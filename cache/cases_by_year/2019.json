SCHOCK  v.  UNITED STATES(2019)\nNo. 18-406\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 2019\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Statement of Justice Sotomayor respecting the denial of certiorari.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Aaron Schock, a former Congressman from Illinois, asks us to decide whether he may immediately appeal, as a collateral order, the denial of his motion to dismiss part of a criminal indictment against him for running afoul of the Constitution's Rulemaking Clause.  See Art. I, \u00a75.  He argues that certain charges against him would require the District Court for the Central District of Illinois to interpret internal rules adopted by the House of Representatives to govern its own Members, and thus would violate separation-of-powers doctrine.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that denials of such Rulemaking Clause challenges are not collateral orders subject to immediate appeal, 891 F.\u00a03d 334 (2018), in disagreement with at least one other Court of Appeals, see United States v. Rostenkowski, 59 F.\u00a03d 1291, 1297 (CADC 1995).  Although this question does not arise frequently--presumably because criminal charges against Members of Congress are rare--the sensitive separation-of-powers questions that such prosecutions raise ought to be handled uniformly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not clear, however, that this case cleanly presents the question whether such orders are, as a general matter, immediately appealable.  The District Court here denied the motion to dismiss on Rulemaking Clause grounds only provisionally, stating that it would revisit the matter \"if at any time it becomes apparent that the prosecution will rely upon evidence that requires the interpretation of House Rules.\"  2017 WL 4780614, *7, and n.\u00a06 (CD Ill., Oct. 23, 2017).  Indeed, the District Court dismissed the only count of the indictment that did, in its view, necessarily turn on an interpretation of the House Rules.  Id., at *8-*11.  As a result, the District Court's order may have been insufficiently \"conclusive\" to support collateral-order appellate jurisdiction, whether or not such jurisdiction would otherwise have been proper.  See Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n, 514 U.\u00a0S. 35, 42 (1995).  The Court of Appeals did not address that alternative ground for affirmance, the presence of which might complicate our review.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I therefore concur in the Court's decision to deny certiorari.  I do so on the understanding, however, that Schock remains free to reassert his Rulemaking Clause challenge in the District Court should subsequent developments warrant.*\n\n\nAARON J. SCHOCK v.

DEVRIES, INDIVIDUALLY AND AS ADMINISTRATRIX OF THE ESTATE OF DEVRIES, DECEASED, ET AL.(2019)\nNo. 17-1104\nArgued: October 10, 2018Decided: March 19, 2019\n\n\nPetitioners produced equipment for three Navy ships.  The equipment required asbestos insulation or asbestos parts to function as intended, but the manufacturers did not always incorporate the asbestos into their products.  Instead, the manufacturers delivered much of the equipment to the Navy without asbestos, and the Navy later added the asbestos to the equipment.  Two Navy veterans, Kenneth McAfee and John DeVries, were exposed to asbestos on the ships and developed cancer.  They and their wives sued the manufacturers, alleging that the asbestos exposure caused the cancer and contending that the manufacturers were negligent in failing to warn about the dangers of asbestos in the integrated products.  Raising the \"bare-metal defense,\" the manufacturers argued that they should not be liable for harms caused by later-added third-party parts.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the manufacturers, but the Third Circuit, adopting a foreseeability approach, vacated and remanded.\nHeld:  In the maritime tort context, a product manufacturer has a duty to warn when its product requires incorporation of a part, the manufacturer knows or has reason to know that the integrated product is likely to be dangerous for its intended uses, and the manufacturer has no reason to believe that the product's users will realize that danger.  Pp.\u00a04-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Tort law imposes a duty to exercise reasonable care on those whose conduct presents a risk of harm to others.  That includes a duty to warn when the manufacturer \"knows or has reason to know\" that its product \"is or is likely to be dangerous for the use for which it is supplied\" and \"has no reason to believe\" that the product's users will realize that danger.  2 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7388.  Three approaches have emerged on how to apply that \"duty to warn\" principle when a manufacturer's product requires later incorporation of a dangerous part in order for the integrated product to function as intended.  The first--the foreseeability rule--provides that a manufacturer may be liable when it was foreseeable that its product would be used with another product or part, even if the manufacturer's product did not require use or incorporation of that other product or part.  The second--the bare-metal defense--provides that if a manufacturer did not itself make, sell, or distribute the part or incorporate the part into the product, the manufacturer is not liable for harm caused by the integrated product--even if the product required incorporation of the part and the manufacturer knew that the integrated product was likely to be dangerous for its intended uses.  A third approach, falling between those two, imposes on the manufacturer a duty to warn when its product requires incorporation of a part and the manufacturer knows or has reason to know that the integrated product is likely to be dangerous for its intended uses.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The third approach is most appropriate for this maritime context.  The foreseeability rule would sweep too broadly, imposing a difficult and costly burden on manufacturers, while simultaneously overwarning users.  The bare-metal defense ultimately goes too far in the other direction.  After all, a manufacturer that supplies a product that is dangerous in and of itself and a manufacturer that supplies a product that requires incorporation of a part that the manufacturer knows or has reason to know is likely to make the integrated product dangerous for its intended uses both \"kno[w] or ha[ve] reason to know\" that the product \"is or is likely to be dangerous for the use for which it is supplied.\"  And in the latter case, the product manufacturer will often be in a better position than the parts manufacturer to warn of the danger, because the product manufacturer knows the nature of the ultimate integrated product.  Requiring a warning in these circumstances will not impose a significant burden on manufacturers, who already have a duty to warn of the dangers of their own products.  Nor will it result in substantial uncertainty about when product manufacturers must provide warnings, because the rule requires a manufacturer to warn only when its product requires a part in order for the integrated product to function as intended.  And this Court is unaware of any substantial overwarning problems in those jurisdictions that have adopted the approach taken here.  Requiring the product manufacturer to warn when its product requires incorporation of a part that makes the integrated product dangerous for its intended uses is especially appropriate in the context of maritime law, which has always recognized a \"\u00a0'special solicitude for the welfare'\u00a0\" of sailors.

DeVRIES,DECEASED, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit\n[March 19, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In maritime tort cases, we act as a common-law court, subject to any controlling statutes enacted by Congress.  See Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 554 U.\u00a0S. 471, 507-508 (2008).  This maritime tort case raises a question about the scope of a manufacturer's duty to warn.  The manufacturers here produced equipment such as pumps, blowers, and turbines for three Navy ships.  The equipment required asbestos insulation or asbestos parts in order to function as intended.  When used on the ships, the equipment released asbestos fibers into the air.  Two Navy veterans who were exposed to asbestos on the ships developed cancer and later died.  The veterans' families sued the equipment manufacturers, claiming that the manufacturers were negligent in failing to warn of the dangers of asbestos.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plaintiffs contend that a manufacturer has a duty to warn when the manufacturer's product requires incorporation of a part (here, asbestos) that the manufacturer knows is likely to make the integrated product dangerous for its intended uses.  The manufacturers respond that they had no duty to warn because they did not themselves incorporate the asbestos into their equipment; rather, the Navy added the asbestos to the equipment after the equipment was already on board the ships.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We agree with the plaintiffs.  In the maritime tort context, a product manufacturer has a duty to warn when (i) its product requires incorporation of a part, (ii) the manufacturer knows or has reason to know that the integrated product is likely to be dangerous for its intended uses, and (iii) the manufacturer has no reason to believe that the product's users will realize that danger.  The District Court did not apply that test when granting summary judgment to the defendant manufacturers.  Although we do not agree with all of the reasoning of the U.\u00a0S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, we affirm its judgment requiring the District Court to reconsider its prior grants of summary judgment to the defendant manufacturers.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kenneth McAfee served in the U.\u00a0S. Navy for more than 20 years.  As relevant here, McAfee worked on the U.\u00a0S.\u00a0S. Wanamassa from 1977 to 1980 and then on the U.\u00a0S.\u00a0S. Commodore from 1982 to 1986.  John DeVries served in the U.\u00a0S. Navy from 1957 to 1960.  He worked on the U.\u00a0S.\u00a0S. Turner.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those ships were outfitted with equipment such as pumps, blowers, and turbines.  That equipment required asbestos insulation or asbestos parts in order to function as intended.  When used as intended, that equipment can cause the release of asbestos fibers into the air.  If inhaled or ingested, those fibers may cause various illnesses.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Five businesses--Air and Liquid Systems, CBS, Foster Wheeler, Ingersoll Rand, and General Electric--produced some of the equipment that was used on the ships.  Al-though the equipment required asbestos insulation or  asbestos parts in order to function as intended, those businesses did not always incorporate the asbestos into their products.  Instead, the businesses delivered much of the equipment to the Navy without asbestos.  The equipment was delivered in a condition known as \"bare-metal.\"  In those situations, the Navy later added the asbestos to the equipment.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0McAfee and DeVries allege that their exposure to the asbestos caused them to develop cancer.  They and their wives sued the equipment manufacturers in Pennsylvania state court.  (McAfee and DeVries later died during the course of the ongoing litigation.)  The plaintiffs did not sue the Navy because they apparently believed the Navy was immune.  See Feres v. United States, 340 U.\u00a0S. 135 (1950).  The plaintiffs also could not recover much from the manufacturers of the asbestos insulation and asbestos parts because those manufacturers had gone bankrupt.  As to the manufacturers of the equipment--such as the pumps, blowers, and turbines--the plaintiffs claimed that those manufacturers negligently failed to warn them of the dangers of asbestos in the integrated products.  If the manufacturers had provided warnings, the workers on the ships presumably could have worn respiratory masks and thereby avoided the danger.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Invoking federal maritime jurisdiction, the manufacturers removed the cases to federal court.  The manufacturers then moved for summary judgment on the ground that manufacturers should not be liable for harms caused by later-added third-party parts.  That defense is known as the \"bare-metal defense.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court granted the manufacturers' motions for summary judgment.  The U.\u00a0S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated and remanded.  In re Asbestos Prods. Liability Litigation, 873 F.\u00a03d 232, 241 (2017).  The Third Circuit held that \"a manufacturer of a bare-metal product may be held liable for a plaintiff's injuries suffered from later-added asbestos-containing materials\" if the manufacturer could foresee that the product would be used with the later-added asbestos-containing materials.  Id., at 240.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to resolve a disagreement among the Courts of Appeals about the validity of the bare-metal defense under maritime law.  584 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).  Compare 873 F.\u00a03d 232 (case below), with Lindstrom v. A-C Prod. Liability Trust, 424 F.\u00a03d 488 (CA6 2005).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article III of the Constitution grants the federal courts jurisdiction over maritime cases.  Under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71333, the federal courts have \"original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of .\u00a0.\u00a0. [a]ny civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a federal court decides a maritime case, it acts as a federal \"common law court,\" much as state courts do in state common-law cases.  Exxon Shipping Co., 554 U.\u00a0S., at 507.  Subject to direction from Congress, the federal courts fashion federal maritime law.  See id., at 508, n.\u00a021; Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U.\u00a0S. 19, 27 (1990); United States v. Reliable Transfer Co., 421 U.\u00a0S. 397, 409 (1975); Detroit Trust Co. v. The Thomas Barlum, 293 U.\u00a0S. 21, 42-44 (1934).  In formulating federal maritime law, the federal courts may examine, among other sources, judicial opinions, legislation, treatises, and scholarly writings.  See Exxon Co., U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U.\u00a0S. 830, 839 (1996); East River S.\u00a0S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval Inc., 476 U.\u00a0S. 858, 864 (1986).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is a maritime tort case.  The plaintiffs allege that the defendant equipment manufacturers were negligent in failing to warn about the dangers of asbestos.  \"The general maritime law has recognized the tort of negligence for more than a century .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock Corp. v. Garris, 532 U.\u00a0S. 811, 820 (2001); see also Kermarec v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 358 U.\u00a0S. 625, 631-632 (1959).  Maritime law has likewise recognized common-law principles of products liability for decades.  See East River S.\u00a0S. Corp., 476 U.\u00a0S., at 865.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this negligence case, we must decide whether a manufacturer has a duty to warn when the manufacturer's product requires later incorporation of a dangerous part--here, asbestos--in order for the integrated product to function as intended.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We start with basic tort-law principles.  Tort law imposes \"a duty to exercise reasonable care\" on those whose conduct presents a risk of harm to others.  1 Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm \u00a77, p.\u00a077 (2005).  For the manufacturer of a product, the general duty of care includes a duty to warn when the manufacturer \"knows or has reason to know\" that its product \"is or is likely to be dangerous for the use for which it is supplied\" and the manufacturer \"has no reason to believe\" that the product's users will realize that danger.  2 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7388, p.\u00a0301 (1963-1964).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In tort cases, the federal and state courts have not reached consensus on how to apply that general tort-law \"duty to warn\" principle when the manufacturer's product requires later incorporation of a dangerous part in order for the integrated product to function as intended.  Three approaches have emerged.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first approach is the more plaintiff-friendly foreseeability rule that the Third Circuit adopted in this case: A manufacturer may be liable when it was foreseeable that the manufacturer's product would be used with another product or part, even if the manufacturer's product did not require use or incorporation of that other product or part.  See, e.g., 873 F.\u00a03d, at 240; Kochera v. Foster Wheeler, LLC, 2015 WL 5584749, *4 (SD Ill., Sept. 23, 2015); Chicano v. General Elec. Co., 2004 WL 2250990, *9 (ED Pa., Oct. 5, 2004); McKenzie v. A. W. Chesterson Co., 277 Ore. App. 728, 749-750, 373 P. 3d 150, 162 (2016).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second approach is the more defendant-friendly bare-metal defense that the manufacturers urge here: If a manufacturer did not itself make, sell, or distribute the part or incorporate the part into the product, the manufacturer is not liable for harm caused by the integrated product--even if the product required incorporation of the part and the manufacturer knew that the integrated product was likely to be dangerous for its intended uses.  See, e.g., Lindstrom, 424 F.\u00a03d, at 492, 495-497; Evans v. CBS Corp., 230 F. Supp. 3d 397, 403-405 (Del. 2017); Cabasug v. Crane Co., 989 F. Supp. 2d 1027, 1041 (Haw. 2013).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The third approach falls between those two approaches.  Under the third approach, foreseeability that the product may be used with another product or part that is likely to be dangerous is not enough to trigger a duty to warn.  But a manufacturer does have a duty to warn when its product requires incorporation of a part and the manufacturer knows or has reason to know that the integrated product is likely to be dangerous for its intended uses.  Under that approach, the manufacturer may be liable even when the manufacturer does not itself incorporate the required part into the product.  See, e.g., Quirin v. Lorillard Tobacco Co., 17 F. Supp. 3d 760, 769-770 (ND Ill. 2014); In re New York City Asbestos Litigation, 27 N.\u00a0Y. 3d 765, 793-794, 59 N.\u00a0E. 3d 458, 474 (2016); May v. Air & Liquid Systems Corp., 446 Md. 1, 29, 129 A. 3d 984, 1000 (2015).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We conclude that the third approach is the most appropriate for this maritime tort context.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To begin, we agree with the manufacturers that a rule of mere foreseeability would sweep too broadly.  See generally 1 Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm \u00a77, Comment j, at 82; 2 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7395, Comment j, at 330.  Many products can foreseeably be used in numerous ways with numerous other products and parts.  Requiring a product manufacturer to imagine and warn about all of those possible uses--with massive liability looming for failure to correctly predict how its product might be used with other products or parts--would impose a difficult and costly burden on manufacturers, while simultaneously overwarning users.  In light of that uncertainty and unfairness, we reject the foreseeability approach for this maritime context.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, we agree with the plaintiffs that the bare-metal defense ultimately goes too far in the other direction.  In urging the bare-metal defense, the manufacturers contend that a business generally has \"no duty\" to \"control the conduct of a third person as to prevent him from causing physical harm to another.\"  Id., \u00a7315, at 122.  That is true, but it is also beside the point here.  After all, when a manufacturer's product is dangerous in and of itself, the manufacturer \"knows or has reason to know\" that the product \"is or is likely to be dangerous for the use for which it is supplied.\"  Id., \u00a7388, at 301.  The same holds true, we conclude, when the manufacturer's product requires incorporation of a part that the manufacturer knows or has reason to know is likely to make the integrated product dangerous for its intended uses.  As a matter of maritime tort law, we find no persuasive reason to distinguish those two similar situations for purposes of a manufacturer's duty to warn.  See Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a72, Comment i, p.\u00a030 (1997) (\"[W]arnings also may be needed to inform users and consumers of nonobvious and not generally known risks that unavoidably inhere in using or consuming the product\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Importantly, the product manufacturer will often be in a better position than the parts manufacturer to warn of the danger from the integrated product.  See generally G. Calabresi, The Costs of Accidents 311-318 (1970).  The product manufacturer knows the nature of the ultimate integrated product and is typically more aware of the risks associated with that integrated product.  By contrast, a parts manufacturer may be aware only that its part could conceivably be used in any number of ways in any number of products.  A parts manufacturer may not always be aware that its part will be used in a way that poses a risk of danger.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, as the manufacturers correctly point out, issuing a warning costs time and money.  But the burden usually is not significant.  Manufacturers already have a duty to warn of the dangers of their own products.  That duty typically imposes a light burden on manufacturers.  See, e.g., Davis v. Wyeth Labs., Inc., 399 F.\u00a02d 121, 131 (CA9 1968); Butler v. L. Sonneborn Sons, Inc., 296 F.\u00a02d 623, 625-626 (CA2 1961); Ross Labs. v. Thies, 725 P.\u00a02d 1076, 1079 (Alaska 1986); Moran v. Faberge, Inc., 273 Md. 538, 543-544, 332 A.\u00a02d 11, 15 (1975).  Requiring a manufacturer to also warn when the manufacturer knows or has reason to know that a required later-added part is likely to make the integrated product dangerous for its intended uses should not meaningfully add to that burden.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The manufacturers also contend that requiring a warning even when they have not themselves incorporated the part into the product will lead to uncertainty about when product manufacturers must provide warnings.  But the manufacturers have not pointed to any substantial confusion in those jurisdictions that have adopted this approach.  And the rule that we adopt here is tightly cabined.  The rule does not require that manufacturers warn in cases of mere foreseeability.  The rule requires that manufacturers warn only when their product requires a part in order for the integrated product to function as intended.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The manufacturers further assert that requiring a warning in these circumstances will lead to excessive warning of consumers.  Again, however, we are not aware of substantial overwarning problems in those jurisdictions that have adopted this approach.  And because the rule we adopt here applies only in certain narrow circumstances, it will not require a plethora of new warnings.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Requiring the product manufacturer to warn when its product requires incorporation of a part that makes the integrated product dangerous for its intended uses--and not just when the manufacturer itself incorporates the part into the product--is especially appropriate in the maritime context.  Maritime law has always recognized a \"special solicitude for the welfare\" of those who undertake to \"venture upon hazardous and unpredictable sea voyages.\"  American Export Lines, Inc. v. Alvez, 446 U.\u00a0S. 274, 285 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The plaintiffs in this case are the families of veterans who served in the U.\u00a0S. Navy.  Maritime law's longstanding solicitude for sailors reinforces our decision to require a warning in these circumstances.  See Yamaha Motor Corp., U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. v. Calhoun, 516 U.\u00a0S. 199, 213 (1996); Miles, 498 U.\u00a0S., at 36; Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., 398 U.\u00a0S. 375, 387 (1970).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For those reasons, we conclude as follows: In the maritime tort context, a product manufacturer has a duty to warn when (i) its product requires incorporation of a part, (ii) the manufacturer knows or has reason to know that the integrated product is likely to be dangerous for its intended uses, and (iii) the manufacturer has no reason to believe that the product's users will realize that danger.  We do not purport to define the proper tort rule outside of the maritime context.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One final point for clarity: Courts have determined that this rule applies in certain related situations, including when: (i) a manufacturer directs that the part be incorporated, see, e.g., Bell v. Foster Wheeler Energy Corp., 2016 WL 5780104, *6-*7 (ED La., Oct. 4, 2016); (ii) a manufacturer itself makes the product with a part that the manufacturer knows will require replacement with a similar part, see, e.g., Chesher v. 3M Co., 234 F. Supp. 3d 693, 713-714 (S.\u00a0C. 2017); Quirin, 17 F. Supp. 3d, at 769-770; May, 446 Md., at 29, 129 A. 3d, at 1000; or (iii) a product would be useless without the part, see, e.g., In re New York City Asbestos Litigation, 27 N.\u00a0Y. 3d, at 793-794, 59 N.\u00a0E. 3d, at 474.  In all of those situations, courts have said that the product in effect requires the part in order for the integrated product to function as intended.  We agree.  The maritime tort rule we adopt today therefore encompasses those situations, so long as the manufacturer knows or has reason to know that the integrated product is likely to be dangerous for its intended uses, and the manufacturer has no reason to believe that the product's users will realize that danger.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the maritime tort context, we hold that a product manufacturer has a duty to warn when (i) its product requires incorporation of a part, (ii) the manufacturer knows or has reason to know that the integrated product is likely to be dangerous for its intended uses, and (iii) the manufacturer has no reason to believe that the product's users will realize that danger.  The District Court should evaluate the evidence under that rule.  Although we do not agree with all of the reasoning of the Third Circuit, we affirm its judgment requiring the District Court to reconsider its prior grants of summary judgment to the defendant manufacturers.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nGorsuch, J., dissenting\n\u2002586 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1104\nAIR AND LIQUID SYSTEMS CORP., et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v.

Things like the turbines used to propel its ships.  Did these manufacturers have to warn users about the dangers of asbestos that someone else later chose to add to or wrap around their products as insulation?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Start with a couple of things we can all agree on.  First, everyone accepts that, under traditional tort principles, the manufacturers who actually supplied the later-added asbestos had to warn about its known dangers.  Second, everyone agrees that the court of appeals erred when it came to analyzing the duties of the bare metal defendants.  The court of appeals held that the bare metal manufacturers had a duty to warn because they could have \"foreseen\" the possibility that others would later use asbestos in conjunction with their products.  Today, the Court rightly rejects this \"foreseeability\" standard, succinctly explaining that \"[r]equiring a product manufacturer to imagine and warn about all of those possible uses--with massive liability looming for failure to correctly predict how its product might be used with other products or parts--would impose a difficult and costly burden on manufacturers, while simultaneously overwarning users.\"  Ante, at 7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our disagreement arises only in what comes next.  Immediately after rejecting the court of appeals' approach, the Court proceeds to devise its own way of holding the bare metal manufacturers responsible for later-added asbestos.  In the Court's judgment, the bare metal defendants had a duty to warn about the dangers of asbestos introduced by others so long as they (i) produced a product that \"require[d] incorporation of\" asbestos, (ii)\u00a0\"kn[ew] or ha[d] reason to know\" that the \"integrated product\" would be dangerous, and (iii)\u00a0had \"no reason to believe\" that users would realize that danger.  Ante, at 9-10.  The Court's new three-part standard surely represents an improvement over the court of appeals' unadorned \"foreseeability\" offering.  But, respectfully, it seems to me to suffer from many of the same defects the Court itself has identified.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first place, neither of these standards enjoys meaningful roots in the common law.  The common law has long taught that a manufacturer has no \"duty to warn or instruct about another manufacturer's products, though those products might be used in connection with the manufacturer's own products.\"  Firestone Steel Prods. Co. v. Barajas, 927 S.\u00a0W. 2d 608, 616 (Tex. 1996).  Instead, \"the manufacturer's duty is restricted to warnings based on the characteristics of the manufacturer's own product.\"  Powell v. Standard Brands Paint Co., 166 Cal. App. 3d 357, 364, 212 Cal. Rptr. 395, 398 (1985).1  It doesn't matter, either, whether a manufacturer's product happens to be (or is designed to be) \"integrated\" with another's.  Instead, it is black-letter law that the supplier of a product generally must warn about only those risks associated with the product itself, not those associated with the \"products and systems into which [it later may be] integrated.\"  Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a75, Comment b, p.\u00a0132 (1997).2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More than that, the traditional common law rule still makes the most sense today.  The manufacturer of a product is in the best position to understand and warn users about its risks; in the language of law and economics, those who make products are generally the least-cost avoiders of their risks.  By placing the duty to warn on a product's manufacturer, we force it to internalize the full cost of any injuries caused by inadequate warnings--and in that way ensure it is fully incentivized to provide adequate warnings.  By contrast, we dilute the incentive of a manufacturer to warn about the dangers of its products when we require other people to share the duty to warn and its corresponding costs.  See S. Shavell, Economic Analysis of Accident Law 17 (1987); G. Calabresi, The Costs of Accidents 135, and n.\u00a01 (1970); Italia Societa per Azioni di Navigazione v. Oregon Stevedoring Co., 376 U.\u00a0S. 315, 324 (1964).3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The traditional common law rule better accords, too, with consumer expectations.  A home chef who buys a butcher's knife may expect to read warnings about the dangers of knives but not about the dangers of undercooked meat.  Likewise, a purchaser of gasoline may expect to see warnings at the pump about its flammability but not about the dangers of recklessly driving a car.  As the Court today recognizes, encouraging manufacturers to offer warnings about other people's products risks long, duplicative, fine print, and conflicting warnings that will leave consumers less sure about which to take seriously and more likely to disregard them all.  In the words of the California Supreme Court, consumer welfare is not well \"served by requiring manufacturers to warn about the dangerous propensities of products they do not design, make, or sell.\"  O'Neil v. Crane Co., 53 Cal. 4th 335, 343, 266 P.\u00a03d 987, 991 (2012); see also Cotton v. Buckeye Gas Prods. Co., 840 F.\u00a02d 935, 938 (CADC 1988) (\"The inclusion of each extra item dilutes the punch of every other item.  Given short attention spans, items crowd each other out; they get lost in fine print\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The traditional tort rule bears yet another virtue: It is simple to apply.  The traditional rule affords manufacturers fair notice of their legal duties, lets injured consumers know whom to sue, and ensures courts will treat like cases alike.  By contrast, when liability depends on the application of opaque or multifactor standards like the one proposed below or the one announced today, \"equality of treatment\" becomes harder to ensure across cases; \"predictability is destroyed\" for innovators, investors, and consumers alike; and \"judicial courage is impaired\" as the ability (and temptation) to fit the law to the case, rather than the case to the law, grows.  Scalia, The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules, 56 U. Chi. L.\u00a0Rev. 1175, 1182 (1989).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just consider some of the uncertainties each part of the Court's new three-part test is sure to invite:\n(i) When does a customer's side-by-side use of two products qualify as \"incorporation\" of the products?  Does hanging asbestos on the outside of a boiler count, or must asbestos be placed inside a product?  And when is incorporation of a dangerous third-party product \"required\" as opposed to just optimal or preferred?  What if a potential substitute existed, but it was less effective or more costly (surely alternatives to asbestos insulation have existed for a long time)?  And what if the third-party product becomes less advantageous over time due to advancing technology (as asbestos did)?  When does the defendant's duty to warn end?\n(ii) What will qualify as an \"integrated product\"?  In the past, we've suggested that a \"product\" is whatever assemblage of parts is \"placed in the stream of commerce by the manufacturer,\" and we've stressed the importance of maintaining the \"distinction between the components added to a product by a manufacturer before the product's sale .\u00a0.\u00a0. and those items added\" later by someone else.  Saratoga Fishing Co. v. J. M. Martinac & Co., 520 U.\u00a0S. 875, 883-884 (1997).  The Court's new standard blurs that distinction, but it is unclear how far it goes.  The Court suggests a turbine and separately installed insulation may now qualify as a single \"integrated product.\"  But what about other parts connected to the turbine?  Does even the propeller qualify as part of the final \"integrated product\" too, so that its manufacturer also bears a duty to warn about the dangers of asbestos hung around the turbine?  For that matter, why isn't the entire ship an \"integrated product,\" with a corresponding duty for all the manufacturers who contributed parts to warn about the dangers of all the other parts?  And when exactly is a manufacturer supposed to \"know or have reason to know\" that some supplement to its product has now made a resulting \"integrated product\" dangerous?  How much cost and effort must manufacturers expend to discover and understand the risks associated with third-party products others may be \"incorporating\" with their products?\n(iii) If a defendant reasonably expects that the manufacturer of a third-party product will comply with its own duty to warn, is that sufficient \"reason to believe\" that users will \"realize\" the danger to absolve the defendant of responsibility?  Or does a defendant have to assume that the third-party manufacturer will behave negligently in rendering its own warnings?  Or that users won't bother to read the warnings others offer?  And what if the defendants here understood that the Navy itself would warn sailors about the need for proper handling of asbestos--did they still have to provide their own warnings?4\nHeadscratchers like these are sure to enrich lawyers and entertain law students, but they also promise to leave everyone else wondering about their legal duties, rights, and liabilities.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor is this kind of uncertainty costless.  Consider what might follow if the Court's standard were widely adopted in tort law.  Would a company that sells smartphone cases have to warn about the risk of exposure to cell phone radiation?  Would a car maker have to warn about the risks of improperly stored antifreeze?  Would a manufacturer of flashlights have to warn about the risks associated with leaking batteries?  Would a seller of hot dog buns have to warn about the health risks of consuming processed meat?  Just the threat of litigation and liability would force many manufacturers of safe products to spend time and money educating themselves and writing warnings about the dangers of other people's more dangerous products.  All this would, as well, threaten to leave consumers worse off.  After all, when we effectively require manufacturers of safe products to subsidize those who make more dangerous items, we promise to raise the price and restrict the output of socially productive products.  Tort law is supposed to be about aligning liability with responsibility, not mandating a social insurance policy in which everyone must pay for everyone else's mistakes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally and relatedly, the Court's new standard implicates the same sort of fair notice problem that the court of appeals' standard did.  Decades ago, the bare metal defendants produced their lawful products and provided all the warnings the law required.  Now, they are at risk of being held responsible retrospectively for failing to warn about other people's products.  It is a duty they could not have anticipated then and one they cannot discharge now.  They can only pay.  Of course, that may be the point.  In deviating from the traditional common law rule, the Court may be motivated by the unfortunate facts of this particular case, where the sailors' widows appear to have a limited prospect of recovery from the companies that supplied the asbestos (they've gone bankrupt) and from the Navy that allegedly directed the use of asbestos (it's likely immune under our precedents).  Ante, at 3.  The bare metal defendants may be among the only solvent potential defendants left.  But how were they supposed to anticipate many decades ago the novel duty to warn placed on them today?  People should be able to find the law in the books; they should not find the law coming upon them out of nowhere.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still, there's a silver lining here.  In announcing its new standard, the Court expressly states that it does \"not purport to define the proper tort rule outside of the maritime context.\"  Ante, at 10.  Indeed, the Court acknowledges that it has created its new standard in part because of the \"solicitude for sailors\" that is a unique feature of our maritime jurisdiction.  Ante, at 9.  All of this means, of course, that nothing in today's opinion compels courts operating outside the maritime context to apply the test announced today.  In other tort cases, courts remain free to use the more sensible and historically proven common law rule.  And given that, \"unlike state courts, we have little .\u00a0.\u00a0. experience in the development of new common-law rules of tort,\" Saratoga, 520 U.\u00a0S., at 886 (Scalia, J., dissenting), that is a liberty they may be wise to exercise.5\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Sometimes, the equipment manufacturers themselves added the asbestos to the equipment.  Even in those situations, however, the Navy later replaced the asbestos parts with third-party asbestos parts.\nFootnote 2\u00a0We do not rule out the possibility that, in certain circumstances, the parts manufacturer may also have a duty to warn.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0See also, e.g., Dreyer v.

Horne stating that \"the Navy chose to control and make personnel aware of the hazards of asbestos exposures through .\u00a0.\u00a0. military specifications and personnel training\").\nFootnote 5\u00a0As the Court notes, some of the defendants sold the Navy products that were not \"bare metal\" but contained asbestos at the time of sale.  Ante, at 3, n.\u00a01.  We can all agree that those defendants had a duty to warn users about the known dangers of asbestos.  And there's a colorable argument that their responsibility didn't end when the Navy, as part of routine upkeep, swapped out the original asbestos parts for replacements supplied by others.  Under traditional tort principles, the seller of a defective, \"unreasonably dangerous\" product may be liable to an injured user if the product \"is expected to and does reach the user .\u00a0.\u00a0. without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.\"  2 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7402A(1)(b), pp.\u00a0347-348 (1963-1964).  And replacing worn-out parts every now and then with equivalently dangerous third-party parts may not qualify as a \"substantial change\" if the replacement part does \"no more than perpetuate\" problems latent in the original.  Sage v. Fairchild-Swearingen Corp., 70 N.\u00a0Y.\u00a02d 579, 584-587, 517 N.\u00a0E. 2d 1304, 1306-1308 (1987); see, e.g., Whelan v. Armstrong Int'l Inc., 455 N.\u00a0J. Super. 569, 597-598, 190 A. 3d 1090, 1106-1107 (App. Div. 2018).  Of course, the defendants' original failure to warn might not be the legal cause of any harm if the use of the replacement part was unforeseeable, or if an intervening action severed the connection between the original sale and the injurious use.  For example, if the replacement part itself posed the danger--or if, by the time the original part wore out, safer alternatives had become available.  The Court's new standard, however, does not address these defendants separately, but focuses on the bare metal defendants.\n\n\n","3":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN LEGION ET AL. v. AMERICAN HUMANIST ASSN. ET AL.(2019)\nNo. 17-1717\nArgued: February 27, 2019Decided: June 20, 2019\n\n\nIn 1918, residents of Prince George's County, Maryland, formed a committee for the purpose of erecting a memorial for the county's soldiers who fell in World War I.  The committee decided that the memorial should be a cross, which was not surprising since the plain Latin cross had become a central symbol of the war.  The image of row after row of plain white crosses marking the overseas graves of soldiers was emblazoned on the minds of Americans at home.  The memorial would stand at the terminus of another World War I memorial--the National Defense Highway connecting Washington to Annapolis.  When the committee ran out of funds, the local American Legion took over the project, completing the memorial in 1925.  The 32-foot tall Latin cross displays the American Legion's emblem at its center and sits on a large pedestal bearing, inter alia, a bronze plaque that lists the names of the 49 county soldiers who had fallen in the war.  At the dedication ceremony, a Catholic priest offered an invocation and a Baptist pastor offered a benediction.  The Bladensburg Cross (Cross) has since been the site of patriotic events honoring veterans on, e.g., Veterans Day, Memorial Day, and Independence Day.  Monuments honoring the veterans of other conflicts have been added in a park near the Cross.  As the area around the Cross developed, the monument came to be at the center of a busy intersection.  In 1961, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (Commission) acquired the Cross and the land where it sits, but the American Legion reserved the right to continue using the site for ceremonies.  The Commission has used public funds to maintain the monument ever since.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2014, the American Humanist Association (AHA) and others filed suit in District Court, alleging that the Cross's presence on public land and the Commission's maintenance of the memorial violate the First Amendment's Establishment Clause.  The American Legion intervened to defend the Cross.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the Commission and the American Legion, concluding that the Cross satisfies both the test announced in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.\u00a0S. 602, and the analysis applied by Justice Breyer in upholding a Ten Commandments monument in Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.\u00a0S. 677.  The Fourth Circuit reversed. \nHeld:\u00a0The judgment is reversed and remanded.\n874 F.\u00a03d 195, reversed and remanded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-B, II-C, III, and IV, concluding that the Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause.  Pp.\u00a016-24, 28-31.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0At least four considerations show that retaining established, religiously expressive monuments, symbols, and practices is quite different from erecting or adopting new ones.  First, these cases often concern monuments, symbols, or practices that were first established long ago, and thus, identifying their original purpose or purposes may be especially difficult.  See Salazar v. Buono, 559 U.\u00a0S. 700.  Second, as time goes by, the purposes associated with an established monument, symbol, or practice often multiply, as in the Ten Commandments monuments addressed in Van Orden and McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Ky., 545 U.\u00a0S. 844.  Even if the monument's original purpose was infused with religion, the passage of time may obscure that sentiment and the monument may be retained for the sake of its historical significance or its place in a common cultural heritage.  Third, the message of a monument, symbol, or practice may evolve, Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.\u00a0S. 460, 477, as is the case with a city name like Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; Arizona's motto \"Ditat Deus\" (\"God enriches\"), adopted in 1864; or Maryland's flag, which has included two crosses since 1904.  Familiarity itself can become a reason for preservation.  Fourth, when time's passage imbues a religiously expressive monument, symbol, or practice with this kind of familiarity and historical significance, removing it may no longer appear neutral, especially to the local community.  The passage of time thus gives rise to a strong presumption of constitutionality.  Pp.\u00a016-21.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The cross is a symbol closely linked to World War I.  The United States adopted it as part of its military honors, establishing the Distinguished Service Cross and the Navy Cross in 1918 and 1919, respectively.  And the fallen soldiers' final resting places abroad were marked by white crosses or Stars of David, a solemn image that became inextricably linked with and symbolic of the ultimate price paid by 116,000 soldiers.  This relationship between the cross and the war may not have been the sole or dominant motivation for the design of the many war memorials that sprang up across the Nation, but that is all but impossible to determine today.  The passage of time means that testimony from the decisionmakers may not be available.  And regardless of the original purposes for erecting the monument, a community may wish to preserve it for very different reasons, such as the historic preservation and traffic-safety concerns noted here.  The area surrounding a monument like the Bladensburg Cross may also have been altered in ways that change its meaning and provide new reasons for its preservation.  Even the AHA recognizes that the monument's surroundings are important, as it concedes that the presence of a cross monument in a cemetery is unobjectionable.  But a memorial's placement in a cemetery is not necessary to create the connection to those it honors.  Memorials took the place of gravestones for those parents and other relatives who lacked the means to travel to Europe to visit the graves of their war dead and for those soldiers whose bodies were never recovered.  Similarly, memorials and monuments honoring important historical figures e.g., Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., often include a symbol of the faith that was important to the persons whose lives are commemorated.  Finally, as World War I monuments have endured through the years and become a familiar part of the physical and cultural landscape, requiring their removal or alteration would not be viewed by many as a neutral act.  Few would say that California is attempting to convey a religious message by retaining the many city names, like Los Angeles and San Diego, given by the original Spanish settlers.  But it would be something else entirely if the State undertook to change those names.  Much the same is true about monuments to soldiers who sacrificed their lives for this country more than a century ago.  Pp.\u00a021-24.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Applying these principles here, the Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause.  The image of the simple wooden cross that originally marked the graves of American soldiers killed in World War I became a symbol of their sacrifice, and the design of the Bladensburg Cross must be understood in light of that background.  That the cross originated as a Christian symbol and retains that meaning in many contexts does not change the fact that the symbol took on an added secular meaning when used in World War I memorials.  The Cross has also acquired historical importance with the passage of time, reminding the townspeople of the deeds and sacrifices of their predecessors as it stands among memorials to veterans of later wars.  It has thus become part of the community.  It would not serve that role had its design deliberately disrespected area soldiers, but there is no evidence that the names of any area Jewish soldiers were either intentionally left off the memorial's list or included against the wishes of their families.  The AHA tries to connect the Cross and the American Legion with anti-Semitism and the Ku Klux Klan, but the monument, which was dedicated during a period of heightened racial and religious animosity, includes the names of both Black and White soldiers; and both Catholic and Baptist clergy participated in the dedication.  It is also natural and appropriate for a monument commemorating the death of particular individuals to invoke the symbols that signify what death meant for those who are memorialized.  Excluding those symbols could make the memorial seem incomplete.  This explains why Holocaust memorials invariably feature a Star of David or other symbols of Judaism and why the memorial at issue features the same symbol that marks the graves of so many soldiers near the battlefields where they fell.  Pp.\u00a028-30.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0The fact that the cross is undoubtedly a Christian symbol should not blind one to everything else that the Bladensburg Cross has come to represent: a symbolic resting place for ancestors who never returned home, a place for the community to gather and honor all veterans and their sacrifices for this Nation, and a historical landmark.  For many, destroying or defacing the Cross would not be neutral and would not further the ideals of respect and tolerance embodied in the First Amendment.  P.\u00a031.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Breyer, and Justice Kavanaugh, concluded in Parts II-A and II-D:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Lemon ambitiously attempted to fashion a test for all Establishment Clause cases.  The test called on courts to examine the purposes and effects of a challenged government action, as well as any entanglement with religion that it might entail.  The expectation of a ready framework has not been met, and the Court has many times either expressly declined to apply the test or simply ignored it.  See, e.g., Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist., 509 U.\u00a0S. 1; Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.\u00a0S. 565.  Pp.\u00a012-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The Lemon Court ambitiously attempted to find a grand unified theory of the Establishment Clause, but the Court has since taken a more modest approach that focuses on the particular issue at hand and looks to history for guidance.  The cases involving prayer before legislative sessions are illustrative.  In Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.\u00a0S. 783, the Court upheld a State Legislature's practice of beginning each session with a prayer by an official chaplain, finding it highly persuasive that Congress for over 200 years had opened its sessions with a prayer and that many state legislatures had followed suit.  And the Court in Town of Greece reasoned that the historical practice of having, since the First Congress, chaplains in Congress showed \"that the Framers considered legislative prayer a benign acknowledgment of religion's role in society.\"  572 U.\u00a0S., at 576.  Where monuments, symbols, and practices with a longstanding history follow in the tradition of the First Congress in respecting and tolerating different views, endeavoring to achieve inclusivity and nondiscrimination, and recognizing the important role religion plays in the lives of many Americans, they are likewise constitutional.  Pp.\u00a024-28.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, agreeing that the Bladensburg Cross is constitutional, concluded: \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The text and history of the Clause--which reads \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\"--suggest that it should not be incorporated against the States.  When the Court incorporated the Clause in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.\u00a0S. 1, 15, it apparently did not consider that an incorporated Establishment Clause would prohibit exactly what the text of the Clause seeks to protect: state establishments of religion.  The appropriate question is whether any longstanding right of citizenship restrains the States in the establishment context.  Further confounding the incorporation question is the fact that the First Amendment by its terms applies only to \"law[s]\" enacted by \"Congress.\"  Pp.\u00a01-3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Even if the Clause applied to state and local governments in some fashion, \"[t]he mere presence of the monument along [respondents'] path involves no [actual legal] coercion,\" the sine qua non of an establishment of religion.  Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.\u00a0S. 677, 694 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  The plaintiff claiming an unconstitutional establishment of religion must demonstrate that he was actually coerced by government conduct that shares the characteristics of an establishment as understood at the founding.  Respondents have not demonstrated that maintaining a religious display on public property shares any of the historical characteristics of an establishment of religion.  Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.\u00a0S. 565, 608 (same).  The Bladensburg Cross is constitutional even though the cross has religious significance.  Religious displays or speech need not be limited to those considered nonsectarian.  Insisting otherwise is inconsistent with this Nation's history and traditions, id., at 578-580 (majority opinion), and would force the courts \"to act as supervisors and censors of religious speech,\" id., at 581.  Pp.\u00a03-5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0The plurality rightly rejects the relevance of the test set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.\u00a0S. 602, 612-613, to claims like this one, which involve religiously expressive monuments, symbols, displays, and similar practices, but Justice Thomas would take the logical next step and overrule the Lemon test in all contexts.  The test has no basis in the original meaning of the Constitution; it has \"been manipulated to fit whatever result the Court aimed to achieve,\" McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Ky., 545 U.\u00a0S. 844, 900 (Scalia, J., dissenting); and it continues to cause enormous confusion in the States and the lower courts.  Pp.\u00a06-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch, joined by Justice Thomas, concludes that a suit like this one should be dismissed for lack of standing.  Pp.\u00a01-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The American Humanist Association claims that its members come into regular, unwelcome contact with the Bladensburg Cross when they drive through the area, but this \"offended observer\" theory of standing has no basis in law.  To establish standing to sue consistent with the Constitution, a plaintiff must show: (1) injury-in-fact, (2) causation, and (3) redressability.  And the injury-in-fact must be \"concrete and particularized.\"  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.\u00a0S. 555, 560.  This Court has already rejected the notion that offense alone qualifies as a \"concrete and particularized\" injury sufficient to confer standing, Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.\u00a0S. 54, 62, and it has done so in the context of the Establishment Clause itself, see Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, 454 U.\u00a0S. 464.  Offended observer standing is deeply inconsistent, too, with many other longstanding principles and precedents, including the rule that \"\u00a0'generalized grievances' about the conduct of Government\" are insufficient to confer standing to sue, Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U.\u00a0S. 208, 217, and \"the rule that a party 'generally must assert his own legal rights and interests,'\u00a0\" not those \"\u00a0'of third parties,'\u00a0\" Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.\u00a0S. 125, 129.  Pp.\u00a01-6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Lower courts invented offended observer standing for Establishment Clause cases in response to Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.\u00a0S. 602, reasoning that if the Establishment Clause forbids anything that a reasonable observer would view as an endorsement of religion, then such an observer must be able to sue.  Lemon, however, was a misadventure, and the Court today relies on a more modest, historically sensitive approach, interpreting the Establishment Clause with reference to historical practices and understandings.  The monument here is clearly constitutional in light of the nation's traditions.  Although the plurality does not say it in as many words, the message of today's decision for the lower courts must be this: whether a monument, symbol, or practice is old or new, apply Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.\u00a0S. 565, not Lemon, because what matters when it comes to assessing a monument, symbol, or practice is not its age but its compliance with ageless principles.  Pp.\u00a06-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0With Lemon now shelved, little excuse will remain for the anomaly of offended observer standing, and the gaping hole it tore in standing doctrine in the courts of appeals should now begin to close.  Abandoning offended observer standing will mean only a return to the usual demands of Article III, requiring a real controversy with real impact on real persons to make a federal case out of it.

Eighty-nine years after the dedication of the Cross, respondents filed this lawsuit, claiming that they are offended by the sight of the memorial on public land and that its presence there and the expenditure of public funds to maintain it violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  To remedy this violation, they asked a federal court to order the relocation or demolition of the Cross or at least the removal of its arms.  The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit agreed that the memorial is unconstitutional and remanded for a determination of the proper remedy.  We now reverse.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the cross has long been a preeminent Christian symbol, its use in the Bladensburg memorial has a special significance.  After the First World War, the picture of row after row of plain white crosses marking the overseas graves of soldiers who had lost their lives in that horrible conflict was emblazoned on the minds of Americans at home, and the adoption of the cross as the Bladensburg memorial must be viewed in that historical context.  For nearly a century, the Bladensburg Cross has expressed the community's grief at the loss of the young men who perished, its thanks for their sacrifice, and its dedication to the ideals for which they fought.  It has become a prominent community landmark, and its removal or radical alteration at this date would be seen by many not as a neutral act but as the manifestation of \"a hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause traditions.\"  Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.\u00a0S. 677, 704 (2005) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment).  And contrary to respondents' intimations, there is no evidence of discriminatory intent in the selection of the design of the memorial or the decision of a Maryland commission to maintain it.  The Religion Clauses of the Constitution aim to foster a society in which people of all beliefs can live together harmoniously, and the presence of the Bladensburg Cross on the land where it has stood for so many years is fully consistent with that aim.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The cross came into widespread use as a symbol of Christianity by the fourth century,1 and it retains that meaning today.  But there are many contexts in which the symbol has also taken on a secular meaning.  Indeed, there are instances in which its message is now almost entirely secular.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A cross appears as part of many registered trademarks held by businesses and secular organizations, including Blue Cross Blue Shield, the Bayer Group, and some Johnson & Johnson products.2  Many of these marks relate to health care, and it is likely that the association of the cross with healing had a religious origin.  But the current use of these marks is indisputably secular.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The familiar symbol of the Red Cross--a red cross on a white background--shows how the meaning of a symbol that was originally religious can be transformed.  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) selected that symbol in 1863 because it was thought to call to mind the flag of Switzerland, a country widely known for its neutrality.3  The Swiss flag consists of a white cross on a red background.  In an effort to invoke the message associated with that flag, the ICRC copied its design with the colors inverted.  Thus, the ICRC selected this symbol for an essentially secular reason, and the current secular message of the symbol is shown by its use today in nations with only tiny Christian populations.4  But the cross was originally chosen for the Swiss flag for religious reasons.5  So an image that began as an expression of faith was transformed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The image used in the Bladensburg memorial--a plain Latin cross6--also took on new meaning after World War I.  \"During and immediately after the war, the army marked soldiers' graves with temporary wooden crosses or Stars of David\"--a departure from the prior practice of marking graves in American military cemeteries with uniform rectangular slabs.  G. Piehler, Remembering War the American Way 101 (1995); App. 1146.  The vast majority of these grave markers consisted of crosses,7 and thus when Americans saw photographs of these cemeteries, what struck them were rows and rows of plain white crosses.  As a result, the image of a simple white cross \"developed into a 'central symbol'\u00a0\" of the conflict.  Ibid.  Contemporary literature, poetry, and art reflected this powerful imagery.  See Brief for Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 10-16.  Perhaps most famously, John McCrae's poem, In Flanders Fields, began with these memorable lines:\n\"In Flanders fields the poppies blow\nBetween the crosses, row on row.\"\nIn Flanders Fields and Other Poems 3 (G. P. Putnam's Sons ed. 1919).  The poem was enormously popular.  See P. Fussell, The Great War and Modern Memory 248-249 (1975).  A 1921 New York Times article quoted a description of McCrae's composition as \"\u00a0'the poem of the army'\u00a0\" and \"\u00a0'of all those who understand the meaning of the great conflict.'\u00a0\"8  The image of \"the crosses, row on row,\" stuck in people's minds, and even today for those who view World War I cemeteries in Europe, the image is arresting.9\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the 1918 armistice, the War Department announced plans to replace the wooden crosses and Stars of David with uniform marble slabs like those previously used in American military cemeteries.  App. 1146.  But the public outcry against that proposal was swift and fierce.  Many organizations, including the American War Mothers, a nonsectarian group founded in 1917, urged the Department to retain the design of the temporary markers.  Id., at 1146-1147.  When the American Battle Monuments Commission took over the project of designing the headstones, it responded to this public sentiment by opting to replace the wooden crosses and Stars of David with marble versions of those symbols.  Id., at 1144.  A Member of Congress likewise introduced a resolution noting that \"these wooden symbols have, during and since the World War, been regarded as emblematic of the great sacrifices which that war entailed, have been so treated by poets and artists and have become peculiarly and inseparably associated in the thought of surviving relatives and comrades and of the Nation with these World War graves.\"  H. Res. 15, 68th Cong., 1 (1924), App. 1163-1164.  This national debate and its outcome confirmed the cross's widespread resonance as a symbol of sacrifice in the war.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recognition of the cross's symbolism extended to local communities across the country.  In late 1918, residents of Prince George's County, Maryland, formed a committee for the purpose of erecting a memorial for the county's fallen soldiers.  App. 988-989, 1014.  Among the committee's members were the mothers of 10 deceased soldiers.  Id., at 989.  The committee decided that the memorial should be a cross and hired sculptor and architect John Joseph Earley to design it.  Although we do not know precisely why the committee chose the cross, it is unsurprising that the committee--and many others commemorating World War I10--adopted a symbol so widely associated with that wrenching event.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After selecting the design, the committee turned to the task of financing the project.  The committee held fundraising events in the community and invited donations, no matter the size, with a form that read:\n\"We, the citizens of Maryland, trusting in God, the Supreme Ruler of the Universe, Pledge Faith in our Brothers who gave their all in the World War to make [the] World Safe for Democracy.  Their Mortal Bodies have turned to dust, but their spirit Lives to guide us through Life in the way of Godliness, Justice and Liberty.\n\"With our Motto, 'One God, One Country, and One Flag' We contribute to this Memorial Cross Commemorating the Memory of those who have not Died in Vain.\"  Id., at. 1251.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many of those who responded were local residents who gave small amounts: Donations of 25 cents to 1 dollar were the most common.  Id., at 1014.  Local businesses and political leaders assisted in this effort.  Id., at 1014, 1243.  In writing to thank United States Senator John Walter Smith for his donation, committee treasurer Mrs. Martin Redman explained that \"[t]he chief reason I feel as deeply in this matter [is that], my son, [Wm.] F. Redman, lost his life in France and because of that I feel that our memorial cross is, in a way, his grave stone.\"  Id., at 1244.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Cross was to stand at the terminus of another World War I memorial--the National Defense Highway, which connects Washington to Annapolis.  The community gathered for a joint groundbreaking ceremony for both memorials on September 28, 1919; the mother of the first Prince George's County resident killed in France broke ground for the Cross.  Id., at 910.  By 1922, however, the committee had run out of funds, and progress on the Cross had stalled.  The local post of the American Legion took over the project, and the monument was finished in 1925.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The completed monument is a 32-foot tall Latin cross that sits on a large pedestal.  The American Legion's emblem is displayed at its center, and the words \"Valor,\" \"Endurance,\" \"Courage,\" and \"Devotion\" are inscribed at its base, one on each of the four faces.  The pedestal also features a 9- by 2.5-foot bronze plaque explaining that the monument is \"Dedicated to the heroes of Prince George's County, Maryland who lost their lives in the Great War for the liberty of the world.\"  Id., at 915 (capitalization omitted).  The plaque lists the names of 49 local men, both Black and White, who died in the war.  It identifies the dates of American involvement, and quotes President Woodrow Wilson's request for a declaration of war: \"The right is more precious than peace.  We shall fight for the things we have always carried nearest our hearts.  To such a task we dedicate our lives.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the dedication ceremony, a local Catholic priest offered an invocation.  Id., at 217-218.  United States Representative Stephen W. Gambrill delivered the keynote address, honoring the \"\u00a0'men of Prince George's County'\u00a0\" who \"\u00a0'fought for the sacred right of all to live in peace  and security.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 1372.  He encouraged the community to look to the \"\u00a0'token of this cross, symbolic of Calvary,'\u00a0\" to \"\u00a0'keep fresh the memory of our boys who died for a righteous cause.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  The ceremony closed with a benediction offered by a Baptist pastor.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since its dedication, the Cross has served as the site of patriotic events honoring veterans, including gatherings on Veterans Day, Memorial Day, and Independence Day.  Like the dedication itself, these events have typically included an invocation, a keynote speaker, and a benediction.  Id., at 182, 319-323.  Over the years, memorials honoring the veterans of other conflicts have been added to the surrounding area, which is now known as Veterans Memorial Park.  These include a World War II Honor Scroll; a Pearl Harbor memorial; a Korea-Vietnam veterans memorial; a September 11 garden; a War of 1812 memorial; and two recently added 38-foot-tall markers depicting British and American soldiers in the Battle of Bladensburg.  Id., at 891-903, 1530.  Because the Cross is located on a traffic island with limited space, the closest of these other monuments is about 200 feet away in a park across the road.  Id., at 36, 44.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the area around the Cross developed, the monument came to be at the center of a busy intersection.  In 1961, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (Commission) acquired the Cross and the land on which it sits in order to preserve the monument and address traffic-safety concerns.11 Id., at 420-421, 1384-1387.  The American Legion reserved the right to continue using the memorial to host a variety of ceremonies, including events in memory of departed veterans.  Id., at 1387.  Over the next five decades, the Commission spent approximately $117,000 to maintain and preserve the monument.  In 2008, it budgeted an additional $100,000 for renovations and repairs to the Cross.12\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2012, nearly 90 years after the Cross was dedicated and more than 50 years after the Commission acquired it, the American Humanist Association (AHA) lodged a complaint with the Commission.  The complaint alleged that the Cross's presence on public land and the Commission's maintenance of the memorial violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  Id., at 1443-1451.  The AHA, along with three residents of Washington, D.\u00a0C., and Maryland, also sued the Commission in the District Court for the District of Maryland, making the same claim.  The AHA sought declaratory and injunctive relief requiring \"removal or demolition of the Cross, or removal of the arms from the Cross to form a non-religious slab or obelisk.\"  874 F.\u00a03d 195, 202, n.\u00a07 (CA4 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The American Legion intervened to defend the Cross.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court granted summary judgment for the Commission and the American Legion.  The Cross, the District Court held, satisfies both the three-pronged test announced in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.\u00a0S. 602 (1971), and the analysis applied by Justice Breyer in upholding the Ten Commandments monument at issue in Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.\u00a0S. 677.  Under the Lemon test, a court must ask whether a challenged government action (1) has a secular purpose; (2) has a \"principal or primary effect\" that \"neither advances nor inhibits religion\"; and (3)\u00a0does not foster \"an excessive government entanglement with religion,\" 403 U.\u00a0S., at 612-613 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Applying that test, the District Court determined that the Commission had secular purposes for acquiring and maintaining the Cross--namely, to commemorate World War I and to ensure traffic safety.  The court also found that a reasonable observer aware of the Cross's history, setting, and secular elements \"would not view the Monument as having the effect of impermissibly endorsing religion.\" 147 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 373, 387 (Md. 2015).  Nor, according to the court, did the Commission's maintenance of the memorial create the kind of \"continued and repeated government involvement with religion\" that would constitute an excessive entanglement.  Ibid. (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted).  Finally, in light of the factors that informed its analysis of Lemon's \"effects\" prong, the court concluded that the Cross is constitutional under Justice Breyer's approach in Van Orden.  147 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 388-390.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed.  The majority relied primarily on the Lemon test but also took cognizance of Justice Breyer's Van Orden concurrence.  While recognizing that the Commission acted for a secular purpose, the court held that the Bladensburg Cross failed Lemon's \"effects\" prong because a reasonable observer would view the Commission's ownership and maintenance of the monument as an endorsement of Christianity.  The court emphasized the cross's \"inherent religious meaning\" as the \"\u00a0'preeminent symbol of Christianity.'\u00a0\"  874 F.\u00a03d, at 206-207.  Although conceding that the monument had several \"secular elements,\" the court asserted that they were \"overshadow[ed]\" by the Cross's size and Christian connection--especially because the Cross's location and condition would make it difficult for \"passers-by\" to \"read\" or otherwise \"examine\" the plaque and American Legion emblem.  Id., at 209-210.  The court rejected as \"too simplistic\" an argument dppefending the Cross's constitutionality on the basis of its 90-year history, suggesting that \"[p]erhaps the longer a violation persists, the greater the affront to those offended.\"  Id., at 208.  In the alternative, the court concluded, the Commission had become excessively entangled with religion by keeping a display that \"aggrandizes the Latin cross\" and by spending more than de minimis public funds to maintain it.  Id., at 211-212.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Judge Gregory dissented in relevant part, contending that the majority misapplied the \"effects\" test by failing to give adequate consideration to the Cross's \"physical setting, history, and usage.\"  Id., at 218 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).  He also disputed the majority's excessive-entanglement analysis, noting that the Commission's maintenance of the Cross was not the kind of \"comprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state surveillance\" of religion that Lemon was con-cerned to rule out.  874 F.\u00a03d, at 221 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Fourth Circuit denied rehearing en banc over dissents by Chief Judge Gregory, Judge Wilkinson, and Judge Niemeyer.  891 F.\u00a03d 117 (2018).  The Commission and the American Legion each petitioned for certiorari.  We granted the petitions and consolidated them for argument.  586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment provides that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\"  While the concept of a formally established church is straightforward, pinning down the meaning of a \"law respecting an establishment of religion\" has proved to be a vexing problem.  Prior to the Court's decision in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.\u00a0S. 1 (1947), the Establishment Clause was applied only to the Federal Government, and few cases involving this provision came before the Court.  After Everson recognized the incorporation of the Clause, however, the Court faced a steady stream of difficult and controversial Establishment Clause issues, ranging from Bible reading and prayer in the public schools, Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.\u00a0S. 421 (1962); School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.\u00a0S. 203 (1963), to Sunday closing laws, McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.\u00a0S. 420 (1961), to state subsidies for church-related schools or the parents of students attending those schools, Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U.\u00a0S. 236 (1968); Everson, supra.  After grappling with such cases for more than 20 years, Lemon ambitiously attempted to distill from the Court's existing case law a test that would bring order and predictability to Establishment Clause decisionmaking.  That test, as noted, called on courts to examine the purposes and effects of a challenged government action, as well as any entanglement with religion that it might entail.  Lemon, 403 U.\u00a0S., at 612-613.  The Court later elaborated that the \"effect[s]\" of a challenged action should be assessed by asking whether a \"reasonable observer\" would conclude that the action constituted an \"endorsement\" of religion.  County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.\u00a0S. 573, 592 (1989); id., at 630 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in  judgment).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the Lemon Court thought that its test would provide a framework for all future Establishment Clause decisions, its expectation has not been met.  In many cases, this Court has either expressly declined to apply the test or has simply ignored it.  See Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U.\u00a0S. 1 (1993); Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.\u00a0S. 687 (1994); Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.\u00a0S. 819 (1995); Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U.\u00a0S. 753 (1995); Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98 (2001); Zelman v.  Simmons-Harris, 536 U.\u00a0S. 639 (2002); Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.\u00a0S. 709 (2005); Van Orden, 545 U. S. 677; Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, 565 U. S. 171 (2012); Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.\u00a0S. 565 (2014); Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U. S. ___ (2018).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This pattern is a testament to the Lemon test's shortcomings.  As Establishment Clause cases involving a great array of laws and practices came to the Court, it became more and more apparent that the Lemon test could not resolve them.  It could not \"explain the Establishment Clause's tolerance, for example, of the prayers that open legislative meetings, .\u00a0.\u00a0. certain references to, and invocations of, the Deity in the public words of public officials; the public references to God on coins, decrees, and buildings; or the attention paid to the religious objectives of certain holidays, including Thanksgiving.\"  Van Orden, supra, at 699 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  The test has been harshly criticized by Members of this Court,13 lamented by lower court judges,14 and questioned by a diverse roster of scholars.15\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For at least four reasons, the Lemon test presents particularly daunting problems in cases, including the one now before us, that involve the use, for ceremonial, celebratory, or commemorative purposes, of words or symbols with religious associations.16  Together, these considerations counsel against efforts to evaluate such cases under Lemon and toward application of a presumption of constitutionality for longstanding monuments, symbols, and practices.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, these cases often concern monuments, symbols, or practices that were first established long ago, and in such cases, identifying their original purpose or purposes may be especially difficult.  In Salazar v. Buono, 559 U.\u00a0S. 700 (2010), for example, we dealt with a cross that a small group of World War I veterans had put up at a remote spot in the Mojave Desert more than seven decades earlier.  The record contained virtually no direct evidence regarding the specific motivations of these men.  We knew that they had selected a plain white cross, and there was some evidence that the man who looked after the monument for many years--\"a miner who had served as a medic and had thus presumably witnessed the carnage of the war firsthand\"--was said not to have been \"particularly religious.\"  Id., at 724 (Alito, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without better evidence about the purpose of the monument, different Justices drew different inferences.  The plurality thought that this particular cross was meant \"to commemorate American servicemen who had died in World War I\" and was not intended \"to promote a Christian message.\"  Id., at 715.  The dissent, by contrast, \"presume[d]\" that the cross's purpose \"was a Christian one, at least in part, for the simple reason that those who erected the cross chose to commemorate American veterans in an explicitly Christian manner.\"  Id., at 752 (opinion of Stevens, J.).  The truth is that 70 years after the fact, there was no way to be certain about the motivations of the men who were responsible for the creation of the monument.  And this is often the case with old monuments, symbols, and practices.  Yet it would be inappropriate for courts to compel their removal or termination based on supposition.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, as time goes by, the purposes associated with an established monument, symbol, or practice often multiply.  Take the example of Ten Commandments monuments, the subject we addressed in Van Orden, 545 U.\u00a0S. 677, and McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Ky., 545 U.\u00a0S. 844 (2005).  For believing Jews and Christians, the Ten Commandments are the word of God handed down to Moses on Mount Sinai, but the image of the Ten Commandments has also been used to convey other meanings.  They have historical significance as one of the foundations of our legal system, and for largely that reason, they are depicted in the marble frieze in our courtroom and in other prominent public buildings in our Nation's capital.  See Van Orden, supra, at 688-690.  In Van Orden and McCreary, no Member of the Court thought that these depictions are unconstitutional.  545 U.\u00a0S., at 688-690; id., at 701 (opinion of Breyer, J.); id., at 740 (Souter, J., dissenting).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as depictions of the Ten Commandments in these public buildings were intended to serve secular purposes, the litigation in Van Orden and McCreary showed that secular motivations played a part in the proliferation of Ten Commandments monuments in the 1950s.  In 1946, Minnesota Judge E. J. Ruegemer proposed that the Ten Commandments be widely disseminated as a way of combating juvenile delinquency.17  With this prompting, the Fraternal Order of the Eagles began distributing paper copies of the Ten Commandments to churches, school groups, courts, and government offices.  The Eagles, \"while interested in the religious aspect of the Ten Commandments, sought to highlight the Commandments' role in shaping civic morality.\"  Van Orden, supra, at 701 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  At the same time, Cecil B. DeMille was filming The Ten Commandments.18  He learned of Judge Ruegemer's campaign, and the two collaborated, deciding that the Commandments should be carved on stone tablets and that DeMille would make arrangements with the Eagles to help pay for them, thus simultaneously promoting his film and public awareness of the Decalogue.  Not only did DeMille and Judge Ruegemer have different purposes, but the motivations of those who accepted the monuments and those responsible for maintaining them may also have differed.  As we noted in Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.\u00a0S. 460, 476 (2009), \"the thoughts or sentiments expressed by a government entity that accepts and displays [a monument] may be quite different from those of either its creator or its donor.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The existence of multiple purposes is not exclusive to longstanding monuments, symbols, or practices, but this phenomenon is more likely to occur in such cases.  Even if the original purpose of a monument was infused with religion, the passage of time may obscure that sentiment.  As our society becomes more and more religiously diverse, a community may preserve such monuments, symbols, and practices for the sake of their historical significance or their place in a common cultural heritage.  Cf. Schempp, 374 U.\u00a0S., at 264-265 (Brennan, J., concurring) (\"[The] government may originally have decreed a Sunday day of rest for the impermissible purpose of supporting religion but abandoned that purpose and retained the laws for the permissible purpose of furthering overwhelmingly secular ends\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, just as the purpose for maintaining a monument, symbol, or practice may evolve, \"[t]he 'message' conveyed .\u00a0.\u00a0.  may change over time.\"  Summum, 555 U.\u00a0S., at 477.  Consider, for example, the message of the Statue of Liberty, which began as a monument to the solidarity and friendship between France and the United States and only decades later came to be seen \"as a beacon welcoming immigrants to a land of freedom.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With sufficient time, religiously expressive monuments, symbols, and practices can become embedded features of a community's landscape and identity.  The community may come to value them without necessarily embracing their religious roots.  The recent tragic fire at Notre Dame in Paris provides a striking example.  Although the French Republic rigorously enforces a secular public square,19 the cathedral remains a symbol of national importance to the religious and nonreligious alike.  Notre Dame is fundamentally a place of worship and retains great religious importance, but its meaning has broadened.  For many, it is inextricably linked with the very idea of Paris and France.20  Speaking to the nation shortly after the fire, President Macron said that Notre Dame \"\u00a0'is our history, our literature, our imagination.  The place where we survived epidemics, wars, liberation.  It has been the epicenter of our lives.'\u00a0\"21\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the same way, consider the many cities and towns across the United States that bear religious names.  Religion undoubtedly motivated those who named Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; Las Cruces, New Mexico; Providence, Rhode Island; Corpus Christi, Texas; Nephi, Utah, and the countless other places in our country with names that are rooted in religion.  Yet few would argue that this history requires that these names be erased from the map.  Or take a motto like Arizona's, \"Ditat Deus\" (\"God enriches\"), which was adopted in 1864,22 or a flag like Maryland's, which has included two crosses since 1904.23  Familiarity itself can become a reason for preservation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth, when time's passage imbues a religiously expressive monument, symbol, or practice with this kind of familiarity and historical significance, removing it may no longer appear neutral, especially to the local community for which it has taken on particular meaning.  A government that roams the land, tearing down monuments with religious symbolism and scrubbing away any reference to the divine will strike many as aggressively hostile to religion.  Militantly secular regimes have carried out such projects in the past,24 and for those with a knowledge of history, the image of monuments being taken down will be evocative, disturbing, and divisive.  Cf. Van Orden, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 704 (opinion of Breyer, J.) (\"[D]isputes concerning the removal of longstanding depictions of the Ten Commandments from public buildings across the Nation .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0could thereby create the very kind of religiously based divisiveness that the Establishment Clause seeks to avoid\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These four considerations show that retaining established, religiously expressive monuments, symbols, and practices is quite different from erecting or adopting new ones.  The passage of time gives rise to a strong presumption of constitutionality.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The role of the cross in World War I memorials is illustrative of each of the four preceding considerations.  Immediately following the war, \"[c]ommunities across America built memorials to commemorate those who had served the nation in the struggle to make the world safe for democracy.\"  G. Piehler, The American Memory of War, App. 1124.  Although not all of these communities included a cross in their memorials, the cross had become a symbol closely linked to the war.  \"[T]he First World War witnessed a dramatic change in .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0the symbols used to commemorate th[e] service\" of the fallen soldiers.  Id., at 1123.  In the wake of the war, the United States adopted the cross as part of its military honors, establishing the Distinguished Service Cross and the Navy Cross in 1918 and 1919, respectively.  See id., at 147-148.  And as already noted, the fallen soldiers' final resting places abroad were marked by white crosses or Stars of David.  The solemn image of endless rows of white crosses became inextricably linked with and symbolic of the ultimate price paid by 116,000 soldiers.  And this relationship between the cross and the war undoubtedly influenced the design of the many war memorials that sprang up across the Nation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is not to say that the cross's association with the war was the sole or dominant motivation for the inclusion of the symbol in every World War I memorial that features it.  But today, it is all but impossible to tell whether that was so.  The passage of time means that testimony from those actually involved in the decisionmaking process is generally unavailable, and attempting to uncover their motivations invites rampant speculation.  And no matter what the original purposes for the erection of a monument, a community may wish to preserve it for very different reasons, such as the historic preservation and traffic-safety concerns the Commission has pressed here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the passage of time may have altered the area surrounding a monument in ways that change its meaning and provide new reasons for its preservation.  Such changes are relevant here, since the Bladensburg Cross now sits at a busy traffic intersection, and numerous additional monuments are located nearby.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even the AHA recognizes that there are instances in which a war memorial in the form of a cross is unobjectionable.  The AHA is not offended by the sight of the Argonne Cross or the Canadian Cross of Sacrifice, both Latin crosses commemorating World War I that rest on public grounds in Arlington National Cemetery.  The difference, according to the AHA, is that their location in a cemetery gives them a closer association with individual gravestones and interred soldiers.  See Brief for Respondents 96; Tr. of Oral Arg. 52.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But a memorial's placement in a cemetery is not necessary to create such a connection.  The parents and other relatives of many of the war dead lacked the means to travel to Europe to visit their graves, and the bodies of approximately 4,400 American soldiers were either never found or never identified.25  Thus, for many grieving relatives and friends, memorials took the place of gravestones.  Recall that the mother of one of the young men memorialized by the Bladensburg Cross thought of the memorial as, \"in a way, his grave stone.\"  App. 1244.  Whether in a cemetery or a city park, a World War I cross remains a memorial to the fallen.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similar reasoning applies to other memorials and monuments honoring important figures in our Nation's history.  When faith was important to the person whose life is commemorated, it is natural to include a symbolic reference to faith in the design of the memorial.  For example, many memorials for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., make reference to his faith.  Take the Martin Luther King, Jr. Civil Rights Memorial Park in Seattle, which contains a sculpture in three segments representing \"both the Christian Trinity and the union of the family.\"26  In Atlanta, the Ebenezer Baptist Church sits on the grounds of the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park.  National Statuary Hall in the Capitol honors a variety of religious figures: for example, Mother Joseph Pariseau kneeling in prayer; Po'Pay, a Pueblo religious leader with symbols of the Pueblo religion; Brigham Young, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; and Father Eusebio Kino with a crucifix around his neck and his hand raised in blessing.27  These monuments honor men and women who have played an important role in the history of our country, and where religious symbols are included in the monuments, their presence acknowledges the centrality of faith to those whose lives are commemorated.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, as World War I monuments have endured through the years and become a familiar part of the physical and cultural landscape, requiring their removal would not be viewed by many as a neutral act.  And an alteration like the one entertained by the Fourth Circuit--amputating the arms of the Cross, see 874 F.\u00a03d, at 202, n.\u00a07--would be seen by many as profoundly disrespectful.  One member of the majority below viewed this objection as inconsistent with the claim that the Bladensburg Cross serves secular purposes, see 891 F.\u00a03d, at 121 (Wynn, J., concurring in denial of en banc), but this argument misunderstands the complexity of monuments.  A monument may express many purposes and convey many different messages, both secular and religious.  Cf. Van Orden, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 690 (plurality opinion) (describing simultaneous religious and secular meaning of the Ten Commandments display).  Thus, a campaign to obliterate items with  religious associations may evidence hostility to religion even if those religious associations are no longer in the forefront.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, few would say that the State of California is attempting to convey a religious message by retaining the names given to many of the State's cities by their original Spanish settlers--San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, San Jose, San Francisco, etc.  But it would be something else entirely if the State undertook to change all those names.  Much the same is true about monuments to soldiers who sacrificed their lives for this country more than a century ago.\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the Lemon Court ambitiously attempted to find a grand unified theory of the Establishment Clause, in later cases, we have taken a more modest approach that focuses on the particular issue at hand and looks to history for guidance.  Our cases involving prayer before a legislative session are an example.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.\u00a0S. 783 (1983), the Court upheld the Nebraska Legislature's practice of beginning each session with a prayer by an official chaplain, and in so holding, the Court conspicuously ignored Lemon and did not respond to Justice Brennan's argument in dissent that the legislature's practice could not satisfy the Lemon test.  Id., at 797-801.  Instead, the Court found it highly persuasive that Congress for more than 200 years had opened its sessions with a prayer and that many state legislatures had followed suit.  Id., at 787-788.  We took a similar approach more recently in Town of Greece, 572 U.\u00a0S., at 577.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We reached these results even though it was clear, as stressed by the Marsh dissent, that prayer is by definition religious.  See Marsh, supra, at 797-798 (opinion of Brennan, J.).  As the Court put it in Town of Greece: \"Marsh\u00a0must not be understood as permitting a practice that would amount to a constitutional violation if not for its historical foundation.\"  572 U.\u00a0S., at 576.  \"The case teaches instead that the Establishment Clause must be interpreted 'by reference to historical practices and understandings'\u00a0\"\u00a0and that the decision of the First Congress to \"provid[e] for the appointment of chaplains only days after approving language for the First Amendment demonstrates that the Framers considered legislative prayer a benign acknowledgment of religion's role in society.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The prevalence of this philosophy at the time of the founding is reflected in other prominent actions taken by the First Congress.  It requested--and President Washington proclaimed--a national day of prayer, see 1 J. Richardson, Messages and Papers of the Presidents, 1789-1897, p. 64 (1897) (President Washington's Thanksgiving Proclamation), and it reenacted the Northwest Territory Ordinance, which provided that \"[r]eligion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged,\" 1 Stat. 52, n. (a).  President Washington echoed this sentiment in his Farewell Address, calling religion and morality \"indispensable supports\" to \"political prosperity.\"  Farewell Address (1796), in 35 The Writings of George Washington 229 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 1940).  See also P. Hamburger, Separation of Church and State 66 (2002).  The First Congress looked to these \"supports\" when it chose to begin its sessions with a prayer.  This practice was designed to solemnize congressional meetings, unifying those in attendance as they pursued a common goal of good governance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To achieve that purpose, legislative prayer needed to be inclusive rather than divisive, and that required a determined effort even in a society that was much more religiously homogeneous than ours today.  Although the United States at the time was overwhelmingly Christian and Protestant,28 there was considerable friction between Protestant denominations.  See M. Noll, America's God: From Jonathan Edwards to Abraham Lincoln 228 (2002).  Thus, when an Episcopal clergyman was nominated as chaplain, some Congregationalist Members of Congress objected due to the \"\u00a0'diversity of religious sentiments represented in Congress.'\u00a0\"  D. Davis, Religion and the Continental Congress 74 (2000).  Nevertheless, Samuel Adams, a staunch Congregationalist, spoke in favor of the motion: \"\u00a0'I am no bigot.  I can hear a prayer from a man  of piety and virtue, who is at the same time a friend of  his country.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  Others agreed and the chaplain was appointed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Over time, the members of the clergy invited to offer prayers at the opening of a session grew more and more diverse.  For example, an 1856 study of Senate and House Chaplains since 1789 tallied 22 Methodists, 20 Presbyterians, 19 Episcopalians, 13 Baptists, 4 Congregationalists, 2 Roman Catholics, and 3 that were characterized as \"miscellaneous.\"29  Four years later, Rabbi Morris Raphall became the first rabbi to open Congress.30  Since then, Congress has welcomed guest chaplains from a variety of faiths, including Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Native American religions.31\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Town of Greece, which concerned prayer before a town council meeting, there was disagreement about the inclusiveness of the town's practice.  Compare 572 U.\u00a0S., at 585 (opinion of the Court) (\"The town made reasonable efforts to identify all of the congregations located within its borders and represented that it would welcome a prayer by any minister or layman who wished to give one\"),  with id., at 616 (Kagan, J., dissenting) (\"Greece's Board did nothing to recognize religious diversity\").  But there was no disagreement that the Establishment Clause permits a nondiscriminatory practice of prayer at the beginning of a town council session.  See ibid. (\"I believe that pluralism and inclusion [in legislative prayer] in a town hall can satisfy the constitutional requirement of neutrality\").  Of course, the specific practice challenged in Town of Greece lacked the very direct connection, via the First Congress, to the thinking of those who were responsible for framing the First Amendment.  But what mattered was that the town's practice \"fi[t] within the tradition long followed in Congress and the state legislatures.\"  Id., at 577 (opinion of the Court).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The practice begun by the First Congress stands out as an example of respect and tolerance for differing views, an honest endeavor to achieve inclusivity and nondiscrimination, and a recognition of the important role that religion plays in the lives of many Americans.  Where categories  of monuments, symbols, and practices with a longstanding history follow in that tradition, they are likewise constitutional.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying these principles, we conclude that the Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we have explained, the Bladensburg Cross carries special significance in commemorating World War I.  Due in large part to the image of the simple wooden crosses that originally marked the graves of American soldiers killed in the war, the cross became a symbol of their sacrifice, and the design of the Bladensburg Cross must be understood in light of that background.  That the cross originated as a Christian symbol and retains that meaning in many contexts does not change the fact that the symbol took on an added secular meaning when used in World War I memorials.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not only did the Bladensburg Cross begin with this meaning, but with the passage of time, it has acquired historical importance.  It reminds the people of Bladensburg and surrounding areas of the deeds of their predecessors and of the sacrifices they made in a war fought in the name of democracy.  As long as it is retained in its original place and form, it speaks as well of the community that erected the monument nearly a century ago and has maintained it ever since.  The memorial represents what the relatives, friends, and neighbors of the fallen soldiers felt at the time and how they chose to express their sentiments.  And the monument has acquired additional layers of historical meaning in subsequent years.  The Cross now stands among memorials to veterans of later wars.  It has become part of the community.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The monument would not serve that role if its design had deliberately disrespected area soldiers who perished in World War I.  More than 3,500\u00a0Jewish\u00a0soldiers\u00a0gave their lives for the United States in\u00a0that conflict,32 and some have wondered whether the names of any Jewish soldiers from the area were deliberately left off the list on the memorial or whether the names of any Jewish soldiers were included on the Cross against the wishes of their families.  There is no evidence that either thing was done, and we do know that one of the local American Legion leaders responsible for the Cross's construction was a Jewish veteran.  See App. 65, 205, 990.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The AHA's brief strains to connect the Bladensburg Cross and even the American Legion with anti-Semitism and the Ku Klux Klan, see Brief for Respondents 5-7, but the AHA's disparaging intimations have no evidentiary support.  And when the events surrounding the erection of the Cross are viewed in historical context, a very different picture may perhaps be discerned.  The monument was dedicated on July 12, 1925, during a period when the country was experiencing heightened racial and religious animosity.  Membership in the Ku Klux Klan, which preached hatred of Blacks, Catholics, and Jews, was at its height.33  On August 8, 1925, just two weeks after the dedication of the Bladensburg Cross and less than 10 miles away, some 30,000 robed Klansmen marched down Pennsylvania Avenue in the Nation's Capital.  But the Bladensburg Cross memorial included the names of both Black and White soldiers who had given their lives in the war; and despite the fact that Catholics and Baptists at that time were not exactly in the habit of participating together in ecumenical services, the ceremony dedicating the Cross began with an invocation by a Catholic priest and ended with a benediction by a Baptist pastor.  App. 1559-1569, 1373.  We can never know for certain what was in the minds of those responsible for the memorial, but in light of what we know about this ceremony, we can perhaps make out a picture of a community that, at least for the moment, was united by grief and patriotism and rose above the divisions of the day.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, it is surely relevant that the monument commemorates the death of particular individuals.  It is natural and appropriate for those seeking to honor the deceased to invoke the symbols that signify what death meant for those who are memorialized.  In some circumstances, the exclusion of any such recognition would make a memorial incomplete.  This well explains why Holocaust memorials invariably include Stars of David or other symbols of Judaism.34  It explains why a new memorial to Native American veterans in Washington, D.\u00a0C., will portray a steel circle to represent \"\u00a0'the hole in the sky where the creator lives.'\u00a0\"35  And this is why the memorial for soldiers from the Bladensburg community features the cross--the same symbol that marks the graves of so many of their comrades near the battlefields where they fell.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The cross is undoubtedly a Christian symbol, but that fact should not blind us to everything else that the Bladensburg Cross has come to represent.  For some, that monument is a symbolic resting place for ancestors who never returned home.  For others, it is a place for the community to gather and honor all veterans and their sacrifices for our Nation.  For others still, it is a historical landmark.  For many of these people, destroying or defacing the Cross that has stood undisturbed for nearly a century would not be neutral and would not further the ideals of respect and tolerance embodied in the First Amendment.

AMERICAN HUMANIST ASSOCIATION, et\u00a0al.\non writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit\n[June 20, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Kagan joins, concurring.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have long maintained that there is no single formula for resolving Establishment Clause challenges.  See Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.\u00a0S. 677, 698 (2005) (opinion concurring in judgment).  The Court must instead consider each case in light of the basic purposes that the Religion Clauses were meant to serve: assuring religious liberty and tolerance for all, avoiding religiously based social conflict, and maintaining that separation of church and state that allows each to flourish in its \"separate spher[e].\"  Ibid.; see also Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.\u00a0S. 639, 717\u2212723 (2002) (Breyer, J., dissenting).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I agree with the Court that allowing the State of Maryland to display and maintain the Peace Cross poses no threat to those ends.  The Court's opinion eloquently explains why that is so: The Latin cross is uniquely associated with the fallen soldiers of World War I; the organizers of the Peace Cross acted with the undeniably secular motive of commemorating local soldiers; no evidence suggests that they sought to disparage or exclude any religious group; the secular values inscribed on the Cross and its place among other memorials strengthen its message of patriotism and commemoration; and, finally, the Cross has stood on the same land for 94 years, generating no controversy in the community until this lawsuit was filed.  Nothing in the record suggests that the lack of public outcry \"was due to a climate of intimidation.\"  Van Orden, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 702 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment).  In light of all these circumstances, the Peace Cross cannot reasonably be understood as \"a government effort to favor a particular religious sect\" or to \"promote religion over nonreligion.\"  Ibid.  And, as the Court explains, ordering its removal or alteration at this late date would signal \"a hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause traditions.\"  Id., at 704.   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The case would be different, in my view, if there were evidence that the organizers had \"deliberately disrespected\" members of minority faiths or if the Cross had been erected only recently, rather than in the aftermath of World War I.  See ante, at 29; see also Van Orden, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 703 (opinion of Breyer, J.) (explaining that, in light of the greater religious diversity today, \"a more contemporary state effort\" to put up a religious display is \"likely to prove divisive in a way that [a] longstanding, pre-existing monument [would] not\").  But those are not the circumstances presented to us here, and I see no reason to order this cross torn down simply because other crosses would raise constitutional concerns.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor do I understand the Court's opinion today to adopt a \"history and tradition test\" that would permit any newly constructed religious memorial on public land.  See post, at 1, 4 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring); cf. post, at 8\u22129 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in judgment).  The Court appropriately \"looks to history for guidance,\" ante, at 25 (plurality opinion), but it upholds the constitutionality of the Peace Cross only after considering its particular historical context and its long-held place in the community, see ante, at 28\u221230 (majority opinion).  A newer memorial, erected under different circumstances, would not necessarily be permissible under this approach.  Cf. ante, at 21. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I have previously explained, \"where the Establishment Clause is at issue,\" the Court must \"\u00a0'distinguish between real threat and mere shadow.'\u00a0\"  Van Orden, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 704 (opinion concurring in judgment) (quoting School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.\u00a0S. 203, 308 (1963) (Goldberg, J., concurring)).  In light of all the circumstances here, I agree with the Court that the Peace Cross poses no real threat to the values that the Establishment Clause serves.    \n\nKavanaugh, J., concurring\n\u2002588 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNos. 17-1717 and 18-18\nTHE AMERICAN LEGION, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS 17-1717\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0v.

I write separately to emphasize two points.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistent with the Court's case law, the Court today applies a history and tradition test in examining and upholding the constitutionality of the Bladensburg Cross.  See Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.\u00a0S. 783, 787-792, 795 (1983); Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.\u00a0S. 677, 686-690 (2005) (plurality opinion); Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.\u00a0S. 565, 575-578 (2014).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As this case again demonstrates, this Court no longer applies the old test articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.\u00a0S. 602 (1971).  The Lemon test examined, among other things, whether the challenged government action had a primary effect of advancing or endorsing religion.  If Lemon guided this Court's understanding of the Establishment Clause, then many of the Court's Establishment Clause cases over the last 48 years would have been decided differently, as I will explain.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The opinion identifies five relevant categories of Establishment Clause cases: (1) religious symbols on government property and religious speech at government events; (2) religious accommodations and exemptions from generally applicable laws; (3) government benefits and tax exemptions for religious organizations; (4) religious expression in public schools; and (5) regulation of private religious speech in public forums.  See ante, at 15, n. 16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Lemon test does not explain the Court's decisions in any of those five categories.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first category of cases, the Court has relied on history and tradition and upheld various religious symbols on government property and religious speech at government events.  See, e.g., Marsh, 463 U.\u00a0S., at 787-792, 795; Van Orden, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 686-690 (plurality opinion); Town of Greece, 572 U.\u00a0S., at 575-578.  The Court does so again today.  Lemon does not account for the results in these cases.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second category of cases, this Court has allowed legislative accommodations for religious activity and upheld legislatively granted religious exemptions from generally applicable laws.  See, e.g., Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.\u00a0S. 327 (1987); Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.\u00a0S. 709 (2005).  But accommodations and exemptions \"by definition\" have the effect of advancing or endorsing religion to some extent.  Amos, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 347 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (quotation altered).  Lemon, fairly applied, does not justify those decisions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the third category of cases, the Court likewise has upheld government benefits and tax exemptions that go to religious organizations, even though those policies have the effect of advancing or endorsing religion.  See, e.g., Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U.\u00a0S. 664 (1970); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.\u00a0S. 388 (1983); Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U.\u00a0S. 793 (2000) (plurality opinion); Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.\u00a0S. 639 (2002); Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017).  Those outcomes are not easily reconciled with Lemon.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the fourth category of cases, the Court has proscribed government-sponsored prayer in public schools.  The Court has done so not because of Lemon, but because the Court concluded that government-sponsored prayer in public schools posed a risk of coercion of students.  The Court's most prominent modern case on that subject,  Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.\u00a0S. 577 (1992), did not rely on Lemon.  In short, Lemon was not necessary to the Court's decisions holding government-sponsored school prayers unconstitutional.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the fifth category, the Court has allowed private religious speech in public forums on an equal basis with secular speech.  See, e.g., Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.\u00a0S. 384 (1993); Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U.\u00a0S. 753 (1995); Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.\u00a0S. 819 (1995); Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U.\u00a0S. 98 (2001).  That practice does not violate the Establishment Clause, the Court has ruled.  Lemon does not explain those cases.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, the Court declines to apply Lemon in a case in the religious symbols and religious speech category, just as the Court declined to apply Lemon in Town of Greece v. Galloway, Van Orden v. Perry, and Marsh v. Chambers.  The Court's decision in this case again makes clear that the Lemon test does not apply to Establishment Clause cases in that category.  And the Court's decisions over the span of several decades demonstrate that the Lemon test is not good law and does not apply to Establishment Clause cases in any of the five categories.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the contrary, each category of Establishment Clause cases has its own principles based on history, tradition, and precedent.  And the cases together lead to an overarching set of principles: If the challenged government practice is not coercive and if it (i) is rooted in history and tradition; or (ii) treats religious people, organizations, speech, or activity equally to comparable secular people, organizations, speech, or activity; or (iii) represents a permissible legislative accommodation or exemption from a generally applicable law, then there ordinarily is no Establishment Clause violation.*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The practice of displaying religious memorials, particularly religious war memorials, on public land is not coercive and is rooted in history and tradition.  The Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause.  Cf. Town of Greece, 572 U.\u00a0S. 565.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bladensburg Cross commemorates soldiers who gave their lives for America in World War I.  I agree with the Court that the Bladensburg Cross is constitutional.  At the same time, I have deep respect for the plaintiffs' sincere objections to seeing the cross on public land.  I have great respect for the Jewish war veterans who in an amicus brief say that the cross on public land sends a message of exclusion.  I recognize their sense of distress and alienation.  Moreover, I fully understand the deeply religious nature of the cross.  It would demean both believers and nonbelievers to say that the cross is not religious, or not all that religious.  A case like this is difficult because it represents a clash of genuine and important interests.  Applying our precedents, we uphold the constitutionality of the cross.  In doing so, it is appropriate to also restate this bedrock constitutional principle: All citizens are equally American, no matter what religion they are, or if they have no religion at all.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The conclusion that the cross does not violate the Establishment Clause does not necessarily mean that those who object to it have no other recourse.  The Court's ruling allows the State to maintain the cross on public land.  The Court's ruling does not require the State to maintain the cross on public land.  The Maryland Legislature could enact new laws requiring removal of the cross or transfer of the land.  The Maryland Governor or other state or local executive officers may have authority to do so under current Maryland law.  And if not, the legislature could enact new laws to authorize such executive action.  The Maryland Constitution, as interpreted by the Maryland Court of Appeals, may speak to this question.  And if not, the people of Maryland can amend the State Constitution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those alternative avenues of relief illustrate a fundamental feature of our constitutional structure: This Court is not the only guardian of individual rights in America.  This Court fiercely protects the individual rights secured by the U. S. Constitution.  See, e.g., West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.\u00a0S. 624 (1943); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.\u00a0S. 205 (1972).  But the Constitution sets a floor for the protection of individual rights.  The constitutional floor is sturdy and often high, but it is a floor.  Other federal, state, and local government entities generally possess authority to safeguard individual rights above and beyond the rights secured by the U. S. Constitution.  See generally J. Sutton, 51 Imperfect Solutions (2018); Brennan, State Constitutions and the Protection of Individual Rights, 90 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 489 (1977).\n\nKagan, J., concurring in part\n\u2002588 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNos. 17-1717 and 18-18\nTHE AMERICAN LEGION, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS 17-1717\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0v.

Although I agree that rigid application of the Lemon test does not solve every Establishment Clause problem, I think that test's focus on purposes and effects is crucial in evaluating government action in this sphere--as this very suit shows.  I therefore do not join Part II-A.  I do not join Part II-D out of perhaps an excess of caution.  Although I too \"look[\u00a0] to history for guidance,\" ante, at 25 (plurality opinion), I prefer at least for now to do so case-by-case, rather than to sign on to any broader statements about history's role in Establishment Clause analysis.  But I find much to admire in this section of the opinion--particularly, its emphasis on whether longstanding monuments, symbols, and practices reflect \"respect and tolerance for differing views, an honest endeavor to achieve inclusivity and nondiscrimination, and a recognition of the important role that religion plays in the lives of many Americans.\"  Ante, at 28.  Here, as elsewhere, the opinion shows sensitivity to and respect for this Nation's pluralism, and the values of neutrality and inclusion that the First Amendment demands.\n\nThomas, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002588 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNos. 17-1717 and 18-18\nTHE AMERICAN LEGION, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS 17-1717\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0v.

Const., Amdt. 1.  The text and history of this Clause suggest that it should not be incorporated against the States.  Even if the Clause expresses an individual right enforceable against the States, it is limited by its text to \"law[s]\" enacted by a legislature, so it is unclear whether the Bladensburg Cross would implicate any incorporated right.  And even if it did, this religious display does not involve the type of actual legal coercion that was a hallmark of historical establishments of religion.  Therefore, the Cross is clearly constitutional.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I have explained elsewhere, the Establishment Clause resists incorporation against the States.  Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.\u00a0S. 565, 604-607 (2014) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.\u00a0S. 1, 49-51 (2004) (opinion concurring in judgment); Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.\u00a0S. 677, 692-693 (2005) (concurring opinion); Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.\u00a0S. 639, 677-680 (2002) (same).  In Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.\u00a0S. 1, 15 (1947), the Court \"casually\" incorporated the Clause with a declaration that because the Free Exercise Clause had been incorporated, \"\u00a0'[t]here is every reason to give the same application and broad interpretation to the \"establishment of religion\" clause.'\u00a0\"  Town of Greece, 572 U.\u00a0S., at 607, n.\u00a01 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  The Court apparently did not consider that an incorporated Establishment Clause would prohibit exactly what the text of the Clause seeks to protect: state establishments of religion.  See id., at 605-606.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's \"inattention\" to the significant question of incorporation \"might be explained, although not excused, by the rise of popular conceptions about 'separation of church and state' as an 'American' constitutional right.\"  Id., at 608, n.\u00a01; see P. Hamburger, Separation of Church and State 454-463 (2002); see also id., at 391-454 (tracing the role of nativist sentiment in the rise of \"the modern myth of separation\" as an American ideal).  But an ahistorical generalization is no substitute for careful constitutional analysis.  We should consider whether any longstanding right of citizenship restrains the States in the establishment context.  See generally McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.\u00a0S. 742, 805-858, and n.\u00a020 (2010) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further confounding the incorporation question is the fact that the First Amendment by its terms applies only to \"law[s]\" enacted by \"Congress.\"  Obviously, a memorial is not a law.  And respondents have not identified any specific law they challenge as unconstitutional, either on its face or as applied.  Thus, respondents could prevail on their establishment claim only if the prohibition embodied in the Establishment Clause was understood to be an individual right of citizenship that applied to more than just \"law[s]\" \"ma[de]\" by \"Congress.\"1\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if the Clause applied to state and local governments in some fashion, \"[t]he mere presence of the monument along [respondents'] path involves no coercion and thus does not violate the Establishment Clause.\"  Van Orden, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 694 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  The sine qua non of an establishment of religion is \"\u00a0'actual legal coercion.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 693.  At the founding, \"[t]he coercion that was a hallmark of historical establishments of religion was coercion of religious orthodoxy and of financial support by force of law and threat of penalty.\"  Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.\u00a0S. 577, 640 (1992) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted).  \"In a typical case, attendance at the established church was mandatory, and taxes were levied to generate church revenue.  Dissenting ministers were barred from preaching, and political participation was limited to members of the established church.\"  Town of Greece, supra, at 608 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (citation omitted).  In an action claiming an unconstitutional establishment of religion, the plaintiff must demonstrate that he was actually coerced by government conduct that shares the characteristics of an establishment as understood at the founding.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, respondents briefly suggest that the government's spending their tax dollars on maintaining the Bladensburg Cross represents coercion, but they have not demonstrated that maintaining a religious display on public property shares any of the historical characteristics of an establishment of religion.  The local commission has not attempted to control religious doctrine or personnel, compel religious observance, single out a particular religious denomination for exclusive state subsidization, or punish dissenting worship.  Instead, the commission has done something that the founding generation, as well as the generation that ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, would have found commonplace: displaying a religious symbol on government property.  See Brief for Becket Fund for Religious Liberty as Amicus Curiae 14-22.  Lacking any characteristics of \"the coercive state establishments that existed at the founding,\" Town of Greece, 572 U.\u00a0S., at 608 (opinion of Thomas, J.), the Bladensburg Cross is constitutional.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bladensburg Cross is constitutional even though the cross has religious significance as a central symbol of Christianity.  Respondents' primary contention is that this characteristic of the Cross makes it \"sectarian\"--a word used in respondents' brief more than 40 times.  Putting aside the fact that Christianity is not a \"sect,\" religious displays or speech need not be limited to that which a \"judge considers to be nonsectarian.\"  Id., at 582 (majority opinion).  As the Court has explained, \"[a]n insistence on nonsectarian\" religious speech is inconsistent with our Nation's history and traditions.  Id., at 578-580; see id., at 595 (Alito, J., concurring).  Moreover, requiring that religious expressions be nonsectarian would force the courts \"to act as supervisors and censors of religious speech.\"  Id., at 581 (majority opinion).  Any such effort would find courts \"trolling through .\u00a0.\u00a0. religious beliefs\" to decide what speech is sufficiently generic.  Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U.\u00a0S. 793, 828 (2000) (plurality opinion).  And government bodies trying to comply with the inevitably arbitrary decisions of the courts would face similarly intractable questions.  See Town of Greece, supra, at 596 (opinion of Alito, J.).3\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the long-discredited test set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.\u00a0S. 602, 612-613 (1971), and reiterated in County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.\u00a0S. 573, 592-594 (1989), the plurality rightly rejects its relevance to claims, like this one, involving \"religious references or imagery in public monuments, symbols, mottos, displays, and ceremonies.\"  Ante, at 15-16, and n.\u00a016.  I agree with that aspect of its opinion.  I would take the logical next step and overrule the Lemon test in all contexts.  First, that test has no basis in the original meaning of the Constitution.  Second, \"since its inception,\" it has \"been manipulated to fit whatever result the Court aimed to achieve.\"  McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Ky., 545 U.\u00a0S. 844, 900 (2005) (Scalia, J., dissenting); see Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.\u00a0S. 384, 398-399 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  Third, it continues to cause enormous confusion in the States and the lower courts.  See generally Utah Highway Patrol Assn. v. American Atheists, Inc., 565 U.\u00a0S. 994 (2011) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  In recent decades, the Court has tellingly refused to apply Lemon in the very cases where it purports to be most useful.  See Utah Highway, supra, at 997-998 (collecting cases); ante, at 13 (plurality opinion) (same).  The obvious explanation is that Lemon does not provide a sound basis for judging Establishment Clause claims.  However, the court below \"s[aw] fit to apply Lemon.\"  874 F.\u00a03d 195, 205 (CA4 2017).

AMERICAN HUMANIST ASSOCIATION, et\u00a0al.\non writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit\n[June 20, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The American Humanist Association wants a federal court to order the destruction of a 94 year-old war memorial because its members are offended.  Today, the Court explains that the plaintiffs are not entitled to demand the destruction of longstanding monuments, and I find much of its opinion compelling.  In my judgment, however, it follows from the Court's analysis that suits like this one should be dismissed for lack of standing.  Accordingly, while I concur in the judgment to reverse and remand the court of appeals' decision, I would do so with additional instructions to dismiss the case.\n*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Association claims that its members \"regularly\" come into \"unwelcome direct contact\" with a World War I memorial cross in Bladensburg, Maryland \"while driving in the area.\"  874 F.\u00a03d 195, 203 (CA4 2017).  And this, the Association suggests, is enough to allow it to insist on a federal judicial decree ordering the memorial's removal.  Maybe, the Association concedes, others who are less offended lack standing to sue.  Maybe others still who are equally affected but who come into contact with the memorial too infrequently lack standing as well.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 48-49.  But, the Association assures us, its members are offended enough--and with sufficient frequency--that they may sue.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This \"offended observer\" theory of standing has no basis in law.  Federal courts may decide only those cases and controversies that the Constitution and Congress have authorized them to hear.  And to establish standing to sue consistent with the Constitution, a plaintiff must show: (1)\u00a0injury-in-fact, (2)\u00a0causation, and (3)\u00a0redressability.  The injury-in-fact test requires a plaintiff to prove \"an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized .\u00a0.\u00a0. and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.\u00a0S. 555, 560 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unsurprisingly, this Court has already rejected the notion that offense alone qualifies as a \"concrete and particularized\" injury sufficient to confer standing.  We could hardly have been clearer: \"The presence of a disagreement, however sharp and acrimonious it may be, is insufficient by itself to meet Art. III's requirements.\"  Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.\u00a0S. 54, 62 (1986).  Imagine if a bystander disturbed by a police stop tried to sue under the Fourth Amendment.  Suppose an advocacy organization whose members were distressed by a State's decision to deny someone else a civil jury trial sought to complain under the Seventh Amendment.  Or envision a religious group upset about the application of the death penalty trying to sue to stop it.  Does anyone doubt those cases would be rapidly dispatched for lack of standing?  Cf. Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.\u00a0S. 149, 151 (1990) (holding that a third party does not have \"standing to challenge the validity of a death sentence imposed on a capital defendant who has elected to forgo his right of appeal\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's not hard to see why this Court has refused suits like these.  If individuals and groups could invoke the authority of a federal court to forbid what they dislike for no more reason than they dislike it, we would risk exceeding the judiciary's limited constitutional mandate and infringing on powers committed to other branches of government.  Courts would start to look more like legislatures, responding to social pressures rather than remedying concrete harms, in the process supplanting the right of the people and their elected representatives to govern themselves.  See, e.g., Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.\u00a0S. 398, 408 (2013) (\"The law of Article III standing, which is built on separation-of-powers principles, serves to prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers of the political branches\"); Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.\u00a0S. 490, 500 (1975) (without standing requirements \"courts would be called upon to decide abstract questions of wide public significance even though other governmental institutions may be more competent to address the questions\"); Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., 551 U.\u00a0S. 587, 635-636 (2007) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (\"\u00a0'To permit a complainant who has no concrete injury to require a court to rule on important constitutional issues in the abstract would create the potential for abuse of the judicial process, distort the role of the Judiciary in its relationship to the Executive and the Legislature and open the Judiciary to an arguable charge of providing \"government by injunction\"\u00a0'\u00a0\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proceeding on these principles, this Court has held offense alone insufficient to convey standing in analogous--and arguably more sympathetic--circumstances.  Take Allen v. Wright, 468 U.\u00a0S. 737 (1984), where the parents of African-American schoolchildren sued to compel the Internal Revenue Service to deny tax-exempt status to schools that discriminated on the basis of race.  The parents claimed that their children suffered a \"stigmatic injury, or denigration\" when the government supported racially discriminatory institutions.  Id., at 754.  But this Court refused to entertain the case, reasoning that standing extends \"only to those persons who are personally denied equal treatment by the challenged discriminatory conduct.\"  Id., at 755 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Now put the teachings there alongside the Association's standing theory here and you get this utterly unjustifiable result: An African-American offended by a Confederate flag atop a state capitol would lack standing to sue under the Equal Protection Clause, but an atheist who is offended by the cross on the same flag could sue under the Establishment Clause.  Who really thinks that could be the law?  See Brief for Becket Fund for Religious Liberty as Amicus Curiae 34-35.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider, as well, the Free Exercise Clause.  In Harris v. McRae, 448 U.\u00a0S. 297 (1980), this Court denied standing to a religious group that raised a free exercise challenge to federal restrictions on abortion funding because \"the plaintiffs had 'not contended that the [statute in question] in any way coerce[d] them as individuals in the practice of their religion.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 321, n.\u00a024.  Instead, the Court has held, a free exercise plaintiff generally must \"show that his good-faith religious beliefs are hampered before he acquires standing to attack a statute under the Free-Exercise Clause.\"  Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.\u00a0S. 599, 615 (1961) (Brennan, J., concurring and dissenting).  And if standing doctrine has such bite under the Free Exercise Clause, it's difficult to see how it could be as toothless as plaintiffs suppose under the neighboring Establishment Clause.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In fact, this Court has already expressly rejected \"offended observer\" standing under the Establishment Clause itself.  In Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.\u00a0S. 464 (1982), the plaintiffs objected to a transfer of property from the federal government to a religious college, an action they had learned about through a news release.  This Court had little trouble concluding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the transfer, explaining that \"the psychological consequence presumably produced by observation of conduct with which one disagrees\" is not an injury-in-fact \"sufficient to confer standing under Art. III.\"  Id., at 485.  To be sure, this Court has sometimes resolved Establishment Clause challenges to religious displays on the merits without first addressing standing.  But as this Court has held, its own failure to consider standing cannot be mistaken as an endorsement of it: \"[D]rive-by jurisdictional rulings of this sort\" carry \"no precedential effect.\"  Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.\u00a0S. 83, 91 (1998).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Offended observer standing is deeply inconsistent, too, with many other longstanding principles and precedents.  For example, this Court has consistently ruled that \"\u00a0'generalized grievances' about the conduct of Government\" are insufficient to confer standing to sue.  Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U.\u00a0S. 208, 217 (1974).  But if offended observers could bring suit, this rule would be rendered meaningless: Who, after all, would have trouble recasting a generalized grievance about governmental action into an \"I-take-offense\" argument for standing?  Similarly, this Court has long \"adhered to the rule that a party 'generally must assert his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.'\u00a0\"  Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.\u00a0S. 125, 129 (2004).  We depart from this rule only where the party seeking to invoke the judicial power \"has a 'close' relationship with the person who possesses the right\" and \"there is a 'hindrance' to the possessor's ability to protect his own interests.\"  Id., at 130.  Applying these principles in Kowalski, this Court held that attorneys lacked standing to assert the rights of indigent defendants.  Id., at 127.  And in Whitmore, we rejected a third party's effort to appeal another person's death sentence.  495 U.\u00a0S., at 151.  But if offended observers could sue, the attorneys in Kowalski might have simply claimed they were \"offended\" by Michigan's procedure for appointing appellate counsel, and the third party in Whitmore could have just said he was offended (as he surely was) by the impending execution.  None of this Court's limits on third-party standing would really matter.\n*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Offended observer standing cannot be squared with this Court's longstanding teachings about the limits of Article III.  Not even today's dissent seriously attempts to defend it.  So at this point you might wonder: How did the lower courts in this case indulge the plaintiffs' \"offended observer\" theory of standing?  And why have other lower courts done similarly in other cases?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The truth is, the fault lies here.  Lower courts invented offended observer standing for Establishment Clause cases in the 1970s in response to this Court's decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.\u00a0S. 602 (1971).  Lemon held that whether governmental action violates the Establishment Clause depends on its (1)\u00a0purpose, (2)\u00a0effect, and (3)\u00a0potential to \"\u00a0'excessive[ly] .\u00a0.\u00a0. entangl[e]'\u00a0\" church and state, id., at 613, a standard this Court came to understand as prohibiting the government from doing anything that a \"\u00a0'reasonable observer'\u00a0\" might perceive as \"endorsing\" religion, County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.\u00a0S. 573, 620-621 (1989) (opinion of Blackmun, J.); id., at 631 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  And lower courts reasoned that, if the Establishment Clause forbids anything a reasonable observer would view as an endorsement of religion, then such an observer must be able to sue.  Moore v. Bryant, 853 F.\u00a03d 245, 250 (CA5 2017).  Here alone, lower courts concluded, though never with this Court's approval, an observer's offense must \"suffice to make an Establishment Clause claim justiciable.\"  Suhre v. Haywood Cty., 131 F.\u00a03d 1083, 1086 (CA4 1997).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As today's plurality rightly indicates in Part II-A, however, Lemon was a misadventure.  It sought a \"grand unified theory\" of the Establishment Clause but left us only a mess.  See ante, at 24 (plurality opinion).  How much \"purpose\" to promote religion is too much (are Sunday closing laws that bear multiple purposes, religious and secular, problematic)?  How much \"effect\" of advancing religion is tolerable (are even incidental effects disallowed)?  What does the \"entanglement\" test add to these inquiries?  Even beyond all that, how \"reasonable\" must our \"reasonable observer\" be, and what exactly qualifies as impermissible \"endorsement\" of religion in a country where \"In God We Trust\" appears on the coinage, the eye of God appears in its Great Seal, and we celebrate Thanksgiving as a national holiday (\"to Whom are thanks being given\")?  Harris v. Zion, 927 F.\u00a02d 1401, 1423 (CA7 1991) (Easterbrook, J., dissenting).  Nearly half a century after Lemon and, the truth is, no one has any idea about the answers to these questions.  As the plurality documents, our \"doctrine [is] in such chaos\" that lower courts have been \"free to reach almost any result in almost any case.\"  McConnell, Religious Participation in Public Programs: Religious Freedom at a Crossroads, 59 U. Chi. L.\u00a0Rev. 115, 119 (1992).  Scores of judges have pleaded with us to retire Lemon, scholars of all stripes have criticized the doctrine, and a majority of this Court has long done the same.  Ante, at 14-15 (plurality opinion).  Today, not a single Member of the Court even tries to defend Lemon against these criticisms--and they don't because they can't.  As Justice Kennedy explained, Lemon is \"flawed in its fundamentals,\" has proved \"unworkable in practice,\" and is \"inconsistent with our history and our precedents.\"  County of Allegheny, 492 U.\u00a0S., at 655, 669 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In place of Lemon, Part II-D of the plurality opinion relies on a more modest, historically sensitive approach, recognizing that \"the Establishment Clause must be interpreted by reference to historical practices and understandings.\"  Ante, at 25 (quoting Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.\u00a0S. 565, 576 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also ante, at 1-4 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring).  So, by way of example, the plurality explains that a state legislature may permissibly begin each session with a prayer by an official chaplain because \"Congress for more than 200 years had opened its sessions with a prayer and .\u00a0.\u00a0. many state legislatures had followed suit.\"  Ante, at 25 (discussing Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.\u00a0S. 783 (1983), and Town of Greece, 572 U.\u00a0S. 565).  The constitutionality of a practice doesn't depend on some artificial and indeterminate three-part test; what matters, the plurality reminds us, is whether the challenged practice fits \"\u00a0'within the tradition'\u00a0\" of this country.  Ante, at 27 (citing Town of Greece, 572 U.\u00a0S., at 577).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I agree with all this and don't doubt that the monument before us is constitutional in light of the nation's traditions.  But then the plurality continues on to suggest that \"longstanding monuments, symbols, and practices\" are \"presumpt[ively]\" constitutional.  Ante, at 16.  And about that, it's hard not to wonder: How old must a monument, symbol, or practice be to qualify for this new presumption?  It seems 94 years is enough, but what about the Star of David monument erected in South Carolina in 2001 to commemorate victims of the Holocaust, or the cross that marines in California placed in 2004 to honor their comrades who fell during the War on Terror?  And where exactly in the Constitution does this presumption come from?  The plurality does not say, nor does it even explain what work its presumption does.  To the contrary, the plurality proceeds to analyze the \"presumptively\" constitutional memorial in this case for its consistency with \"\u00a0'historical practices and understandings'\u00a0\" under Marsh and Town of Greece--exactly the same approach that the plurality, quoting Town of Greece, recognizes \"\u00a0'must be'\u00a0\" used whenever we interpret the Establishment Clause.  Ante, at 25; see also ante, at 2-4 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring).  Though the plurality does not say so in as many words, the message for our lower court colleagues seems unmistakable: Whether a monument, symbol, or practice is old or new, apply Town of Greece, not Lemon.  Indeed, some of our colleagues recognize this implication and blanch at its prospect.  See ante, at 2-3 (Breyer, J., concurring); ante, at 1-2 (Kagan, J., concurring in part) (declining to join Parts II-A & II-D); post, at 2, n.\u00a02 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).  But if that's the real message of the plurality's opinion, it seems to me exactly right--because what matters when it comes to assessing a monument, symbol, or practice isn't its age but its compliance with ageless principles.  The Constitution's meaning is fixed, not some good-for-this-day-only coupon, and a practice consistent with our nation's traditions is just as permissible whether undertaken today or 94 years ago.\n*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With Lemon now shelved, little excuse will remain for the anomaly of offended observer standing, and the gaping hole it tore in standing doctrine in the courts of appeals should now begin to close.  Nor does this development mean colorable Establishment Clause violations will lack for proper plaintiffs.  By way of example only, a public school student compelled to recite a prayer will still have standing to sue.  See School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.\u00a0S. 203, 224, n.\u00a09 (1963).  So will persons denied public office because of their religious affiliations or lack of them.  And so will those who are denied government benefits because they do not practice a favored religion or any at all.  Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U.\u00a0S. 1, 7-8 (1989) (plurality opinion).  On top of all that, States remain free to supply other forms of relief consistent with their own laws and constitutions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Abandoning offended observer standing will mean only a return to the usual demands of Article III, requiring a real controversy with real impact on real persons to make a federal case out of it.  Along the way, this will bring with it the welcome side effect of rescuing the federal judiciary from the sordid business of having to pass aesthetic judgment, one by one, on every public display in this country for its perceived capacity to give offense.  It's a business that has consumed volumes of the federal reports, invited erratic results, frustrated generations of judges, and fomented \"the very kind of religiously based divisiveness that the Establishment Clause seeks to avoid.\"  Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.\u00a0S. 677, 704 (2005) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment).  Courts applying Lemon's test have upheld Ten Commandment displays and demanded their removal; they have allowed memorial crosses and insisted that they be razed; they have permitted Christmas displays and pulled the plug on them; and they have pondered seemingly endlessly the inclusion of \"In God We Trust\" on currency or similar language in our Pledge of Allegiance.  No one can predict the rulings--but one thing is certain: Between the challenged practices and the judicial decisions, just about everyone will wind up offended.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor have we yet come close to exhausting the potential sources of offense and federal litigation Lemon invited, for what about the display of the Ten Commandments on the frieze in our own courtroom or on the doors leading into it?  Or the statues of Moses and the Apostle Paul next door in the Library of Congress?  Or the depictions of the Ten Commandments found in the Justice Department and the National Archives?  Or the crosses that can be found in the U.\u00a0S. Capitol building?  And all that just takes us mere steps from where we sit.  In light of today's decision, we should be done with this business, and our lower court colleagues may dispose of cases like these on a motion to dismiss rather than enmeshing themselves for years in intractable disputes sure to generate more heat than light.\n*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a large and diverse country, offense can be easily found.  Really, most every governmental action probably offends somebody.  No doubt, too, that offense can be sincere, sometimes well taken, even wise.  But recourse for disagreement and offense does not lie in federal litigation.  Instead, in a society that holds among its most cherished ambitions mutual respect, tolerance, self-rule, and democratic responsibility, an \"offended viewer\" may \"avert his eyes,\" Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U.\u00a0S. 205, 212 (1975), or pursue a political solution.  Today's decision represents a welcome step toward restoring this Court's recognition of these truths, and I respectfully concur in the judgment.\n\nGinsburg, J., dissenting\n\u2002588 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNos. 17-1717 and 18-18\nTHE AMERICAN LEGION, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS 17-1717\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0v.

Known as the Peace Cross, the monument was erected by private citizens in 1925 to honor local soldiers who lost their lives in World War I.  \"[T]he town's most prominent symbol\" was rededicated in 1985 and is now said to honor \"the sacrifices made [in] all wars,\" id., at 868 (internal quotation marks omitted), by \"all veterans,\" id., at 195.  Both the Peace Cross and the traffic island are owned and maintained by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (Commission), an agency of the State of Maryland.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Decades ago, this Court recognized that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution demands governmental neutrality among religious faiths, and between religion and nonreligion.  See Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.\u00a0S. 1, 15 (1947).  Numerous times since, the Court has reaffirmed the Constitution's commitment to neutrality.  Today the Court erodes that neutrality commitment, diminishing precedent designed to preserve individual liberty and civic harmony in favor of a \"presumption of constitutionality for longstanding monuments, symbols, and practices.\"  Ante, at 16 (plurality opinion).2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Latin cross is the foremost symbol of the Christian faith, embodying the \"central theological claim of Christianity: that the son of God died on the cross, that he rose from the dead, and that his death and resurrection offer the possibility of eternal life.\"  Brief for Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 7 (Brief for Amici Christian and Jewish Organizations).  Precisely because the cross symbolizes these sectarian beliefs, it is a common marker for the graves of Christian soldiers.  For the same reason, using the cross as a war memorial does not transform it into a secular symbol, as the Courts of Appeals have uniformly recognized.  See infra, at 10-11, n.\u00a010.  Just as a Star of David is not suitable to honor Christians who died serving their country, so a cross is not suitable to honor those of other faiths who died defending their nation.

Adoption of these complementary provisions followed centuries of \"turmoil, civil strife, and persecutio[n], generated in large part by established sects determined to maintain their absolute political and religious supremacy.\"  Id, at 8-9.

Correspondingly, \"the indirect coercive pressure upon religious minorities to conform to the prevailing officially approved religion is plain.\"  Engel, 370 U.\u00a0S., at 431.  And by demanding neutrality between religious faith and the absence thereof, the Establishment Clause shores up an individual's \"right to select any religious faith or none at all.\"  Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.\u00a0S. 38, 53 (1985).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In cases challenging the government's display of a religious symbol, the Court has tested fidelity to the principle of neutrality by asking whether the display has the \"effect of 'endorsing' religion.\"  County of Allegheny, 492 U.\u00a0S., at 592.  The display fails this requirement if it objectively \"convey[s] a message that religion or a particular religious belief is favored or preferred.\"  Id., at 593 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted).3  To make that determination, a court must consider \"the pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the symbol and its placement.\"  Buono, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 721 (plurality opinion); id.,  at 750-751 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (quoting plurality opinion).4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I see it, when a cross is displayed on public property, the government may be presumed to endorse its religious content.  The venue is surely associated with the State; the symbol and its meaning are just as surely associated exclusively with Christianity.  \"It certainly is not common for property owners to open up their property [to] monuments that convey a message with which they do not wish to be associated.\"  Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.\u00a0S. 460, 471 (2009).  To non-Christians, nearly 30% of the population of the United States, Pew Research Center, America's Changing Religious Landscape 4 (2015), the State's choice to display the cross on public buildings or spaces conveys a message of exclusion: It tells them they \"are outsiders, not full members of the political community,\" County of Allegheny, 492 U.\u00a0S., at 625 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Cf. Van Orden, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 708 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\"The adornment of our public spaces with displays of religious symbols\" risks \"\u00a0'offend[ing] nonmembers of the faith being advertised as well as adherents who consider the particular advertisement disrespectful.'\u00a0\" (quoting County of Allegheny, 492 U.\u00a0S., at 651 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part))).5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A presumption of endorsement, of course, may be overcome.  See Buono, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 718 (plurality opinion) (\"The goal of avoiding governmental endorsement does not require eradication of all religious symbols in the public realm.\").  A display does not run afoul of the neutrality principle if its \"setting .\u00a0.\u00a0. plausibly indicates\" that the government has not sought \"either to adopt [a] religious message or to urge its acceptance by others.\"  Van Orden, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 737 (Souter, J., dissenting).  The \"typical museum setting,\" for example, \"though not neutralizing the religious content of a religious painting, negates any message of endorsement of that content.\"  Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.\u00a0S. 668, 692 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring).  Similarly, when a public school history teacher discusses the Protestant Reformation, the setting makes clear that the teacher's purpose is to educate, not to proselytize.  The Peace Cross, however, is not of that genre.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"For nearly two millennia,\" the Latin cross has been the \"defining symbol\" of Christianity, R. Jensen, The Cross: History, Art, and Controversy ix (2017), evoking the foundational claims of that faith.  Christianity teaches that Jesus Christ was \"a divine Savior\" who \"illuminate[d] a path toward salvation and redemption.\"  Lynch, 465 U.\u00a0S., at 708 (Brennan, J., dissenting).  Central to the religion are the beliefs that \"the son of God,\" Jesus Christ, \"died on the cross,\" that \"he rose from the dead,\" and that \"his death and resurrection offer the possibility of eternal life.\"  Brief for Amici Christian and Jewish Organizations 7.6  \"From its earliest times,\" Christianity was known as \"religio crucis--the religion of the cross.\"  R. Viladesau, The Beauty of the Cross: The Passion of Christ in Theology and the Arts, From the Catacombs to the Eve of the Renaissance 7 (2006).  Christians wear crosses, not as an ecumenical symbol, but to proclaim their adherence to Christianity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An exclusively Christian symbol, the Latin cross is not emblematic of any other faith.  Buono, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 747 (Stevens, J., dissenting); Viladesau, supra, at 7 (\"[T]he cross and its meaning .\u00a0.\u00a0. set Christianity apart from other world religions.\").7  The principal symbol of Christianity around the world should not loom over public thoroughfares, suggesting official recognition of that religion's paramountcy.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission urges in defense of its monument that the Latin cross \"is not merely a reaffirmation of Christian beliefs\"; rather, \"when used in the context of a war memorial,\" the cross becomes \"a universal symbol of the sacrifices of those who fought and died.\"  Brief for Petitioner Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission 34-35 (Brief for Planning Commission) (internal quotation marks omitted).  See also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25 (The Latin cross is \"a Christian symbol .\u00a0.\u00a0. [b]ut it is also 'a symbol often used to honor and respect [soldiers'] heroic acts.'\u00a0\" (quoting Buono, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 721 (plurality opinion); some internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission's \"[a]ttempts to secularize what is unquestionably a sacred [symbol] defy credibility and disserve people of faith.\"  Van Orden, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 717 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  See, e.g., Brief for Amici Christian and Jewish Organizations 7 (\"For Christians who think seriously about the events and message that the cross represents, [the Commission's] claims are deeply offensive.\").  The asserted commemorative meaning of the cross rests on--and is inseparable from--its Christian meaning: \"the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the redeeming benefits of his passion and death,\" specifically, \"the salvation of man.\"  American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois v. St. Charles, 794 F.\u00a02d 265, 273 (CA7 1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because of its sacred meaning, the Latin cross has been used to mark Christian deaths since at least the fourth century.  See Jensen, supra, at 68-69.  The cross on a grave \"says that a Christian is buried here,\" Brief for Amici Christian and Jewish Organizations 8, and \"commemorates [that person's death] by evoking a conception of salvation and eternal life reserved for Christians,\" Brief for Amicus Jewish War Veterans 7.  As a commemorative symbol, the Latin cross simply \"makes no sense apart from the crucifixion, the resurrection, and Christianity's promise of eternal life.\"  Brief for Amici Christian and Jewish Organizations 8.8\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The cross affirms that, thanks to the soldier's embrace of Christianity, he will be rewarded with eternal life.  Id., at 8-9.  \"To say that the cross honors the Christian war dead does not identify a secular meaning of the cross; it merely identifies a common application of the religious meaning.\"  Id., at 8.  Scarcely \"a universal symbol of sacrifice,\" the cross is \"the symbol of one particular sacrifice.\"  Buono, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 748, n.\u00a08 (Stevens, J., dissenting).9\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every Court of Appeals to confront the question has held that \"[m]aking a .\u00a0.\u00a0. Latin cross a war memorial does not make the cross secular,\" it \"makes the war memorial sectarian.\"  Id., at 747.10  See also Separation of Church and State Comm. v. Eugene, 93 F. 3d 617, 626 (CA9 1996) (O'Scannlain, J., concurring in result) (\"[T]he City's use of a cross to memorialize the war dead may lead observers to believe that the City has chosen to honor only Christian veterans.\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Peace Cross is no exception.  That was evident from the start.  At the dedication ceremony, the keynote speaker analogized the sacrifice of the honored soldiers to that of Jesus Christ, calling the Peace Cross \"symbolic of Calvary,\" App. 449, where Jesus was crucified.  Local reporters variously described the monument as \"[a] mammoth cross, a likeness of the Cross of Calvary, as described in the Bible,\" id., at 428; \"a monster [C]alvary cross,\" id., at 431; and \"a huge sacrifice cross,\" id., at 439.  The character of the monument has not changed with the passage of time.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commission nonetheless urges that the Latin cross is a \"well-established\" secular symbol commemorating, in particular, \"military valor and sacrifice [in] World War I.\"  Brief for Planning Commission 21.  Calling up images of United States cemeteries overseas showing row upon row of cross-shaped gravemarkers, id., at 4-8; see ante, at 4-5, 21-22; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26, the Commission overlooks this reality: The cross was never perceived as an appropriate headstone or memorial  for Jewish soldiers and others who did not adhere to Christianity.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A page of history is worth retelling.  On November 11, 1918, the Great War ended.  Bereaved families of American soldiers killed in the war sought to locate the bodies of their loved ones, and then to decide what to do with their remains.  Once a soldier's body was identified, families could choose to have the remains repatriated to the United States or buried overseas in one of several American military cemeteries, yet to be established.  Eventually, the remains of 46,000 soldiers were repatriated, and those of 30,000 soldiers were laid to rest in Europe.  American Battle Monuments Commission, Annual Report to the President of the United States Fiscal Year 1925, p. 5 (1926) (ABMC Report).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While overseas cemeteries were under development, the graves of American soldiers in Europe were identified by one of two temporary wooden markers painted white.  Christian soldiers were buried beneath the cross; the graves of Jewish soldiers were marked by the Star of David.  See L. Budreau, Bodies of War: World War I and the Politics of Commemoration in America, 1919-1933, p. 120 (2010).  The remains of soldiers who were neither Christian nor Jewish could be repatriated to the United States for burial under an appropriate headstone.11\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the War Department began preparing designs for permanent headstones in 1919, \"no topic managed to stir more controversy than the use of religious symbolism.\"  Id., at 121-122.  Everyone involved in the dispute, however, saw the Latin cross as a Christian symbol, not as a universal or secular one.  To achieve uniformity, the War Department initially recommended replacing the temporary sectarian markers with plain marble slabs resembling \"those designed for the national cemeteries in the United States.\"  Van Duyne, Erection of Permanent  Headstones in the American Military Cemeteries in  Europe, The Quartermaster Review (1930) (Quartermaster Report).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The War Department's recommendation angered prominent civil organizations, including the American Legion and the Gold Star associations: the United States, they urged, ought to retain both the cross and Star of David.  See ibid.; Budreau, supra, at 123.  In supporting sectarian markers, these groups were joined by the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC), a newly created independent agency charged with supervising the establishment of overseas cemeteries.  ABMC Report 57.  Congress weighed in by directing the War Department to erect headstones \"of such design and material as may be agreed upon by the Secretary of War and the American Battle Monuments Commission.\"  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  In 1924, the War Department approved the ABMC's \"designs for a Cross and Star of David.\"  Quartermaster Report; ABMC Report 57.12\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Throughout the headstone debate, no one doubted that the Latin cross and the Star of David were sectarian gravemarkers, and therefore appropriate only for soldiers who adhered to those faiths.  A committee convened by the War Department composed of representatives from \"seven prominent war-time organizations\" as well as \"religious bodies, Protestant, Jewish, [and] Catholic\" agreed \"unanimous[ly] .\u00a0.\u00a0. that marble crosses be placed on the graves of all Christian American dead buried abroad, and that the graves of the Jewish American dead be marked by the six-pointed star.\"  Durable Markers in the Form of Crosses for Graves of American Soldiers in Europe, Hearings before the Committee on Military Affairs of the House of Representatives, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 24 (1924) (emphasis added).  The Executive Director of the Jewish Welfare Board stated that \"if any religious symbol is erected over the graves, then Judaism should have its symbol over the graves of its dead.\"  Id., at 19.  Others expressing views described the Latin cross as the appropriate symbol to \"mar[k] the graves of the Christian heroes of the American forces.\"  Id., at 24 (emphasis added).  As stated by the National Catholic War Council, \"the sentiment and desires of all Americans, Christians and Jews alike, are one\": \"They who served us in life should be honored, as they would have wished, in death.\"  Ibid.13\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Far more crosses than Stars of David, as one would expect, line the grounds of American cemeteries overseas, for Jews composed only 3% of the United States population in 1917.  J. Fredman & L. Falk, Jews in American Wars 100 (5th ed. 1954).  Jews accounted for nearly 6% of U.\u00a0S. forces in World War I (in numbers, 250,000), and 3,500 Jewish soldiers died in that war.  Ibid.  Even in Flanders Field, with its \"\u00a0'crosses, row on row,'\u00a0\" ante, at 5 (quoting J. McCrae, In Flanders Fields, In Flanders Fields and Other Poems 3 (G. P. Putnam's Sons ed. 1919)), \"Stars of David mark the graves of [eight American soldiers] of Jewish faith,\" American Battle Monuments Commission, Flanders Field American Cemetery and Memorial Visitor Booklet 11.14\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reiterating its argument that the Latin cross is a \"universal symbol\" of World War I sacrifice, the Commission states that \"40 World War I monuments .\u00a0.\u00a0. built in the United States .\u00a0.\u00a0. bear the shape of a cross.\"  Brief for Planning Commission 8 (citing App. 1130).  This figure includes memorials that merely \"incorporat[e]\" a cross.  App. 1130.15  Moreover, the 40 monuments compose only 4% of the \"948 outdoor sculptures commemorating the First World War.\"  Ibid.  The Court lists just seven freestanding cross memorials, ante, at 6, n.\u00a010, less than 1% of the total number of monuments to World War I in the United States, see App. 1130.  Cross memorials, in short, are outliers.  The overwhelming majority of World War I memorials contain no Latin cross.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In fact, the \"most popular and enduring memorial of the [post-World War I] decade\" was \"[t]he mass-produced Spirit of the American Doughboy statue.\"  Budreau, Bodies of War, at 139.  That statue, depicting a U.\u00a0S. infantryman, \"met with widespread approval throughout American communities.\"  Ibid.  Indeed, the first memorial to World War I erected in Prince George's County \"depict[s] a doughboy.\"  App. 110-111.  The Peace Cross, as Plaintiffs' expert historian observed, was an \"aberration .\u00a0.\u00a0. even in the era [in which] it was built and dedicated.\"  Id., at 123.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like cities and towns across the country, the United States military comprehended the importance of \"pay[ing] equal respect to all members of the Armed Forces who perished in the service of our country,\" Buono, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 759 (Stevens, J., dissenting), and therefore avoided incorporating the Latin cross into memorials.  The construction of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is illustrative.  When a proposal to place a cross on the Tomb was advanced, the Jewish Welfare Board objected; no cross appears on the Tomb.  See App. 167.  In sum, \"[t]here is simply 'no evidence .\u00a0.\u00a0. that the cross has been widely embraced by'--or even applied to--'non-Christians as a secular symbol of death' or of sacrifice in military service\" in World War I or otherwise.  Trunk v. San Diego, 629 F. 3d 1099, 1116 (CA9 2011).\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Holding the Commission's display of the Peace Cross unconstitutional would not, as the Commission fears, \"inevitably require the destruction of other cross-shaped memorials throughout the country.\"  Brief for Planning Commission 52.  When a religious symbol appears in a public cemetery--on a headstone, or as the headstone itself, or perhaps integrated into a larger memorial--the setting counters the inference that the government seeks \"either to adopt the religious message or to urge its acceptance by others.\"  Van Orden, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 737 (Souter, J., dissenting).  In a cemetery, the \"privately selected religious symbols on individual graves are best understood as the private speech of each veteran.\"  Laycock, Government-Sponsored Religious Displays: Transparent Rationalizations and Expedient Post-Modernism, 61 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 1211, 1242 (2011).  See also Summum, 555 U.\u00a0S., at 487 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment) (\"[T]here are circumstances in which government maintenance of monuments does not look like government speech at all.  Sectarian identifications on markers in Arlington Cemetery come to mind.\").  Such displays are \"linked to, and sho[w] respect for, the individual honoree's faith and beliefs.\"  Buono, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 749, n. 8 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  They do not suggest governmental endorsement of those faith and beliefs.16\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recognizing that a Latin cross does not belong on a public highway or building does not mean the monument must be \"torn down.\"  Ante, at 2 (Breyer, J., concurring); ante, at 1 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in judgment).17  \"[L]ike the determination of the violation itself,\" the \"proper remedy .\u00a0.\u00a0. is necessarily context specific.\"  Buono, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 755, n.\u00a011 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  In some instances, the violation may be cured by relocating the monument to private land or by transferring ownership of the land and monument to a private party.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1790, President Washington visited Newport, Rhode Island, \"a longtime bastion of religious liberty and the home of one of the first communities of American Jews.\"  Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.\u00a0S. 565, 636 (2014) (Kagan, J., dissenting).  In a letter thanking the congregation for its warm welcome, Washington praised \"[t]he citizens of the United States of America\" for \"giv[ing] to mankind .\u00a0.\u00a0. a policy worthy of imitation\": \"All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship.\"  Letter to Newport Hebrew Congregation (Aug. 18, 1790), in 6 Papers of George Washington 284, 285 (D. Twohig ed. 1996).  As Washington and his contemporaries were aware, \"some of them from bitter personal experience,\" Engel, 370 U.\u00a0S., at 429, religion is \"too personal, too sacred, too holy, to permit its 'unhallowed perversion' by a civil magistrate,\" id., at 432 (quoting Memorial and Remonstrance).  The Establishment Clause, which preserves the integrity of both church and state, guarantees that \"however .\u00a0.\u00a0. individuals worship, they will count as full and equal American citizens.\"  Town of Greece, 572 U.\u00a0S., at 615 (Kagan, J., dissenting).  \"If the aim of the Establishment Clause is genuinely to uncouple government from church,\" the Clause does \"not permit .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0a display of th[e] character\" of Bladensburg's Peace Cross.

J. Fredman & L. Falk, Jews in American Wars 100 (5th ed. 1954).  In the congressional hearings involving the appropriate grave markers for those buried abroad, one Representative stated that approximately 1,600 of these Jewish soldiers were buried in overseas graves marked by Stars of David. See Hearings before the Committee on Military Affairs, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1924).  That would constitute about 5.2% of the 30,973 graves in American World War I cemeteries abroad.

Airy World War Memorial in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and the Great War for Democracy Memorial in Waterbury, Connecticut.\nFootnote 11\u00a0There is some ambiguity as to whether the American Legion ever owned the land on which the Cross rests.  When the Legion took over the Cross, the town of Bladensburg passed a resolution \"assign[ing] and grant[ing] to the said Snyder-Farmer Post #3, American Legion, that parcel of ground upon which the cross now stands and that part necessary to complete .\u00a0.\u00a0. the park around said cross, to the perpetual care of the Snyder-Farmer Post #3 as long as it is in existence, and should the said Post go out of existence the plot to revert to the Town of Bladensburg, together with the cross and its surroundings.\"  App. 65.  In 1935, a statute authorized the State Roads Commission of Maryland to \"investigate the ownership and possessory rights\" of the tract surrounding the Cross and to \"acquire the same by purchase or condemnation.\"  Id., at 421.  It appears that in 1957, a court determined that it was necessary for the State to condemn the property.  Id., at 1377-1379.  The State Roads Commission thereafter conveyed the property to the Commission in 1960.  Id., at 1380, 1382.  To resolve any ambiguities, in 1961, the local American Legion post \"transfer[ed] and assign[ed] to [the Commission] all its right, title and interest in and to the Peace Cross, also originally known as the Memorial Cross, and the tract upon which it is located.\"  Id., at 1387.  At least by 1961, then, both the land and the Cross were publicly owned.\nFootnote 12\u00a0Of the budgeted $100,000, the Commission had spent only $5,000 as of 2015.

Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.\u00a0S. 1 (1947), most can be divided into six rough categories: (1) religious references or imagery in public monuments, symbols, mottos, displays, and ceremonies, e.g., Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.\u00a0S. 668 (1984); Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.\u00a0S. 677 (2005); (2) religious accommodations and exemptions from generally applicable laws, e.g., Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.\u00a0S. 709 (2005); Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.\u00a0S. 327 (1987); (3) subsidies and tax exemptions, e.g., Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U.\u00a0S. 664 (1970); Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.\u00a0S. 639 (2002); (4) religious expression in public schools, e.g., School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.\u00a0S. 203 (1963); Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.\u00a0S. 577 (1992); (5) regulation of private religious speech, e.g., Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U.\u00a0S. 753 (1995); and (6) state interference with internal church affairs, e.g., Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, 565 U.\u00a0S. 171 (2012).  A final, miscellaneous category, including cases involving such issues as Sunday closing laws, see McGowan, v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420 (1961), and church involvement in governmental decisionmaking, see Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U. S. 116 (1982); Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet,  512 U.

Any such cases must be analyzed under the relevant Establishment Clause principles and precedents.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0In my view, the original meaning of the phrase \"Congress shall make no law\" is a question worth exploring.  Compare G. Lawson & G. Seidman, The Constitution of Empire 42 (2004) (arguing that the First Amendment \"applies only to Congress\"), with Shrum v. Coweta, 449 F.\u00a03d 1132, 1140-1143 (CA10 2006) (McConnell, J.) (arguing that it is not so limited).  \nFootnote 2\u00a0Of course, cases involving state or local action are not strictly speaking Establishment Clause cases, but instead Fourteenth Amendment cases about a privilege or immunity of citizenship.  It is conceivable that the salient characteristics of an establishment changed by the time of the Fourteenth Amendment, see Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.\u00a0S. 565, 607, 609-610 (2014) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), but respondents have presented no evidence suggesting so.\nFootnote 3\u00a0Another reason to avoid a constitutional test that turns on the \"sectarian\" nature of religious speech is that the Court has suggested \"formally dispens[ing]\" with this factor in related contexts.  Mitchell, 530 U.\u00a0S., at 826 (plurality opinion).  Among other reasons, the \"sectarian\" test \"has a shameful pedigree\" that originated during the 1870s when Congress considered the Blaine Amendment, \"which would have amended the Constitution to bar any aid to sectarian institutions.\"  Id., at 828.  \"Consideration of the amendment arose at a time of pervasive hostility to the Catholic Church and to Catholics in general, and it was an open secret that 'sectarian' was code for 'Catholic.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  This anti-Catholic hostility may well have played a role in the Court's later decisions.  Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.\u00a0S. 1 (1947), for example, was written by Justice Black, who would later accuse Catholics who advocated for textbook loans to religious schools of being \"powerful sectarian religious propagandists .\u00a0.\u00a0. looking toward complete domination and supremacy of their particular brand of religion.\"  Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U.\u00a0S. 236, 251 (1968) (Black, J., dissenting).  Even by the time of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.\u00a0S. 602 (1971), some Justices were still \"influenced by residual anti-Catholicism and by a deep suspicion of Catholic schools.\"  Laycock, The Underlying Unity of Separation and Neutrality, 46 Emory L.\u00a0J. 43, 58 (1997).  Indeed, the Court's opinion in Lemon \"relied on what it considered to be inherent risks in religious schools despite the absence of a record in Lemon itself and despite contrary fact-finding by the district court in the companion case.\"  Laycock, supra, at 58 (footnote omitted); see generally W. Ball, Mere Creatures of the State?, 35-40 (1994).  And in his concurring opinion, Justice Douglas (joined by Justice Black) repeatedly quoted an anti-Catholic book, including for the proposition that, in Catholic parochial schools, \"\u00a0'[t]he whole education of the child is filled with propaganda.'\u00a0\"  403 U.\u00a0S., at 635, n.\u00a020 (quoting L. Boettner, Roman Catholicism 360 (1962)); see 403 U.\u00a0S., at 636 (similar).  The tract said that Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin learned the \"secret[s] of [their] success\" in indoctrination from the Catholic Church, and that \"an undue proportion of the gangsters, racketeers, thieves, and juvenile delinquents who roam our big city streets come .\u00a0.\u00a0. from the [Catholic] parochial schools,\" where children are taught by \"brain-washed,\" \"\u00a0'ignorant European peasants.'\u00a0\"  Boettner, supra, at 363, 370-372.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0A photograph of the monument and a map showing its location are reproduced in the Appendix, infra, at 19.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Some of my colleagues suggest that the Court's new presumption extends to all governmental displays and practices, regardless of their age.  See ante, at 3 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring); ante, at 6 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); ante, at 9 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in judgment).  But see ante, at 2 (Breyer, J., joined by Kagan, J., concurring) (\"\u00a0'[A] more contemporary state effort' to put up a religious display is 'likely to prove divisive in a way that [a] longstanding, pre-existing monument [would] not.'\u00a0\").  I read the Court's opinion to mean what it says: \"[R]etaining established, religiously expressive monuments, symbols, and practices is quite different from erecting or adopting new ones,\" ante, at 21, and, consequently, only \"longstanding monuments, symbols, and practices\" enjoy \"a presumption of constitutionality,\" id., at 16 (plurality opinion).\nFootnote 3\u00a0Justice Gorsuch's \"no standing\" opinion is startling in view of the many religious-display cases this Court has resolved on the merits.  E.g., McCreary County, 545 U.\u00a0S. 844; Van Orden, 545 U.\u00a0S. 677; Stone v. Graham, 449 U.\u00a0S. 39 (1980) (per curiam).  And, if Justice Gorsuch is right, three Members of the Court were out of line when they recognized that \"[t]he [Establishment] Clause forbids a city to permit the permanent erection of a large Latin cross on the roof of city hall,\" Buono, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 715 (opinion of Kennedy, J., joined by Roberts, C.J., and Alito, J.) (quoting County of Allegheny, 492 U.\u00a0S., at 661 (second alteration in original), for no one, according to Justice Gorsuch, should be heard to complain about such a thing.  But see Brief for Law Professors as Amici Curiae (explaining why offended observer standing is necessary and proper).\nFootnote 4\u00a0This inquiry has been described by some Members of the Court as the \"reasonable observer\" standard.  See, e.g., Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 806 (1995) (Stevens, J., dissenting); County of Allegheny, 492 U.\u00a0S., at 630-631 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\nFootnote 5\u00a0See also Jews and Christians Discussion Group in the Central Committee of German Catholics, A Convent and Cross in Auschwitz, in The Continuing Agony: From the Carmelite Convent to the Crosses at Auschwitz 231-232 (A. Berger, H. Cargas, & S. Nowak eds. 2004) (\"We Christians must appreciate [that] [t]hroughout history many non-Christians, especially Jews, have experienced the Cross as a symbol of persecution, through the Crusades, the Inquisition and the compulsory baptisms.\").\nFootnote 6\u00a0Under \"one widespread reading of Christian scriptures,\" non-Christians are barred from eternal life and, instead, are condemned to hell.  Brief for Amici Christian and Jewish Organizations 2.  On this reading, the Latin cross symbolizes both the promise of salvation and the threat of damnation by \"divid[ing] the world between the saved and the damned.\"  Id., at 12.\nFootnote 7\u00a0Christianity comprises numerous denominations.  The term is here used to distinguish Christian sects from religions that do not embrace the defining tenets of Christianity.\nFootnote 8\u00a0The Court sets out familiar uses of the Greek cross, including the Red Cross and the Navy Cross, ante, at 3, 22, and maintains that, today, they carry no religious message.  But because the Latin cross has never shed its Christian character, its commemorative meaning is exclusive to Christians.  The Court recognizes as much in suggesting that the Peace Cross features the Latin cross for the same reason \"why Holocaust memorials invariably include Stars of David\": those sectarian \"symbols .\u00a0.\u00a0. signify what death meant for those who are memorialized.\"  Ante, at 30.\nFootnote 9\u00a0Christian soldiers have drawn parallels between their experiences in war and Jesus's suffering and sacrifice.  See, e.g., C. Dawson, Living Bayonets: A Record of the Last Push 19-20 (1919) (upon finding a crucifix strewn among rubble, a soldier serving in World War I wrote home that Jesus Christ \"seem[ed] so like ourselves in His lonely and unhallowed suffering\").  This comparison has been portrayed by artists, see, e.g., 7 Encyclopedia of Religion 4348 (2d ed. 2005) (painter George Rouault's 1926 Miserere series \"compares Christ's suffering with twentieth-century experiences of human sufferings in war\"), and documented by historians, see, e.g., R. Schweitzer, The Cross and the Trenches: Religious Faith and Doubt Among British and American Great War Soldiers 28-29 (2003) (given the horrors of trench warfare, \"[t]he parallels that soldiers saw between their suffering and Christ's make their identification with Jesus both understandable and revealing\"); Lemay, Politics in the Art of War: The American War Cemeteries, 38 Int'l J.

Davenport, 637 F.\u00a03d 1095, 1122 (CA10 2010) (\"[A] memorial cross is not a generic symbol of death; it is a Christian symbol of death that signifies or memorializes the death of a Christian.\"); Trunk v.

See, e.g., Robinson v. Edmond, 68 F.\u00a03d 1226, 1232 (CA10 1995) (city seal depicting the cross) (\"The religious significance and meaning of the Latin or Christian cross are unmistakable.\"); Carpenter v.

The ABMC later decided that \"all unidentified graves would be marked with a [c]ross.\"  Id., at 164, n. 21.

PEPPER ET AL.(2019)\nNo. 17-204\nArgued: November 26, 2018Decided: May 13, 2019\n\n\nApple Inc. sells iPhone applications, or apps, directly to iPhone owners through its App Store--the only place where iPhone owners may lawfully buy apps.  Most of those apps are created by independent developers under contracts with Apple.  Apple charges the developers a $99 annual membership fee, allows them to set the retail price of the apps, and charges a 30% commission on every app sale.  Respondents, four iPhone owners, sued Apple, alleging that the company has unlawfully monopolized the aftermarket for iPhone apps.  Apple moved to dismiss, arguing that the iPhone owners could not sue because they were not direct purchasers from Apple under Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.\u00a0S. 720.  The District Court agreed, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that the iPhone owners were direct purchasers because they purchased apps directly from Apple.\nHeld: Under Illinois Brick, the iPhone owners were direct purchasers who may sue Apple for alleged monopolization.  Pp.\u00a04-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0This straightforward conclusion follows from the text of the antitrust laws and from this Court's precedent.  Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides that \"any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue.\"  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a715(a).  That broad text readily covers consumers who purchase goods or services at higher-than-competitive prices from an allegedly monopolistic retailer.  Applying \u00a74, this Court has consistently stated that \"the immediate buyers from the alleged antitrust violators\" may maintain a suit against the antitrust violators, Kansas v. UtiliCorp United Inc., 497 U.\u00a0S. 199, 207, but has ruled that indirect purchasers who are two or more steps removed from the violator in a distribution chain may not sue.  Unlike the consumer in Illinois Brick, the iPhone owners here are not consumers at the bottom of a vertical distribution chain who are attempting to sue manufacturers at the top of the chain.  The absence of an intermediary in the distribution chain between Apple and the consumer is dispositive.  Pp.\u00a04-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Apple argues that Illinois Brick allows consumers to sue only the party who sets the retail price, whether or not the party sells the good or service directly to the complaining party.  But that theory suffers from three main problems.  First, it contradicts statutory text and precedent by requiring the Court to rewrite the rationale of Illinois Brick and to gut its longstanding bright-line rule.  Any ambiguity in Illinois Brick should be resolved in the direction of the statutory text, which states that \"any person\" injured by an antitrust violation may sue to recover damages.  Second, Apple's theory is not persuasive economically or legally.  It would draw an arbitrary and unprincipled line among retailers based on their financial arrangements with their manufacturers or suppliers.  And it would permit a consumer to sue a monopolistic retailer when the retailer set the retail price by marking up the price it had paid the manufacturer or supplier for the good or service but not when the manufacturer or supplier set the retail price and the retailer took a commission on each sale.  Third, Apple's theory would provide a roadmap for monopolistic retailers to structure transactions with manufacturers or suppliers so as to evade antitrust claims by consumers and thereby thwart effective antitrust enforcement.  Pp.\u00a07-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Contrary to Apple's argument, the three Illinois Brick rationales for adopting the direct-purchaser rule cut strongly in respondents' favor.  First, Apple posits that allowing only the upstream app developers--and not the downstream consumers--to sue Apple would mean more effective antitrust enforcement.  But that makes little sense, and it would directly contradict the longstanding goal of effective private enforcement and consumer protection in antitrust cases.  Second, Apple warns that calculating the damages in successful consumer antitrust suits against monopolistic retailers might be complicated.  But Illinois Brick is not a get-out-of-court-free card for monopolistic retailers to play any time that a damages calculation might be complicated.  Third, Apple claims that allowing consumers to sue will result in \"conflicting claims to a common fund--the amount of the alleged overcharge.\"  Illinois Brick, 431 U.\u00a0S., at 737.  But this is not a case where multiple parties at different levels of a distribution chain are trying to recover the same passed-through overcharge initially levied by the manufacturer at the top of the chain, cf. id., at 726-727.

ROBERT PEPPER, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\n[May 13, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2007, Apple started selling iPhones.  The next year, Apple launched the retail App Store, an electronic store where iPhone owners can purchase iPhone applications from Apple.  Those \"apps\" enable iPhone owners to send messages, take photos, watch videos, buy clothes, order food, arrange transportation, purchase concert tickets, donate to charities, and the list goes on.  \"There's an app for that\" has become part of the 21st-century American lexicon.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, however, several consumers contend that Apple charges too much for apps.  The consumers argue, in particular, that Apple has monopolized the retail market for the sale of apps and has unlawfully used its monopolistic power to charge consumers higher-than-competitive prices.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A claim that a monopolistic retailer (here, Apple) has used its monopoly to overcharge consumers is a classic antitrust claim.  But Apple asserts that the consumer-plaintiffs in this case may not sue Apple because they supposedly were not \"direct purchasers\" from Apple under our decision in Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.\u00a0S. 720, 745-746 (1977).  We disagree.  The plaintiffs purchased apps directly from Apple and therefore are direct purchasers under Illinois Brick.  At this early pleadings stage of the litigation, we do not assess the merits of the plaintiffs' antitrust claims against Apple, nor do we consider any other defenses Apple might have.  We merely hold that the Illinois Brick direct-purchaser rule does not bar these plaintiffs from suing Apple under the antitrust laws.  We affirm the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2007, Apple began selling iPhones.  In July 2008, Apple started the App Store.  The App Store now contains about 2 million apps that iPhone owners can download.  By contract and through technological limitations, the App Store is the only place where iPhone owners may lawfully buy apps.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the most part, Apple does not itself create apps.  Rather, independent app developers create apps.  Those independent app developers then contract with Apple to make the apps available to iPhone owners in the App Store.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Through the App Store, Apple sells the apps directly to iPhone owners.  To sell an app in the App Store, app developers must pay Apple a $99 annual membership fee.  Apple requires that the retail sales price end in $0.99, but otherwise allows the app developers to set the retail price.  Apple keeps 30 percent of the sales price, no matter what the sales price might be.  In other words, Apple pockets a 30 percent commission on every app sale.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2011, four iPhone owners sued Apple.  They allege that Apple has unlawfully monopolized \"the iPhone apps aftermarket.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a.  The plaintiffs allege that, via the App Store, Apple locks iPhone owners \"into buying apps only from Apple and paying Apple's 30% fee, even if\" the iPhone owners wish \"to buy apps elsewhere or pay less.\"  Id., at 45a.  According to the complaint, that 30 percent commission is \"pure profit\" for Apple and, in a competitive environment with other retailers, \"Apple would be under considerable pressure to substantially lower its 30% profit margin.\"  Id., at 54a-55a.  The plaintiffs allege that in a competitive market, they would be able to \"choose between Apple's high-priced App Store and less costly alternatives.\"  Id., at 55a.  And they allege that they have \"paid more for their iPhone apps than they would have paid in a competitive market.\"  Id., at 53a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apple moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the iPhone owners were not direct purchasers from Apple and therefore may not sue.  In Illinois Brick, this Court held that direct purchasers may sue antitrust violators, but also ruled that indirect purchasers may not sue. The District Court agreed with Apple and dismissed the complaint.  According to the District Court, the iPhone owners were not direct purchasers from Apple because the app developers, not Apple, set the consumers' purchase price.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit reversed.  The Ninth Circuit concluded that the iPhone owners were direct purchasers under Illinois Brick because the iPhone owners purchased apps directly from Apple.  According to the Ninth Circuit, Illinois Brick means that a consumer may not sue an alleged monopolist who is two or more steps removed from the consumer in a vertical distribution chain.  See In re Apple iPhone Antitrust Litig., 846 F.\u00a03d 313, 323 (2017).  Here, however, the consumers purchased directly from Apple, the alleged monopolist.  Therefore, the Ninth Circuit held that the iPhone owners could sue Apple for allegedly monopolizing the sale of iPhone apps and charging higher-than-competitive prices.  Id., at 324.  We granted certiorari.  585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plaintiffs' allegations boil down to one straightforward claim: that Apple exercises monopoly power in the retail market for the sale of apps and has unlawfully used its monopoly power to force iPhone owners to pay Apple higher-than-competitive prices for apps.  According to the plaintiffs, when iPhone owners want to purchase an app, they have only two options: (1) buy the app from Apple's App Store at a higher-than-competitive price or (2) do not buy the app at all.  Any iPhone owners who are dissatisfied with the selection of apps available in the App Store or with the price of the apps available in the App Store are out of luck, or so the plaintiffs allege.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sole question presented at this early stage of the case is whether these consumers are proper plaintiffs for this kind of antitrust suit--in particular, our precedents ask, whether the consumers were \"direct purchasers\" from Apple.  Illinois Brick, 431 U.\u00a0S., at 745-746.  It is undisputed that the iPhone owners bought the apps directly from Apple.  Therefore, under Illinois Brick, the iPhone owners were direct purchasers who may sue Apple for alleged monopolization.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That straightforward conclusion follows from the text of the antitrust laws and from our precedents.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First is text: Section 2 of the Sherman Act makes it unlawful for any person to \"monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations.\"  26 Stat. 209, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72.  Section 4 of the Clayton Act in turn provides that \"any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue .\u00a0.\u00a0. the defendant .\u00a0.\u00a0. and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.\"  38 Stat. 731, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a715(a) (emphasis added).  The broad text of \u00a74--\"any person\" who has been \"injured\" by an antitrust violator may sue--readily covers consumers who purchase goods or services at higher-than-competitive prices from an allegedly monopolistic retailer.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second is precedent: Applying \u00a74, we have consistently stated that \"the immediate buyers from the alleged antitrust violators\" may maintain a suit against the antitrust violators.  Kansas v. UtiliCorp United Inc., 497 U.\u00a0S. 199, 207 (1990); see also Illinois Brick, 431 U.\u00a0S., at 745-746.  At the same time, incorporating principles of proximate cause into \u00a74, we have ruled that indirect purchasers who are two or more steps removed from the violator in a distribution chain may not sue.  Our decision in Illinois Brick established a bright-line rule that authorizes suits by direct purchasers but bars suits by indirect purchasers.  Id., at 746.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The facts of Illinois Brick illustrate the rule.  Illinois Brick Company manufactured and distributed concrete blocks.  Illinois Brick sold the blocks primarily to masonry contractors, and those contractors in turn sold masonry structures to general contractors.  Those general contractors in turn sold their services for larger construction projects to the State of Illinois, the ultimate consumer of the blocks.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The consumer State of Illinois sued the manufacturer Illinois Brick.  The State alleged that Illinois Brick had engaged in a conspiracy to fix the price of concrete blocks.  According to the complaint, the State paid more for the concrete blocks than it would have paid absent the price-fixing conspiracy.  The monopoly overcharge allegedly flowed all the way down the distribution chain to the ultimate consumer, who was the State of Illinois.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court ruled that the State could not bring an antitrust action against Illinois Brick, the alleged violator, because the State had not purchased concrete blocks directly from Illinois Brick.  The proper plaintiff to bring that claim against Illinois Brick, the Court stated, would be an entity that had purchased directly from Illinois Brick.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The bright-line rule of Illinois Brick, as articulated in that case and as we reiterated in UtiliCorp, means that indirect purchasers who are two or more steps removed from the antitrust violator in a distribution chain may not sue.  By contrast, direct purchasers--that is, those who are \"the immediate buyers from the alleged antitrust violators\"--may sue.  UtiliCorp, 497 U.\u00a0S., at 207.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, if manufacturer A sells to retailer B, and retailer B sells to consumer C, then C may not sue A.  But B may sue A if A is an antitrust violator.  And C may sue B if B is an antitrust violator.  That is the straightforward rule of Illinois Brick.  See Loeb Industries, Inc. v. Sumi- tomo Corp., 306 F.\u00a03d 469, 481-482 (CA7 2002) (Wood, J.).2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, unlike in Illinois Brick, the iPhone owners are not consumers at the bottom of a vertical distribution chain who are attempting to sue manufacturers at the top of the chain.  There is no intermediary in the distribution chain between Apple and the consumer.  The iPhone owners purchase apps directly from the retailer Apple, who is the alleged antitrust violator.  The iPhone owners pay the alleged overcharge directly to Apple.  The absence of an intermediary is dispositive.  Under Illinois Brick, the iPhone owners are direct purchasers from Apple and are proper plaintiffs to maintain this antitrust suit.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All of that seems simple enough.  But Apple argues strenuously against that seemingly simple conclusion, and we address its arguments carefully.  For this kind of retailer case, Apple's theory is that Illinois Brick allows consumers to sue only the party who sets the retail price, whether or not that party sells the good or service directly to the complaining party.  Apple says that its theory accords with the economics of the transaction.  Here, Apple argues that the app developers, not Apple, set the retail price charged to consumers, which according to Apple means that the consumers may not sue Apple.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We see three main problems with Apple's \"who sets the price\" theory.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, Apple's theory contradicts statutory text and precedent.  As we explained above, the text of \u00a74 broadly affords injured parties a right to sue under the antitrust laws.  And our precedent in Illinois Brick established a bright-line rule where direct purchasers such as the consumers here may sue antitrust violators from whom they purchased a good or service.  Illinois Brick, as we read the opinion, was not based on an economic theory about who set the price.  Rather, Illinois Brick sought to ensure an effective and efficient litigation scheme in antitrust cases.  To do so, the Court drew a bright line that allowed direct purchasers to sue but barred indirect purchasers from suing.  When there is no intermediary between the purchaser and the antitrust violator, the purchaser may sue.  The Illinois Brick bright-line rule is grounded on the \"belief that simplified administration improves antitrust enforcement.\"  2A P. Areeda, H. Hovenkamp, R. Blair, & C. Durrance, Antitrust Law \u00b6346e, p. 194 (4th ed. 2014) (Areeda & Hovenkamp).  Apple's theory would require us to rewrite the rationale of Illinois Brick and to gut the longstanding bright-line rule.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the extent that Illinois Brick leaves any ambiguity about whether a direct purchaser may sue an antitrust violator, we should resolve that ambiguity in the direction of the statutory text.  And under the text, direct purchasers from monopolistic retailers are proper plaintiffs to sue those retailers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, in addition to deviating from statutory text and precedent, Apple's proposed rule is not persuasive economically or legally.  Apple's effort to transform Illinois Brick from a direct-purchaser rule to a \"who sets the price\" rule would draw an arbitrary and unprincipled line among retailers based on retailers' financial arrangements with their manufacturers or suppliers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the retail context, the price charged by a retailer to a consumer is often a result (at least in part) of the price charged by the manufacturer or supplier to the retailer, or of negotiations between the manufacturer or supplier and the retailer.  Those agreements between manufacturer or supplier and retailer may take myriad forms, including for example a markup pricing model or a commission pricing model.  In a traditional markup pricing model, a hypothetical monopolistic retailer might pay $6 to the manufacturer and then sell the product for $10, keeping $4 for itself.  In a commission pricing model, the retailer might pay nothing to the manufacturer; agree with the manufacturer that the retailer will sell the product for $10 and keep 40 percent of the sales price; and then sell the product for $10, send $6 back to the manufacturer, and keep $4.  In those two different pricing scenarios, everything turns out to be economically the same for the manufacturer, retailer, and consumer.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet Apple's proposed rule would allow a consumer to sue the monopolistic retailer in the former situation but not the latter.  In other words, under Apple's rule a consumer could sue a monopolistic retailer when the retailer set the retail price by marking up the price it had paid the manufacturer or supplier for the good or service.  But a consumer could not sue a monopolistic retailer when the manufacturer or supplier set the retail price and the retailer took a commission on each sale.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apple's line-drawing does not make a lot of sense, other than as a way to gerrymander Apple out of this and similar lawsuits.  In particular, we fail to see why the form of the upstream arrangement between the manufacturer or supplier and the retailer should determine whether a monopolistic retailer can be sued by a downstream consumer who has purchased a good or service directly from the retailer and has paid a higher-than-competitive price because of the retailer's unlawful monopolistic conduct.  As the Court of Appeals aptly stated, \"the distinction between a markup and a commission is immaterial.\"  846 F.\u00a03d, at 324. A leading antitrust treatise likewise states: \"Denying standing because 'title' never passes to a broker is an overly lawyered approach that ignores the reality that a distribution system that relies on brokerage is economically indistinguishable from one that relies on purchaser-resellers.\"  2A Areeda & Hovenkamp \u00b6345, at 183.  If a retailer has engaged in unlawful monopolistic conduct that has caused consumers to pay higher-than-competitive prices, it does not matter how the retailer structured its relationship with an upstream manufacturer or supplier--whether, for example, the retailer employed a markup or kept a commission.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, if the monopolistic retailer's conduct has not caused the consumer to pay a higher-than-competitive price, then the plaintiff's damages will be zero.  Here, for example, if the competitive commission rate were 10 percent rather than 30 percent but Apple could prove that app developers in a 10 percent commission system would always set a higher price such that consumers would pay the same retail price regardless of whether Apple's commission was 10 percent or 30 percent, then the consumers' damages would presumably be zero.  But we cannot assume in all cases--as Apple would necessarily have us do--that a monopolistic retailer who keeps a commission does not ever cause the consumer to pay a higher-than-competitive price.  We find no persuasive legal or economic basis for such a blanket assertion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, we do not understand the relevance of the upstream market structure in deciding whether a downstream consumer may sue a monopolistic retailer.  Apple's rule would elevate form (what is the precise arrangement between manufacturers or suppliers and retailers?) over substance (is the consumer paying a higher price because of the monopolistic retailer's actions?).  If the retailer's unlawful monopolistic conduct caused a consumer to pay the retailer a higher-than-competitive price, the consumer is entitled to sue the retailer under the antitrust laws.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, if accepted, Apple's theory would provide a roadmap for monopolistic retailers to structure transactions with manufacturers or suppliers so as to evade antitrust claims by consumers and thereby thwart effective antitrust enforcement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider a traditional supplier-retailer relationship, in which the retailer purchases a product from the supplier and sells the product with a markup to consumers.  Under Apple's proposed rule, a retailer, instead of buying the product from the supplier, could arrange to sell the product for the supplier without purchasing it from the supplier.  In other words, rather than paying the supplier a certain price for the product and then marking up the price to sell the product to consumers, the retailer could collect the price of the product from consumers and remit only a fraction of that price to the supplier.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That restructuring would allow a monopolistic retailer to insulate itself from antitrust suits by consumers, even in situations where a monopolistic retailer is using its monopoly to charge higher-than-competitive prices to consumers.  We decline to green-light monopolistic retailers to exploit their market position in that way.  We refuse to rubber-stamp such a blatant evasion of statutory text and judicial precedent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, Apple's theory would disregard statutory text and precedent, create an unprincipled and economically senseless distinction among monopolistic retailers, and furnish monopolistic retailers with a how-to guide for evasion of the antitrust laws.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In arguing that the Court should transform the direct-purchaser rule into a \"who sets the price\" rule, Apple insists that the three reasons that the Court identified in Illinois Brick for adopting the direct-purchaser rule apply to this case--even though the consumers here (unlike in Illinois Brick) were direct purchasers from the alleged monopolist.  The Illinois Brick Court listed three reasons for barring indirect-purchaser suits: (1) facilitating more effective enforcement of antitrust laws; (2) avoiding complicated damages calculations; and (3) eliminating duplicative damages against antitrust defendants.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we said in UtiliCorp, however, the bright-line rule of Illinois Brick means that there is no reason to ask whether the rationales of Illinois Brick \"apply with equal force\" in every individual case.  497 U.\u00a0S., at 216. We should not engage in \"an unwarranted and counterproductive exercise to litigate a series of exceptions.\" Id., at 217.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But even if we engage with this argument, we conclude that the three Illinois Brick rationales--whether considered individually or together--cut strongly in the plaintiffs' favor here, not Apple's.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, Apple argues that barring the iPhone owners from suing Apple will better promote effective enforcement of the antitrust laws.  Apple posits that allowing only the upstream app developers--and not the downstream consumers--to sue Apple would mean more effective enforcement of the antitrust laws.  We do not agree.  Leaving consumers at the mercy of monopolistic retailers simply because upstream suppliers could also sue the retailers makes little sense and would directly contradict the longstanding goal of effective private enforcement and consumer protection in antitrust cases.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, Apple warns that calculating the damages in successful consumer antitrust suits against monopolistic retailers might be complicated.  It is true that it may be hard to determine what the retailer would have charged in a competitive market.  Expert testimony will often be necessary.  But that is hardly unusual in antitrust cases.  Illinois Brick is not a get-out-of-court-free card for monopolistic retailers to play any time that a damages calculation might be complicated.  Illinois Brick surely did not wipe out consumer antitrust suits against monopolistic retailers from whom the consumers purchased goods or services at higher-than-competitive prices.  Moreover, the damages calculation may be just as complicated in a retailer markup case as it is in a retailer commission case.  Yet Apple apparently accepts consumers suing monopolistic retailers in a retailer markup case.  If Apple accepts that kind of suit, then Apple should also accept consumers suing monopolistic retailers in a retailer commission case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, Apple claims that allowing consumers to sue will result in \"conflicting claims to a common fund--the amount of the alleged overcharge.\"  Illinois Brick, 431 U.\u00a0S., at 737.  Apple is incorrect.  This is not a case where multiple parties at different levels of a distribution chain are trying to all recover the same passed-through overcharge initially levied by the manufacturer at the top of the chain.  Cf. id., at 726-727; Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.\u00a0S. 481, 483-484 (1968). If the iPhone owners prevail, they will be entitled to the full amount of the unlawful overcharge that they paid to Apple.  The overcharge has not been passed on by anyone to anyone.  Unlike in Illinois Brick, there will be no need to \"trace the effect of the overcharge through each step in the distribution chain.\"  431 U.\u00a0S., at 741.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that Apple's alleged anticompetitive conduct may leave Apple subject to multiple suits by different plaintiffs.  But Illinois Brick did not purport to bar multiple liability that is unrelated to passing an overcharge down a chain of distribution. Basic antitrust law tells us that the \"mere fact that an antitrust violation produces two different classes of victims hardly entails that their injuries are duplicative of one another.\"  2A Areeda & Hovenkamp \u00b6339d, at 136.  Multiple suits are not atypical when the intermediary in a distribution chain is a bottleneck monopolist or monopsonist (or both) between the manufacturer on the one end and the consumer on the other end.  A retailer who is both a monopolist and a monopsonist may be liable to different classes of plaintiffs--both to downstream consumers and to upstream suppliers--when the retailer's unlawful conduct affects both the downstream and upstream markets.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, some downstream iPhone consumers have sued Apple on a monopoly theory.  And it could be that some upstream app developers will also sue Apple on a monopsony theory.  In this instance, the two suits would rely on fundamentally different theories of harm and would not assert dueling claims to a \"common fund,\" as that term was used in Illinois Brick.  The consumers seek damages based on the difference between the price they paid and the competitive price.  The app developers would seek lost profits that they could have earned in a competitive retail market.  Illinois Brick does not bar either category of suit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, the three Illinois Brick rationales do not persuade us to remake Illinois Brick and to bar direct-purchaser suits against monopolistic retailers who employ commissions rather than markups.  The plaintiffs seek to hold retailers to account if the retailers engage in unlawful anticompetitive conduct that harms consumers who purchase from those retailers.  That is why we have antitrust law.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ever since Congress overwhelmingly passed and President Benjamin Harrison signed the Sherman Act in 1890, \"protecting consumers from monopoly prices\" has been \"the central concern of antitrust.\"  2A Areeda & Hovenkamp \u00b6345, at 179.  The consumers here purchased apps directly from Apple, and they allege that Apple used its monopoly power over the retail apps market to charge higher-than-competitive prices.  Our decision in Illinois Brick does not bar the consumers from suing Apple for Apple's allegedly monopolistic conduct.  We affirm the judgment of the U.\u00a0S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nGorsuch, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-204\nAPPLE INC., PETITIONER v.

Illinois Brick held that these convoluted \"pass on\" theories of damages violate traditional principles of proximate causation and that the right plaintiff to bring suit is the one on whom the overcharge immediately and surely fell.  Yet today the Court lets a pass-on case proceed.  It does so by recasting Illinois Brick as a rule forbidding only suits where the plaintiff does not contract directly with the defendant.  This replaces a rule of proximate cause and economic reality with an easily manipulated and formalistic rule of contractual privity.  That's not how antitrust law is supposed to work, and it's an uncharitable way of treating a precedent which--whatever its flaws--is far more sensible than the rule the Court installs in its place.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To understand Illinois Brick, it helps to start with the case that paved the way for that decision: Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.\u00a0S. 481 (1968).  Hanover sued United, a company that supplied machinery Hanover used to make shoes.  Hanover alleged that  United's illegal monopoly in the shoe-making-machinery market had allowed it to charge supracompetitive prices.  As damages, Hanover sought to recover the amount it had overpaid United for machinery.  United replied that Hanover hadn't been damaged at all because, United asserted, Hanover had not absorbed the supposedly \"illegal overcharge\" but had \"passed the cost on to its customers\" by raising the prices it charged for shoes.  Id., at 487-488, and n.\u00a06.  This Court called United's argument a \"\u00a0'passing-on' defense\" because it suggested that a court should consider whether an antitrust plaintiff had \"passed on\" the defendant's overcharge to its own customers when assessing if and to what degree the plaintiff was injured by the defendant's anticompetitive conduct.  Id., at 488.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court rejected that defense.  While \u00a74 of the Clayton Act allows private suits for those injured by antitrust violations, we have long interpreted this language against the backdrop of the common law.  See, e.g., Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U.\u00a0S. 519, 529-531 (1983).  And under ancient rules of proximate causation, the \"\u00a0'general tendency of the law, in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step.'\u00a0\"  Hanover Shoe, 392 U.\u00a0S., at 490, n.\u00a08 (quoting Southern Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., 245 U.\u00a0S. 531, 533 (1918)).  In Hanover Shoe, the first step was United's overcharging of Hanover.  To proceed beyond that and inquire whether Hanover had passed on the overcharge to its customers, the Court held, would risk the sort of problems traditional principles of proximate cause were designed to avoid.  \"[N]early insuperable\" questions would follow about whether Hanover had the capacity and incentive to pass on to its customers in the shoe-making market United's alleged monopoly rent from the separate shoe-making-machinery market.  392 U.\u00a0S., at 493.  Resolving those questions would, in turn, necessitate a trial within a trial about Hanover's power and conduct in its own market, with the attendant risk that proceedings would become \"long and complicated\" and would \"involv[e] massive evidence and complicated theories.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Illinois Brick was just the other side of the coin.  With Hanover Shoe having held that an antitrust defendant could not rely on a pass-on theory to avoid damages, Illinois Brick addressed whether an antitrust plaintiff could rely on a pass-on theory to recover damages.  The State of Illinois had sued several manufacturers of concrete blocks, alleging that the defendants' price-fixing conspiracy had enabled them to overcharge building contractors, who in turn had passed on those charges to their customers, including the State.  Recognizing that Hanover Shoe had already prohibited antitrust violators from using a \"pass-on theory\" defensively, the Court declined to \"permit offensive use of a pass-on theory against an alleged violator that could not use the same theory as a defense.\"  431 U.\u00a0S., at 735.  \"Permitting the use of pass-on theories under \u00a74,\" the Court reasoned, would require determining how much of the manufacturer's monopoly rent was absorbed by intermediary building contractors and how much they were able and chose to pass on to their customers like the State.  Id., at 737.  Allowing pass-on theories would, as well, allow \"plaintiffs at each level in the distribution chain\" to \"assert conflicting claims to a common fund,\" which would require \"massive efforts to apportion the recovery among all potential plaintiffs that could have absorbed part of the overcharge--from direct purchasers to middlemen to ultimate consumers.\"  Ibid.  Better again, the Court decided, to adhere to traditional rules of proximate causation and allow only the first affected customers--the building contractors--to sue for the monopoly rents they had directly paid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is nothing surprising in any of this.  Unless Congress provides otherwise, this Court generally reads statutory causes of action as \"limited to plaintiffs whose injuries are proximately caused by violations of the statute.\"  Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.\u00a0S. 118, 132 (2014).  That proximate cause requirement typically bars suits for injuries that are \"derivative of misfortunes visited upon a third person by the defendant's acts.\"  Id., at 133 (internal quotation marks omitted).  So, for example, if a defendant's false advertising causes harm to one of its competitors, the competitor can sue the false advertiser under the Lanham Act.  But if the competitor is unable to pay its rent as a result, the competitor's landlord can't sue the false advertiser, because the landlord's harm derives from the harm to the competitor.  Id., at 134; see also, e.g., Bank of America Corp. v. Miami, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2017) (slip op., at 10-11); Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 346 (2005); Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 268-270 (1992).  This Court has long understood Illinois Brick as simply applying these traditional proximate cause principles in the antitrust context.  See Associated Gen. Contractors, 459 U. S., at 532-535, 544-545.1\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The lawsuit before us depends on just the sort of pass-on theory that Illinois Brick forbids.  The plaintiffs bought apps from third-party app developers (or manufacturers) in Apple's retail Internet App Store, at prices set by the developers.  The lawsuit alleges that Apple is a monopolist retailer and that the 30% commission it charges developers for the right to sell through its platform represents an anticompetitive price.  The problem is that the 30% commission falls initially on the developers.  So if the commission is in fact a monopolistic overcharge, the developers are the parties who are directly injured by it.  Plaintiffs can be injured only if the developers are able and choose to pass on the overcharge to them in the form of higher app prices that the developers alone control.  Plaintiffs admitted as much in the district court, where they described their theory of injury this way: \"[I]f Apple tells the developer .\u00a0.\u00a0. we're going to take this 30 percent commission .\u00a0.\u00a0. what's the developer going to do?  The developer is going to increase its price to cover Apple's .\u00a0.\u00a0. demanded profit.\"  App. 143.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because this is exactly the kind of \"pass-on theory\" Illinois Brick rejected, it should come as no surprise that the concerns animating that decision are also implicated.  Like other pass-on theories, plaintiffs' theory will necessitate a complex inquiry into how Apple's conduct affected third-party pricing decisions.  And it will raise difficult questions about apportionment of damages between app developers and their customers, along with the risk of duplicative damages awards.  If anything, plaintiffs' claims present these difficulties even more starkly than did the claims at issue in Illinois Brick.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider first the question of causation.  To determine if Apple's conduct damaged plaintiffs at all (and if so, the magnitude of their damages), a court will first have to explore whether and to what extent each individual app developer was able--and then opted--to pass on the 30% commission to its consumers in the form of higher app prices.  Sorting this out, if it can be done at all, will entail wrestling with \"\u00a0'complicated theories'\u00a0\" about \"how the relevant market variables would have behaved had there been no overcharge.\"  Illinois Brick, 431 U.\u00a0S., at 741-743.  Will the court hear testimony to determine the market power of each app developer, how each set its prices, and what it might have charged consumers for apps if Apple's commission had been lower?  Will the court also consider expert testimony analyzing how market factors might have influenced developers' capacity and willingness to pass on Apple's alleged monopoly overcharge?  And will the court then somehow extrapolate its findings to all of the tens of thousands of developers who sold apps through the App Store at different prices and times over the course of years?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This causation inquiry will be complicated further by Apple's requirement that all app prices end in $0.99.  As plaintiffs acknowledge, this rule has caused prices for the \"vast majority\" of apps to \"cluster\" at exactly $0.99.  Brief for Respondents 44.  And a developer charging $0.99 for its app can't raise its price by just enough to recover the 30-cent commission.  Instead, if the developer wants to pass on the commission to consumers, it has to more than double its price to $1.99 (doubling the commission in the process), which could significantly affect its sales.  In short, because Apple's 99-cent rule creates a strong disincentive for developers to raise their prices, it makes plaintiffs' pass-on theory of injury even harder to prove.  Yet the court will have to consider all of this when determining what damages, if any, plaintiffs suffered as a result of Apple's allegedly excessive 30% commission.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Plaintiffs' claims will also necessitate \"massive efforts to apportion the recovery among all potential plaintiffs that could have absorbed part of the overcharge,\" including both consumers and app developers.  Illinois Brick, 431 U.\u00a0S., at 737.  If, as plaintiffs contend, Apple's 30% commission is a monopolistic overcharge, then the app developers have a claim against Apple to recover whatever portion of the commission they did not pass on to consumers.  Before today, Hanover Shoe would have prevented Apple from reducing its liability to the developers by arguing that they had passed on the overcharge to consumers.  But the Court's holding that Illinois Brick doesn't govern this situation surely must mean Hanover Shoe doesn't either.  So courts will have to divvy up the commissions Apple collected between the developers and the consumers.  To do that, they'll have to figure out which party bore what portion of the overcharge in every purchase.  And if the developers bring suit separately from the consumers, Apple might be at risk of duplicative damages awards totaling more than the full amount it collected in commissions.  To avoid that possibility, it may turn out that the developers are necessary parties who will have to be joined in the plaintiffs' lawsuit.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\u00a019(a)(1)(B); Illinois Brick, 431 U.\u00a0S., at 739 (explaining that \"[t]hese absent potential claimants would seem to fit the classic definition of 'necessary parties,' for purposes of compulsory joinder\").3\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States and its antitrust regulators agree with all of this, so how does the Court reach such a different conclusion?  Seizing on Illinois Brick's use of the shorthand phrase \"direct purchasers\" to describe the parties immediately injured by the monopoly overcharge in that case, the Court (re)characterizes Illinois Brick as a rule that anyone who purchases goods directly from an alleged antitrust violator can sue, while anyone who doesn't, can't.  Under this revisionist version of Illinois Brick, the dispositive question becomes whether an \"intermediary in the distribution chain\" stands between the plaintiff and the defendant.  Ante, at 6.  And because the plaintiff app purchasers in this case happen to have purchased apps directly from Apple, the Court reasons, they may sue.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This exalts form over substance.  Instead of focusing on the traditional proximate cause question where the alleged overcharge is first (and thus surely) felt, the Court's test turns on who happens to be in privity of contract with whom.  But we've long recognized that antitrust law should look at \"the economic reality of the relevant transactions\" rather than \"formal conceptions of contract law.\"  United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., Inc., 393 U.\u00a0S. 199, 208 (1968).  And this case illustrates why.  To evade the Court's test, all Apple must do is amend its contracts.  Instead of collecting payments for apps sold in the App Store and remitting the balance (less its commission) to developers, Apple can simply specify that consumers' payments will flow the other way: directly to the developers, who will then remit commissions to Apple.  No antitrust reason exists to treat these contractual arrangements differently, and doing so will only induce firms to abandon their preferred--and presumably more efficient--distribution arrangements in favor of less efficient ones, all so they might avoid an arbitrary legal rule.  See Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.\u00a0S. 752, 763, 772-774 (1984) (rejecting an \"\u00a0'artificial distinction'\u00a0\" that \"serves no valid antitrust goals but merely deprives consumers and producers of the benefits\" of a particular business model).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor does Illinois Brick come close to endorsing such a blind formalism.  Yes, as the Court notes, the plaintiff in Illinois Brick did contract directly with an intermediary rather than with the putative antitrust violator.  But Illinois Brick's rejection of pass-on claims, and its explanation of the difficulties those claims present, had nothing to do with privity of contract.  Instead and as we have seen, its rule and reasoning grew from the \"general tendency of the law .\u00a0.\u00a0. not to go beyond\" the party that first felt the sting of the alleged overcharge, and from the complications that can arise when courts attempt to discern whether and to what degree damages were passed on to others.  Supra, at 2-3.  The Court today risks replacing a cogent rule about proximate cause with a pointless and easily evaded imposter.  We do not usually read our own precedents so uncharitably.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maybe the Court proceeds as it does today because it just disagrees with Illinois Brick.  After all, the Court not only displaces a sensible rule in favor of a senseless one; it also proceeds to question each of Illinois Brick's rationales--doubting that those directly injured are always the best plaintiffs to bring suit, that calculating damages for pass-on plaintiffs will often be unduly complicated, and that conflicting claims to a common fund justify limiting who may sue.  Ante, at 11-13.  The Court even tells us that any \"ambiguity\" about the permissibility of pass-on damages should be resolved \"in the direction of the statutory text,\" ante, at 8--ignoring that Illinois Brick followed the well-trodden path of construing the statutory text in light of background common law principles of proximate cause.  Last but not least, the Court suggests that the traditional understanding of Illinois Brick leads to \"arbitrary and unprincipled\" results.  Ante, at 8.  It asks us to consider two hypothetical scenarios that, it says, prove the point.  The first is a \"markup\" scenario in which a monopolistic retailer buys a product from a manufacturer for $6 and then decides to sell the product to a consumer for $10, applying a supracompetitive $4 markup.  The second is a \"commission\" scenario in which a manufacturer directs a monopolistic retailer to sell the manufacturer's product to a consumer for $10 and the retailer keeps a supracompetitive 40% commission, sending $6 back to the manufacturer.  The two scenarios are economically the same, the Court asserts, and forbidding recovery in the second for lack of proximate cause makes no sense.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But there is nothing arbitrary or unprincipled about Illinois Brick's rule or results.  The notion that the causal chain must stop somewhere is an ancient and venerable one.  As with most any rule of proximate cause, reasonable people can debate whether Illinois Brick drew exactly the right line in cutting off claims where it did.  But the line it drew is intelligible, principled, administrable, and far more reasonable than the Court's artificial rule of contractual privity.  Nor do the Court's hypotheticals come close to proving otherwise.  In the first scenario, the markup falls initially on the consumer, so there's no doubt that the retailer's anticompetitive conduct proximately caused the consumer's injury.  Meanwhile, in the second scenario the commission falls initially on the manufacturer, and the consumer won't feel the pain unless the manufacturer can and does recoup some or all of the elevated commission by raising its own prices.  In that situation, the manufacturer is the directly injured party, and the difficulty of disaggregating damages between those directly and indirectly harmed means that the consumer can't establish proximate cause under traditional principles.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some amici share the Court's skepticism of Illinois Brick.  They even urge us to overrule Illinois Brick, assuring us that \"modern economic techniques\" can now mitigate any problems that arise in allocating damages between those who suffer them directly and those who suffer them indirectly.  Brief for State of Texas et al. as Amici Curiae 25.  Maybe there is something to these arguments; maybe not.  But there's plenty of reason to decline any invitation to take even a small step away from Illinois Brick today.  The plaintiffs have not asked us to overrule our precedent--in fact, they've disavowed any such request.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 40.  So we lack the benefit of the adversarial process in a complex area involving a 40-year-old precedent and many hard questions.  For example, if we are really inclined to overrule Illinois Brick, doesn't that mean we must do the same to Hanover Shoe?  If the proximate cause line is no longer to be drawn at the first injured party, how far down the causal chain can a plaintiff be and still recoup damages?  Must all potential claimants to the single monopoly rent be gathered in a single lawsuit as necessary parties (and if not, why not)?  Without any invitation or reason to revisit our precedent, and with so many grounds for caution, I would have thought the proper course today would have been to afford Illinois Brick full effect, not to begin whittling it away to a bare formalism.  I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Illinois Brick held that the direct-purchaser requirement applies to claims for damages.  Illinois Brick did not address injunctive relief, and we likewise do not address injunctive relief in this case.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Thirty States and the District of Columbia filed an amicus brief supporting the plaintiffs, and they argue that C should be able to sue A in that hypothetical.  They ask us to overrule Illinois Brick to allow such suits.  In light of our ruling in favor of the plaintiffs in this case, we have no occasion to consider that argument for overruling Illinois Brick.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0For this reason, it's hard to make sense of the suggestion that Illinois Brick may not apply to claims for injunctive relief, ante, at 5, n.\u00a01.  Under our normal rule of construction, a plaintiff who's not proximately harmed by a defendant's unlawful conduct has no cause of action to sue the defendant for any type of relief.  Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.\u00a0S. 118, 135 (2014) (although a plaintiff that \"cannot quantify its losses with sufficient certainty to recover damages .\u00a0.\u00a0. may still be entitled to injunctive relief,\" the requirement of proximate causation \"must be met in every case\").\nFootnote 2\u00a0Plaintiffs haven't argued (and so have forfeited in this Court any argument) that Apple's imposition of the 99-cent rule was itself an antitrust violation that injured consumers by raising the price of apps above competitive levels.  They didn't mention the 99-cent rule in their complaint in district court or in their briefs to the court of appeals.  And, as I've noted, they concede that they are seeking damages \"based solely on\" the 30% commission.  Brief in Opposition 5.\nFootnote 3\u00a0The Court denies that allowing both consumers and developers to sue over the same allegedly unlawful commission will \"result in 'conflicting claims to a common fund'\u00a0\" as Illinois Brick feared.  Ante, at 12.  But Apple charged only one commission on each sale.  So even assuming for argument's sake that the 30% commission was entirely illegal, Apple can only be required to pay out in damages, at most, the full amount it received in commissions.  To their credit, even plaintiffs have conceded as much, acknowledging that because \"there is only one 30% markup,\" any claim by the developers against Apple would necessarily be seeking \"a piece of the same 30% pie.\"  Brief in Opposition 12.  It's a mystery why the Court refuses to accept that sensible concession.\n\n\n","5":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAZAR, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES v. ALLINA HEALTH SERVICES ET AL.(2019)\nNo. 17-1484\nArgued: January 15, 2019Decided: June 3, 2019\n\n\nThe Medicare program offers additional payments to institutions that serve a \"disproportionate number\" of low-income patients.  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71395ww(d)(5)(F)(i)(I).  These payments are calculated in part using what is called a hospital's \"Medicare fraction.\"  The fraction's denominator is the time the hospital spent caring for patients who were \"entitled to benefits under\" Medicare Part A, while the numerator is the time the hospital spent caring for Part-A-entitled patients who were also entitled to income support payments under the Social Security Act.  \u00a71395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I).  Congress created Medicare Part C in 1997, leading to the question whether Part C enrollees should be counted as \"entitled to benefits under\" Part A when calculating a hospital's Medicare fraction.  Respondents claim that, because Part C enrollees tend to be wealthier than Part A enrollees, counting them makes the fraction smaller and reduces hospitals' payments considerably.  In 2004, the agency overseeing Medicare issued a final rule declaring that it would count Part C patients, but that rule was later vacated after hospitals filed legal challenges.  In 2013, it issued a new rule prospectively readopting the policy of counting Part C patients.  In 2014, unable to rely on either the vacated 2004 rule or the prospective 2013 rule, the agency posted on its website the Medicare fractions for fiscal year 2012, noting that they included Part C patients.  A group of hospitals, respondents here, sued.  They claimed, among other things, that the government had violated the Medicare Act's requirement to provide public notice and a 60-day comment period for any \"rule, requirement, or other statement of policy . . . that establishes or changes a substantive legal standard governing . . . the payment for services,\" \u00a71395hh(a)(2).  The court of appeals ultimately sided with the hospitals.\nHeld:  Because the government has not identified a lawful excuse for neglecting its statutory notice-and-comment obligations, its policy must be vacated.  Pp.\u00a05-17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0This case turns on whether the government's 2014 announcement established or changed a \"substantive legal standard.\"  The government suggests the statute means to distinguish a substantive from an interpretive legal standard and thus tracks the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), under which \"substantive rules\" have the \"force and effect of law,\" while \"interpretive rules\" merely \"advise the public of the agency's construction of the statutes and rules which it administers,\" Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.\u00a0S. 92, ___.  Because the policy of counting Part C patients in the Medicare fractions would be treated as interpretive rather than substantive under the APA, the government submits, it had no statutory obligation to provide notice and comment before adopting the policy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The government's interpretation is incorrect because the Medicare Act and the APA do not use the word \"substantive\" in the same way.  First, the Medicare Act contemplates that \"statements of policy\" can establish or change a \"substantive legal standard,\" \u00a71395hh(a)(2), while APA statements of policy are not substantive by definition but are grouped with and treated as interpretive rules, 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7553(b)(A).  Second, \u00a71395hh(e)(1)--which gives the government limited authority to make retroactive \"substantive change[s]\" in, among other things, \"interpretative rules\" and \"statements of policy\"--would make no sense if the Medicare Act used the term \"substantive\" as the APA does, because interpretive rules and statements of policy--and any changes to them--are not substantive under the APA by definition.  Third, had Congress wanted to follow the APA in the Medicare Act and exempt interpretive rules and policy statements from notice and comment, it could have simply cross-referenced the exemption in \u00a7553(b)(A) of the APA.  And the fact that Congress did cross-reference the APA's neighboring good cause exemption found in \u00a7553(b)(B), see \u00a71395hh(b)(2)(C), strongly suggests that it \"act[ed] intentionally and purposefully in the disparate\" decisions, Russello v. United States, 464 U.\u00a0S. 16, 23.  Pp.\u00a05-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The Medicare Act's text and structure foreclose the government's position in this case, and the legislative history presented by the government is ambiguous at best.  The government also advances a policy argument: Requiring notice and comment for Medicare interpretive rules would be excessively burdensome.  But courts are not free to rewrite clear statutes under the banner of their own policy concerns, and the government's argument carries little force even on its own terms.  Pp.\u00a013-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Because this Court affirms the court of appeals' judgment under \u00a71395hh(a)(2), there is no need to address that court's alternative holding that \u00a71395hh(a)(4) independently required notice and comment.  Nor does this Court consider the argument, not pursued by the government here, that the policy did not \"establis[h] or chang[e]\" a substantive legal standard--and so did not require notice and comment under \u00a71395hh(a)(2)--because the statute itself required the government to count Part C patients in the Medicare fraction.

In 2014, the government revealed a new policy on its website that dramatically--and retroactively--reduced payments to hospitals serving low-income patients.  Because affected members of the public received no advance warning and no chance to comment first, and because the government has not identified a lawful excuse for neglecting its statutory notice-and-comment obligations, we agree with the court of appeals that the new policy cannot stand.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, Medicare stands as the largest federal program after Social Security.  It spends about $700 billion annually to provide health insurance for nearly 60 million aged or disabled Americans, nearly one-fifth of the Nation's population.  Needless to say, even seemingly modest modifications to the program can affect the lives of millions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As Medicare has grown, so has Congress's interest in ensuring that the public has a chance to be heard before changes are made to its administration.  As originally enacted in 1965, the Medicare Act didn't address the possibility of public input.  Nor did the notice-and-comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act apply.  While the APA requires many other agencies to offer public notice and a comment period before adopting new regulations, it does not apply to public benefit programs like Medicare.  5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7553(a)(2).  Soon enough, though, the government volunteered to follow the informal notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures found in the APA when proceeding under the Medicare Act.  See Clarian Health West, LLC v. Hargan, 878 F.\u00a03d 346, 356-357 (CADC 2017).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This solution came under stress in the 1980s.  By then, Medicare had grown exponentially and the burdens and benefits of public comment had come under new scrutiny.  The government now took the view that following the APA's procedures had become too troublesome and proposed to relax its commitment to them.  See 47 Fed. Reg. 26860-26861 (1982).  But Congress formed a different judgment.  It decided that, with the growing scope of Medicare, notice and comment should become a matter not merely of administrative grace, but of statutory duty.  See \u00a79321(e)(1), 100 Stat. 2017; \u00a74035(b), 101 Stat. 1330-78.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notably, Congress didn't just adopt the APA's notice-and-comment regime for the Medicare program.  That, of course, it could have easily accomplished in just a few words.  Instead, Congress chose to write a new, Medicare-specific statute.  The new statute required the government to provide public notice and a 60-day comment period (twice the APA minimum of 30 days) for any \"rule, requirement, or other statement of policy (other than a national coverage determination) that establishes or changes a substantive legal standard governing the scope of benefits, the payment for services, or the eligibility of individuals, entities, or organizations to furnish or receive services or benefits under [Medicare].\"  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71395hh(a)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our case involves a dispute over this language.  Since Medicare's creation and under what's called \"Medicare Part A,\" the federal government has paid hospitals directly for providing covered patient care.  To ensure hospitals have the resources and incentive to serve low-income patients, the government has also long offered additional payments to institutions that serve a \"disproportionate number\" of such persons.  \u00a71395ww(d)(5)(F)(i)(I).  These payments are calculated in part using a hospital's so-called \"Medicare fraction,\" which asks how much of the care the hospital provided to Medicare patients in a given year was provided to low-income Medicare patients.  The fraction's denominator is the time the hospital spent caring for patients who were \"entitled to benefits under\" Medicare Part A.  The numerator is the time the hospital spent caring for Part-A-entitled patients who were also entitled to income support payments under the Social Security Act.  \u00a71395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I).  The bigger the fraction, the bigger the payment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calculating Medicare fractions got more complicated in 1997.  That year, Congress created \"Medicare Part C,\" sometimes referred to as Medicare Advantage.  Under Part C, beneficiaries may choose to have the government pay their private insurance premiums rather than pay for their hospital care directly.  This development led to the question whether Part C patients should be counted as \"entitled to benefits under\" Part A when calculating a hospital's Medicare fraction.  The question is important as a practical matter because Part C enrollees, we're told, tend to be wealthier than patients who opt for traditional Part A coverage.  Allina Health Services v. Price, 863 F.\u00a03d 937, 939 (CADC 2017).  So counting them makes the fraction smaller and reduces hospitals' payments considerably--by between $3 and $4 billion over a 9-year period, according to the government.  Pet. for Cert. 23.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The agency overseeing Medicare has gone back and forth on whether to count Part C participants in the Medicare fraction.  At first, it did not include them.  See Northeast Hospital Corp. v. Sebelius, 657 F.\u00a03d 1, 15-16 (CADC 2011).  In 2003, the agency even proposed codifying that practice in a formal rule.  68 Fed. Reg. 27208.  But after the public comment period, the agency reversed field and issued a final rule in 2004 declaring that it would begin counting Part C patients.  69 Fed. Reg. 49099.  This abrupt change prompted various legal challenges from hospitals.  In one case, a court held that the agency couldn't apply the 2004 rule retroactively.  Northeast Hospital, 657 F.\u00a03d, at 14.  In another case, a court vacated the 2004 rule because the agency had \"\u00a0'pull[ed] a surprise switcheroo'\u00a0\" by doing the opposite of what it had proposed.  Allina Health Services v. Sebelius, 746 F.\u00a03d 1102, 1108 (CADC 2014).  Eventually, and in response to these developments, the agency in 2013 issued a new rule that prospectively \"readopt[ed] the policy\" of counting Part C patients.  78 Fed. Reg. 50620.  Challenges to the 2013 rule are pending.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The case before us arose in 2014.  That's when the agency got around to calculating hospitals' Medicare fractions for fiscal year 2012.  When it did so, the agency still wanted to count Part C patients.  But it couldn't rely on the 2004 rule, which had been vacated.  And it couldn't rely on the 2013 rule, which bore only prospective effect.  The agency's solution?  It posted on a website a spreadsheet announcing the 2012 Medicare fractions for 3,500 hospitals nationwide and noting that the fractions included Part C patients.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That Internet posting led to this lawsuit.  A group of hospitals who provided care to low-income Medicare patients in 2012 argued (among other things) that the government had violated the Medicare Act by skipping its statutory notice-and-comment obligations.  In reply, the government admitted that it hadn't provided notice and comment but argued it wasn't required to do so in these circumstances.  Ultimately, the court of appeals sided with the hospitals.  863 F.\u00a03d, at 938.  But in doing so the court created a conflict with other circuits that had suggested, if only in passing, that notice and comment wasn't needed in cases like this.  See, e.g., Via Christi Regional Medical Center, Inc. v. Leavitt, 509 F.\u00a03d 1259, 1271, n.\u00a011 (CA10 2007); Baptist Health v. Thompson, 458 F.\u00a03d 768, 776, n.\u00a08 (CA8 2006).  We granted the government's petition for certiorari to resolve the conflict.  585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case hinges on the meaning of a single phrase in the notice-and-comment statute Congress drafted specially for Medicare in 1987.  Recall that the law requires the government to provide the public with advance notice and a chance to comment on any \"rule, requirement, or other statement of policy\" that \"establishes or changes a substantive legal standard governing .\u00a0.\u00a0. the payment for services.\"  \u00a71395hh(a)(2).  Before us, everyone agrees that the government's 2014 announcement of the 2012 Medicare fractions governed \"payment for services.\"  It's clear, too, that the government's announcement was at least a \"statement of policy\" because it \"le[t] the public know [the agency's] current .\u00a0.\u00a0. adjudicatory approach\" to a critical question involved in calculating payments for thousands of hospitals nationwide.  Syncor Int'l Corp. v. Shalala, 127 F.\u00a03d 90, 94 (CADC 1997).  So whether the government had an obligation to provide notice and comment winds up turning on whether its 2014 announcement established or changed a \"substantive legal standard.\"  That phrase doesn't seem to appear anywhere else in the entire United States Code, and the parties offer at least two ways to read it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The hospitals suggest the statute means to distinguish a substantive from a procedural legal standard.  On this account, a substantive standard is one that \"creates duties, rights and obligations,\" while a procedural standard specifies how those duties, rights, and obligations should be enforced.  Black's Law Dictionary 1281 (5th ed. 1979) (defining \"substantive law\").  And everyone agrees that a policy of counting Part C patients in the Medicare fraction is substantive in this sense, because it affects a hospital's right to payment.  From this it follows that the public had a right to notice and comment before the government could adopt the policy at hand.  863 F.\u00a03d, at 943.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Very differently, the government suggests the statute means to distinguish a substantive from an interpretive legal standard.  Under the APA, \"substantive rules\" are those that have the \"force and effect of law,\" while \"interpretive rules\" are those that merely \"\u00a0'advise the public of the agency's construction of the statutes and rules which it administers.'\u00a0\"  Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.\u00a0S. 92, ___-___ (2015) (slip op., at 2-3).  On the government's view, the 1987 Medicare notice-and-comment statute meant to track the APA's usage in this respect.  And the government submits that, because the policy of counting Part C patients in the Medicare fractions would be treated as interpretive rather than substantive under the APA, it had no statutory obligation to provide notice and comment before adopting its new policy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who has the better reading?  Several statutory clues persuade us of at least one thing: The government's interpretation can't be right.  Pretty clearly, the Medicare Act doesn't use the word \"substantive\" in the same way the APA does--to identify only those legal standards that have the \"force and effect of law.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Medicare Act contemplates that \"statements of policy\" like the one at issue here can establish or change a \"substantive legal standard.\"  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71395hh(a)(2) (emphasis added).  Yet, by definition under the APA, statements of policy are not substantive; instead they are grouped with and treated as interpretive rules.  5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7553(b)(A).  This strongly suggests the Medicare Act just isn't using the word \"substantive\" in the same way as the APA.  Even the government acknowledges that its contrary reading leaves the Medicare Act's treatment of policy statements \"incoherent.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 19.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, the government suggests that the statutory incoherence produced by its reading turns out to serve a rational purpose: It clarifies that the agency overseeing Medicare can't evade its notice-and-comment obligations for new rules that bear the \"force and effect\" of law by the simple expedient of \"call[ing]\" them mere \"statements of policy.\"  Id., at 19-20.  The dissent echoes this argument, suggesting that Congress included \"statements of policy\" in \u00a71395hh(a)(2) in order to capture \"substantive rules in disguise.\"  Post, at 5 (opinion of Breyer, J.).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the statute doesn't refer to things that are labeled or disguised as statements of policy; it just refers to \"statements of policy.\"  Everyone agrees that when Congress used that phrase in the APA and in other provisions of \u00a71395hh, it referred to things that really are statements of policy.  See, e.g., Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Federal Power Comm'n, 506 F.\u00a02d 33, 38 (CADC 1974); post, at 4-5 (discussing \u00a71395hh(e)(1)).  Yet, to accept the government's view, we'd have to hold that when Congress used the very same phrase in \u00a71395hh(a)(2), it sought to refer to things an agency calls statements of policy but that in fact are nothing of the sort.  The dissent admits this \"may seem odd at first blush,\" post, at 5, but further blushes don't bring much improvement.  This Court does not lightly assume that Congress silently attaches different meanings to the same term in the same or related statutes.  See Law v. Siegel, 571 U.\u00a0S. 415, 422 (2014).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Besides, even if the statute's reference to \"statements of policy\" could bear such an odd construction, the government and the dissent fail to explain why Congress would have thought it necessary or appropriate.  Agencies have never been able to avoid notice and comment simply by mislabeling their substantive pronouncements.  On the contrary, courts have long looked to the contents of the agency's action, not the agency's self-serving label, when deciding whether statutory notice-and-comment demands apply.  See, e.g., General Motors Corp. v. Ruckelshaus, 742 F.\u00a02d 1561, 1565 (CADC 1984) (en banc) (\"[T]he agency's own label, while relevant, is not dispositive\"); Guardian Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Federal Sav. & Loan Ins. Corp., 589 F.\u00a02d 658, 666-667 (CADC 1978) (if \"a so-called policy statement is in purpose or likely effect .\u00a0.\u00a0. a binding rule of substantive law,\" it \"will be taken for what it is\").  Nor is there any evidence before us suggesting that Congress thought it important to underscore this prosaic point in the Medicare Act (and yet not in the APA)--let alone any reason to think Congress would have sought to make the point in such an admittedly incoherent way.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the government's reading would introduce another incoherence into the Medicare statute.  Subsection (e)(1) of \u00a71395hh gives the government limited authority to make retroactive \"substantive change[s]\" in, among other things, \"interpretative rules\" and \"statements of policy.\"  But this statutory authority would make no sense if the Medicare Act used the term \"substantive\" as the APA does.  It wouldn't because, again, interpretive rules and statements of policy--and any changes to them--are not substantive under the APA by definition.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, too, the government offers no satisfactory reply.  It concedes, as it must, that the term \"substantive\" in subsection (e)(1) can't carry the meaning it wishes to ascribe to the same word in subsection (a)(2).  Tr. of Oral Arg. 16-18.  So that leaves the government to suggest (again) that the same word should mean two different things in the same statute.  In (e)(1), the government says, it may bear the meaning the hospitals propose, but in (a)(2) it means the same thing it does in the APA.  But, once more, the government fails to offer any good reason or evidence to unseat our normal presumption that, when Congress uses a term in multiple places within a single statute, the term bears a consistent meaning throughout.  See Law, 571 U.\u00a0S., at 422.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, the government suggests Congress used the phrase \"substantive legal standard\" in the Medicare Act as a way to exempt interpretive rules and policy statements from notice and comment.  But Congress had before it--and rejected--a much more direct path to that destination.  In a single sentence the APA sets forth two exemptions from the government's usual notice-and-comment obligations:\n\"Except when notice or hearing is required by statute, this subsection [requiring notice and comment] does not apply--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(A)\u00a0to interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(B)\u00a0when the agency for good cause finds .\u00a0.\u00a0. that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.\"  5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7553(b).\nIn the Medicare Act, Congress expressly borrowed one of the APA's exemptions, the good cause exemption, by cross-referencing it in \u00a71395hh(b)(2)(C).  If, as the government supposes, Congress had also wanted to borrow the other APA exemption, for interpretive rules and policy statements, it could have easily cross-referenced that exemption in exactly the same way.  Congress had recently done just that, cross-referencing both of the APA's exceptions in the Clean Air Act.  See \u00a7305(a), 91 Stat. 772, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77607(d)(1).  Yet it didn't do the same thing in the Medicare Act, and Congress's choice to include a cross-reference to one but not the other of the APA's neighboring exemptions strongly suggests it acted \"\u00a0'intentionally and purposefully in the disparate'\u00a0\" decisions.  Russello v. United States, 464 U.\u00a0S. 16, 23 (1983).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The government's response asks us to favor a most unlikely reading over this obvious one.  The government submits that Congress simply preferred to mimic the APA's interpretive-rule exemption in the Medicare Act by using the novel and enigmatic phrase \"substantive legal standard\" instead of a simple cross-reference.  But the government supplies no persuasive account why Congress would have thought it necessary or wise to proceed in this convoluted way.  The dissent suggests that a cross-reference could not have taken the place of other language in \u00a71395hh(a)(2) limiting the notice-and-comment requirement to rules governing benefits, payment, or eligibility, post, at 17; but we can't see why this would have made a cross-reference less desirable than the phrase \"substantive legal standard\" as a means of incorporating the APA's interpretive-rule exemption.  So we're left with nothing but the doubtful proposition that Congress sought to accomplish in a \"surpassingly strange manner\" what it could have accomplished in a much more straightforward way.  RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.\u00a0S. 639, 647 (2012); see Advocate Health Care Network v. Stapleton, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 8) (\"When legislators did not adopt 'obvious alternative' language, 'the natural implication is that they did not intend' the alternative\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent would have us disregard all of the textual clues we've found significant because the word \"substantive\" carried \"a special meaning in the context of administrative law\" in the 1980s, making it \"almost a certainty\" that Congress had that meaning in mind when it used the word \"substantive\" in \u00a71395hh(a)(2).  Post, at 3, 8.  But it was the phrase \"substantive rule\" that was a term of art in administrative law, and Congress chose not to use that term in the Medicare Act.  Instead, it introduced a seemingly new phrase to the statute books when it spoke of \"substantive legal standards.\"  And, for all the reasons we have already explored, the term \"substantive legal standard\" in the Medicare Act appears to carry a more expansive scope than that borne by the term \"substantive rule\" under the APA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In reply, the dissent stresses that \u00a71395hh refers to agency actions requiring notice and comment as \"regulations.\"  This is significant, the dissent says, because \"courts had sometimes treated [the term 'regulations'] as interchangeable with the term 'substantive rules'\u00a0\" around the time of the 1987 Medicare Act amendments.  Post,  at 4.  So if only \"regulations\" must proceed through notice and comment, the dissent reasons, that necessarily encompasses only things that qualify as substantive rules under the APA.  In fact, however, by 1987 courts had commonly referred to both substantive and interpretive rules as \"regulations,\" so the dissent's logical syllogism fails on its own terms.  To see this, one need look no further than Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.\u00a0S. 281 (1979), which described the substantive-interpretive divide as \"the central distinction among agency regulations found in the APA.\"  Id., at 301 (emphasis added); see also, e.g., Batterton v. Francis, 432 U.\u00a0S. 416, 425, n.\u00a09 (1977) (distinguishing between \"[l]egislative, or substantive, regulations\" and \"interpretative regulation[s]\"); United Technologies Corp. v. EPA, 821 F.\u00a02d 714, 719 (CADC 1987) (\"most of the regulations at issue are .\u00a0.\u00a0. interpretative\").1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the end, all of the available evidence persuades us that the phrase \"substantive legal standard,\" which appears in \u00a713955hh(a)(2) and apparently nowhere else in the U.\u00a0S. Code, cannot bear the same construction as the term \"substantive rule\" in the APA.  We need not, however, go so far as to say that the hospitals' interpretation, adopted by the court of appeals, is correct in every particular.  To affirm the judgment before us, it is enough to say the government's arguments for reversal fail to withstand scrutiny.  Other questions about the statute's meaning can await other cases.  The dissent would like us to provide more guidance, post, at 13-14, but the briefing before us focused on the issue whether the Medicare Act borrows the APA's interpretive-rule exception, and we limit our holding accordingly.  In doing so, we follow the well-worn path of declining \"to issue a sweeping ruling when a narrow one will do.\"  McWilliams v. Dunn, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 14).2\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unable to muster support for its position in the statutory text or structure, the government encourages us to look elsewhere.  It begins by inviting us to follow it into the legislative history lurking behind the Medicare Act.  \"But legislative history is not the law.\"  Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 23).  And even those of us who believe that clear legislative history can \"illuminate ambiguous text\" won't allow \"ambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory language.\"  Milner v. Department of Navy, 562 U.\u00a0S. 562, 572 (2011).  Yet the text before us clearly forecloses the government's position in this case, and the legislative history presented to us is ambiguous at best.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The government points us first to a conference report on the 1986 bill that adopted \u00a71395hh(b).  The 1986 report opined that the bill adopted at that time wouldn't require notice and comment for interpretive rules.  See H.\u00a0R. Conf. Rep. No. 99-1012, p.\u00a0311 (1986).  But the 1986 bill didn't include the statutory language at issue here.  Congress added that language only the following year, when it enacted \u00a71395hh(a)(2).  Nor does the government try to explain how a report on a 1986 bill sheds light on the meaning of statutory terms first introduced in 1987.  If anything, the fact that Congress revisited the statute in 1987 may suggest it wasn't satisfied with the 1986 notice-and-comment requirements and wished to enhance them.  Some legislative history even says as much.  See H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 100-391(I), p.\u00a0430 (1987) (expressing concern that, despite the 1986 legislation, the agency was still announcing \"important policies\" without notice and  comment).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The conference report on the 1987 bill that did adopt the statutory language before us today doesn't offer much help to the government either.  The House version of the bill would have required notice and comment for rules with a \"significant effect\" on payments, a condition no doubt present here.  H.\u00a0R. 3545, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., reprinted in 133 Cong. Rec. 30019.  Later, the conference committee replaced the House's language with the current language of subsection (a)(2), which the report said \"reflect[ed] recent court rulings.\"  H.\u00a0R. Conf. Rep. No. 100-495, p.\u00a0566 (1987).  The government contends that this was an oblique reference to a then-recent decision discussing the APA's interpretive-rule exception and an implicit suggestion that interpretive rules shouldn't be subject to notice and comment.  See American Hospital Assn. v. Bowen, 834 F.\u00a02d 1037, 1045-1046 (CADC 1987).  But, as the hospitals point out, Bowen was mostly about the APA's treatment of procedural rules.  See id., at 1047-1057.  So it seems at least equally plausible that the conference committee revised the House's language because it feared that language would have subjected procedural rules to notice-and-comment obligations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The hospitals call our attention to other indications, too, that Members of Congress didn't understand the conference's language to track the APA.  For example, the relevant provision in the final bill was titled \"Publication as Regulations of Significant Policies.\"  \u00a74035(b), 101 Stat. 1330-78 (emphasis added).  And, as we've seen, \"significant policies\" don't always amount to substantive rules under the APA.  The House Ways and Means Committee likewise described the final bill as requiring notice and comment for \"[s]ignificant policy changes,\" not just substantive rules.  Summary of Conference Agreement on Reconciliation Provisions Within the Jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 12-13 (Comm. Print 1987).  So in the end and at most, we are left with exactly the kind of murky legislative history that we all agree can't overcome a statute's clear text and structure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That leads us to the government's final redoubt: a policy argument.  But as the government knows well, courts aren't free to rewrite clear statutes under the banner of our own policy concerns.  If the government doesn't like Congress's notice-and-comment policy choices, it must take its complaints there.  See, e.g., Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc., 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2017) (slip op., at 9-10); Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U.\u00a0S. 369, 381 (2013).  Besides, the government's policy arguments don't carry much force even on their own terms.  The government warns that providing the public with notice and a chance to comment on all Medicare interpretive rules, like those in its roughly 6,000-page \"Provider Reimbursement Manual,\" would take \"\u00a0'many years'\u00a0\" to complete.  Brief for Petitioner 18, 42.  But the dissent points to only eight manual provisions that courts have deemed interpretive over the last four decades, see post, at 10-12, and the government hasn't suggested that providing notice and comment for these or any other specific manual provisions would prove excessively burdensome.  Nor has the government identified any court decision invalidating a manual provision under \u00a71395hh(a)(2) in the nearly two years since the court of appeals issued its opinion in this case.  For their part, the hospitals claim that only a few dozen pages of the Provider Reimbursement Manual might even arguably require notice and comment.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 49-51.  And they tell us that the agency regularly and without much difficulty undertakes notice-and-comment rulemaking for many other decisions affecting the Medicare program.  See Brief for Respondents 58; App. to Brief in Opposition 1a-3a.  The government hasn't rebutted any of these points.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not only has the government failed to document any draconian costs associated with notice and comment, it also has neglected to acknowledge the potential countervailing benefits.  Notice and comment gives affected parties fair warning of potential changes in the law and an opportunity to be heard on those changes--and it affords the agency a chance to avoid errors and make a more informed decision.  See 1 K. Hickman & R. Pierce, Administrative Law \u00a74.8 (6th ed. 2019). Surely a rational Congress could have thought those benefits especially valuable when it comes to a program where even minor changes to the agency's approach can impact millions of people and billions of dollars in ways that are not always easy for regulators to anticipate.  None of this is to say Congress had to proceed as it did.  It is only to say that Congress reasonably could have believed that the policy decision reflected in the statute would yield benefits sufficient to outweigh the speculative burdens the government has suggested.  And if notice and comment really does threaten to \"become a major roadblock to the implementation of\" Medicare, post, at 10, the agency can seek relief from Congress, which--unlike the courts--is both qualified and constitutionally entitled to weigh the costs and benefits of different approaches and make the necessary policy  judgment.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are two more lines of argument that deserve brief acknowledgment.  One concerns \u00a71395hh(a)(4), which provides that a Medicare regulation struck down for not being a logical outgrowth of the government's proposal can't \"take effect\" until the agency provides a \"further opportunity for public comment.\"  The hospitals claim, and the court of appeals held, that subsection (a)(4) also and independently required notice and comment here.  But given our holding affirming the court of appeals' judgment under \u00a71395hh(a)(2), we have no need to reach this  question.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Separately, we can imagine that the government might have sought to argue that the policy at issue here didn't \"establis[h] or chang[e]\" a substantive legal standard--and so didn't require notice and comment under \u00a71395hh(a)(2)--because the statute itself required it to count Part C patients in the Medicare fraction.  But we need not consider this argument either, this time because the government hasn't pursued it and we normally have no obligation to entertain grounds for reversal that a party hasn't presented.  Far from suggesting that the Medicare Act supplies the controlling legal standard for determining whether to count Part C patients, the government has insisted that the statute \"does not speak directly to the issue,\" Brief for Appellant in Northeast Hospital Corp. v. Sebelius, No. 10-5163 (CADC), p.\u00a022, and thus leaves a \"\u00a0'gap'\u00a0\" for the agency to fill, Brief for Appellee in Allina v. Price, No. 16-5255 (CADC), p.\u00a050 (quoting Northeast Hospital Corp., 657 F.\u00a03d, at 13).  The courts below accepted the government's submission, and the government hasn't sought to take a different position in this Court.  So we express no opinion on whether the statute in fact contains such a \"gap.\"  We hold simply that, when the government establishes or changes an avowedly \"gap\"-filling policy, it can't evade its notice-and-comment obligations under \u00a71395hh(a)(2) on the strength of the arguments it has advanced in this case.\n*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the court of appeals is\nAffirmed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kavanaugh took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nBreyer, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1484\nALEX M. AZAR, II, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, PETITIONER v. ALLINA HEALTH SERVICES, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit\n[June 3, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statute before us, a subsection of the Medicare Act, refers to a \"rule, requirement, or other statement of policy .\u00a0.\u00a0. that establishes or changes a substantive legal standard.\"  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71395hh(a)(2).  This phrase is nested within a set of provisions that, taken together, require  the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use  notice-and-comment rulemaking before promulgating \"regulations.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government argues that the language at issue, like the notice-and-comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), applies only to \"substantive\" or \"legislative\" rules.  In its view, the language does not cover \"interpretive\" rules (which it believes the agency promulgated here).  After considering the relevant language, the statutory context, the statutory history, and the related consequences, I believe the Government is right.  I would remand this case to the Court of Appeals to consider whether the agency determination at issue in this case is a substantive rule (which requires notice and comment) or an interpretive rule (which does not).\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The arguments in support of my interpretation are simple.  By using words with meanings that are well settled in the APA context, Congress made clear that the notice-and-comment requirement in the Medicare Act applies only to substantive, not interpretive, rules.  The statutory language, at minimum, permits this interpretation, and the statute's history and the practical consequences provide further evidence that Congress had only substantive rules in mind.  Importantly, this interpretation of the statute, unlike the Court's, provides a familiar and readily administrable way for the agency to distinguish the actions that require notice and comment from the actions that do not.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I begin with the specific language of the statute.  There are, in my view, three relevant subsections that must be read together.  The first, a general provision, has been part of the Medicare Act since Congress created the program in 1965.  It says that the Secretary \"shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the administration of the insurance programs.\"  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71395hh(a)(1) (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The other two relevant provisions were added in the 1980s.  The provision contained in the very next paragraph is the one directly at issue here.  It says:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No rule, requirement, or other statement of policy .\u00a0.\u00a0. that establishes or changes a substantive legal standard governing the scope of benefits, the payment for services, or the eligibility .\u00a0.\u00a0. to furnish or receive services or benefits .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall take effect unless it is promulgated by the Secretary by regulation under paragraph (1).\"  \u00a71395hh(a)(2) (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the third relevant provision, eight paragraphs away, contains the notice-and-comment requirement:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"[B]efore issuing in final form any regulation under subsection (a) .\u00a0.\u00a0. , the Secretary shall provide for notice of the proposed regulation in the Federal Register and a period of not less than 60 days for public comment thereon.\"  \u00a71395hh(b)(1) (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taken together, these provisions say that the Secretary must use notice-and-comment procedures before promulgating any \"regulation,\" and that a \"rule, requirement,  or other statement of policy\" counts as a \"regulation\" whenever it \"establishes or changes a substantive legal standard.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question at hand is whether an interpretive rule qualifies as the type of \"regulation\" that Congress intended to subject to the notice-and-comment requirement when it added the second and third provisions in the 1980s.  In my view, the answer is no.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the 1980s, the words \"regulation\" and \"substantive\" (which I have repeatedly italicized above) carried a special meaning in the context of administrative law.  This Court had recognized the \"central distinction\" drawn by the APA between \"\u00a0'substantive rules' on the one hand and 'interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice' on the other.\"  Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.\u00a0S. 281, 301 (1979).  A \"substantive rule,\" often promulgated pursuant to specific statutory authority, is a rule that \"\u00a0'bind[s]'\u00a0\" the public or has \"\u00a0'the force and effect of law.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 301\u2212302.  Substantive rules had also come to be known as \"legislative rules.\"  Id., at 302.  And some courts referred to substantive rules as \"regulations\" as well, see, e.g., American Hospital Assn. v. Bowen, 834 F.\u00a02d 1037, 1045 (CADC 1987) (\"\u00a0'\u00a0\"regulations,\" \"substantive rules,\" or \"legislative rules\" are those which create law'\u00a0\"); Cabais v. Egger, 690 F.\u00a02d 234, 238 (CADC 1982) (same), although this practice was both less common and less consistent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of contrast, courts had held that \"interpretive rules\" do not have the \"force and effect of law\"; they simply set forth the agency's interpretation of the statutes or regulations that it administers.  Chrysler Corp., 441 U.\u00a0S., at 302, and n. 31; see also American Hospital Assn., 834 F.\u00a02d, at 1045 (interpretive rules \"merely clarify or explain existing law or regulations\").  Then, as today, whether a rule was substantive or interpretive determined whether it had to be promulgated using the APA's notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures.  5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7553(b)(3)(A) (exempting \"interpretative rules,\" among other things, from the notice-and-comment requirement); see also Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital, 514 U.\u00a0S. 87, 99 (1995) (\"Interpretive rules do not require notice and  comment\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point, we can begin to see support in the statutory language for the Government's interpretation of the notice-and-comment provisions--one that excludes interpretive rules from their scope.  By applying the statute only to agency actions that \"establish or change a substantive legal standard,\" \u00a71395hh(a)(2) (emphasis added), Congress used words that courts had long used to describe substantive rules under the APA.  See, e.g., American Hospital Assn., 834 F.\u00a02d, at 1045, 1046 (\"\u00a0'substantive rules'\u00a0\" are rules that \"\u00a0'create law'\u00a0\" or \"\u00a0'establis[h] a standard of conduct which has the force of law'\u00a0\"); Linoz v. Heckler, 800 F.\u00a02d 871, 877 (CA9 1986) (substantive rules \"\u00a0'effect a change in existing law or policy'\u00a0\").  Moreover, by limiting the notice-and-comment requirement to \"regulation[s],\" \u00a71395hh(b)(1) (emphasis added), Congress used a word that courts had sometimes treated as interchangeable with the term \"substantive rules.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another subsection of the statute, \u00a71395hh(e)(1), similarly implies that Congress had only substantive rules in mind when it used the term \"regulations.\"  That subsection bars the agency from retroactively applying certain policy changes articulated in \"regulations, manual instructions, interpretative rules, statements of policy, or guidelines of general applicability.\"  Ibid.  By using the word \"or\" to connect \"regulations\" and the other words in the list, Congress suggested that each linked phrase refers to something different.  This textual distinction between \"regulations\" and \"interpretive rules\" further suggests that the \"regulations\" that must go through notice and comment do not include interpretive rules.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is, however, an important counterargument.  As the Court emphasizes, ante, at 7\u22128, the provision before us includes the words \"statement[s] of policy.\"  \u00a71395hh(a)(2).  Even if we can easily read the words \"rule[s]\" and \"requirement[s]\" as referring to substantive or legislative rules, \"statement[s] of policy\" are a different matter.  Ibid.  Indeed, the APA explicitly excludes \"statements of policy\" from its notice-and-comment requirements.  5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7553(d)(2).  So how can we say that our provision--which explicitly includes statements of policy--encompasses only those legislative rules that the APA subjects to notice-and-comment rulemaking?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer to this question linguistically is that our provision does not include all \"statements of policy,\" but rather only those that are, in effect, substantive rules.  That is because the statute does not \"just refe[r] to 'statements of policy,'\u00a0\" ante, at 7; it refers to \"statement[s] of policy .\u00a0.\u00a0. that establis[h] or chang[e] a substantive legal standard,\" \u00a71395hh(a)(2) (emphasis added).  Those words, read together, are simply another way of referring to substantive rules in disguise.  This reading may seem odd at first blush, but the statutory history and the consequences of the alternative interpretation persuade me that this is precisely what Congress intended.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I turn next to the history of the statute, which provides significant support for believing that the Medicare rulemaking provision does not extend to interpretive rules.  As enacted in 1965, the Medicare Act authorized the agency to promulgate \"regulations\" as necessary, but did not require the agency to follow any particular rulemaking procedures.  See \u00a7102(a), 79 Stat. 331.  The APA's notice-and-comment requirements did not apply to Medicare regulations, for the APA specifically exempts \"matter[s] relating to .\u00a0.\u00a0. benefits\" from its scope.  5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7553(a)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1971, the agency nonetheless adopted a policy of voluntarily promulgating most regulations through notice-and-comment rulemaking.  See Public Participation in Rule Making, 36 Fed. Reg. 2532.  But the agency did not use notice and comment for all policy decisions during this time.  It also provided extensive guidance to participants in the Medicare system through less formal means like manuals (a practice it still follows today).  See, e.g., Daughters of Miriam Ctr. for the Aged v. Mathews, 590 F.\u00a02d 1250, 1254 (CA3 1978) (describing the agency's Provider Reimbursement Manual, which \"interprets and elaborates upon\" Medicare regulations).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the early 1980s, the agency proposed to change its notice-and-comment policy: It no longer intended to use notice and comment when the disadvantages of doing so \"outweigh[ed] the benefits of receiving public comment.\"  Administrative Practice and Procedures, 47 Fed. Reg. 26860 (1982).  This announcement provoked widespread opposition.  Citizens' groups and others asked Congress to \"make it clear, by statute, that Medicare regulations .\u00a0.\u00a0. should be subject to\" the APA.  Medicare Appeals Provisions: Hearing on S. 1158 before the Subcommittee on Health of the Senate Committee on Finance, 99th Cong., 1st Sess., 62 (1985).  In 1986, Congress responded to these requests by enacting a provision that required public notice and a 60-day comment period for \"any regulation,\" with a few exceptions.  See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71395hh (1982 ed., Supp. IV); \u00a79321(e)(1), 100 Stat. 2017.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress meant the term \"regulation\" to include only substantive or legislative rules.  As I have said, supra, at 3, at the time Congress wrote the notice-and-comment provision in the 1980s, courts sometimes used all three terms interchangeably.  See, e.g., Cabais, 690 F.\u00a02d, at 238.  And the legislative history confirms that Congress expected the APA principles to apply.  The House-Senate Conference Report stated that the 1986 notice-and-comment provision would not require rulemaking for \"items (such as interpretive rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure or practice) that are not currently subject to that requirement.\"  H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 99-1012, p. 311.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As of 1986, then, it was clear that the Medicare Act required notice-and-comment rulemaking only for substantive rules, not for interpretive rules.  That was true even though the Medicare Act did not expressly cross-reference the APA's exception for interpretive rules.  Instead, Congress simply understood that the statutory term \"regulation\" excluded interpretive rules, statements of policy, and the like.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now I shall turn to the subsection before us, a provision enacted one year later.  Did that provision, enacted in 1987, significantly change the scope of the Medicare Act's notice-and-comment requirement?  The House of Representatives passed a version of the provision that seemed to say yes.  The House Report on that bill said that the provision arose from a \"concer[n] that important policies [were] being developed without benefit of the public notice and comment period and, with growing frequency, [were] being transmitted, if at all, through manual instructions and other informal means.\"  H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 100\u2212391, pt. 1,  p. 430 (emphasis added).  Thus, the House bill required notice and comment for any \"rule, requirement, or other statement of policy .\u00a0.\u00a0. that has (or may have) a significant effect on the scope of benefits, the payment for services, or the eligibility\" for benefits or services.  H.\u00a0R. 3545, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a74073(a)(2) (1987), 133 Cong. Rec. 30019.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Senate, however, thought the scope of this language was too broad.  And the House-Senate Conference Committee agreed with the Senate, not the House.  It revised the House version by taking out the words \"has (or may have) a significant effect on the scope of\" benefits, payment, or eligibility, and by substituting for those words the current language--namely, \"establishes or changes a substantive legal standard governing the scope of\" benefits, payment, or eligibility.  \u00a71395hh(a)(2) (emphasis added); see \u00a74035(b), 101 Stat. 1330\u221278 (1987); H.\u00a0R. Conf. Rep. No. 100-495, p. 566 (1987).  The revised language thus focused on the legal effect of the agency decision, not its practical importance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Conference Report explains that the Committee substituted its language for that of the House in order to \"reflec[t] recent court rulings.\"  Ibid.  What were those \"court rulings\"?  I have described many of them above.  See supra, at 3\u22124.  Among others, they included rulings describing \"substantive rules\" as rules that \"\u00a0'establis[h] a standard of conduct which has the force of law'\u00a0\" or that change \"substantive standards.\"  American Hospital Assn., 834 F.\u00a02d, at 1046, 1056.  Given this case law, it is almost a certainty that the Conference Committee had in mind the meaning that courts had already given to the term \"substantive\"; indeed, neither the Court nor the hospitals point to any other recent rulings to which the Report could have referred.  And if that is correct, Congress would not have intended to include interpretive rules within the scope of the revised provision.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then-recent court rulings also explain why Congress added the words \"statement of policy,\" given its desire to mimic the scope of the APA's rulemaking provision.  At the time Congress added this language in 1987, the D.\u00a0C. Circuit had recently described it as \"well established that a court, in determining whether notice and comment procedures apply to an agency action, will consider the agency's own characterization of the particular action.\"  Telecommunications Research and Action Ctr. v. FCC, 800 F.\u00a02d 1181, 1186 (1986); see also United Technologies Corp. v. EPA, 821 F.\u00a02d 714, 718 (CADC 1987) (\"[T]he agency's characterization of a rule is 'relevant'\u00a0\").  And in practice, courts appeared to give the agency's characterization at least some weight.  See Telecommunications, 800 F.\u00a02d, at 1186 (finding \"no reason to question the Commission's characterization\" of the challenged action as a \"policy statement\"); General Motors Corp. v. Ruckelshaus, 742 F.\u00a02d 1561, 1565 (CADC 1984) (en banc) (finding a rule exempt from notice and comment in part because \"the agency regarded its rule as interpretative\").  These cases thus reinforce the likelihood that Congress inserted the words \"statement of policy\" to make clear that the agency could not evade the notice-and-comment obligation simply by calling a substantive rule a \"statement of policy.\"  In deciding whether a particular agency action is (or is not) a substantive rule, it is the substantive legal effect that will matter, not the label.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, the statute's history provides considerable evidence that Congress intended to replicate the APA framework.  Nowhere in this history is there any indication that Congress intended to require notice and comment for a broader category than substantive rules.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The third--and perhaps strongest--reason for believing that Congress intended this interpretation is a practical reason.  Medicare is a massive federal program, \"embodied in hundreds of pages of statutes and thousands of pages of often interrelated regulations.\"  Shalala v. Illinois Council on Long Term Care, Inc., 529 U.\u00a0S. 1, 13 (2000).  To help participants navigate the statutory and regulatory scheme, the agency has issued tens of thousands of pages of manual instructions, interpretive rules, and other guidance documents.  And it has followed this practice since well before Congress enacted the notice-and-comment provisions at issue here.  See supra, at 6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This combination of regulations and informal guidance is, we have said, \"a sensible structure for the complex Medicare reimbursement process.\"  Guernsey Memorial Hospital, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 101.  Notice-and-comment procedures are elaborate and take time to complete.  The Government cites a study showing that notice-and-comment rulemakings take an average of four years to complete.  Pet. for Cert. 20 (citing GAO, D. Fantone, Federal Rulemaking 5, 19 (GAO-09-205, 2009)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To imagine that Congress wanted the agency to use those procedures in respect to a large percentage of its Medicare guidance manuals is to believe that Congress intended to enact what could become a major roadblock to the implementation of the Medicare program.  As the Government warns us, the Court of Appeals' interpretation may \"substantially undermine\" and even \"cripple\" the administration of the Medicare scheme.  See Brief for Petitioner 21, 42.  To illustrate this point, consider the following provisions of the Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual, which the agency has published for decades.  All of these provisions were held by courts to be \"interpretive rules,\" and hence not subject--before today--to the statute's notice-and-comment requirements:\nProvisions governing when provider contributions to employee deferred compensation plans are necessary and proper and therefore reimbursable.

Thompson, 447 F.\u00a03d 68, 76\u221277 (CA1 2006).\nProvisions governing exceptions to the per diem cost limits that the Secretary can authorize in respect to routine extended care service costs.

Enterprises, Inc. v.

Bowen, 811 F.\u00a02d 1524, 1525, 1529 (CADC 1987).\nA provision regarding the recapture of excess reimbursements resulting from a provider depreciating its assets using an accelerated method.

Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, 466 F.\u00a0Supp. 605, 615\u2212616 (DC 1979).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These examples all involve provisions of the Provider Reimbursement Manual, but the agency also publishes more than a dozen other manuals, with tens of thousands of additional pages of instructions governing \"the scope of benefits, the payment for services, [and] the eligibility\" for benefits or services.  \u00a71395hh(a)(2).  These include the Medicare General Information, Eligibility and Entitlement Manual; the Medicare Claims Processing Manual; the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual; the Medicare Secondary Payer Manual; the Medicare Program Integrity Manual; the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual; and many others.  Many provisions of these manuals have been deemed interpretive rules as well.  See, e.g., Erringer v. Thompson, 371 F. 3d 625, 632 (CA9 2004) (provisions of Program Integrity Manual governing contractors' creation of local coverage determinations); Linoz, 800 F.\u00a02d, at 876-878 (provision of Carrier's Manual carving out an exception to the rule governing reimbursement for ambulance service).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is it reasonable to believe that Congress intended to impose notice-and-comment requirements upon all, or most, or even many of these rules, requirements, or statements of policy?  See ante, at 16.  In my view, the answer is clearly no.  Yet the Court's opinion might impose this unnecessary and potentially severe burden on the administration of the Medicare scheme.\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, interpreting the statute as replicating the APA has the added virtues of clarity and stability.  We know that Congress could not have meant to require notice-and-comment rulemaking for all agency actions that could conceivably affect substantive Medicare policy.  So there must be a way to distinguish the \"substantive\" rules that are covered from the \"substantive\" rules that are not.  And the APA's notion of a \"substantive rule\" provides a natural, legally understandable, and customary way for judges, agencies, and lawyers to perform that task.  In that sense, the APA offers us a familiar port in an interpretive storm.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court not only leaves the APA behind; it fails to substitute any reasonably clear alternative standard.  How is the agency to determine whether a rule \"establishes or changes a substantive legal standard\"?  At one point, the Court refers to the hospitals' view that the statute applies to agency actions \"that 'creat[e] duties, rights and obligations,' as distinct from [agency actions] that specif[y] how those duties, rights, and obligations should be enforced.\"  Ante, at 6.  But it later declines to \"go so far as\" to fully endorse that view.  Ante, at 12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At another point, the Court refers to the notice-and-comment requirement as applying to \"avowedly 'gap'-filling polic[ies],\" suggesting the case might be different if the Government had argued that \"the statute itself\" \"supplie[d] the controlling legal standard.\"  Ante, at 16\u221217.  But these statements sound as if the Court is embracing the very interpretive-rule exception that its holding denies.  See, e.g., Hemp Industries Assn. v. DEA, 333 F. 3d 1082, 1087 (CA9 2003) (interpretive rules \"merely explain, but do not add to, the substantive law that already exists in the form of a statute\"); American Hospital Assn., 834 F.\u00a02d, at 1046 (agency action is interpretive where it \"merely reminds parties of existing duties\" under a statute); cf. Clarian Health West, LLC v. Hargan, 878 F.\u00a03d 346, 355\u2212356 (CADC 2017) (concluding, after the decision below, that manual instructions governing reconciliation of outlier payments did not require notice and comment because they did not \"bind\" the agency and because existing statutory and regulatory provisions \"establish[ed the] substantive legal standards\").  If the Court is going to effectively exempt interpretive rules from the notice-and-comment requirement, why not simply say so?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor does the Court's resolution of this particular case offer clarity as to the scope of the statute.  The Court holds that the agency must provide notice and comment before including Medicare Part C patients in the Medicare fraction.  But it does not explain why that agency decision \"establishes or changes a substantive legal standard.\"  Is it because the decision \"affects a hospital's right to payment\"?  Ante, at 6.  Is it because the decision's financial impact is \"considerabl[e]\"?  Ante, at 3\u22124.  Is it because the agency had previously sought to adopt the same policy through notice and comment?  Ante, at 4.  The Court does not say.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This lack of explanation aggravates the potential burden that the Court's opinion already imposes upon the Medicare program.  It may also lead to legal challenges to the validity of interpretive rules (or even procedural rules) previously thought to have been settled.  And it will  thereby increase the confusion that is inevitable once the Court rejects the settled and readily available principles that courts have learned to use to identify substantive rules under the APA.  These potential adverse consequences are, in my view, persuasive evidence that Congress did not intend the statute to be construed in this way.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To consider these consequences in no way invades Congress' constitutional authority to \"weigh the costs and benefits of different approaches and make the necessary policy judgment.\"  Ante, at 16.  Congress exercised that authority when it passed the Medicare Act's notice-and-comment provisions.  But it used language that even the Court describes as \"enigmatic,\" ante, at 10, and our role as judges is to decipher that enigma.  Examining the potential consequences of each competing interpretation helps us perform that task, as we can presume that Congress did not intend to produce irrational or undesirable practical consequences.  See Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 568 U.\u00a0S. 519, 538, 544\u2212545 (2013) (concluding that Congress did not intend an interpretation of the copyright statute that would produce serious and extensive \"practical problems\"); cf. Home Depot U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A., Inc.\u00a0v.\u00a0Jackson, ante, at ___ (Alito, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 8) (\"[A] good interpreter also reads a text charitably, not lightly ascribing irrationality to its author\").\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reasons set forth above provide sufficient grounds to believe that Congress only intended to require notice and comment for substantive rules.  The Court nonetheless concludes that three \"textual clues\" foreclose this interpretation.  Ante, at 10\u221211.  I have already mentioned one of them:  Congress' use of the words \"statement of policy\" in the provision before us.  As I have explained, the most plausible explanation for this language is that Congress sought to make clear that the agency must use notice and comment for any agency pronouncement that amounts to a substantive rule--irrespective of the label that the agency applies.  See supra, at\u00a08\u22129.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The remaining two arguments that the Court offers to defend its interpretation are, in my view, similarly inadequate.  The Court points, for example, to \u00a71395hh(e)(1), which Congress added in 2003.  See \u00a7903(a)(1), 117 Stat. 2376.  That subsection limits the agency's authority to make retroactive any \"substantive change\" in \"regulations, manual instructions, interpretative rules, statements of policy, or guidelines of general applicability.\"  The Court points out that the word \"substantive\" in this subsection does not mean a \"substantive rule\" under the APA.  Ante, at 8\u22129.  And I agree with that observation.  But I cannot see how that fact sheds light on the meaning of the phrase \"establishes or changes a substantive legal standard,\" where the adjective \"substantive\" modifies an entirely different noun.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We of course normally presume that the same word carries a single meaning throughout a given statute.  Here, however, that presumption is overcome.  The word \"substantive\" in \u00a71395hh(e)(1) modifies the word \"change,\" and the phrase \"substantive change\" has a known meaning in the law.  It refers to a change to the substance of a rule, rather than a technical change to its form.  See, e.g., Northwest, Inc. v. Ginsberg, 572 U.\u00a0S. 273, 282 (2014) (noting that statutory recodification \"did not effect any 'substantive change'\u00a0\" to the law); see also Black's Law Dictionary 1469 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \"substance\" as, inter alia, \"the essential quality of something, as opposed to its mere form\" (emphasis added)).  Thus, \u00a71395hh(e)(1) simply says that the agency cannot retroactively apply nontechnical changes made to policies articulated in \"regulations, manual instructions, interpretative rules, statements of policy, or guidelines of general applicability.\"  The provision before us deals with an entirely different subject, namely, the use of notice-and-comment procedures.  And the word \"substantive\" in this context has a different and significantly narrower scope.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court also points to the fact that the Medicare Act cross-references the APA's good-cause exception.  Had Congress wanted to pick up the APA's exclusion of interpretive rules, the Court says, it could simply have cross-referenced the APA's interpretive-rule exception as well.  Ante, at 9-10.  As a practical matter, the legislative history suggests that the absence of a cross-reference is a particularly unreliable guide to congressional intent in this case.  The initial version of the bill passed by the House of Representatives unambiguously sought to broaden the scope of the APA.  See supra, at 7\u22128.  Rather than starting anew, the Conference Committee retained some of the language from the House's version but revised it to reflect the APA's notion of a substantive rule.  See ibid. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even putting the drafting history aside, there are many reasons why Congress might have chosen to spell out the governing standard rather than rest upon an explicit cross-reference to a portion of the APA.  Section 1395hh(a)(2), for example, reflects Congress' judgment that rulemaking is necessary only for a certain subset of substantive rules--namely, those governing \"the scope of benefits, the payment for services, or the eligibility\" for benefits or services.  A simple cross-reference to the APA's interpretive-rule exception would not have adequately captured this judgment.  The APA's exception would have exempted interpretive rules, but Congress also wanted to exempt those substantive rules that do not govern benefits, payment, or eligibility.  True, Congress could have produced the same result by first amending the statute to require notice-and-comment for any regulation governing benefits, payment, or eligibility and then cross-referencing the interpretive-rule exception.  But the language of \u00a71395hh(a)(2) accomplishes both of those tasks at once.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And even were that not so, there is no rule requiring Congress to use cross-references.  As I have explained, the Medicare Act's notice-and-comment provisions already operate by way of three cross-linked subsections.  See supra, at 2\u22123.  Given the complexity of this scheme, I would not second-guess Congress' decision not to add yet another cross-reference here.  \n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the statute's context, its language, its history, and related practical consequences, I believe that Congress intended the provision before us to apply to all substantive rules, irrespective of the labels that the agency affixed.  Congress did not, however, intend the provision to require notice and comment for interpretive rules that, by definition, lack the force and effect of law.  I fear that the Court, in rejecting this interpretation, has improperly (and needlessly) \"ignore[d] persuasive evidence of Congress' actual purpose.\"  West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83, 115 (1991) (Stevens, J., dissenting); cf. Johnson v. United States, 163 F. 30, 32 (CA1 1908) (Holmes, J.) (\"[I]t is not an adequate discharge of duty for courts to say: We see what you are driving at, but you have not said it, and therefore we shall go on as before\").  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If I am right, and if the Court's opinion will cause serious confusion or delay, Congress can, through legislation, fix the Court's mistake.  \"But legislative action takes time; Congress has much to do; and other matters .\u00a0.\u00a0. may warrant higher legislative priority.\"  Milner v. Department of Navy, 562 U.\u00a0S. 562, 592 (2011) (Breyer, J., dissenting).  Rather than requiring Congress to \"revisit the matter\" and \"restate its purpose in more precise English,\" Casey, 499 U. S., at 115 (Stevens, J., dissenting), I would hold that the Medicare Act only requires notice and comment for what this Court has traditionally considered to be substantive rules.  I would remand for the Court of Appeals to decide in the first instance whether the agency's decision in this case qualifies as a substantive or an interpretive rule.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Nor does \u00a71395hh(e)(1) imply that the statute is using \"regulations\" and \"interpretative rules\" to mean different things.  Post, at 4-5.  True, that provision refers to \"regulations, manual instructions, interpretative rules, statements of policy, or guidelines of general applicability.\"  But contrary to the dissent's suggestion that each item in the list \"refers to something different,\" post, at 5, the items appear to have substantial overlap.  For example, many manual instructions surely qualify as guidelines of general applicability; and, as explained above, the statute explicitly requires some statements of policy to be issued as regulations.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Nor is it obvious that the dissent's approach would provide significantly clearer guidance.  Lower courts have often observed \"that it is quite difficult to distinguish between substantive and interpretative rules,\" Syncor Int'l Corp. v. Shalala, 127 F.\u00a03d 90, 93 (CADC 1997), and precisely where to draw the boundary has been a subject \"of much scholarly and judicial debate,\" Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.\u00a0S. 92, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 3).\n\n\n","6":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBIESTEK v. BERRYHILL, ACTING COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY(2019)\nNo. 17-1184\nArgued: December 4, 2018Decided: April 1, 2019\n\n\nPetitioner Michael Biestek, a former construction worker, applied for social security disability benefits, claiming he could no longer work due to physical and mental disabilities.  The Social Security Administration (SSA) assigned an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) to conduct a hearing, at which the ALJ had to determine whether Biestek could successfully transition to less physically demanding work.  For guidance on that issue, the ALJ heard testimony from a vocational expert regarding the types of jobs Biestek could still perform and the number of such jobs that existed in the national economy.  See 20 CFR \u00a7\u00a7404.1560(c)(1), 416.960(c)(1).  On cross-examination, Biestek's attorney asked the expert \"where [she was] getting [her numbers] from,\" and the expert explained they were from her own individual labor market surveys.  Biestek's attorney then requested that the expert turn over the surveys.  The expert declined.  The ALJ ultimately denied Biestek benefits, basing his conclusion on the expert's testimony about the number of jobs available to him.  Biestek sought review in federal court, where an ALJ's factual findings are \"conclusive\" if supported by \"substantial evidence,\" 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7405(g).  The District Court rejected Biestek's argument that the expert's testimony could not possibly constitute substantial evidence because she had declined to produce her supporting data.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: A vocational expert's refusal to provide private market-survey data upon the applicant's request does not categorically preclude the testimony from counting as \"substantial evidence.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Substantial evidence is \"more than a mere scintilla,\" and means only \"such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\"  Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.\u00a0S. 197, 229.  Biestek proposes a categorical rule that the testimony of a vocational expert who refuses a request for supporting data about job availability can never clear that bar.  To assess that proposal, the Court begins with the parties' common ground: Assuming no demand, a vocational expert's testimony may count as substantial evidence even when unaccompanied by supporting data.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If that is true, is it not obvious why one additional fact--a refusal to a request for that data--should make an expert's testimony categorically inadequate.  In some cases, the refusal to disclose data, considered along with other shortcomings, will undercut an expert's credibility and prevent a court from finding that \"a reasonable mind\" could accept the expert's testimony.  But in other cases, the refusal will have no such consequence.  Similarly, the refusal will sometimes interfere with effective cross-examination, which a reviewing court may consider in deciding how much to credit an expert's opinion.  But other times, even without supporting data, an applicant will be able to probe the strength of the expert's testimony on cross-examination.  Ultimately, Biestek's error lies in his pressing for a categorical rule, applying to every case in which a vocational expert refuses a request for underlying data.  The inquiry, as is usually true in determining the substantiality of evidence, is case-by-case.  It takes into account all features of the vocational expert's testimony, as well as the rest of the administrative record, and defers to the presiding ALJ, who has seen the hearing up close.

To determine whether an applicant is entitled to benefits, the agency may hold an informal hearing examining (among other things) the kind and number of jobs available for someone with the applicant's disability and other characteristics.  The agency's factual findings on that score are \"conclusive\" in judicial review of the benefits decision so long as they are supported by \"substantial evidence.\"  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7405(g).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case arises from the SSA's reliance on an expert's testimony about the availability of certain jobs in the economy.  The expert largely based her opinion on private market-survey data.  The question presented is whether her refusal to provide that data upon the applicant's request categorically precludes her testimony from counting as \"substantial evidence.\"  We hold it does not. \nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Michael Biestek once worked as a carpenter and general laborer on construction sites.  But he stopped working after he developed degenerative disc disease, Hepatitis C, and depression.  He then applied for social security disability benefits, claiming eligibility as of October 2009.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After some preliminary proceedings, the SSA assigned an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) to hold a hearing on Biestek's application.  Those hearings, as described in the Social Security Act, 49 Stat. 620, as amended, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7301 et\u00a0seq., are recognizably adjudicative in nature.  The ALJ may \"receive evidence\" and \"examine witnesses\" about the contested issues in a case.  \u00a7\u00a7405(b)(1), 1383(c) (1)(A).  But many of the rules governing such hearings are less rigid than those a court would follow.  See Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.\u00a0S. 389, 400-401 (1971).  An ALJ is to conduct a disability hearing in \"an informal, non-adversarial manner.\"  20 CFR \u00a7404.900(b) (2018); \u00a7416.1400(b).  Most notably, an ALJ may receive evidence in a disability hearing that \"would not be admissible in court.\"  \u00a7\u00a7404.950(c), 416.1450(c); see 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7405(b) (1), 1383(c)(1)(A).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To rule on Biestek's application, the ALJ had to determine whether the former construction laborer could successfully transition to less physically demanding work.  That required exploring two issues.  The ALJ needed to identify the types of jobs Biestek could perform notwithstanding his disabilities.  See 20 CFR \u00a7\u00a7404.1560(c)(1), 416.960(c)(1).  And the ALJ needed to ascertain whether those kinds of jobs \"exist[ed] in significant numbers in the national economy.\"  \u00a7\u00a7404.1560(c)(1), 416.960(c)(1); see \u00a7\u00a7404.1566, 416.966.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For guidance on such questions, ALJs often seek the views of \"vocational experts.\"  See \u00a7\u00a7404.1566(e), 416.966(e); SSA, Hearings, Appeals, and Litigation Law Manual I-2-5-50 (Aug. 29, 2014).  Those experts are professionals under contract with SSA to provide impartial testimony in agency proceedings.  See id., at I-2-1-31.B.1 (June 16, 2016); id., at I-2-5-48.  They must have \"expertise\" and \"current knowledge\" of \"[w]orking conditions and physical demands of various\" jobs; \"[k]nowledge of the existence and numbers of [those jobs] in the national economy\"; and \"[i]nvolvement in or knowledge of placing adult workers[\u00a0] with disabilities[\u00a0] into jobs.\"  Id., at I-2-1-31.B.1.  Many vocational experts simultaneously work in the private sector locating employment for persons with disabilities.  See C. Kubitschek & J. Dubin, Social Security Disability Law & Procedure in Federal Court \u00a73:89 (2019).  When offering testimony, the experts may invoke not only publicly available sources but also \"information obtained directly from employers\" and data otherwise developed from their own \"experience in job placement or career counseling.\"  Social Security Ruling, SSR 00-4p, 65 Fed. Reg. 75760 (2000).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Biestek's hearing, the ALJ asked a vocational expert named Erin O'Callaghan to identify a sampling of \"sedentary\" jobs that a person with Biestek's disabilities, education, and job history could perform.  Tr. 59 (July 21, 2015); see 20 CFR \u00a7\u00a7404.1567(a), 416.967(a) (defining a \"sedentary\" job as one that \"involves sitting\" and requires \"lifting no more than 10 pounds\").  O'Callaghan had served as a vocational expert in SSA proceedings for five years; she also had more than ten years' experience counseling people with disabilities about employment opportunities.  See Stachowiak v. Commissioner of Social Security, 2013 WL 593825, *1 (ED Mich., Jan. 11, 2013); Record in No. 16-10422 (ED Mich.), Doc. 17-13, p. 1274 (resume).  In response to the ALJ's query, O'Callaghan listed sedentary jobs \"such as a bench assembler [or] sorter\" that did not require many skills.  Tr. 58-59.  And she further testified that 240,000 bench assembler jobs and 120,000 sorter jobs existed in the national economy.  See ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On cross-examination, Biestek's attorney asked O'Callaghan \"where [she was] getting those [numbers] from.\"  Id., at 71.  O'Callaghan replied that they came from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and her \"own individual labor market surveys.\"  Ibid.  The lawyer then requested that O'Callaghan turn over the private surveys so he could review them.  Ibid.  O'Callaghan responded that she wished to keep the surveys confidential because they were \"part of [her] client files.\"  Id., at 72.  The lawyer suggested that O'Callaghan could \"take the clients' names out.\"  Ibid.  But at that point the ALJ interjected that he \"would not require\" O'Callaghan to produce the files in any form.  Ibid.  Biestek's counsel asked no further questions about the basis for O'Callaghan's assembler and sorter numbers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the hearing concluded, the ALJ issued a decision granting Biestek's application in part and denying it in part.  According to the ALJ, Biestek was entitled to benefits beginning in May 2013, when his advancing age (he turned fifty that month) adversely affected his ability to find employment.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 19a, 112a-113a.  But before that time, the ALJ held, Biestek's disabilities should not have prevented a \"successful adjustment to other work.\"  Id., at 110a-112a.  The ALJ based that conclusion on O'Callaghan's testimony about the availability in the economy of \"sedentary unskilled occupations such as bench assembler [or] sorter.\"  Id., at 111a (emphasis deleted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Biestek sought review in federal court of the ALJ's denial of benefits for the period between October 2009 and May 2013.  On judicial review, an ALJ's factual findings--such as the determination that Biestek could have found sedentary work--\"shall be conclusive\" if supported by \"substantial evidence.\"  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7405(g); see supra,  at 1.  Biestek contended that O'Callaghan's testimony could not possibly constitute such evidence because she had declined, upon request, to produce her supporting data.  See Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment in No. 16-10422 (ED Mich.), Doc. 22, p. 23.  But the District Court rejected that argument.  See 2017 WL 1173775, *2 (Mar. 30, 2017).  And the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  See Biestek v. Commissioner of Social Security, 880 F.\u00a03d 778 (2018).  That court recognized that the Seventh Circuit had adopted the categorical rule Biestek proposed, precluding a vocational expert's testimony from qualifying as substantial if the expert had declined an applicant's request to provide supporting data.  See id., at 790 (citing McKinnie v. Barnhart, 368 F.\u00a03d 907, 910-911 (2004)).  But that rule, the Sixth Circuit observed in joining the ranks of unconvinced courts, \"ha[d] not been a popular export.\"  880 F.\u00a03d, at 790 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And no more is it so today.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The phrase \"substantial evidence\" is a \"term of art\" used throughout administrative law to describe how courts are to review agency factfinding.  T-Mobile South, LLC v. Roswell, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 7).  Under the substantial-evidence standard, a court looks to an existing administrative record and asks whether it contains \"sufficien[t] evidence\" to support the agency's factual determinations.  Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.\u00a0S. 197, 229 (1938) (emphasis deleted).  And whatever the meaning of \"substantial\" in other contexts, the threshold for such evidentiary sufficiency is not high.  Substantial evidence, this Court has said, is \"more than a mere scintilla.\"  Ibid.; see, e.g., Perales, 402 U.\u00a0S., at 401 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It means--and means only--\"such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\"  Consolidated Edison, 305 U.\u00a0S., at 229.  See Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U.\u00a0S. 150, 153 (1999) (comparing the substantial-evidence standard to the deferential clearly-erroneous standard).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, Biestek argues that the testimony of a vocational expert who (like O'Callaghan) refuses a request for supporting data about job availability can never clear the substantial-evidence bar.  See Brief for Petitioner 21-34.  As that formulation makes clear, Biestek's proposed rule is categorical, rendering expert testimony insufficient to sustain an ALJ's factfinding whenever such a refusal has occurred.1  But Biestek hastens to add two caveats.  The first is to clarify what the rule is not, the second to stress where its limits lie.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Biestek initially takes pains--and understandably so--to distinguish his argument from a procedural claim.  Reply Brief 12-14.  At no stage in this litigation, Biestek says, has he ever espoused \"a free-standing procedural rule under which a vocational expert would always have to produce [her underlying data] upon request.\"  Id., at 2.  That kind of rule exists in federal court: There, an expert witness must produce all data she has considered in reaching her conclusions.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(a)(2)(B).  But as Biestek appreciates, no similar requirement applies in SSA hearings.  As explained above, Congress intended those proceedings to be \"informal\" and provided that the \"strict rules of evidence, applicable in the courtroom, are not to\" apply.  Perales, 402 U.\u00a0S., at 400; see 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7405(b)(1); supra, at 2.  So Biestek does not press for a \"procedural rule\" governing \"the means through which an evidentiary record [must be] created.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 6; Reply Brief 13.  Instead, he urges a \"substantive rule\" for \"assess[ing] the quality and quantity of [record] evidence\"--which would find testimony like O'Callaghan's inadequate, when taken alone, to support an ALJ's factfinding.  Id., at 12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Biestek also emphasizes a limitation within that proposed rule.  For the rule to kick in, the applicant must make a demand for the expert's supporting data.  See Brief for Petitioner i, 5, 18, 40, 55; Tr. of Oral Arg. 25-26.  Consider two cases in which vocational experts rely on, but do not produce, nonpublic information.  In the first, the applicant asks for the data; in the second, not.  According to Biestek, the expert's testimony in the first case cannot possibly clear the substantial-evidence bar; but in the second case, it may well do so, even though the administrative record is otherwise the same.  And Biestek underscores that this difference in outcome has nothing to do with waiver or forfeiture: As he acknowledges, an applicant \"cannot waive the substantial evidence standard.\"  Id., at 27.  It is just that the evidentiary problem arises from the expert's refusal of a demand, not from the data's absence alone.  In his words, the testimony \"can constitute substantial evidence if unchallenged, but not if challenged.\"  Reply Brief 18.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To assess Biestek's proposal, we begin with the parties' common ground: Assuming no demand, a vocational expert's testimony may count as substantial evidence even when unaccompanied by supporting data.  Take an example.  Suppose an expert has top-of-the-line credentials, including professional qualifications and many years' experience; suppose, too, she has a history of giving sound testimony about job availability in similar cases (perhaps before the same ALJ).  Now say that she testifies about the approximate number of various sedentary jobs an applicant for benefits could perform.  She explains that she arrived at her figures by surveying a range of representative employers; amassing specific information about their labor needs and employment of people with disabilities; and extrapolating those findings to the national economy by means of a well-accepted methodology.  She answers cogently and thoroughly all questions put to her by the ALJ and the applicant's lawyer.  And nothing in the rest of the record conflicts with anything she says.  But she never produces her survey data.  Still, her testimony would be the kind of evidence--far \"more than a mere scintilla\"--that \"a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support\" a finding about job availability.  Consolidated Edison, 305 U.\u00a0S., at 229.  Of course, the testimony would be even better--more reliable and probative--if she had produced supporting data; that would be a best practice for the SSA and its experts.2  And of course, a different (maybe less qualified) expert failing to produce such data might offer testimony that is so feeble, or contradicted, that it would fail to clear the substantial-evidence bar.  The point is only--as, again, Biestek accepts--that expert testimony can sometimes surmount that bar absent underlying data.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if that is true, why should one additional fact--a refusal to a request for that data--make a vocational expert's testimony categorically inadequate?  Assume that an applicant challenges our hypothetical expert to turn over her supporting data; and assume the expert declines because the data reveals private information about her clients and making careful redactions will take a fair bit of time.  Nothing in the expert's refusal changes her testimony (as described above) about job availability.  Nor does it alter any other material in the record.  So if our expert's opinion was sufficient--i.e., qualified as substantial evidence--before the refusal, it is hard to see why the opinion has to be insufficient afterward.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Biestek suggests two reasons for that non-obvious result.  First, he contends that the expert's rejection of a request for backup data necessarily \"cast[s her testimony] into doubt.\"  Reply Brief 16.  And second, he avers that the refusal inevitably \"deprives an applicant of the material necessary for an effective cross-examination.\"  Id., at 2.  But Biestek states his arguments too broadly--and the nuggets of truth they contain cannot justify his proposed flat rule.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider Biestek's claim about how an expert's refusal undercuts her credibility.  Biestek here invokes the established idea of an \"adverse inference\": If an expert declines to back up her testimony with information in her control, then the factfinder has a reason to think she is hiding something.  See id., at 16 (citing cases).  We do not dispute that possibility--but the inference is far from always required.  If an ALJ has no other reason to trust the expert, or finds her testimony iffy on its face, her refusal of the applicant's demand for supporting data may properly tip the scales against her opinion.  (Indeed, more can be said: Even if the applicant makes no demand, such an expert's withholding of data may count against her.)  But if (as in our prior hypothetical example, see supra, at 7-8) the ALJ views the expert and her testimony as otherwise trustworthy, and thinks she has good reason to keep her data private, her rejection of an applicant's demand need not make a difference.  So too when a court reviews the ALJ's decision under the deferential substantial-evidence standard.  In some cases, the refusal to disclose data, considered along with other shortcomings, will prevent a court from finding that \"a reasonable mind\" could accept the expert's testimony.  Consolidated Edison, 305 U.\u00a0S., at 229. But in other cases, that refusal will have no such consequence.  Even taking it into account, the expert's opinion will qualify as \"more than a mere scintilla\" of evidence supporting the ALJ's conclusion.  Which is to say it will count, contra Biestek, as substantial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And much the same is true of Biestek's claim that an expert's refusal precludes meaningful cross-examination.  We agree with Biestek that an ALJ and reviewing court may properly consider obstacles to such questioning when deciding how much to credit an expert's opinion.  See Perales, 402 U.\u00a0S., at 402-406.  But Biestek goes too far in suggesting that the refusal to provide supporting data always interferes with effective cross-examination, or that the absence of such testing always requires treating an opinion as unreliable.  Even without specific data, an applicant may probe the strength of testimony by asking an expert about (for example) her sources and methods--where she got the information at issue and how she analyzed it and derived her conclusions.  See, e.g., Chavez v. Berryhill, 895 F.\u00a03d 962, 969-970 (CA7 2018).  And even without significant testing, a factfinder may conclude that testimony has sufficient indicia of reliability to support a conclusion about whether an applicant could find work.  Indeed, Biestek effectively concedes both those points in cases where supporting data is missing, so long as an expert has not refused an applicant's demand.  See supra, at 7.  But once that much is acknowledged, Biestek's argument cannot hold.  For with or without an express refusal, the absence of data places the selfsame limits on cross-examination.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where Biestek goes wrong, at bottom, is in pressing for a categorical rule, applying to every case in which a vocational expert refuses a request for underlying data.  Sometimes an expert's withholding of such data, when combined with other aspects of the record, will prevent her testimony from qualifying as substantial evidence.  That would be so, for example, if the expert has no good reason to keep the data private and her testimony lacks other markers of reliability.  But sometimes the reservation of data will have no such effect.  Even though the applicant might wish for the data, the expert's testimony still will clear (even handily so) the more-than-a-mere-scintilla threshold.  The inquiry, as is usually true in determining the substantiality of evidence, is case-by-case.  See, e.g., Perales, 402 U.\u00a0S., at 399, 410 (rejecting a categorical rule pertaining to the substantiality of medical reports in a disability hearing).  It takes into account all features of the vocational expert's testimony, as well as the rest of the administrative record.  And in so doing, it defers to the presiding ALJ, who has seen the hearing up close.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That much is sufficient to decide this case.  Biestek petitioned us only to adopt the categorical rule we have now rejected.  He did not ask us to decide whether, in the absence of that rule, substantial evidence supported the ALJ in denying him benefits.  Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals' judgment.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nSotomayor, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1184\nMICHAEL J. BIESTEK, PETITIONER v. NANCY A. BERRYHILL, ACTING COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit\n[April 1, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court focuses on the propriety of a categorical rule that precludes private data that a vocational expert refuses to provide upon request from qualifying as \" 'substantial evidence.' \"  See ante, at 1. I agree with Justice Gorsuch that the question presented by this case encompasses an inquiry not just into the propriety of a categorical rule in such circumstances but also into whether the substantial-evidence standard was met in the narrower circumstances of Michael Biestek's case.  See post, at 6-7 (dissenting opinion).  For the reasons that Justice Gorsuch sets out, the vocational expert's conclusory testimony in this case, offered without even a hint of support, did not constitute substantial evidence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once Biestek established that he had impairments, the agency bore the burden of proving that work opportunities were available to someone with his disabilities and individual characteristics.  20 CFR \u00a7 416.912(b)(3) (2018).  To meet that burden, the agency relied on a vocational expert's testimony that Biestek could qualify for one of 240,000 \"bench assembler\" jobs or 120,000 \"sorter\" jobs nationwide.  Tr. 59 (July 21, 2015).  The expert said that those numbers were based in part on her \"professional experience.\"  Id., at 61.  When Biestek's counsel understandably asked for more details, the expert said only that she got the numbers from a publicly available source as well as from her \"own individual labor market surveys\" that were part of confidential client files.  Id., at 71; see id., at 67, 71-72.  Biestek's counsel asked if the names in the files could be redacted, but the administrative law judge (ALJ) interrupted and ruled that she would not require the surveys to be produced in redacted form.  Id., at 72; see also id., at 67.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the ALJ would have allowed Biestek's counsel to ask followup questions about the basis for the testimony at that point, and perhaps Biestek's counsel should have tried to do so.  But a Social Security proceeding is \"inquisitorial rather than adversarial.\"  Sims v. Apfel, 530 U.\u00a0S. 103, 110-111 (2000); see 20 CFR \u00a7\u00a7404.900(b), 416.1400(b).  The ALJ acts as \"an examiner charged with developing the facts,\" Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.\u00a0S. 389, 410 (1971), and has a duty to \"develop the arguments both for and against granting benefits,\" Sims, 530 U.\u00a0S., at 111; see also Social Security Ruling, SSR 00-4P, 65 Fed. Reg. 75760 (2000) (noting \"the adjudicator's duty to fully develop the record\").  Here, instead of taking steps to ensure that the claimant had a basis from which effective cross-examination could be made and thus the record could be developed, the ALJ cut off that process by intervening when Biestek's counsel asked about the possibility of redaction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The result was that the expert offered no detail whatsoever on the basis for her testimony.  She did not say whom she had surveyed, how many surveys she had conducted, or what information she had gathered, nor did she offer any other explanation of the data on which she relied.  In conjunction with the failure to proffer the surveys themselves, the expert's conclusory testimony alone could not constitute substantial evidence to support the ALJ's factfinding.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I agree with much of Justice Gorsuch's reasoning.  I emphasize that I do not foreclose the possibility that a more developed record could justify an ALJ's reliance on vocational-expert testimony in some circumstances even if the expert does not produce records underlying that testimony on request.  An expert may have legitimate reasons for not turning over data, such as the burden of gathering records or confidentiality concerns that redaction cannot address.  In those circumstances, as the majority suggests, the agency may be able to support an expert's testimony in ways other than by providing underlying data, such as by offering a fulsome description of the data and methodology on which the expert relies.  See ante, at 8. The agency simply did not do so here.\n\nGorsuch, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1184\nMICHAEL J. BIESTEK, PETITIONER v. NANCY A. BERRYHILL, ACTING COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit\n[April 1, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Walk for a moment in Michael Biestek's shoes.  As part of your application for disability benefits, you've proven that you suffer from serious health problems and can't return to your old construction job.  Like many cases, yours turns on whether a significant number of other jobs remain that someone of your age, education, and experience, and with your physical limitations, could perform.  When it comes to that question, the Social Security Administration bears the burden of proof.  To meet its burden in your case, the agency chooses to rest on the testimony of a vocational expert the agency hired as an independent contractor.  The expert asserts there are 120,000 \"sorter\" and 240,000 \"bench assembler\" jobs nationwide that you could perform even with your disabilities.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where did these numbers come from?  The expert says she relied on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and her own private surveys.  But it turns out the Bureau can't be the source; its numbers aren't that specific.  The source--if there is a source--must be the expert's private surveys.  So you ask to see them.  The expert refuses--she says they're part of confidential client files.  You reply by pointing out that any confidential client information can be redacted.  But rather than ordering the data produced, the hearing examiner, herself a Social Security Administration employee, jumps in to say that won't be necessary.  Even without the data, the examiner states in her decision on your disability claim, the expert's say-so warrants \"great weight\" and is more than enough evidence to deny your application.  Case closed.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a-112a, 118a-119a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Would you say this decision was based on \"substantial evidence\"?  Count me with Judge Easterbrook and the Seventh Circuit in thinking that an agency expert's bottom-line conclusion, supported only by a claim of readily available evidence that she refuses to produce on request, fails to satisfy the government's statutory burden of producing substantial evidence of available other work.  See Don- ahue v. Barnhart, 279 F.\u00a03d 441, 446 (CA7 2002); McKinnie v. Barnhart, 368 F.\u00a03d 907, 910-911 (CA7 2004) (per curiam).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Start with the legal standard.  The Social Security Act of 1935 requires the agency to support its conclusions about the number of available jobs with \"substantial evidence.\"  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7405(g).  Congress borrowed that standard from civil litigation practice, where reviewing courts may overturn a jury verdict when the record lacks \"substantial evidence\"--that is, evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to reach the verdict it did.  Much the same standard governs summary judgment and directed verdict practice today.  See 2 K. Hickman & R. Pierce, Administrative Law \u00a710.2.1, pp.\u00a01082-1085 (6th ed. 2019); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.\u00a0S. 242, 252 (1986); NLRB v. Columbian Enameling & Stamping Co., 306 U.\u00a0S. 292, 300 (1939).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, consider what we know about this standard.  Witness testimony that's clearly wrong as a matter of fact cannot be substantial evidence.  See Scott v. Harris, 550 U.\u00a0S. 372, 380 (2007).  Falsified evidence isn't substantial evidence.  See, e.g., Firemen's and Policemen's Civil Serv. Comm'n v. Brinkmeyer, 662 S.\u00a0W.\u00a02d 953, 956 (Tex. 1984).  Speculation isn't substantial evidence.  See, e.g., Cao He Lin v. Department of Justice, 428 F.\u00a03d 391, 400 (CA2 2005); Alpo Petfoods, Inc. v. NLRB, 126 F.\u00a03d 246, 250 (CA4 1997).  And, maybe most pointedly for our purposes, courts have held that a party or expert who supplies only conclusory assertions fails this standard too.  See, e.g., Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U.\u00a0S. 871, 888 (1990) (\"The object of [summary-judgment practice] is not to replace conclusory allegations of the complaint or answer with conclusory allegations of an affidavit\"); Regents of Univ. of Minn. v. AGA Medical Corp., 717 F.\u00a03d 929, 941 (CA Fed. 2013) (\"conclusory expert assertions cannot raise triable issues of material fact\") (collecting cases); Mid-State Fertilizer Co. v. Exchange Nat. Bank of Chicago, 877 F.\u00a02d 1333, 1339 (CA7 1989) (\"An expert who supplies nothing but a bottom line supplies nothing of value to the judicial process\"); Sea Robin Pipeline Co. v. FERC, 795 F.\u00a02d 182, 188 (CADC 1986) (\"[I]nordinate faith in the conclusory assertions of an expert .\u00a0.\u00a0. cannot satisfy the requirement [of] substantial evidence\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If clearly mistaken evidence, fake evidence, speculative evidence, and conclusory evidence aren't substantial evidence, the evidence here shouldn't be either.  The case hinges on an expert who (a) claims to possess evidence on the dispositive legal question that can be found nowhere else in the record, but (b) offers only a conclusion about its contents, and (c) refuses to supply the evidence when requested without showing that it can't readily be made available.  What reasonable factfinder would rely on evidence like that?  It seems just the sort of conclusory evidence courts have long held insufficient to meet the substantial evidence standard.  And thanks to its conclusory nature, for all anyone can tell it may have come out of a hat--and, thus, may wind up being clearly mistaken, fake, or speculative evidence too.  Unsurprisingly given all this, the government fails to cite even a single authority blessing the sort of evidence here as substantial evidence, despite the standard's long history and widespread use.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Veteran Social Security practitioners must be feeling a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.  Half a century ago, Judge Henry Friendly encountered Kerner v. Flemming, 283 F.\u00a02d 916 (CA2 1960).  There, the agency's hearing examiner offered \"nothing save [his own] speculation\" to support his holding that the claimant \"could in fact obtain substantial gainful employment.\"  Id., at 921.  The Second Circuit firmly explained that this kind of conclusory claim is insufficient to meet the substantial evidence standard.  In response, the Social Security Administration began hiring vocational experts, like the one in this case, to document the number of jobs available to a given claimant.  But if the government can do what it did in this case, it's hard to see what all the trouble was for.  The agency might still rest decisions on a hunch--just so long as the hunch comes from an agency contractor rather than an agency examiner.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead of addressing the realities of this case, the government asks us to imagine a hypothetical one.  Assume, it says, that no one had requested the underlying data.  In those circumstances, the government points out, even Mr. Biestek appears to accept that the agency's decision could have stood.  And if that's true, the government asks, why should it make a difference if we add only one additional fact--the expert's refusal to produce the data?  See ante, at 7-9 (presenting the same argument).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer is an old and familiar one.  The refusal to supply readily available evidentiary support for a conclusion strongly suggests that the conclusion is, well, unsupported.  See, e.g., Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, 306 U.\u00a0S. 208, 226 (1939) (\"The production of weak evidence when strong is available can lead only to the conclusion that the strong would have been adverse\"); Clifton v. United States, 4 How. 242, 248 (1846) (the withholding of \"more direct\" proof suggests that \"if the more perfect exposition had been given it would have laid open deficiencies and objections which the more obscure and uncertain testimony was intended to conceal\"); 31A C.\u00a0J.\u00a0S., Evidence \u00a7156(2), p.\u00a0402 (1964) (\"The unfavorable inference .\u00a0.\u00a0. is especially applicable where the party withholding the evidence has had notice or has been ordered to produce it\").  Meanwhile, a similar inference may not arise if no one's bothered to ask for the evidence, or if the evidence is shown to be unavailable for a good reason.  In cases like those, there may be just too many other plausible and innocent excuses for the evidence's absence.  Maybe, for example, nobody bothered to seek the underlying data because everyone knew what it would show.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fine, the Court responds, all that's true enough.  But even if we accept that an expert's failure to produce the evidence underlying her conclusion may support an inference that her conclusion is unsupported, that doesn't mean such an inference must follow.  Whether an inference is appropriate depends on the facts of the particular case.  See ante, at 9-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But what more do we need to know about the facts of this case?  All of the relevant facts are undisputed, and it remains only to decide the legal question whether they meet the substantial evidence standard.  We know that the expert offered a firm and exact conclusion about the number of available jobs.  We know that the expert claimed to have private information to support her conclusion.  We know Mr. Biestek requested that information and we have no reason to think any confidentiality concerns could not have been addressed.  We know, too, that the hearing examiner had \"no other reason to trust the expert['s]\" numbers beyond her say-so.  Ibid.  Finally and looking to the law, we know that a witness's bare conclusion is regularly held insufficient to meet the substantial evidence threshold--and we know that the government hasn't cited a single case finding substantial evidence on so little.  This is exactly the sort of case where an adverse inference should \"tip the scales.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With so much now weighing against the government, everything seems to turn on a final hypothetical.  Now we are asked to imagine that the expert had offered detailed oral testimony about the withheld data.  Her testimony was so detailed, we are asked to suppose, that Mr. Biestek could have thoroughly tested the data's reliability through cross-examination.  (You might wonder just how effective this cross-examination could be if Mr. Biestek didn't have access to the data.  But overlook that.)  Surely in those circumstances it wouldn't matter whether the expert failed to produce the data even in bad faith.  Any failure to produce would be harmless as a matter of law because the expert's testimony, all by itself, would amount to substantial evidence on which a rational factfinder might rely.  Ante, at 10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The problem is that this imaginary case has nothing to teach us about our real one.  In Mr. Biestek's case, it is undisputed that the expert offered only a bare conclusion about the number of available jobs.  No other relevant testimony was offered or received: no testimony about the underlying data, no testimony about its specific sources, no testimony about its reliability.  In our real case, there is simply no way to shrug off the failure to produce the data as harmless error.  To the contrary, and as we have seen, cases like this routinely fail to satisfy the substantial evidence standard.  And if the government has a \"duty to fully develop the record,\" ante, at 2 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting), that conclusion should follow all the more strongly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What leads the Court to a different conclusion?  It says that it views Mr. Biestek's petition as raising only the \"categorical\" question whether an expert's failure to produce underlying data always and in \"every case\" precludes her testimony from qualifying as substantial evidence.  Ante, at 1, 9-11.  And once the question is ratcheted up to that level of abstraction, of course it is easy enough to shoot it down: just point to a series of hypothetical cases where the record contains additional justification for the expert's failure to produce or additional evidence to support her opinion.  In such counterfactual cases, the failure to produce either would not be enough to give rise to an adverse inference under traditional legal principles or could be held harmless as a matter of law.  See ante, at 7-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But as I understand Mr. Biestek's submission, it does not require an all-or-nothing approach that would cover \"every case.\"  As the Court acknowledges, Mr. Biestek has focused us \"on the Seventh Circuit's categorical rule.\"  Ante, at 6, n.\u00a01.  And that \"rule\" targets the narrower \"category\" of circumstances we have here--where an expert \"\u00a0'give[s] a bottom line,'\u00a0\" fails to provide evidence \"underlying that bottom line\" when challenged, and fails to show the evidence is unavailable.  McKinnie, 368 F.\u00a03d, at 911 (quoting Donahue, 279 F.\u00a03d, at 446).  What to do about that category falls well within the question presented: \"[w]hether a vocational expert's testimony can constitute substantial evidence of 'other work' .\u00a0.\u00a0. when the expert fails upon the applicant's request to provide the underlying data on which that testimony is premised.\"  Pet. for Cert. i.  The answer to that question may be \"always,\" \"never,\" or--as the Court itself seems to acknowledge--\"[s]ometimes.\"  Ante, at 11.  And if the answer is \"sometimes,\" the critical question becomes \"in what circumstances\"?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I suppose we could stop short and leave everyone guessing.  But another option is to follow the Seventh Circuit's lead, resolve the smaller yet still significant \"category\" of cases like the one before us, and in that way begin to offer lower courts meaningful guidance in this important area.  While I would not hesitate to take this course and make plain that cases like Mr. Biestek's fail the substantial evidence standard, I understand the Court today to choose the first option and leave these matters for another day.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is good news and bad news in this.  If my understanding of the Court's opinion is correct, the good news is that the Court remains open to the possibility that in real-world cases like Mr. Biestek's, lower courts may--and even should--find the substantial evidence test unmet.  The bad news is that we must wait to find out, leaving many people and courts in limbo in the meantime.  Cases with facts like Mr. Biestek's appear to be all too common.  See, e.g., Dubin, Overcoming Gridlock: Campbell After a Quarter-Century and Bureaucratically Rational Gap-Filling in Mass Justice Adjudication in the Social Security Administration's Disability Programs, 62 Admin. L. Rev. 937, 966 (2010).  And many courts have erred in them by finding the substantial evidence test met, as the Sixth Circuit did in the case now before us.  Some courts have even conflated the substantial evidence standard--a substantive standard governing what's needed to sustain a judgment as a matter of law--with procedural rules governing the admission of evidence.  These courts have mistakenly suggested that, because the Federal Rules of Evidence don't apply in Social Security proceedings, anything an expert says will suffice to meet the agency's burden of proof.  See, e.g., Welsh v. Commissioner of Social Security, 662 Fed. Appx. 105, 109-110 (CA3 2016); Bayliss v. Barnhart, 427 F.\u00a03d 1211, 1218, and n.\u00a04 (CA9 2005).  Definitively resolving this case would have provided more useful guidance for practitioners and lower courts that have struggled with a significant category of cases like Mr. Biestek's, all while affording him the relief the law promises in disputes like his.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The principle that the government must support its allegations with substantial evidence, not conclusions and secret evidence, guards against arbitrary executive decisionmaking.  See Friendly, \"Some Kind of Hearing,\" 123 U.\u00a0Pa. L.\u00a0Rev. 1267, 1313-1314 (1975).  Without it, people like Mr. Biestek are left to the mercy of a bureaucrat's caprice.  Over 100 years ago, in ICC v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 227 U.\u00a0S. 88 (1913), the government sought to justify an agency order binding private parties without producing the information on which the agency had relied.  The government argued that its findings should be \"presumed to have been supported.\"  Id., at 93.  In essence, the government sought the right to \"act upon any sort of secret evidence.\"  Gellhorn, Official Notice in Administrative Adjudication, 20 Texas L. Rev. 131, 145 (1941).  This Court did not approve of that practice then, and I would not have hesitated to make clear that we do not approve of it today.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0In contrast, the principal dissent cannot decide whether it favors such a categorical rule.  At first, Justice Gorsuch endorses the rule Biestek and the Seventh Circuit have proposed.  See post, at 2.  But in then addressing our opinion, he takes little or no issue with the reasoning we offer to show why that rule is too broad.  See post, at 4-7.  So the dissent tries to narrow the scope of Biestek's categorical rule--to only cases that look just like his.  See post, at 7-8.  And still more, it shelves all the \"categorical\" talk and concentrates on Biestek's case alone.  See post, at 1, 4-8.  There, Justice Gorsuch's dissent joins Justice Sotomayor's in concluding that the expert evidence in this case was insubstantial.  But as we later explain, see infra, at 11, Biestek did not petition us to resolve that factbound question; nor did his briefing and argument focus on anything other than the Seventh Circuit's categorical rule.  We confine our opinion accordingly.\nFootnote 2\u00a0The SSA itself appears to agree.  In the handbook given to vocational experts, the agency states: \"You should have available, at the hearing, any vocational resource materials that you are likely to rely upon\" because \"the ALJ may ask you to provide relevant portions of [those] materials.\"  SSA, Vocational Expert Handbook 37 (Aug. 2017), https:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/appeals\/public_experts\/Vocational_Experts_ (VE)_Handbook-508.pdf (as last visited Mar. 28, 2019).\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0I note that the agency's own handbook says that experts \"should have available, at the hearing, any vocational resource materials that [they] are likely to rely upon and should be able to thoroughly explain what resource materials [they] used and how [they] arrived at [their] opinions.\"  SSA, Vocational Expert Handbook 37 (Aug. 2017), https:\/\/www.ssa.gov\u00a0\/\u00a0appeals\u00a0\/\u00a0public_experts\u00a0\/\u00a0Vocational_Experts_(VE)_Handbook-508.pdf (as last visited Mar. 29, 2019).\n\n\n","7":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBNSF RAILWAY CO. v. LOOS(2019)\nNo. 17-1042\nArgued: November 6, 2018Decided: March 4, 2019\n\n\nRespondent Michael Loos sued petitioner BNSF Railway Company under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA) for injuries he received while working at BNSF's railyard.  A jury awarded him $126,212.78, ascribing $30,000 of that amount to wages lost during the time Loos was unable to work.  BNSF asserted that the lost wages constituted \"compensation\" taxable under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA) and asked to withhold $3,765 of the $30,000 to cover Loos's share of the RRTA taxes.  The District Court and the Eighth Circuit rejected the requested offset, holding that an award of damages compensating an injured railroad worker for lost wages is not taxable under the RRTA.\nHeld: \u00a0A railroad's payment to an employee for working time lost due to an on-the-job injury is taxable \"compensation\" under the RRTA.  Pp.\u00a02-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0In 1937, Congress created a self-sustaining retirement benefits system for railroad workers.  The RRTA funds the program by imposing a payroll tax on both railroads and their employees, referring to the railroad's contribution as an \"excise\" tax, 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73221, and the employee's share as an \"income\" tax, \u00a73201.  The Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) entitles railroad workers to various benefits.  Taxes under the RRTA and benefits under the RRA are measured by the employee's \"compensation,\" which both statutes define as \"any form of money remuneration paid to an individual for services rendered as an employee.\"  \u00a73231(e)(1); 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7231(h)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statutory foundation of the railroad retirement system mirrors that of the Social Security system.  The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes employers and employees to fund benefits distributed pursuant to the Social Security Act (SSA).  Tax and benefit amounts are determined by the worker's \"wages,\" the Social Security equivalent to \"compensation.\"  Both the FICA and the SSA define \"wages\" employing language resembling the RRTA and the RRA definitions of \"compensation.\"  The term \"wages\" means \"all remuneration\" for \"any service, of whatever nature, performed .\u00a0.\u00a0. by an employee.\"  26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73121(a)-(b) (FICA); see 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7409(a), 410(a) (SSA).  Pp.\u00a02-4. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Given the textual similarity between the definitions of \"compensation\" and \"wages,\" the decisions on the meaning of \"wages\" in Social Security Bd. v. Nierotko, 327 U.\u00a0S. 358, and United States v. Quality Stores, Inc., 572 U.\u00a0S. 141, inform this Court's comprehension of the RRTA term \"compensation.\"  In Nierotko, the Court held that \"wages\" embraced pay for active service as well as pay received for periods of absence from active service, 327 U.\u00a0S., at 366, and concluded that backpay for time lost due to \"the employer's wrong\" counted as \"wages,\" id., at 364.  In Quality Stores, the Court held that severance payments qualified as \"wages\" taxable under the FICA.  572 U.\u00a0S., at 146-147.  In line with these decisions, the Court holds that \"compensation\" under the RRTA encompasses not simply pay for active service but also pay for periods of absence from active service--provided that the remuneration in question stems from the \"employer-employee relationship.\"  Nierotko, 327 U.\u00a0S., at 366.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Damages awarded under the FELA for lost wages fit comfortably within this definition.  See BNSF R.\u00a0Co. v. Tyrrell, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___.  If a railroad negligently fails to maintain a safe railyard and a worker is injured as a result, the FELA requires the railroad to compensate the injured worker for working time lost due to the employer's wrongdoing.  FELA damages for lost wages, like backpay, are \"compensation\" taxable under the RRTA.  Pp.\u00a04-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0The Eighth Circuit construed \"compensation\" for RRTA purposes to mean only pay for active service, but this reading cannot be reconciled with Nierotko and Quality Stores.  In addition, the RRTA's pinpointed exclusions for certain types of payments for time lost signal that nonexcluded pay for time lost remains RRTA-taxable \"compensation.\"  Pp.\u00a07-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0Loos contends that \"compensation\" does not include payments made to compensate for an injury.  This reading, however, is at odds with Nierotko, which held that \"wages\" included backpay awarded to redress \"the loss of wages\" occasioned by \"the employer's wrong.\"  327 U.\u00a0S., at 364.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Loos also argues that the exclusion of personal injury damages from \"gross income\" for federal income tax purposes, see 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7104(a)(2), should carry over to the RRTA's tax on the \"income\" of railroad workers.  The RRTA, however, uses the term \"income\" merely to distinguish the \"income\" tax on an employee from the matching \"excise\" tax on a railroad.  Further, Congress specified not \"gross income\" but employee \"compensation\" as the tax base for RRTA taxes.  Congress did not exclude personal injury damages from \"compensation.\"  Pp.\u00a010-14.\n865 F. 3d 1106, reversed and remanded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.\u00a0J., and Breyer, Alito, Sotomayor, Kagan, and Kavanaugh, JJ., joined.

LOOS\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit\n[March 4, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent Michael Loos was injured while working at petitioner BNSF Railway Company's railyard.  Loos sued BNSF under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a751 et seq., and gained a $126,212.78 jury verdict.  Of that amount the jury ascribed $30,000 to wages lost during the time Loos was unable to work.  BNSF moved for an offset against the judgment.  The lost wages awarded Loos, BNSF asserted, constituted \"compensation\" taxable under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA), 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73201 et seq.  Therefore, BNSF urged, the railway was required to withhold a portion of the $30,000 attributable to lost wages to cover Loos's share of RRTA taxes, which came to $3,765.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit rejected the requested offset, holding that an award of damages compensating an injured railroad worker for lost wages is not taxable under the RRTA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question presented: Is a railroad's payment to an employee for working time lost due to an on-the-job injury taxable \"compensation\" under the RRTA, 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73231(e)(1)?  We granted review to resolve a division of opinion on the answer to that question.  584 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).  Compare Hance v. Norfolk S. R. Co., 571 F.\u00a03d 511, 523 (CA6 2009) (\"compensation\" includes pay for time lost); Phillips v. Chicago Central & Pacific R.\u00a0Co., 853 N.\u00a0W. 2d 636, 650-651 (Iowa 2014) (agency reasonably interpreted \"compensation\" as including pay for time lost); Heckman v. Burlington N. Santa Fe R. Co., 286 Neb. 453, 463, 837 N.\u00a0W. 2d 532, 540 (2013) (\"compensation\" includes pay for time lost), with 865 F.\u00a03d 1106, 1117-1118 (CA8 2017) (case below) (\"compensation\" does not include pay for time lost); Mickey v. BNSF R. Co., 437 S.\u00a0W. 3d 207, 218 (Mo. 2014) (\"compensation\" does not include FELA damages for lost wages).  We now hold that an award compensating for lost wages is subject to taxation under the RRTA.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1937, Congress created a self-sustaining retirement benefits system for railroad workers.  The system provides generous pensions as well as benefits \"correspon[ding] .\u00a0.\u00a0. to those an employee would expect to receive were he covered by the Social Security Act.\"  Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, 439 U.\u00a0S. 572, 575 (1979).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two statutes operate in concert to ensure that retired railroad workers receive their allotted pensions and benefits.  The first, the RRTA, funds the program by imposing a payroll tax on both railroads and their employees.  The RRTA refers to the railroad's contribution as an \"excise\" tax, 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73221, and describes the employee's share as an \"income\" tax, \u00a73201.  Congress assigned to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) responsibility for collecting both taxes.  \u00a7\u00a73501, 7801.1  The second statute, the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA), 50 Stat. 307, as restated and amended, 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7231 et\u00a0seq., entitles railroad workers to various benefits and prescribes eligibility requirements.  The RRA is administered by the Railroad Retirement Board.  See \u00a7231f(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taxes under the RRTA and benefits under the RRA are measured by the employee's \"compensation.\"  26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a73201, 3221; 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7231b.  The RRTA and RRA separately define \"compensation,\" but both statutes state that the term means \"any form of money remuneration paid to an individual for services rendered as an employee.\"  26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73231(e)(1); 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7231(h)(1).  This language has remained basically unchanged since the RRTA's enactment in 1937.  See Carriers Taxing Act of 1937 (1937 RRTA), \u00a71(e), 50 Stat. 436 (defining \"compensation\" as \"any form of money remuneration earned by an individual for services rendered as an employee\").  The RRTA excludes from \"compensation\" certain types of sick pay and disability pay.  See 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73231(e)(1), (4)(A).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The IRS's reading of the word \"compensation\" as it appears in the RRTA has remained constant.  One year after the RRTA's adoption, the IRS stated that \"compensation\" is not limited to pay for active service but reaches, as well, pay for periods of absence.  See 26 CFR \u00a7410.5 (1938).  This understanding has governed for more than eight decades.  As restated in the current IRS regulations, \"[t]he term compensation is not confined to amounts paid for active service, but includes amounts paid for an identifiable period during which the employee is absent from the active service of the employer.\"  \u00a731.3231(e)-1(a)(3) (2017).  In 1994, the IRS added, specifically, that \"compensation\" includes \"pay for time lost.\"  \u00a731.3231(e)-1(a)(4); see 59 Fed. Reg. 66188 (1994).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress created both the railroad retirement system and the Social Security system during the Great Depression primarily to ensure the financial security of members of the workforce when they reach old age.  See Wisconsin Central Ltd. v. United States, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 1); Helvering v. Davis, 301 U.\u00a0S. 619, 641 (1937).  Given the similarities in timing and purpose of the two programs, it is hardly surprising that their statutory foundations mirror each other.  Regarding Social Security, the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73101 et\u00a0seq., taxes employers and employees to fund benefits, which are distributed pursuant to the Social Security Act (SSA), 49 Stat. 620, as amended, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7301 et\u00a0seq.  Tax and benefit amounts are determined by the worker's \"wages,\" the Social Security equivalent to \"compensation.\"  See Davis, 301 U.\u00a0S., at 635-636.  Both the FICA and the SSA define \"wages\" employing language resembling the RRTA and the RRA definitions of \"compensation.\"  \"Wages\" under the FICA and the SSA mean \"all remuneration for employment,\" and \"employment,\" in turn, means \"any service, of whatever nature, performed .\u00a0.\u00a0. by an employee.\"  26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73121(a)-(b) (FICA); see 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7409(a), 410(a) (SSA).  Reading these prescriptions together, the term \"wages\" encompasses \"all remuneration\" for \"any service, of whatever nature, performed .\u00a0.\u00a0. by an employee.\"  Ibid.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To determine whether RRTA-qualifying \"compensation\" includes an award of damages for lost wages, we begin with the statutory text.2  The RRTA defines \"compensation\" as \"remuneration paid to an individual for services rendered as an employee.\"  26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73231(e)(1).  This definition, as just noted, is materially indistinguishable from the FICA's definition of \"wages\" to include \"remuneration\" for \"any service, of whatever nature, performed .\u00a0.\u00a0. by an employee.\"  \u00a73121.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the textual similarity between the definitions of \"compensation\" for railroad retirement purposes and \"wages\" for Social Security purposes, our decisions on the meaning of \"wages\" in Social Security Bd. v. Nierotko, 327 U.\u00a0S. 358 (1946), and United States v. Quality Stores, Inc., 572 U.\u00a0S. 141 (2014), inform our comprehension of the RRTA term \"compensation.\"  In Nierotko, the National Labor Relations Board found that an employee had been \"wrongfully discharged for union activity\" and awarded him backpay.  327 U.\u00a0S., at 359.  The Social Security Board refused to credit the backpay award in calculating the employee's benefits.  Id., at 365-366.  In the Board's view, \"wages\" covered only pay for active service.  Ibid.  We disagreed.  Emphasizing that the phrase \"any service .\u00a0.\u00a0. performed\" denotes \"breadth of coverage,\" we held that \"wages\" means remuneration for \"the entire employer-employee relationship\"; in other words, \"wages\" embraced pay for active service plus pay received for periods of absence from active service.  Id., at 366.  Backpay, we reasoned, counts as \"wages\" because it compensates for \"the loss of wages which the employee suffered from the employer's wrong.\"  Id., at 364.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Quality Stores, we again trained on the meaning of \"wages,\" reiterating that \"Congress chose to define wages .\u00a0.\u00a0. broadly.\"  572 U.\u00a0S., at 146 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Guided by Nierotko, Quality Stores held that severance payments qualified as \"wages\" taxable under the FICA.  \"[C]ommon sense,\" we observed, \"dictates that employees receive th[ose] payments 'for employment.'\u00a0\"  572 U.\u00a0S., at 146.  Severance payments, the Court spelled out, \"are made to employees only,\" \"are made in consideration for employment,\" and are calculated \"according to the function and seniority of the [terminated] employee.\"  Id., at 146-147.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In line with Nierotko, Quality Stores, and the IRS's long held construction, we hold that \"compensation\" under the RRTA encompasses not simply pay for active service but, in addition, pay for periods of absence from active service--provided that the remuneration in question stems from the \"employer-employee relationship.\"  Nierotko, 327 U.\u00a0S., at 366.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Damages awarded under the FELA for lost wages fit comfortably within this definition.  The FELA \"makes railroads liable in money damages to their employees for on-the-job injuries.\"  BNSF R. Co. v. Tyrrell, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 1); see 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a751.  If a railroad negligently fails to maintain a safe railyard and a worker is injured as a result, the FELA requires the railroad to compensate the injured worker for, inter alia, working time lost due to the employer's wrongdoing.  FELA damages for lost wages, then, are functionally equivalent to an award of backpay, which compensates an employee \"for a period of time during which\" the employee is \"wrongfully separated from his job.\"  Nierotko, 327 U.\u00a0S., at 364.  Just as Nierotko held that backpay falls within the definition of \"wages,\" ibid., we conclude that FELA damages for lost wages qualify as \"compensation\" and are therefore taxable under the RRTA.\nIII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Eighth Circuit construed \"compensation\" for RRTA purposes to mean only pay for \"services that an employee actually renders,\" in other words, pay for active service.  Consequently, the court held that \"compensation\" within the RRTA's compass did not reach pay for periods of absence.  865 F.\u00a03d, at 1117.  In so ruling, the Court of Appeals attempted to distinguish Nierotko and Quality Stores.  The Social Security decisions, the court said, were inapposite because the FICA \"taxes payment for 'employment,'\u00a0\" whereas the RRTA \"tax[es] payment for 'services.'\u00a0\"  865 F.\u00a03d, at 1117.  As noted, however, supra, at 3-4, the FICA defines \"employment\" in language resembling the RRTA in all relevant respects.  Compare 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73121(b) (FICA) (\"any service, of whatever nature, performed .\u00a0.\u00a0. by an employee\") with \u00a73231(e)(1) (RRTA) (\"services rendered as an employee\").  Construing RRTA \"compensation\" as less embracive than \"wages\" covered by the FICA would introduce an unwarranted disparity between terms Congress appeared to regard as equivalents.  The reasoning of Nierotko and Quality Stores, as we see it, resists the Eighth Circuit's swift writeoff.3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nierotko and Quality Stores apart, we would in any event conclude that the RRTA term \"compensation\" covers pay for time lost.  Restricting \"compensation\" to pay for active service, the Court of Appeals relied on statutory history and, in particular, the eventual deletion of two references to pay for time lost contained in early renditions of the RRTA.  See also post, at 6-7 (presenting the Eighth Circuit's statutory history argument).  To understand the Eighth Circuit's position, and why, in our judgment, that position does not withstand scrutiny, some context is in order.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On enactment of the RRTA in 1937, Congress made \"compensation\" taxable at the time it was earned and provided specific guidance on when pay for time lost should be \"deemed earned.\"  Congress instructed: \"The term 'compensation' means any form of money remuneration earned by an individual for services rendered as an employee .\u00a0.\u00a0. , including remuneration paid for time lost as an employee, but [such] remuneration .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be deemed earned in the month in which such time is lost.\"  1937 RRTA, \u00a71(e), 50 Stat. 436 (emphasis added).  In 1946, Congress clarified that the phrase \"pa[y] for time lost\" meant payment for \"an identifiable period of absence from the active service of the employer, including absence on account of personal injury.\"  Act of July 31, 1946 (1946 Act), \u00a72, 60 Stat. 722.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, originally, the RRTA stated that \"compensation\" included pay for time lost, and the language added in 1946 presupposed the same.  In subsequent amendments, however, Congress removed the references to pay for time lost.  First, in 1975, Congress made \"compensation\" taxable when paid rather than when earned.  Congress simultaneously removed the 1937 language that both referred to pay for time lost and specified when such pay should be \"deemed earned.\"  So amended, the definitional sentence, in its current form, reads: \"The term 'compensation' means any form of money remuneration paid to an individual for services rendered as an employee .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  Act of Aug. 9, 1975 (1975 Act), \u00a7204, 89 Stat. 466 (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, in 1983, Congress shifted the wage base for RRTA taxes from monthly \"compensation\" to annual \"compensation.\"  See Railroad Retirement Solvency Act of 1983 (1983 Act), \u00a7225, 97 Stat. 424-425.  Because the \"monthly wage bases for railroad retirement taxes [were being] changed to annual amounts,\" the House Report explained, the RRTA required \"[s]everal technical and conforming amendments.\"  H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 98-30, pt. 2, p. 29 (1983).  In a section of the 1983 Act titled \"Technical Amendments,\" Congress struck the subsection containing, among other provisions, the 1946 Act's clarification of pay for time lost.  1983 Act, \u00a7225, 97 Stat. 424-425.  In lieu of the deleted subsection, Congress inserted detailed instructions concerning the new annual wage base.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court of Appeals and the dissent see it, the 1975 and 1983 deletions show that \"compensation\" no longer includes pay for time lost.  865 F.\u00a03d, at 1119; see post, at 6-7.  We are not so sure.  The 1975 Act left unaltered the language at issue here, \"remuneration .\u00a0.\u00a0. for services rendered as an employee.\"  That Act also left intact the 1946 Act's description of pay for time lost.  Continuing after the 1975 Act, then, such pay remained RRTA-taxable \"compensation.\"  The 1983 Act, as billed by Congress, effected only \"[t]echnical [a]mendments\" relating to the change from monthly to annual computation of \"compensation.\"  Concerning the 1975 and 1983 alterations, the IRS concluded that Congress revealed no \"inten[tion] to exclude payments for time lost from compensation.\"  59 Fed. Reg. 66188 (1994).  We credit the IRS reading.  It would be passing strange for Congress to restrict substantially what counts as \"compensation\" in a manner so oblique.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the text of the RRTA continues to indicate that \"compensation\" encompasses pay for time lost.  The RRTA excludes from \"compensation\" a limited subset of payments for time lost, notably certain types of sick pay and disability pay.  See 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73231(e)(1), (4).  These enumerated exclusions would be entirely superfluous if, as the Court of Appeals held, the RRTA broadly excludes from \"compensation\" any and all pay received for time lost.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In justification of its confinement of RRTA-taxable receipts to pay for active service, the Court of Appeals also referred to the RRA.  The RRA, like the RRTA as enacted in 1937, states that \"compensation\" \"includ[es] remuneration paid for time lost as an employee\" and specifies that such pay \"shall be deemed earned in the month in which such time is lost.\"  45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7231(h)(1).  Pointing to the discrepancy between the RRA and the amended RRTA, which no longer contains the above-quoted language, the Court of Appeals concluded that Congress intended the RRA, but not the RRTA, to include pay for time lost.  Accord post, at 7.  Although \"\u00a0'[w]e usually presume differences in language .\u00a0.\u00a0. convey differences in meaning,'\u00a0\" Wisconsin Central, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4), Congress' failure to reconcile the RRA and the amended RRTA is inconsequential.  As just explained, the RRTA's pinpointed exclusions from RRTA taxation signal that nonexcluded pay for time lost remains RRTA-taxable \"compensation.\"\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead of adopting lockstep the Court of Appeals' interpretation, Loos takes a different approach.  In his view, echoed by the dissent, \"remuneration .\u00a0.\u00a0. for services rendered\" means the \"package of benefits\" an employer pays \"to retain the employee.\"  Brief for Respondent 37; post, at 3-4.  He therefore agrees with BNSF that benefits like sick pay and vacation pay are taxable \"compensation.\"  He contends, however, that FELA damages for lost wages are of a different order.  They are not part of an employee's \"package of benefits,\" he observes, and therefore should not count as \"compensation.\"  Such damages, Loos urges, \"compensate for an injury\" rather than for services rendered.  Brief for Respondent 20; post, at 3-4.  Loos argues in the alternative that even if voluntary settlements qualify as \"compensation,\" \"involuntary payment[s]\" in the form of damages do not.  Brief for Respondent 33.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our decision in Nierotko undermines Loos's argument that, unlike sick pay and vacation pay, payments \"compensat[ing] for an injury,\" Brief for Respondent 20, are not taxable under the RRTA. We held in Nierotko that an award of backpay compensating an employee for his wrongful discharge ranked as \"wages\" under the SSA.  That was so, we explained, because the backpay there awarded to the employee redressed \"the loss of wages\" occasioned by \"the employer's wrong.\"  327 U.\u00a0S., at 364; see supra, at 5.  Applying that reasoning here, there should be no dispositive difference between a payment voluntarily made and one required by law.4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor does United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U.\u00a0S. 200 (2001), aid Loos's argument, repeated by the dissent.  See post, at 8.  Indeed, Cleveland Indians reasserted Nierotko's holding that \"backpay for a time in which the employee was not on the job\" counts as pay for services, and therefore ranks as wages.  532 U.\u00a0S., at 210.  Cleveland Indians then took up a discrete, \"secondary issue\" Nierotko presented, one not in contention here, i.e., whether for taxation purposes backpay is allocable to the tax period when paid rather than an earlier time-earned period.  532 U.\u00a0S., at 211, 213-214, 219-220.  Moreover, Quality Stores, which postdated Cleveland Indians, left no doubt that what qualifies under Nierotko as \"wages\" for benefit purposes also qualifies as such for taxation purposes.  572 U.\u00a0S., at 146-147.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Loos presses a final reason why he should not owe RRTA taxes on his lost wages award.  Loos argues, and the District Court held, that the RRTA's tax on employees does not apply to personal injury damages.  He observes that the RRTA taxes \"the income of each employee.\"  26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73201(a)-(b) (emphasis added).  He then cites a provision of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7104(a)(2).  This provision exempts \"damages .\u00a0.\u00a0. received .\u00a0.\u00a0. on account of personal physical injuries\" from federal income taxation by excluding such damages from \"gross income.\"  Loos urges that the exclusion of personal injury damages from \"gross income\" should carry over to the RRTA's tax on the \"income\" of railroad workers, \u00a73201(a)-(b).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The argument is unconvincing.  As the Government points out, the District Court, echoed by Loos, conflated \"the distinct concepts of 'gross income,' [a prime component of] the tax base on which income tax is collected, and 'compensation,' the separately defined category of payments that are taxable under the RRTA.\"  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 15.  Blending tax bases that Congress kept discrete, the District Court and Loos proffer a scheme in which employees pay no tax on damages compensating for personal injuries; railroads pay the full excise tax on such compensation; and employees receive full credit for the compensation in determining their retirement benefits.  That scheme, however, is not plausibly attributable to Congress.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For federal income tax purposes, \"gross income\" means \"all income\" \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided.\"  26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a761; see \u00a7\u00a71, 63 (imposing a tax on \"taxable income,\" defined as \"gross income minus .\u00a0.\u00a0. deductions\").  Congress provided detailed prescriptions on the scope of \"gross income,\" excluding from its reach numerous items, among them, personal injury damages.  See \u00a7\u00a7101-140.  Conspicuously absent from the RRTA, however, is any reference to \"gross income.\"  As employed in the RRTA, the word \"income\" merely distinguishes the tax on the employee, an \"income .\u00a0.\u00a0. tax,\" \u00a73201, from the matching tax on the railroad, called an \"excise tax.\"  \u00a7\u00a73201, 3221.  See also 1937 RRTA, \u00a7\u00a72-3 (establishing an \"income tax on employees\" and an \"excise tax on employers\"); S.\u00a0Rep. No. 818, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1937) (stating that the RRTA imposes an \"income tax on employees\" and an \"excise tax on employers\"); H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 1071, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 6 (1937) (same).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress, we reiterate, specified not \"gross income\" but employee \"compensation\" as the tax base for the RRTA's income and excise taxes.  \u00a7\u00a73201, 3221.  Congress then excepted certain payments from the calculation of \"compensation.\"  See \u00a73231(e); supra, at 9.  Congress adopted by cross-reference particular Internal Revenue Code exclusions from \"gross income,\" thereby carving out those specified items from RRTA coverage.  See \u00a73231(e)(5)-(6), (9)-(11).  Tellingly, Congress did not adopt for RRTA purposes the exclusion of personal injury damages from federal income taxation set out in \u00a7104(a)(2).  We note, furthermore, that if RRTA taxes were based on \"income\" or \"gross income\" rather than \"compensation,\" the RRTA tax base would sweep in nonrailroad income, including, for example, dividends, interest accruals, even lottery winnings.  Shifting from \"compensation\" to \"income\" as the RRTA tax base would thus saddle railroad workers with more RRTA taxes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the multiple flaws in Loos's last ditch argument, we conclude that \u00a7104(a)(2) does not exempt FELA damages from the RRTA's income and excise taxes.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In harmony with this Court's decisions in Nierotko and Quality Stores, we hold that \"compensation\" for RRTA purposes includes an employer's payments to an employee for active service and for periods of absence from active service.  It is immaterial whether the employer chooses to make the payment or is legally required to do so.  Either way, the payment is remitted to the recipient because of his status as a service-rendering employee.  See 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73231(e)(1); 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7231(h)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated, FELA damages for lost wages qualify as RRTA-taxable \"compensation.\"  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is accordingly reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nGorsuch, J., dissenting\n\u2002586 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1042\nBNSF RAILWAY COMPANY, PETITIONER v. MICHAEL D. LOOS\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit\n[March 4, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch, with whom Justice Thomas  joins, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BNSF Railway's negligence caused one of its employees a serious injury.  After a trial, a court ordered the company to pay damages.  But instead of sending the full amount to the employee, BNSF asserted that it had to divert a portion to the Internal Revenue Service.  Why?  BNSF said the money represented taxable \"compensation\" for \"services rendered as an employee.\"  26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73231(e)(1).  Today, the Court agrees with the company.  Respectfully, I do not.  When an employee suffers a physical injury due to his employer's negligence and has to sue in court to recover damages, it seems more natural to me to describe the final judgment as compensation for his injury than for services (never) rendered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court does not lay out the facts of the case, but they are relevant to my analysis and straightforward enough.  Years ago, Michael Loos was working for BNSF in a train yard when he fell into a hidden drainage grate and injured his knee.  He missed work for many months, and upon his return he had a series of absences, many of which he attributed to knee-injury flareups.  When the company moved to fire him for allegedly violating its attendance policies, Mr. Loos sued.  Among other things, Mr. Loos sought damages for BNSF's negligence in maintaining the train yard.  He brought his claim under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), an analogue to tradititional state-law tort suits that makes an interstate railroad \"liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed\" by the railroad \"for such injury .\u00a0.\u00a0. resulting in whole or in part from the [railroad's] negligence.\"  45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a751.  Ultimately, and again much like in any other tort suit, the jury awarded damages in three categories: $85,000 in pain and suffering, $11,212.78 in medical expenses, and $30,000 in lost wages--the final category representing the amount Mr. Loos was unable to earn because of the injury BNSF's negligence caused.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then a strange thing happened.  BNSF argued that the lost wages portion of Mr. Loos's judgment represented \"compensation\" to him \"for services rendered as an employee\" and was thus taxable income under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA).  26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73201 et\u00a0seq.  In much the same way the Social Security Act taxes other citizens' incomes to fund their retirement benefits, the RRTA taxes railroad employees' earnings to pay for their public pensions.  And BNSF took the view that, because Mr. Loos owed the IRS taxes on the lost wages portion of his judgment, it had to withhold an appropriate sum and redirect it to the government.  The company took this position even though it meant BNSF would owe corresponding excise taxes.  See 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73221.  It took this position, too, even though no one has identified for us a single case where the IRS has sought to collect RRTA taxes on a FELA judgment in the 80 years the two statutes have coexisted.  The company even persisted in its view after, first, the district court and, then, the Eighth Circuit ruled that Mr. Loos's award wasn't subject to RRTA taxes.  Even after all that, BNSF went to the trouble of seeking review in this Court to win the right to pay the IRS.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What's the reason for BNSF's tireless campaign?  Is the company really moved by a selfless desire to protect a federal program from \"a long-term risk of insolvency\"?  See ante, at 5, n.\u00a02.  Several amici offer a more prosaic possibility.  Under the rule BNSF seeks and wins today, RRTA taxes will be due on (but only on) the portion of a FELA settlement or judgment designated as lost wages.  Taxes will not attach to other amounts attributed to, say, pain and suffering or medical costs.  At trial, of course, a plaintiff's damages are what they are, and often juries will attribute a significant portion of damages to lost wages.  But with the help of the asymmetric tax treatment they secure today, railroads like BSNF can now sweeten their settlement offers while offering less money.  Forgo trial and accept a lower settlement, they will tell injured workers, and in return we will designate a small fraction (maybe even none) of the payments as taxable lost wages.  In this way, the Court's decision today may do precisely nothing to increase the government's tax collections or protect the solvency of any federal program.  Instead, it may only mean that employees will pay a tax for going to trial--and railroads will succeed in buying cheaper settlements in the future at the bargain basement price of a few thousand dollars in excise taxes in one case today.  See Brief for American Association for Justice as Amicus Curiae 34-36; Brief for SMART et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 5-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whatever the reason for BNSF's gambit, the problems with it start for me at the first step of the statutory interpretation analysis--with the text of the law itself.  The RRTA taxes an employee's \"compensation,\" which it defines as \"money remuneration .\u00a0.\u00a0. for services rendered as an employee to one or more employers.\"  26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73231(e)(1).  A \"service\" refers to \"duty or labor .\u00a0.\u00a0. by one person .\u00a0.\u00a0. bound to submit his will to the direction and control of [another].\"  Black's Law Dictionary 1607 (3d ed. 1933).  And \"remuneration\" means \"a quid pro quo,\" \"recompense\" or \"reward\" for such services.  Id., at 1528.  So the words \"remuneration for services rendered\" naturally cover things like an employee's salary or hourly wage.  Nor do they stop there, as the Court correctly notes.  Rather, and contrary to the court of appeals' view, those words also fairly encompass benefits like sick or disability pay.  After all, an employer offers those benefits to attract and keep employees working on its behalf.  In that way, these benefits form part of the \"quid pro quo\" (compensation) the employer pays to secure the \"duty or labor\" (services) the employee renders.  Cf. United States v. Quality Stores, Inc., 572 U.\u00a0S. 141, 146 (2014).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But damages for negligence are different.  No one would describe a dangerous fall or the wrenching of a knee as a \"service rendered\" to the party who negligently caused the accident.  BNSF hardly directed Mr. Loos to fall or offered to pay him for doing so.  In fact, BNSF didn't even pay Mr. Loos voluntarily; he had to wrest a judgment from the railroad at the end of a legal battle.  So Mr. Loos's FELA judgment seems to me, as it did to every judge in the proceedings below, unconnected to any service Mr. Loos rendered to BNSF.  Instead of being \"compensation\" for \"services rendered as an employee,\" it seems more natural to say that the negligence damages BNSF paid are \"compensation\" to Mr. Loos for his injury.  That's exactly how we usually understand tort damages--as \"compensation\" for an \"injury\" caused by \"the unlawful act or omission or negligence of another.\"  Black's Law Dictionary 314 (2d ed. 1910).  And that's exactly how FELA describes the damages it provides--stating that it renders a railroad \"liable\" not for services rendered but for any \"injury\" caused by the defendant's \"negligence.\"  45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a751; see also New York Central R. Co. v. Winfield, 244 U.\u00a0S. 147, 164 (1917) (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (FELA liability is \"a penalty for wrong doing,\" a \"remedy\" that \"mak[es] the wrongdoer indemnify him whom he has wronged\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, BNSF isn't without a reply.  Time and again it highlights the fact that the district court measured the lost wages portion of Mr. Loos's award by reference to what he could have earned but for his injury.  But if BNSF's negligence had injured a passenger on a train instead of an employee in a train yard, a jury could have measured the passenger's tort damages in exactly the same way, taking account of the wages she could have earned from her own employer but for the railroad's negligence.  Vicksburg & Meridian R. Co. v. Putnam, 118 U.\u00a0S. 545, 554 (1886).  In those circumstances, I doubt any of us would say the passenger's damages award represented compensation for \"services rendered\" to her employer rather than compensation for her injury.  And I don't see why we would reach a different result here simply because the victim of BNSF's negligence happened to be one of its own workers.  Of course, as the Court points out, ante, at 11, n.\u00a05, FELA suits may be brought only by railroad employees against their employers.  But in cases like ours a FELA suit simply serves in the interstate railroad industry as a federalized substitute for a traditional state negligence tort claim of the sort that could be brought by anyone the railroad injured, employee or not.  Inescapably, \"the basis of liability under [FELA] is and remains negligence.\"  Wilkerson v. McCarthy, 336 U.\u00a0S. 53, 69 (1949) (Douglas, J., concurring).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Looking beyond the statute's text to its history only compounds BNSF's problems.  To be clear, the statutory history I have in mind here isn't the sort of unenacted legislative history that often is neither truly legislative (having failed to survive bicameralism and presentment) nor truly historical (consisting of advocacy aimed at winning in future litigation what couldn't be won in past statutes).  Instead, I mean here the record of enacted changes Congress made to the relevant statutory text over time, the sort of textual evidence everyone agrees can sometimes shed light on meaning.  See United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.\u00a0S. 649, 653-654 (1898).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The RRTA's statutory history is long and instructive.  Beginning in 1937, the statute defined taxable \"compensation\" to include remuneration \"for services rendered,\" but with the further instruction that this included compensation \"for time lost.\"  Carriers Taxing Act of 1937, \u00a71(e), 50 Stat. 436.  Courts applying the RRTA's sister statute, the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA), understood this language to capture settlement payments for personal injury claims that would not otherwise qualify as \"remuneration .\u00a0.\u00a0. for services rendered.\"  See, e.g., Jacques v. Railroad Retirement Bd., 736 F.\u00a02d 34, 39-40 (CA2 1984); Grant v. Railroad Retirement Bd., 173 F.\u00a02d 385, 386-387 (CA10 1949).  Congress itself seemed to agree, explaining in 1946 that remuneration for \"time lost\" includes payments made \"with respect to an .\u00a0.\u00a0. absence on account of personal injury.\"  \u00a73(f), 60 Stat. 725.  But then Congress reversed field.  In 1975, it removed payments \"for time lost\" from the RRTA's definition of \"compensation.\"  \u00a7204, 89 Stat. 466.  And in 1983, Congress overwrote the last remaining reference to payments \"for time lost\" in a nearby section.  \u00a7225, 97 Stat. 424-426.  To my mind, Congress's decision to remove the only language that could have fairly captured the damages here cannot be easily ignored.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet BNSF would have us do exactly that.  On its account, the RRTA's discussions about compensation for time lost and personal injuries only ever served to illustrate what has qualified all along as remuneration for \"services rendered.\"  So, on its view, when Congress first added and then removed language about time lost and personal injuries, it quite literally wasted its time because none of its additions and subtractions altered the statute's meaning.  Put another way, BNSF asks us to read back into the law words (time lost, personal injury) that Congress deliberately removed on the assumption they were never really needed in the first place.  As I see it, that is less \"\u00a0'a construction of a statute [than] an enlargement of it by the court, so that what was omitted, [BNSF] presum[es] by inadvertence, may be included within its scope.  To supply omissions [like that] transcends the judicial function.'\u00a0\"  West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.\u00a0S. 83, 101 (1991) (quoting Iselin v. United States, 270 U.\u00a0S. 245, 251 (1926) (Brandeis, J.)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Looking beyond the text and history of this statute to compare it with others confirms the conclusion.  Where the RRTA directs the taxation of railroad employee income to fund retirement benefits, the RRA controls the calculation of those benefits.  And, unlike the RRTA, that statute continues to include \"pay for time lost\" in the definition of \"compensation\" it uses to calculate benefits. 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7231(h)(1).  Normally, when Congress chooses to exclude terms in one statute while introducing or retaining them in another closely related law, we give effect to rather than pass a blind eye over the difference.  Nor is there any question that Congress knows exactly how to tax a favorable tort judgment when it wants.  See, e.g., 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7104(a)(2) (punitive damages are not deductible).  Its failure to offer any comparably clear command here should, once more, tell us something.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With so much in the statute's text, history, and surroundings now pointing for Mr. Loos, BNSF is left to lean heavily on case law.  The company says we must rule its way primarily because of Social Security Bd. v. Nierotko, 327 U.\u00a0S. 358 (1946).  But I do not see anything in that case dictating a victory for BNSF.  Nierotko concerned a different statute, a different legal claim, and a different factual context.  There, the plaintiff brought a wrongful termination claim before the National Labor Relations Board, claiming that his employer fired him in retaliation for union activity.  The NLRB ordered the employee reinstated to his former job and paid as if he had never left.  Under those circumstances, this Court held that for purposes of calculating the plaintiff's Social Security Act benefits, his \"wages\" should include his backpay award, allocated to the period when he would have been working but for the employer's misconduct.  Since then, however, the Court has suggested that at least one of Nierotko's holdings was likely motivated more by a policy concern with protecting the employee's full retirement to Social Security benefits than by a careful reading of the Social Security Act.  See United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U.\u00a0S. 200, 212-213 (2001); id., at 220-221 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  Besides, in this case we're simply not faced with a wrongful termination claim, an award of backpay, or the interpretation of the Social Security Act--let alone reason to worry that ruling for Mr. Loos would inequitably shortchange an employee.  So whatever light Nierotko might continue to shed on the question it faced, and whatever superficial similarities one might point to here, that decision simply doesn't dictate an answer to the question whether a tort victim's damages for a physical injury qualify as \"compensation for services rendered\" under the RRTA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By this point BNSF is left with only one argument, which it treats as no more than a last resort: Chevron deference.  In the past, the briefs and oral argument in this case likely would have centered on whether we should defer to the IRS's administrative interpretation of the RRTA.  After all, the IRS (at least today) agrees with BNSF's interpretation that \"compensation .\u00a0.\u00a0. for services rendered\" includes damages for personal injuries.  And the Chevron doctrine, if it retains any force, would seem to allow BNSF to parlay any statutory ambiguity into a colorable argument for judicial deference to the IRS's view, regardless of the Court's best independent understanding of the law.  See Chevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.\u00a0S. 837 (1984).  Of course, any Chevron analysis here would be complicated by the government's change of heart.  For if Nierotko is as relevant as BNSF contends, then it must also be relevant that, back when Nierotko was decided, the IRS took the view that the term \"wages\" in the Social Security Act did not include backpay awards for wrongful termination.  See 327 U.\u00a0S., at 366-367.  And if \"wages\" don't include backpay awards for wrongful terminations, it's hard to see how \"compensation .\u00a0.\u00a0. for services rendered\" might include damages for an act of negligence.  Still, even with the complications that follow from executive agencies' penchant for changing their views about the law's meaning almost as often as they change administrations, a plea for deference surely would have enjoyed pride of place in BNSF's submission not long ago.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But nothing like that happened here.  BNSF devoted scarcely any of its briefing to Chevron.  At oral argument, BNSF's lawyer didn't even mention the case until the final seconds--and even then \"hate[d] to cite\" it.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 58.  No doubt, BNSF proceeded this way well aware of the mounting criticism of Chevron deference.  See, e.g., Pereira v. Sessions, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2018) (Kennedy, J., concurring).  And no doubt, too, this is all to the good. Instead of throwing up our hands and letting an interested party--the federal government's executive branch, no less--dictate an inferior interpretation of the law that may be more the product of politics than a scrupulous reading of the statute, the Court today buckles down to its job of saying what the law is in light of its text, its context, and our precedent.  Though I may disagree with the result the Court reaches, my colleagues rightly afford the parties before us an independent judicial interpretation of the law.  They deserve no less.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The railroad remits both taxes to the IRS.  As to the income tax, the railroad deducts the amount owed by the employee from her earnings and then forwards that amount to the IRS.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 22-23.  See also 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73402(a)(1) (employers must \"deduct and withhold\" income taxes from earnings).\nFootnote 2\u00a0Before turning to the language of the RRTA, the dissent endeavors to unearth the reason why BNSF has pursued this case.  The railroad's \"gambit,\" the dissent surmises, is to increase pressure on injured workers to settle their claims.  Post, at 3.  Contrast with the dissent's conjecture, BNSF's entirely plausible account of a railroad's stake in this dispute.  Because the RRA credits lost wages toward an employee's benefits, see 45 U. S. C. \u00a7231(h)(1), BNSF posits that immunizing those payments from RRTA taxes would expose the system to \"a long-term risk of insolvency.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 4; see Reply Brief for Petitioner 14.\nFootnote 3\u00a0The dissent's reduction of Nierotko's significance fares no better.  Nierotko, the dissent urges, is distinguishable because it involved \"a different factual context.\"  Post, at 7.  But as just explained, supra, at 6-7, the facts in Nierotko resemble those here in all material respects.\nFootnote 4\u00a0The dissent, building on Loos's argument, tenders an inapt analogy between passengers and employees.  If BNSF were ordered to pay damages for lost wages to an injured passenger, the dissent asserts, one would not say the passenger had been compensated \"for services rendered.\"  There is no reason, the dissent concludes, to \"reach a different result here simply because the victim of BNSF's negligence happened to be one of its own workers.\"  Post, at 5.  Under the RRTA, however, this distinction is of course critical.  The passenger's damages for lost wages are not taxable under the RRTA, for she has no employment relationship with the railroad.  In contrast, FELA damages for lost wages are taxable because they are paid only if the injured person previously \"rendered [services] as an employee,\" 26 U. S. C. \u00a73231(e)(1), and, indeed, was working for the railroad when the injury occurred, see 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a751.\n\n\n","8":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOBBY JAMES MOORE v. TEXAS(2019)\nNo. 18-443\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 2019\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Per Curiam.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2015, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that petitioner, Bobby James Moore, did not have intellectual disability and consequently was eligible for the death penalty.  Ex\u00a0parte Moore, 470 S. W. 3d 481, 527-528 (Ex\u00a0parte Moore I).  We previously considered the lawfulness of that determination, vacated the appeals court's decision, and remanded the case for further consideration of the issue.  Moore v. Texas, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 18).  The appeals court subsequently reconsidered the matter but reached the same conclusion.  Ex\u00a0parte Moore, 548 S. W. 3d 552, 573 (Tex. Crim. App. 2018) (Ex\u00a0parte Moore II).  We again review its decision, and we reverse its determination.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When we first heard this case, in Moore, we noted that the state trial court (a state habeas court) \"received affidavits and heard testimony from Moore's family members, former counsel, and a number of court-appointed mental-health experts.\"  581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  We described the evidence as \"reveal[ing]\" the following:\n\"Moore had significant mental and social difficulties beginning at an early age.  At 13, Moore lacked basic understanding of the days of the week, the months of the year, and the seasons; he could scarcely tell time or comprehend the standards of measure or the basic principle that subtraction is the reverse of addition.  At school, because of his limited ability to read and write, Moore could not keep up with lessons.  Often, he was separated from the rest of the class and told to draw pictures.  Moore's father, teachers, and peers called him 'stupid' for his slow reading and speech.  After failing every subject in the ninth grade, Moore dropped out of high school.  Cast out of his home, he survived on the streets, eating from trash cans, even after two bouts of food poisoning.\"  Ibid. (citations omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the basis of this and other evidence, the trial court found that Moore had intellectual disability and thus was ineligible for the death penalty under Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.\u00a0S. 304 (2002).  App. to Pet. for Cert. 310a-311a.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed that determination, Ex\u00a0parte Moore I, 470 S. W. 3d 481, and we reviewed its decision, Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the outset of our opinion, we recognized as valid the three underlying legal criteria that both the trial court and appeals court had applied.  Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 3-4) (citing American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, Intellectual Disability: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports (11th ed. 2010) (AAIDD-11); American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed. 2013) (DSM-5)).  To make a finding of intellectual disability, a court must see: (1) deficits in intellectual functioning--primarily a test-related criterion, see DSM-5, at 37; (2) adaptive deficits, \"assessed using both clinical evaluation and individualized .\u00a0.\u00a0. measures,\" ibid.; and (3) the onset of these deficits while the defendant was still a minor, id., at 38.  With respect to the first criterion, we wrote that Moore's intellectual testing indicated his was a borderline case, but that he had demonstrated sufficient intellectual-functioning deficits to require consideration of the second criterion--adaptive functioning.  Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 10-12).  With respect to the third criterion, we found general agreement that any onset took place when Moore was a minor.  Id., at ___, n.\u00a03 (slip op., at 4, n.\u00a03).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But there was significant disagreement between the state courts about whether Moore had the adaptive deficits needed for intellectual disability.  \"In determining the significance of adaptive deficits, clinicians look to whether an individual's adaptive performance falls two or more standard deviations below the mean in any of the three adaptive skill sets (conceptual, social, and practical).\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (citing AAIDD-11, at 43).  Based on the evidence before it, the trial court found that \"Moore's performance fell roughly two standard deviations below the mean in all three skill categories.\"  581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4); see App. to Pet. for Cert. 309a.  Reversing that decision, the appeals court held that Moore had \"not proven by a preponderance of the evidence\" that he possessed the requisite adaptive deficits, and thus was eligible for the death penalty.  Ex\u00a0parte Moore I, 470 S. W. 3d, at 520.  We disagreed with the appeals court's adaptive-functioning analysis, however, and identified at least five errors.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals \"overemphasized Moore's perceived adaptive strengths.\"  Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  \"But the medical community,\" we said, \"focuses the adaptive-functioning inquiry on adaptive deficits.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the appeals court \"stressed Moore's improved behavior in prison.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  But \"[c]linicians .\u00a0.\u00a0. caution against reliance on adaptive strengths developed 'in a controlled setting,' as a prison surely is.\"  Ibid. (quoting DSM-5, at 38).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, the appeals court \"concluded that Moore's record of academic failure, .\u00a0.\u00a0. childhood abuse[,] and suffering \u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. detracted from a determination that his intellectual and adaptive deficits were related.\"  581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  But \"in the medical community,\" those \"traumatic experiences\" are considered \"\u00a0'risk factors' for intellectual disability.\"  Ibid. (quoting AAIDD-11, at 59-60).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals required \"Moore to show that his adaptive deficits were not related to 'a personality disorder.'\u00a0\"  581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Ex\u00a0parte Moore I, 470 S. W. 3d, at 488).  But clinicians recognize that the \"existence of a personality disorder or mental-health issue .\u00a0.\u00a0. is 'not evidence that a person does not also have intellectual disability.'\u00a0\"  581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Brief for American Psychological Association et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae in Moore v. Texas, O. T. 2016, No. 15-797, p.\u00a019).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fifth, the appeals court directed state courts, when examining adaptive deficits, to rely upon certain factors set forth in a Texas case called Ex\u00a0parte Briseno, 135 S. W. 3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).  Ex\u00a0parte Moore I, 470 S. W. 3d, at 486, 489. The Briseno factors were: whether \"those who knew the person best during the developmental stage\" thought of him as \"mentally retarded\"; whether he could \"formulat[e] plans\" and \"car[ry] them through\"; whether his conduct showed \"leadership\"; whether he showed a \"rational and appropriate\" \"response to external stimuli\"; whether he could answer questions \"coherently\" and \"rationally\"; whether he could \"hide facts or lie effectively\"; and whether the commission of his offense required \"forethought, planning, and complex execution of purpose.\"  135 S.\u00a0W. 3d, at 8-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We criticized the use of these factors both because they had no grounding in prevailing medical practice, and because they invited \"lay perceptions of intellectual dis-ability\" and \"lay stereotypes\" to guide assessment of intellectual disability.  Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  Emphasizing the Briseno factors over clinical factors, we said, \"\u00a0'creat[es] an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed.'\u00a0\"  581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Hall v. Florida, 572 U.\u00a0S. 701, 704 (2014)).  While our decisions in \"Atkins and Hall left to the States 'the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce' the restriction on executing the intellectually disabled,\" 581 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at 719), a court's intellectual disability determination \"must be 'informed by the medical community's diagnostic framework,'\u00a0\" 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at 721).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Three Members of this Court dissented from the major-ity's treatment of Moore's intellectual functioning and with aspects of its adaptive-functioning analysis, but all agreed about the impropriety of the Briseno factors.  As The Chief Justice wrote in his dissenting opinion, the Briseno factors were \"an unacceptable method of enforcing the guarantee of Atkins\" and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals \"therefore erred in using them to analyze adaptive deficits.\"  Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.) (slip op., at 1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons we have described, the Court set aside the judgment of the appeals court and remanded the case \"for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 18).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On remand the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reconsidered the appeal and reached the same basic conclusion, namely, that Moore had not demonstrated intellectual disability.  Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 555.  The court again noted the three basic criteria: intellectual-functioning deficits, adaptive deficits, and early onset.  Id., at 560-562.  But this time it focused almost exclusively on the second criterion, adaptive deficits.  The court said that, in doing so, it would \"abandon reliance on the Briseno evidentiary factors.\"  Id., at 560.  It would instead use \"\u00a0'current medical diagnostic standards'\u00a0\" set forth in the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5.  Id., at 559-560. In applying those standards to the trial court record, it found the State's expert witness, Dr. Kristi Compton, \"\u00a0'far more credible and reliable'\u00a0\" than the other experts considered by the trial court.  Id., at 562.  (As in our last opinion, we neither second nor second-guess that judgment.)  And, as we have said, it reached the same conclusion it had before.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moore has now filed a petition for certiorari in which he argues that the trial court record demonstrates his intellectual disability.  He asks us to reverse the appeals court's contrary holding.  Pet. for Cert. 2.  The prosecutor, the district attorney of Harris County, \"agrees with the petitioner that he is intellectually disabled and cannot be executed.\"  Brief in Opposition 9.  The American Psychological Association (APA), American Bar Association (ABA), and various individuals have also filed amicus curiae briefs supporting the position of Moore and the prosecutor.  Brief for APA et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae; Brief for ABA as Amicus Curiae; Brief for Donald B. Ayer et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae.  The Attorney General of Texas, however, has filed a motion for leave to intervene, and asks us to deny Moore's petition.  Motion for Leave to Intervene as a Respondent.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After reviewing the trial court record and the court of appeals' opinion, we agree with Moore that the appeals court's determination is inconsistent with our opinion in Moore. We have found in its opinion too many instances in which, with small variations, it repeats the analysis we previously found wanting, and these same parts are critical to its ultimate conclusion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For one thing, the court of appeals again relied less upon the adaptive deficits to which the trial court had referred than upon Moore's apparent adaptive strengths. See Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (criticizing the appeals court's \"overemphas[is]\" upon Moore's \"perceived adaptive strengths\"); supra, at 3.  The appeals court's discussion of Moore's \"[c]ommunication [s]kills\" does not discuss the evidence relied upon by the trial court.  Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 563-565.  That evidence includes the young Moore's inability to understand and answer family members, even a failure on occasion to respond to his own name.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 289a-290a.  Its review of Moore's \"[r]eading and [w]riting\" refers to deficits only in observing that \"in prison, [Moore] progressed from being illiterate to being able to write at a seventh-grade level.\"  Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 565.  But the trial court heard, among other things, evidence that in school Moore was made to draw pictures when other children were reading, and that by sixth grade Moore struggled to read at a second-grade level.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 290a, 295a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead, the appeals court emphasized Moore's capacity to communicate, read, and write based in part on pro\u00a0se papers Moore filed in court.  Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 565-566.  That evidence is relevant, but it lacks convincing strength without a determination about whether Moore wrote the papers on his own, a finding that the court of appeals declined to make.  Rather, the court dismissed the possibility of outside help: Even if other inmates \"composed\" these papers, it said, Moore's \"ability to copy such documents by hand\" was \"within the realm of only a few intellectually disabled people.\"  Id., at 565.  Similarly, the court of appeals stressed Moore's \"coherent\" testimony in various proceedings, but acknowledged that Moore had \"a lawyer to coach him\" in all but one.  Id., at 564, and n.\u00a095.  As for that pro\u00a0se hearing, the court observed that Moore read letters into the record \"without any apparent difficulty.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For another thing, the court of appeals relied heavily upon adaptive improvements made in prison.  See Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (\"caution[ing] against reliance on adaptive strengths developed\" in \"prison\"); supra, at 3.  It concluded that Moore has command of elementary math, but its examples concern trips to the prison commissary, commissary purchases, and the like.  Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 566-569.  It determined that Moore had shown leadership ability in prison by refusing, on occasion, \"to mop up some spilled oatmeal,\" shave, get a haircut, or sit down.  Id., at 570-571, and n.\u00a0149.  And as we have said, it stressed correspondence written in prison.  Id., at 565.  The length and detail of the court's discussion on these points is difficult to square with our caution against relying on prison-based development.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, the court of appeals concluded that Moore failed to show that the \"cause of [his] deficient social behavior was related to any deficits in general mental abilities\" rather than \"emotional problems.\"  Id., at 570.  But in our last review, we said that the court of appeals had \"departed from clinical practice\" when it required Moore to prove that his \"problems in kindergarten\" stemmed from his intellectual disability, rather than \"\u00a0'emotional problems.'\u00a0\"  Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Ex\u00a0parte Moore I, 470 S. W. 3d, at 488, 526)).  And we pointed to an amicus brief in which the APA explained that a personality disorder or mental-health issue is \"not evidence that a person does not also have intellectual disability.\"  581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Brief for APA et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae in No. 15-797, at 19).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, despite the court of appeals' statement that it would \"abandon reliance on the Briseno evidentiary factors,\" Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 560, it seems to have used many of those factors in reaching its conclusion.  See supra, at 4 (detailing those factors).  Thus, Briseno asked whether the \"offense require[d] forethought, planning, and complex execution of purpose.\"  135 S. W. 3d, at 9.  The court of appeals wrote that Moore's crime required \"a level of planning and forethought.\"  Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 572, 603 (observing that Moore \"w[ore] a wig, conceal[ed] the weapon, and fle[d]\" after the crime).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Briseno asked whether the defendant could \"respond coherently, rationally, and on point to oral and written questions.\"  135 S. W. 3d, at 8.  The court of appeals found that Moore \"responded rationally and coherently to questions.\"  Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 564.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Briseno asked whether the defendant's \"conduct show[s] leadership or .\u00a0.\u00a0. that he is led around by others.\"  135 S. W. 3d, at 8.  The court of appeals wrote that Moore's \"refus[al] to mop up some spilled oatmeal\" (and other such behavior) showed that he \"influences others and stands up to authority.\"  Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 570-571.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, clinicians also ask questions to which the court of appeals' statements might be relevant.  See AAIDD-11, at 44 (noting that how a person \"follows rules\" and \"obeys laws\" can bear on assessment of her social skills).  But the similarity of language and content between Briseno's factors and the court of appeals' statements suggests that Briseno continues to \"pervasively infec[t] the [the appeals courts'] analysis.\"  Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, the court of appeals opinion is not identical to the opinion we considered in Moore. There are sentences here and there suggesting other modes of analysis consistent with what we said.  But there are also sentences here and there suggesting reliance upon what we earlier called \"lay stereotypes of the intellectually disabled.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  Compare Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 570-571 (finding evidence that Moore \"had a girlfriend\" and a job as tending to show he lacks intellectual disability), with AAIDD-11, at 151 (criticizing the \"incorrect stereotypes\" that persons with intellectual disability \"never have friends, jobs, spouses, or children\"), and Brief for APA et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 8 (\"[I]t is estimated that between nine and forty percent of persons with in-tellectual disability have some form of paid employment\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We conclude that the appeals court's opinion, when taken as a whole and when read in the light both of our prior opinion and the trial court record, rests upon analysis too much of which too closely resembles what we previously found improper.  And extricating that analysis from the opinion leaves too little that might warrant reaching a different conclusion than did the trial court.  We consequently agree with Moore and the prosecutor that, on the basis of the trial court record, Moore has shown he is a person with intellectual disability.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for certiorari is granted.  The Attorney General of Texas' motion to intervene is denied; we have considered that filing as an amicus brief.  The judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nRoberts, C. J., concurring\n\u2002586 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nBOBBY JAMES MOORE v. TEXAS\non petition for writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of texas\nNo. 18-443.\u2003Decided February 19, 2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Justice Roberts, concurring.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When this case was before us two years ago, I wrote in dissent that the majority's articulation of how courts should enforce the requirements of Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.\u00a0S. 304 (2002), lacked clarity.  Moore v. Texas, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2017) (slip op., at 10-11).  It still does.  But putting aside the difficulties of applying Moore in other cases, it is easy to see that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals misapplied it here.  On remand, the court repeated the same errors that this Court previously condemned--if not quite in haec verba, certainly in substance.  The court repeated its improper reliance on the factors articulated in Ex\u00a0parte Briseno, 135 S.\u00a0W. 3d 1, 8 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004), and again emphasized Moore's adaptive strengths rather than his deficits.  That did not pass muster under this Court's analysis last time.  It still doesn't.  For those reasons, I join the Court's opinion reversing the judgment below.\n\nAlito, J., dissenting\n\u2002586 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nBOBBY JAMES MOORE v. TEXAS\non petition for writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of texas\nNo. 18-443.\u2003Decided February 19, 2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch join, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two years ago, this Court vacated a judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals holding that Bobby James Moore was not intellectually disabled and was therefore eligible for the death penalty.  Moore v. Texas, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017).  While the Court divided on the appropriate disposition, both the majority and the dissent agreed that the Court of Criminal Appeals should have assessed Moore's claim of intellectual disability under contemporary standards rather than applying the outdated evidentiary factors laid out in Ex\u00a0parte Briseno, 135 S.\u00a0W. 3d 1, 8 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).  Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2); id., at ___  (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1).  On remand, the Court of Criminal Appeals adopted the leading contemporary clinical standards for assessing intellectual disability, applied those standards to the record, and once again determined that Moore is eligible for the death penalty.  Ex\u00a0parte Moore, 548 S.\u00a0W. 3d 552, 555 (2018).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, the Court reverses that most recent decision, holding that the Court of Criminal Appeals failed to follow our decision in Moore.  Such a failure would be understandable given the \"lack of guidance [Moore] offers to States seeking to enforce the holding of Atkins.\"  Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___  (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 10).  Indeed, each of the errors that the majority ascribes to the state court's decision is traceable to Moore's failure to provide a clear rule.  For example, the majority faults the Court of Criminal Appeals for \"rel[ying] less upon the adaptive deficits .\u00a0.\u00a0. than upon Moore's apparent adaptive strengths,\" ante, at 6-7, and for \"rel[ying] heavily upon adaptive improvements made in prison,\" ante, at 8.  But in Moore, we said only that a court ought not \"overemphasiz[e]\" adaptive strengths or place too much \"stres[s]\" on improved behavior in prison.  This left \"the line between the permissible--consideration, maybe even emphasis--and the forbidden--'overemphasis'--.\u00a0.\u00a0. not only thin, but totally undefined .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___  (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 11).  The majority's belief that the state court failed to follow Moore on remand merely proves that \"[n]either the Court's articulation of this standard [in Moore] nor its application sheds any light on what it means.\"  Id., at ___ (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 10).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having concluded that the Court of Criminal Appeals failed to apply the standard allegedly set out in Moore, the Court today takes it upon itself to correct these factual findings and reverse the judgment.*  This is not our role.  \"We do not grant a certiorari to review evidence and discuss specific facts.\"  United States v. Johnston, 268 U.\u00a0S. 220, 227 (1925); see also Salazar-Limon v. Houston, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (Alito, J., concurring in denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 2) (\"[W]e rarely grant review where the thrust of the claim is that a lower court simply erred in applying a settled rule of law to the facts of a particular case\").  If the Court is convinced that the Court of Criminal Appeals made a legal error, it should vacate the judgment below, pronounce the standard that we failed to provide in Moore, and remand for the state court to apply that standard.  The Court's decision, instead, to issue a summary reversal belies our role as \"a court of review, not of first view.\"  Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.\u00a0S. 709, 718, n.\u00a07 (2005).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's foray into factfinding is an unsound departure from our usual practice.  The error in this litigation was not the state court's decision on remand but our own failure to provide a coherent rule of decision in Moore.  I would deny the petition for a writ of certiorari.  I certainly would not summarily reverse and make our own finding of fact without even giving the State the opportunity to brief and argue the question.  I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n\nBOBBY JAMES MOORE v. TEXAS\non petition for writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of texas\nNo. 18-443.\u2003Decided February 19, 2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Per Curiam.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2015, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that petitioner, Bobby James Moore, did not have intellectual disability and consequently was eligible for the death penalty.  Ex\u00a0parte Moore, 470 S. W. 3d 481, 527-528 (Ex\u00a0parte Moore I).  We previously considered the lawfulness of that determination, vacated the appeals court's decision, and remanded the case for further consideration of the issue.  Moore v. Texas, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 18).  The appeals court subsequently reconsidered the matter but reached the same conclusion.  Ex\u00a0parte Moore, 548 S. W. 3d 552, 573 (Tex. Crim. App. 2018) (Ex\u00a0parte Moore II).  We again review its decision, and we reverse its determination.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When we first heard this case, in Moore, we noted that the state trial court (a state habeas court) \"received affidavits and heard testimony from Moore's family members, former counsel, and a number of court-appointed mental-health experts.\"  581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  We described the evidence as \"reveal[ing]\" the following:\n\"Moore had significant mental and social difficulties beginning at an early age.  At 13, Moore lacked basic understanding of the days of the week, the months of the year, and the seasons; he could scarcely tell time or comprehend the standards of measure or the basic principle that subtraction is the reverse of addition.  At school, because of his limited ability to read and write, Moore could not keep up with lessons.  Often, he was separated from the rest of the class and told to draw pictures.  Moore's father, teachers, and peers called him 'stupid' for his slow reading and speech.  After failing every subject in the ninth grade, Moore dropped out of high school.  Cast out of his home, he survived on the streets, eating from trash cans, even after two bouts of food poisoning.\"  Ibid. (citations omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the basis of this and other evidence, the trial court found that Moore had intellectual disability and thus was ineligible for the death penalty under Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.\u00a0S. 304 (2002).  App. to Pet. for Cert. 310a-311a.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed that determination, Ex\u00a0parte Moore I, 470 S. W. 3d 481, and we reviewed its decision, Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the outset of our opinion, we recognized as valid the three underlying legal criteria that both the trial court and appeals court had applied.  Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 3-4) (citing American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, Intellectual Disability: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports (11th ed. 2010) (AAIDD-11); American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed. 2013) (DSM-5)).  To make a finding of intellectual disability, a court must see: (1) deficits in intellectual functioning--primarily a test-related criterion, see DSM-5, at 37; (2) adaptive deficits, \"assessed using both clinical evaluation and individualized .\u00a0.\u00a0. measures,\" ibid.; and (3) the onset of these deficits while the defendant was still a minor, id., at 38.  With respect to the first criterion, we wrote that Moore's intellectual testing indicated his was a borderline case, but that he had demonstrated sufficient intellectual-functioning deficits to require consideration of the second criterion--adaptive functioning.  Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 10-12).  With respect to the third criterion, we found general agreement that any onset took place when Moore was a minor.  Id., at ___, n.\u00a03 (slip op., at 4, n.\u00a03).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But there was significant disagreement between the state courts about whether Moore had the adaptive deficits needed for intellectual disability.  \"In determining the significance of adaptive deficits, clinicians look to whether an individual's adaptive performance falls two or more standard deviations below the mean in any of the three adaptive skill sets (conceptual, social, and practical).\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (citing AAIDD-11, at 43).  Based on the evidence before it, the trial court found that \"Moore's performance fell roughly two standard deviations below the mean in all three skill categories.\"  581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4); see App. to Pet. for Cert. 309a.  Reversing that decision, the appeals court held that Moore had \"not proven by a preponderance of the evidence\" that he possessed the requisite adaptive deficits, and thus was eligible for the death penalty.  Ex\u00a0parte Moore I, 470 S. W. 3d, at 520.  We disagreed with the appeals court's adaptive-functioning analysis, however, and identified at least five errors.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals \"overemphasized Moore's perceived adaptive strengths.\"  Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  \"But the medical community,\" we said, \"focuses the adaptive-functioning inquiry on adaptive deficits.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the appeals court \"stressed Moore's improved behavior in prison.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  But \"[c]linicians .\u00a0.\u00a0. caution against reliance on adaptive strengths developed 'in a controlled setting,' as a prison surely is.\"  Ibid. (quoting DSM-5, at 38).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, the appeals court \"concluded that Moore's record of academic failure, .\u00a0.\u00a0. childhood abuse[,] and suffering \u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. detracted from a determination that his intellectual and adaptive deficits were related.\"  581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  But \"in the medical community,\" those \"traumatic experiences\" are considered \"\u00a0'risk factors' for intellectual disability.\"  Ibid. (quoting AAIDD-11, at 59-60).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals required \"Moore to show that his adaptive deficits were not related to 'a personality disorder.'\u00a0\"  581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Ex\u00a0parte Moore I, 470 S. W. 3d, at 488).  But clinicians recognize that the \"existence of a personality disorder or mental-health issue .\u00a0.\u00a0. is 'not evidence that a person does not also have intellectual disability.'\u00a0\"  581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Brief for American Psychological Association et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae in Moore v. Texas, O. T. 2016, No. 15-797, p.\u00a019).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fifth, the appeals court directed state courts, when examining adaptive deficits, to rely upon certain factors set forth in a Texas case called Ex\u00a0parte Briseno, 135 S. W. 3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).  Ex\u00a0parte Moore I, 470 S. W. 3d, at 486, 489. The Briseno factors were: whether \"those who knew the person best during the developmental stage\" thought of him as \"mentally retarded\"; whether he could \"formulat[e] plans\" and \"car[ry] them through\"; whether his conduct showed \"leadership\"; whether he showed a \"rational and appropriate\" \"response to external stimuli\"; whether he could answer questions \"coherently\" and \"rationally\"; whether he could \"hide facts or lie effectively\"; and whether the commission of his offense required \"forethought, planning, and complex execution of purpose.\"  135 S.\u00a0W. 3d, at 8-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We criticized the use of these factors both because they had no grounding in prevailing medical practice, and because they invited \"lay perceptions of intellectual dis-ability\" and \"lay stereotypes\" to guide assessment of intellectual disability.  Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  Emphasizing the Briseno factors over clinical factors, we said, \"\u00a0'creat[es] an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed.'\u00a0\"  581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Hall v. Florida, 572 U.\u00a0S. 701, 704 (2014)).  While our decisions in \"Atkins and Hall left to the States 'the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce' the restriction on executing the intellectually disabled,\" 581 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at 719), a court's intellectual disability determination \"must be 'informed by the medical community's diagnostic framework,'\u00a0\" 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at 721).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Three Members of this Court dissented from the major-ity's treatment of Moore's intellectual functioning and with aspects of its adaptive-functioning analysis, but all agreed about the impropriety of the Briseno factors.  As The Chief Justice wrote in his dissenting opinion, the Briseno factors were \"an unacceptable method of enforcing the guarantee of Atkins\" and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals \"therefore erred in using them to analyze adaptive deficits.\"  Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.) (slip op., at 1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons we have described, the Court set aside the judgment of the appeals court and remanded the case \"for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 18).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On remand the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reconsidered the appeal and reached the same basic conclusion, namely, that Moore had not demonstrated intellectual disability.  Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 555.  The court again noted the three basic criteria: intellectual-functioning deficits, adaptive deficits, and early onset.  Id., at 560-562.  But this time it focused almost exclusively on the second criterion, adaptive deficits.  The court said that, in doing so, it would \"abandon reliance on the Briseno evidentiary factors.\"  Id., at 560.  It would instead use \"\u00a0'current medical diagnostic standards'\u00a0\" set forth in the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5.  Id., at 559-560. In applying those standards to the trial court record, it found the State's expert witness, Dr. Kristi Compton, \"\u00a0'far more credible and reliable'\u00a0\" than the other experts considered by the trial court.  Id., at 562.  (As in our last opinion, we neither second nor second-guess that judgment.)  And, as we have said, it reached the same conclusion it had before.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moore has now filed a petition for certiorari in which he argues that the trial court record demonstrates his intellectual disability.  He asks us to reverse the appeals court's contrary holding.  Pet. for Cert. 2.  The prosecutor, the district attorney of Harris County, \"agrees with the petitioner that he is intellectually disabled and cannot be executed.\"  Brief in Opposition 9.  The American Psychological Association (APA), American Bar Association (ABA), and various individuals have also filed amicus curiae briefs supporting the position of Moore and the prosecutor.  Brief for APA et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae; Brief for ABA as Amicus Curiae; Brief for Donald B. Ayer et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae.  The Attorney General of Texas, however, has filed a motion for leave to intervene, and asks us to deny Moore's petition.  Motion for Leave to Intervene as a Respondent.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After reviewing the trial court record and the court of appeals' opinion, we agree with Moore that the appeals court's determination is inconsistent with our opinion in Moore. We have found in its opinion too many instances in which, with small variations, it repeats the analysis we previously found wanting, and these same parts are critical to its ultimate conclusion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For one thing, the court of appeals again relied less upon the adaptive deficits to which the trial court had referred than upon Moore's apparent adaptive strengths. See Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (criticizing the appeals court's \"overemphas[is]\" upon Moore's \"perceived adaptive strengths\"); supra, at 3.  The appeals court's discussion of Moore's \"[c]ommunication [s]kills\" does not discuss the evidence relied upon by the trial court.  Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 563-565.  That evidence includes the young Moore's inability to understand and answer family members, even a failure on occasion to respond to his own name.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 289a-290a.  Its review of Moore's \"[r]eading and [w]riting\" refers to deficits only in observing that \"in prison, [Moore] progressed from being illiterate to being able to write at a seventh-grade level.\"  Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 565.  But the trial court heard, among other things, evidence that in school Moore was made to draw pictures when other children were reading, and that by sixth grade Moore struggled to read at a second-grade level.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 290a, 295a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead, the appeals court emphasized Moore's capacity to communicate, read, and write based in part on pro\u00a0se papers Moore filed in court.  Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 565-566.  That evidence is relevant, but it lacks convincing strength without a determination about whether Moore wrote the papers on his own, a finding that the court of appeals declined to make.  Rather, the court dismissed the possibility of outside help: Even if other inmates \"composed\" these papers, it said, Moore's \"ability to copy such documents by hand\" was \"within the realm of only a few intellectually disabled people.\"  Id., at 565.  Similarly, the court of appeals stressed Moore's \"coherent\" testimony in various proceedings, but acknowledged that Moore had \"a lawyer to coach him\" in all but one.  Id., at 564, and n.\u00a095.  As for that pro\u00a0se hearing, the court observed that Moore read letters into the record \"without any apparent difficulty.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For another thing, the court of appeals relied heavily upon adaptive improvements made in prison.  See Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (\"caution[ing] against reliance on adaptive strengths developed\" in \"prison\"); supra, at 3.  It concluded that Moore has command of elementary math, but its examples concern trips to the prison commissary, commissary purchases, and the like.  Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 566-569.  It determined that Moore had shown leadership ability in prison by refusing, on occasion, \"to mop up some spilled oatmeal,\" shave, get a haircut, or sit down.  Id., at 570-571, and n.\u00a0149.  And as we have said, it stressed correspondence written in prison.  Id., at 565.  The length and detail of the court's discussion on these points is difficult to square with our caution against relying on prison-based development.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, the court of appeals concluded that Moore failed to show that the \"cause of [his] deficient social behavior was related to any deficits in general mental abilities\" rather than \"emotional problems.\"  Id., at 570.  But in our last review, we said that the court of appeals had \"departed from clinical practice\" when it required Moore to prove that his \"problems in kindergarten\" stemmed from his intellectual disability, rather than \"\u00a0'emotional problems.'\u00a0\"  Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Ex\u00a0parte Moore I, 470 S. W. 3d, at 488, 526)).  And we pointed to an amicus brief in which the APA explained that a personality disorder or mental-health issue is \"not evidence that a person does not also have intellectual disability.\"  581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Brief for APA et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae in No. 15-797, at 19).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, despite the court of appeals' statement that it would \"abandon reliance on the Briseno evidentiary factors,\" Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 560, it seems to have used many of those factors in reaching its conclusion.  See supra, at 4 (detailing those factors).  Thus, Briseno asked whether the \"offense require[d] forethought, planning, and complex execution of purpose.\"  135 S. W. 3d, at 9.  The court of appeals wrote that Moore's crime required \"a level of planning and forethought.\"  Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 572, 603 (observing that Moore \"w[ore] a wig, conceal[ed] the weapon, and fle[d]\" after the crime).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Briseno asked whether the defendant could \"respond coherently, rationally, and on point to oral and written questions.\"  135 S. W. 3d, at 8.  The court of appeals found that Moore \"responded rationally and coherently to questions.\"  Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 564.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Briseno asked whether the defendant's \"conduct show[s] leadership or .\u00a0.\u00a0. that he is led around by others.\"  135 S. W. 3d, at 8.  The court of appeals wrote that Moore's \"refus[al] to mop up some spilled oatmeal\" (and other such behavior) showed that he \"influences others and stands up to authority.\"  Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 570-571.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, clinicians also ask questions to which the court of appeals' statements might be relevant.  See AAIDD-11, at 44 (noting that how a person \"follows rules\" and \"obeys laws\" can bear on assessment of her social skills).  But the similarity of language and content between Briseno's factors and the court of appeals' statements suggests that Briseno continues to \"pervasively infec[t] the [the appeals courts'] analysis.\"  Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, the court of appeals opinion is not identical to the opinion we considered in Moore. There are sentences here and there suggesting other modes of analysis consistent with what we said.  But there are also sentences here and there suggesting reliance upon what we earlier called \"lay stereotypes of the intellectually disabled.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  Compare Ex\u00a0parte Moore II, 548 S. W. 3d, at 570-571 (finding evidence that Moore \"had a girlfriend\" and a job as tending to show he lacks intellectual disability), with AAIDD-11, at 151 (criticizing the \"incorrect stereotypes\" that persons with intellectual disability \"never have friends, jobs, spouses, or children\"), and Brief for APA et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 8 (\"[I]t is estimated that between nine and forty percent of persons with in-tellectual disability have some form of paid employment\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We conclude that the appeals court's opinion, when taken as a whole and when read in the light both of our prior opinion and the trial court record, rests upon analysis too much of which too closely resembles what we previously found improper.  And extricating that analysis from the opinion leaves too little that might warrant reaching a different conclusion than did the trial court.  We consequently agree with Moore and the prosecutor that, on the basis of the trial court record, Moore has shown he is a person with intellectual disability.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for certiorari is granted.

But putting aside the difficulties of applying Moore in other cases, it is easy to see that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals misapplied it here.  On remand, the court repeated the same errors that this Court previously condemned--if not quite in haec verba, certainly in substance.  The court repeated its improper reliance on the factors articulated in Ex\u00a0parte Briseno, 135 S.\u00a0W. 3d 1, 8 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004), and again emphasized Moore's adaptive strengths rather than his deficits.  That did not pass muster under this Court's analysis last time.  It still doesn't.  For those reasons, I join the Court's opinion reversing the judgment below.\n\nAlito, J., dissenting\n\u2002586 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nBOBBY JAMES MOORE v. TEXAS\non petition for writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of texas\nNo. 18-443.\u2003Decided February 19, 2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch join, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two years ago, this Court vacated a judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals holding that Bobby James Moore was not intellectually disabled and was therefore eligible for the death penalty.  Moore v. Texas, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017).  While the Court divided on the appropriate disposition, both the majority and the dissent agreed that the Court of Criminal Appeals should have assessed Moore's claim of intellectual disability under contemporary standards rather than applying the outdated evidentiary factors laid out in Ex\u00a0parte Briseno, 135 S.\u00a0W. 3d 1, 8 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).  Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2); id., at ___  (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1).  On remand, the Court of Criminal Appeals adopted the leading contemporary clinical standards for assessing intellectual disability, applied those standards to the record, and once again determined that Moore is eligible for the death penalty.  Ex\u00a0parte Moore, 548 S.\u00a0W. 3d 552, 555 (2018).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, the Court reverses that most recent decision, holding that the Court of Criminal Appeals failed to follow our decision in Moore.  Such a failure would be understandable given the \"lack of guidance [Moore] offers to States seeking to enforce the holding of Atkins.\"  Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___  (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 10).  Indeed, each of the errors that the majority ascribes to the state court's decision is traceable to Moore's failure to provide a clear rule.  For example, the majority faults the Court of Criminal Appeals for \"rel[ying] less upon the adaptive deficits .\u00a0.\u00a0. than upon Moore's apparent adaptive strengths,\" ante, at 6-7, and for \"rel[ying] heavily upon adaptive improvements made in prison,\" ante, at 8.  But in Moore, we said only that a court ought not \"overemphasiz[e]\" adaptive strengths or place too much \"stres[s]\" on improved behavior in prison.  This left \"the line between the permissible--consideration, maybe even emphasis--and the forbidden--'overemphasis'--.\u00a0.\u00a0. not only thin, but totally undefined .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  Moore, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___  (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 11).  The majority's belief that the state court failed to follow Moore on remand merely proves that \"[n]either the Court's articulation of this standard [in Moore] nor its application sheds any light on what it means.\"  Id., at ___ (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 10).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having concluded that the Court of Criminal Appeals failed to apply the standard allegedly set out in Moore, the Court today takes it upon itself to correct these factual findings and reverse the judgment.*  This is not our role.  \"We do not grant a certiorari to review evidence and discuss specific facts.\"  United States v. Johnston, 268 U.\u00a0S. 220, 227 (1925); see also Salazar-Limon v. Houston, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (Alito, J., concurring in denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 2) (\"[W]e rarely grant review where the thrust of the claim is that a lower court simply erred in applying a settled rule of law to the facts of a particular case\").  If the Court is convinced that the Court of Criminal Appeals made a legal error, it should vacate the judgment below, pronounce the standard that we failed to provide in Moore, and remand for the state court to apply that standard.  The Court's decision, instead, to issue a summary reversal belies our role as \"a court of review, not of first view.\"  Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.\u00a0S. 709, 718, n.\u00a07 (2005).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's foray into factfinding is an unsound departure from our usual practice.  The error in this litigation was not the state court's decision on remand but our own failure to provide a coherent rule of decision in Moore.  I would deny the petition for a writ of certiorari.  I certainly would not summarily reverse and make our own finding of fact without even giving the State the opportunity to brief and argue the question.  I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1*\u00a0The Court excuses its usurpation of the factfinding role by contrasting the conclusions of \"the trial court,\" ante, at 6-7, 10, with the views of \"the court of appeals,\" ante, at 7-9.

Rees, 553 U.\u00a0S. 35, a plurality of this Court concluded that a State's refusal to alter its execution protocol could violate the Eighth Amendment only if an inmate first identified a \"feasible, readily implemented\" alternative procedure that would \"significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain.\"  Id., at 52.  A majority of the Court subsequently held Baze's plurality opinion to be controlling.  See Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Russell Bucklew was convicted of murder and sentenced to death.  The State of Missouri plans to execute him by lethal injection using a single drug, pentobarbital.  Mr. Bucklew presented an as-applied Eighth Amendment challenge to the State's lethal injection protocol, alleging that, regardless whether it would cause excruciating pain for all prisoners, it would cause him severe pain because of his particular medical condition.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court dismissed his challenge.  The Eighth Circuit, applying the Baze-Glossip test, remanded the case to allow Mr. Bucklew to identify a feasible, readily implemented alternative procedure that would significantly reduce his alleged risk of pain.  Eventually, Mr. Bucklew identified nitrogen hypoxia, but the District Court found the proposal lacking and granted the State's motion for summary judgment.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0Baze and Glossip govern all Eighth Amendment challenges, whether facial or as-applied, alleging that a method of execution inflicts unconstitutionally cruel pain.  Pp. 8-20.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The Eighth Amendment forbids \"cruel and unusual\" methods of capital punishment but does not guarantee a prisoner a painless  >death.  See Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___.  As originally understood, the Eighth Amendment tolerated methods of execution, like hanging, that involved a significant risk of pain, while forbidding as cruel only those methods that intensified the death sentence by \"superadding\" terror, pain, or disgrace.  To establish that a State's chosen method cruelly \"superadds\" pain to the death sentence, a prisoner must show a feasible and readily implemented alternative method that would significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain and that the State has refused to adopt without a legitimate penological reason.  Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 52; Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___.  And Glossip left no doubt that this standard governs \"all Eighth Amendment method-of-execution claims.\"  Id., at ___.  Baze and Glossip recognized that the Constitution affords a \"measure of deference to a State's choice of execution procedures\" and does not authorize courts to serve as \"boards of inquiry charged with determining 'best practices' for executions.\"  Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 51-52.  Nor do they suggest that traditionally accepted methods of execution are necessarily rendered unconstitutional as soon as an arguably more humane method becomes available.  Pp. 8-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Precedent forecloses Mr. Bucklew's argument that methods posing a \"substantial and particular risk of grave suffering\" when applied to a particular inmate due to his \"unique medical condition\" should be considered \"categorically\" cruel.  Because distinguishing between constitutionally permissible and impermissible degrees of pain is a necessarily comparative exercise, the Court held in Glossip, identifying an available alternative is \"a requirement of all Eighth Amendment method-of-execution claims\" alleging cruel pain.  576 U.\u00a0S., at ___.  Mr. Bucklew's argument is also inconsistent with the original and historical understanding of the Eighth Amendment on which Baze and Glossip rest: When it comes to determining whether a punishment is unconstitutionally cruel because of the pain involved, the law has always asked whether the punishment superadds pain well beyond what's needed to effectuate a death sentence.  And answering that question has always involved a comparison with available alternatives, not an abstract exercise in \"categorical\" classification.  The substantive meaning of the Eighth Amendment does not change depending on how broad a remedy the plaintiff chooses to seek.  Mr. Bucklew's solution also invites pleading games, and there is little likelihood that an inmate facing a serious risk of pain will be unable to identify an available alternative.  Pp. 14-20.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Mr. Bucklew has failed to satisfy the Baze-Glossip test.  Pp. 20-28.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0He fails for two independent reasons to present a triable question on the viability of nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative to the State's lethal injection protocol.  First, an inmate must show that his proposed alternative method is not just theoretically \"feasible\" but also \"\u00a0'readily implemented,'\u00a0\" Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___.  This means the inmate's proposal must be sufficiently detailed to permit a finding that the State could carry it out relatively easily and reasonably quickly.  Mr. Bucklew's proposal falls well short of that standard.  He presented no evidence on numerous questions essential to implementing his preferred method; instead, he merely pointed to reports from correctional authorities in other States indicating the need for additional study to develop a nitrogen hypoxia protocol.  Second, the State had a \"legitimate\" reason for declining to switch from its current method of execution as a matter of law, Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 52, namely, choosing not to be the first to experiment with a new, \"untried and untested\" method of execution.  Id., at 41.  Pp. 20-22.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Even if nitrogen hypoxia were a viable alternative, neither of Mr. Bucklew's theories shows that nitrogen hypoxia would significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain.  First, his contention that the State may use painful procedures to administer the lethal injection, including forcing him to lie flat on his back (which he claims could impair his breathing even before the pentobarbital is administered), rests on speculation unsupported, if not affirmatively contradicted, by the record.  And to the extent the record is unclear, he had ample opportunity to conduct discovery and develop a factual record concerning the State's planned procedures.  Second, Mr. Bucklew contends that while either method will cause him to experience feelings of suffocation for some period of time before he is rendered fully unconscious, the duration of that period will be shorter with nitrogen than with pentobarbital.  But nothing in the record suggests that he will be capable of experiencing pain for significantly more time after receiving pentobarbital than he would after receiving nitrogen.  His claim to the contrary rested on his expert's testimony regarding a study of euthanasia in horses that everyone now agrees the expert misunderstood or misremembered.

ANNE L. PRECYTHE, DIRECTOR, MISSOURI DEPARTMENTOF CORRECTIONS, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit\n[April 1, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Russell Bucklew concedes that the State of Missouri lawfully convicted him of murder and a variety of other crimes.  He acknowledges that the U.\u00a0S. Constitution permits a sentence of execution for his crimes.  He accepts, too, that the State's lethal injection protocol is constitutional in most applications.  But because of his unusual medical condition, he contends the protocol is unconstitutional as applied to him.  Mr. Bucklew raised this claim for the first time less than two weeks before his scheduled execution.  He received a stay of execution and five years to pursue the argument, but in the end neither the district court nor the Eighth Circuit found it supported by the law or evidence.  Now, Mr. Bucklew asks us to overturn those judgments.  We can discern no lawful basis for doing so.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1996, when Stephanie Ray announced that she wanted to end their relationship, Mr. Bucklew grew violent.  He cut her jaw, punched her in the face, and threatened her with a knife.  Frightened to remain in the home they had shared, Ms. Ray sought refuge with her children in Michael Sanders' nearby residence.  But then one night Mr. Bucklew invaded that home.  Bearing a pistol in each hand, he shot Mr. Sanders in the chest; fired at Mr. Sanders' 6-year-old son (thankfully, he missed); and pistol-whipped Ms. Ray, this time breaking her jaw.  Then Mr. Bucklew handcuffed Ms. Ray, drove her to a secluded spot, and raped her at gunpoint.  After a trooper spotted Mr. Bucklew, a shootout followed and he was finally arrested.  While all this played out, Mr. Sanders bled to death.  As a coda, Mr. Bucklew escaped from jail while awaiting trial and attacked Ms. Ray's mother with a hammer before he could be recaptured.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After a decade of litigation, Mr. Bucklew was seemingly out of legal options.  A jury had convicted him of murder and other crimes and recommended a death sentence, which the court had imposed.  His direct appeal had proved unsuccessful.  State v. Bucklew, 973 S.\u00a0W. 2d 83 (Mo. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.\u00a0S. 1082 (1999).  Separate rounds of state and federal post-conviction proceedings also had failed to yield relief.  Bucklew v. State, 38 S.\u00a0W. 3d 395 (Mo.), cert. denied, 534 U.\u00a0S. 964 (2001); Bucklew v. Luebbers, 436 F.\u00a03d 1010 (CA8), cert. denied, 549 U.\u00a0S. 1079 (2006).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As it turned out, though, Mr. Bucklew's case soon became caught up in a wave of litigation over lethal injection procedures.  Like many States, Missouri has periodically sought to improve its administration of the death penalty.  Early in the 20th century, the State replaced hanging with the gas chamber.  Later in the century, it authorized the use of lethal injection as an alternative to lethal gas.  By the time Mr. Bucklew's post-conviction proceedings ended, Missouri's protocol called for lethal injections to be carried out using three drugs: sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride.  And by that time, too, various inmates were in the process of challenging the constitutionality of the State's protocol and others like it around the country.  See Taylor v. Crawford, 457 F.\u00a03d 902 (CA8 2006); Note, A New Test for Evaluating Eighth Amendment Challenges to Lethal Injections, 120 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 1301, 1304 (2007) (describing flood of lethal injection lawsuits around 2006 that \"severely constrained states' ability to carry out executions\"); Denno, The Lethal Injection Quandary: How Medicine Has Dismantled the Death Penalty, 76 Ford. L.\u00a0Rev. 49, 102-116 (2007).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ultimately, this Court answered these legal challenges in Baze v. Rees, 553 U.\u00a0S. 35 (2008).  Addressing Kentucky's similar three-drug protocol, The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Alito and Justice Kennedy, concluded that a State's refusal to alter its lethal injection protocol could violate the Eighth Amendment only if an inmate first identified a \"feasible, readily implemented\" alternative procedure that would \"significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain.\"  Id., at 52.  Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, thought the protocol passed muster because it was not intended \"to add elements of terror, pain, or disgrace to the death penalty.\"  Id., at 107.  Justice Breyer reached the same result because he saw no evidence that the protocol created \"a significant risk of unnecessary suffering.\"  Id., at 113.  And though Justice Stevens objected to the continued use of the death penalty, he agreed that petitioners' evidence was insufficient.  Id., at 87.  After this Court decided Baze, it denied review in a case seeking to challenge Missouri's similar lethal injection protocol.  Taylor v. Crawford, 487 F.\u00a03d 1072 (2007), cert. denied, 553 U.\u00a0S. 1004 (2008).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But that still was not the end of it.  Next, Mr. Bucklew and other inmates unsuccessfully challenged Missouri's protocol in state court, alleging that it had been adopted in contravention of Missouri's Administrative Procedure Act.  Middleton v. Missouri Dept. of Corrections, 278 S.\u00a0W. 3d 193 (Mo.), cert. denied, 556 U.\u00a0S. 1255 (2009).  They also unsuccessfully challenged the protocol in federal court, this time alleging it was pre-empted by various federal statutes.  Ringo v. Lombardi, 677 F.\u00a03d 793 (CA8 2012).  And Mr. Bucklew sought to intervene in yet another lawsuit alleging that Missouri's protocol violated the Eighth Amendment because unqualified personnel might botch its administration.  That lawsuit failed too.  Clemons v. Crawford, 585 F.\u00a03d 1119 (CA8 2009), cert. denied, 561 U.\u00a0S. 1026 (2010).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While all this played out, pressure from anti-death-penalty advocates induced the company that manufactured sodium thiopental to stop supplying it for use in executions.  As a result, the State was unable to proceed with executions until it could change its lethal injection protocol again.  This it did in 2012, prescribing the use of a single drug, the sedative propofol.  Soon after that, Mr. Bucklew and other inmates sued to invalidate this new protocol as well, alleging that it would produce excruciating pain and violate the Eighth Amendment on its face.  After the State revised the protocol in 2013 to use the sedative pentobarbital instead of propofol, the inmates amended their complaint to allege that pentobarbital would likewise violate the Constitution.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Things came to a head in 2014.  With its new protocol in place and the necessary drugs now available, the State scheduled Mr. Bucklew's execution for May 21.  But 12 days before the execution Mr. Bucklew filed yet another lawsuit, the one now before us.  In this case, he presented an as-applied Eighth Amendment challenge to the State's new protocol.  Whether or not it would cause excruciating pain for all prisoners, as his previous lawsuit alleged, Mr. Bucklew now contended that the State's protocol would cause him severe pain because of his particular medical condition.  Mr. Bucklew suffers from a disease called cavernous hemangioma, which causes vascular tumors--clumps of blood vessels--to grow in his head, neck, and throat.  His complaint alleged that this condition could prevent the pentobarbital from circulating properly in his body; that the use of a chemical dye to flush the intravenous line could cause his blood pressure to spike and his tumors to rupture; and that pentobarbital could interact adversely with his other medications.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These latest protocol challenges yielded mixed results.  The district court dismissed both the inmates' facial challenge and Mr. Bucklew's as-applied challenge.  But, at Mr. Bucklew's request, this Court agreed to stay his execution until the Eighth Circuit could hear his appeal.  Bucklew v. Lombardi, 572 U.\u00a0S. 1131 (2014).  Ultimately, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the facial challenge.  Zink v. Lombardi, 783 F.\u00a03d 1089 (en banc) (per curiam), cert. denied, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015).  Then, turning to the as-applied challenge and seeking to apply the test set forth by the Baze plurality, the court held that Mr. Bucklew's complaint failed as a matter of law to identify an alternative procedure that would significantly reduce the risks he alleged would flow from the State's lethal injection protocol.  Yet, despite this dispositive shortcoming, the court of appeals decided to give Mr. Bucklew another chance to plead his case.  The court stressed that, on remand before the district court, Mr. Bucklew had to identify \"at the earliest possible time\" a feasible, readily implemented alternative procedure that would address those risks.  Bucklew v. Lombardi, 783 F.\u00a03d 1120, 1127-1128 (2015) (en banc).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shortly after the Eighth Circuit issued its judgment, this Court decided Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015), rejecting a challenge to Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol.  There, the Court clarified that The Chief Justice's plurality opinion in Baze was controlling under Marks v. United States, 430 U.\u00a0S. 188 (1977).  In doing so, it reaffirmed that an inmate cannot successfully challenge a method of execution under the Eighth Amendment unless he identifies \"an alternative that is 'feasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduces a substantial risk of severe pain.'\u00a0\"  576 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 12-13).  Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, reiterated his view that the Eighth Amendment \"prohibits only those methods of execution that are deliberately designed to inflict pain,\" but he joined the Court's opinion because it correctly explained why petitioners' claim failed even under the controlling opinion in Baze.  Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (concurring opinion) (slip op., at 1) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite the Eighth Circuit's express instructions, when Mr. Bucklew returned to the district court in 2015 he still refused to identify an alternative procedure that would significantly reduce his alleged risk of pain.  Instead, he insisted that inmates should have to carry this burden only in facial, not as-applied, challenges.  Finally, after the district court gave him \"one last opportunity,\" App. 30, Mr. Bucklew filed a fourth amended complaint in which he claimed that execution by \"lethal gas\" was a feasible and available alternative method that would significantly reduce his risk of pain.  Id., at 42.  Mr. Bucklew later clarified that the lethal gas he had in mind was nitrogen, which neither Missouri nor any other State had ever used to carry out an execution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The district court allowed Mr. Bucklew \"extensive discovery\" on his new proposal.  883 F.\u00a03d 1087, 1094 (CA8 2018).  But even at the close of discovery in 2017, the district court still found the proposal lacking and granted the State's motion for summary judgment.  By this point in the proceedings, Mr. Bucklew's contentions about the pain he might suffer had evolved considerably.  He no longer complained about circulation of the drug, the use of dye, or adverse drug interactions.  Instead, his main claim now was that he would experience pain during the period after the pentobarbital started to take effect but before it rendered him fully unconscious.  According to his expert, Dr. Joel Zivot, while in this semiconscious \"twilight stage\" Mr. Bucklew would be unable to prevent his tumors from obstructing his breathing, which would make him feel like he was suffocating.  Dr. Zivot declined to say how long this twilight stage would last.  When pressed, however, he referenced a study on euthanasia in horses.  He claimed that the horses in the study had displayed some amount of brain activity, as measured with an electroencephalogram (or EEG), for up to four minutes after they were given a large dose of pentobarbital.  Based on Dr. Zivot's testimony, the district court found a triable issue as to whether there was a \"substantial risk\" that Mr. Bucklew would \"experience choking and an inability to breathe for up to four minutes\" if he were executed by lethal injection.  App. 827.  Even so, the court held, Mr. Bucklew's claim failed because he had produced no evidence that his proposed alternative, execution by nitrogen hypoxia, would significantly reduce that risk.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This time, a panel of the Eighth Circuit affirmed.  The panel held that Mr. Bucklew had produced no evidence that the risk of pain he alleged \"would be substantially reduced by use of nitrogen hypoxia instead of lethal injection as the method of execution.\"  883 F.\u00a03d, at 1096.  Judge Colloton dissented, arguing that the evidence raised a triable issue as to whether nitrogen gas would \"render Bucklew insensate more quickly than pentobarbital.\"  Id., at 1099.  The full court denied rehearing en banc over a dissent by Judge Kelly, who maintained that, while prisoners pursuing facial challenges to a state execution protocol must plead and prove an alternative method of execution under Baze and Glossip, prisoners like Mr. Bucklew who pursue as-applied challenges should not have to bear that burden.  885 F.\u00a03d 527, 528 (2018).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the same day Mr. Bucklew was scheduled to be executed, this Court granted him a second stay of execution.  583 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).  We then agreed to hear his case to clarify the legal standards that govern an as-applied Eighth Amendment challenge to a State's method of carrying out a death sentence.  584 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We begin with Mr. Bucklew's suggestion that the test for lethal injection protocol challenges announced in Baze and Glossip should govern only facial challenges, not as-applied challenges like his.  In evaluating this argument, we first examine the original and historical understanding of the Eighth Amendment and our precedent in Baze and Glossip.  We then address whether, in light of those authorities, it would be appropriate to adopt a different constitutional test for as-applied claims.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Constitution allows capital punishment.  See Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 2-4); Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 47.  In fact, death was \"the standard penalty for all serious crimes\" at the time of the founding.  S. Banner, The Death Penalty: An American History 23 (2002) (Banner).  Nor did the later addition of the Eighth Amendment outlaw the practice.  On the contrary--the Fifth Amendment, added to the Constitution at the same time as the Eighth, expressly contemplates that a defendant may be tried for a \"capital\" crime and \"deprived of life\" as a penalty, so long as proper procedures are followed.  And the First Congress, which proposed both Amendments, made a number of crimes punishable by death.  See Act of Apr. 30, 1790, 1 Stat. 112.  Of course, that doesn't mean the American people must continue to use the death penalty.  The same Constitution that permits States to authorize capital punishment also allows them to outlaw it.  But it does mean that the judiciary bears no license to end a debate reserved for the people and their representatives.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the Eighth Amendment doesn't forbid capital punishment, it does speak to how States may carry out that punishment, prohibiting methods that are \"cruel and unusual.\"  What does this term mean?  At the time of the framing, English law still formally tolerated certain punishments even though they had largely fallen into disuse--punishments in which \"terror, pain, or disgrace [were] superadded\" to the penalty of death.  4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 370 (1769).  These included such \"[d]isgusting\" practices as dragging the prisoner to the place of execution, disemboweling, quartering, public dissection, and burning alive, all of which Blackstone observed \"savor[ed] of torture or cruelty.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Methods of execution like these readily qualified as \"cruel and unusual,\" as a reader at the time of the Eighth Amendment's adoption would have understood those words.  They were undoubtedly \"cruel,\" a term often defined to mean \"[p]leased with hurting others; inhuman; hard-hearted; void of pity; wanting compassion; savage; barbarous; unrelenting,\" 1 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed. 1773), or \"[d]isposed to give pain to others, in body or mind; willing or pleased to torment, vex or afflict; inhuman; destitute of pity, compassion or kindness,\" 1 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828).  And by the time of the founding, these methods had long fallen out of use and so had become \"unusual.\"  4 Blackstone, supra, at 370; Banner 76; Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 97 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); see also Stinneford, The Original Meaning of \"Unusual\": The Eighth Amendment as a Bar to Cruel Innovation, 102 Nw. U. L.\u00a0Rev. 1739, 1770-1771, 1814 (2008) (observing that Americans in the late 18th and early 19th centuries described as \"unusual\" governmental actions that had \"fall[en] completely out of usage for a long period of time\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Contemporary evidence confirms that the people who ratified the Eighth Amendment would have understood it in just this way.  Patrick Henry, for one, warned that unless the Constitution was amended to prohibit \"cruel and unusual punishments,\" Congress would be free to inflict \"tortures\" and \"barbarous\" punishments.  3 Debates on the Federal Constitution 447-448 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1891).  Many early commentators likewise described the Eighth Amendment as ruling out \"the use of the rack or the stake, or any of those horrid modes of torture devised by human ingenuity for the gratification of fiendish passion.\"  J. Bayard, A Brief Exposition of the Constitution of the United States 140 (1833); see B. Oliver, The Rights of an American Citizen 186 (1832) (the Eighth Amendment prohibits such \"barbarous and cruel punishments\" as \"[b]reaking on the wheel, flaying alive, rending asunder with horses, .\u00a0.\u00a0. maiming, mutilating and scourging to death\").  Justice Story even remarked that he thought the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments likely \"unnecessary\" because no \"free government\" would ever authorize \"atrocious\" methods of execution like these.  3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a71896, p. 750 (1833).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistent with the Constitution's original understanding, this Court in Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.\u00a0S. 130 (1879), permitted an execution by firing squad while observing that the Eighth Amendment forbade the gruesome methods of execution described by Blackstone \"and all others in the same line of unnecessary cruelty.\"  Id., at 135-136.  A few years later, the Court upheld a sentence of death by electrocution while observing that, though electrocution was a new mode of punishment and therefore perhaps could be considered \"unusual,\" it was not \"cruel\" in the constitutional sense: \"[T]he punishment of death is not cruel, within the meaning of that word as used in the Constitution.  [Cruelty] implies .\u00a0.\u00a0. something inhuman and barbarous, something more than the mere extinguishment of life.\"  In\u00a0re Kemmler, 136 U.\u00a0S. 436, 447 (1890).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's instructive, too, to contrast the modes of execution the Eighth Amendment was understood to forbid with those it was understood to permit.  At the time of the Amendment's adoption, the predominant method of execution in this country was hanging.  Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).  While hanging was considered more humane than some of the punishments of the Old World, it was no guarantee of a quick and painless death.  \"Many and perhaps most hangings were evidently painful for the condemned person because they caused death slowly,\" and \"[w]hether a hanging was painless or painful seems to have been largely a matter of chance.\"  Banner 48, 170.  The force of the drop could break the neck and sever the spinal cord, making death almost instantaneous.  But that was hardly assured given the techniques that prevailed at the time.  More often it seems the prisoner would die from loss of blood flow to the brain, which could produce unconsciousness usually within seconds, or suffocation, which could take several minutes.  Id., at 46-47; J. Laurence, The History of Capital Punishment 44-46 (1960); Gardner, Executions and Indignities: An Eighth Amendment Assessment of Methods of Inflicting Capital Punishment, 39 Ohio St. L.\u00a0J. 96, 120 (1978).  But while hanging could and often did result in significant pain, its use \"was virtually never questioned.\"  Banner 170.  Presumably that was because, in contrast to punishments like burning and disemboweling, hanging wasn't \"intended to be painful\" and the risk of pain involved was considered \"unfortunate but inevitable.\"  Ibid.; see also id., at 48.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What does all this tell us about how the Eighth Amendment applies to methods of execution?  For one thing, it tells us that the Eighth Amendment does not guarantee a prisoner a painless death--something that, of course, isn't guaranteed to many people, including most victims of capital crimes.  Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  Instead, what unites the punishments the Eighth Amendment was understood to forbid, and distinguishes them from those it was understood to allow, is that the former were long disused (unusual) forms of punishment that intensified the sentence of death with a (cruel) \"\u00a0'superadd[ition]'\u00a0\" of \"\u00a0'terror, pain, or disgrace.'\u00a0\"  Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 48; accord, id., at 96 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has yet to hold that a State's method of execution qualifies as cruel and unusual, and perhaps understandably so.  Far from seeking to superadd terror, pain, or disgrace to their executions, the States have often sought more nearly the opposite, exactly as Justice Story predicted.  Through much of the 19th century, States experimented with technological innovations aimed at making hanging less painful.  See Banner 170-177.  In the 1880s, following the recommendation of a commission tasked with finding \"\u00a0'the most humane and practical method known to modern science of carrying into effect the sentence of death,'\u00a0\" the State of New York replaced hanging with electrocution.  Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).  Several States followed suit in the \"\u00a0'\u00a0\"belief that electrocution is less painful and more humane than hanging.\"\u00a0'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  Other States adopted lethal gas after concluding it was \"\u00a0'the most humane [method of execution] known to modern science.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  And beginning in the 1970s, the search for less painful modes of execution led many States to switch to lethal injection.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3); Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 42, 62; see also Banner 178-181, 196-197, 297.  Notably, all of these innovations occurred not through this Court's intervention, but through the initiative of the people and their representatives.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still, accepting the possibility that a State might try to carry out an execution in an impermissibly cruel and unusual manner, how can a court determine when a State has crossed the line?  The Chief Justice's opinion in Baze, which a majority of the Court held to be controlling in Glossip, supplies critical guidance.  It teaches that where (as here) the question in dispute is whether the State's chosen method of execution cruelly superadds pain to the death sentence, a prisoner must show a feasible and readily implemented alternative method of execution that would significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain and that the State has refused to adopt without a legitimate penological reason.  See Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 12-13); Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 52.  Glossip left no doubt that this standard governs \"all Eighth Amendment method-of-execution claims.\"  576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In reaching this conclusion, Baze and Glossip recognized that the Eighth Amendment \"does not demand the avoidance of all risk of pain in carrying out executions.\"  Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 47.  To the contrary, the Constitution affords a \"measure of deference to a State's choice of execution procedures\" and does not authorize courts to serve as \"boards of inquiry charged with determining 'best practices' for executions.\"  Id., at 51-52, and nn.\u00a02-3.  The Eighth Amendment does not come into play unless the risk of pain associated with the State's method is \"substantial when compared to a known and available alternative.\"  Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13); see Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 61.  Nor do Baze and Glossip suggest that traditionally accepted methods of execution--such as hanging, the firing squad, electrocution, and lethal injection--are necessarily rendered unconstitutional as soon as an arguably more humane method like lethal injection becomes available.  There are, the Court recognized, many legitimate reasons why a State might choose, consistent with the Eighth Amendment, not to adopt a prisoner's preferred method of execution.  See, e.g., Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 13-14) (a State can't be faulted for failing to use lethal injection drugs that it's unable to procure through good-faith efforts); Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 57 (a State has a legitimate interest in selecting a method it regards as \"preserving the dignity of the procedure\"); id., at 66 (Alito, J., concurring) (a State isn't required to modify its protocol in ways that would require the involvement of \"persons whose professional ethics rules or traditions impede their participation\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we've seen, two Members of the Court whose votes were essential to the judgment in Glossip argued that establishing cruelty consistent with the Eighth Amendment's original meaning demands slightly more than the majority opinion there (or the Baze plurality opinion it followed) suggested.  Instead of requiring an inmate to establish that a State has unreasonably refused to alter its method of execution to avoid a risk of unnecessary pain, Justice Thomas and Justice Scalia contended that an inmate must show that the State intended its method to inflict such pain.  See Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1); Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 94-107 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  But revisiting that debate isn't necessary here because, as we'll see, the State was entitled to summary judgment in this case even under the more forgiving Baze-Glossip test.  See Part III, infra.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before turning to the application of Baze and Glossip, however, we must confront Mr. Bucklew's argument that a different standard entirely should govern as-applied challenges like his.  He admits that Baze and Glossip supply the controlling test in facial challenges to a State's chosen method of execution.  But he suggests that he should not have to prove an alternative method of execution in his as-applied challenge because \"certain categories\" of punishment are \"manifestly cruel .\u00a0.\u00a0. without reference to any alternative methods.\"  Brief for Petitioner 41-42 (internal quotation marks omitted).  He points to \"\u00a0'burning at the stake, crucifixion, [and] breaking on the wheel'\u00a0\" as examples of \"categorically\" cruel methods.  Ibid.  And, he says, we should use this case to add to the list of \"categorically\" cruel methods any method that, as applied to a particular inmate, will pose a \"substantial and particular risk of grave suffering\" due to the inmate's \"unique medical condition.\"  Id., at 44.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first problem with this argument is that it's foreclosed by precedent.  Glossip expressly held that identifying an available alternative is \"a requirement of all Eighth Amendment method-of-execution claims\" alleging cruel pain.  576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (emphasis added).  And just as binding as this holding is the reasoning underlying it.  Distinguishing between constitutionally permissible and impermissible degrees of pain, Baze and Glossip explained, is a necessarily comparative exercise.  To decide whether the State has cruelly \"superadded\" pain to the punishment of death isn't something that can be accomplished by examining the State's proposed method in a vacuum, but only by \"compar[ing]\" that method with a viable alternative.  Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13); see Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 61.  As Mr. Bucklew acknowledges when speaking of facial challenges, this comparison \"provides the needed metric\" to measure whether the State is lawfully carrying out an execution or inflicting \"gratuitous\" pain.  Brief for Petitioner 42-43.  Yet it is that very comparison and needed metric Mr. Bucklew would now have us discard.  Nor does he offer some persuasive reason for overturning our precedent.  To the contrary, Mr. Bucklew simply repeats the same argument the principal dissent offered and the Court expressly and thoughtfully rejected in Glossip.  Just as Mr. Bucklew argues here, the dissent there argued that \"certain methods of execution\" like \"burning at the stake\" should be declared \"categorically off-limits.\"  And just as Mr. Bucklew submits here, the dissent there argued that any other \"intolerably painful\" method of execution should be added to this list.  576 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 23-24).  Mr. Bucklew's submission, thus, amounts to no more than a headlong attack on precedent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Bucklew's argument fails for another independent reason: It is inconsistent with the original and historical understanding of the Eighth Amendment on which Baze and Glossip rest.  As we've seen, when it comes to determining whether a punishment is unconstitutionally cruel because of the pain involved, the law has always asked whether the punishment \"superadds\" pain well beyond what's needed to effectuate a death sentence.  And answering that question has always involved a comparison with available alternatives, not some abstract exercise in \"categorical\" classification.  At common law, the ancient and barbaric methods of execution Mr. Bucklew cites were understood to be cruel precisely because--by comparison to other available methods--they went so far beyond what was needed to carry out a death sentence that they could only be explained as reflecting the infliction of pain for pain's sake.  Meanwhile, hanging carried with it an acknowledged and substantial risk of pain but was not considered cruel because that risk was thought--by comparison to other known methods--to involve no more pain than was reasonably necessary to impose a lawful death sentence.  See supra, at 9-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What does the principal dissent have to say about all this?  It acknowledges that Glossip's comparative requirement helps prevent facial method-of-execution claims from becoming a \"backdoor means to abolish\" the death penalty.  Post, at 8 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  But, the dissent assures us, there's no reason to worry that as-applied method-of-execution challenges might be used that way.  This assurance misses the point.  As we've explained, the alternative-method requirement is compelled by our understanding of the Constitution, not by mere policy concerns.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With that, the dissent is left only to rehash the same argument that Mr. Bucklew offers.  The dissent insists that some forms of execution are just categorically cruel.  Post, at 10-11.  At first and like others who have made this argument, the dissent offers little more than intuition to support its conclusion.  Ultimately, though, even it bows to the necessity of something firmer.  If a \"comparator is needed\" to assess whether an execution is cruel, the dissent tells us, we should compare the pain likely to follow from the use of a lethal injection in this case with the pain-free use of lethal injections in mine-run cases.  Post, at 10.  But that's just another way of saying executions must always be carried out painlessly because they can be carried out painlessly most of the time, a standard the Constitution has never required and this Court has rejected time and time again.  Supra, at 12.  To determine whether the State is cruelly superadding pain, our precedents and history require asking whether the State had some other feasible and readily available method to carry out its lawful sentence that would have significantly reduced a substantial risk of pain.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That Mr. Bucklew and the dissent fail to respect the force of our precedents--or to grapple with the understanding of the Constitution on which our precedents rest--is more than enough reason to reject their view that as-applied and facial challenges should be treated differently.  But it turns out their position on this score suffers from further problems too--problems that neither Mr. Bucklew nor the dissent even attempts to address.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take this one.  A facial challenge is really just a claim that the law or policy at issue is unconstitutional in all its applications.  So classifying a lawsuit as facial or as-applied affects the extent to which the invalidity of the challenged law must be demonstrated and the corresponding \"breadth of the remedy,\" but it does not speak at all to the substantive rule of law necessary to establish a constitutional violation.  Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm'n, 558 U.\u00a0S. 310, 331 (2010).  Surely it would be strange for the same words of the Constitution to bear entirely different meanings depending only on how broad a remedy the plaintiff chooses to seek.  See Gross v. United States, 771 F.\u00a03d 10, 14-15 (CADC 2014) (\"\u00a0'[T]he substantive rule of law is the same for both [facial and as-applied] challenges'\u00a0\"); Brooklyn Legal Servs. Corp. v. Legal Servs. Corp., 462 F.\u00a03d 219, 228 (CA2 2006) (the facial\/as-applied distinction affects \"the extent to which the invalidity of a statute need be demonstrated,\" not \"the substantive rule of law to be used\").  And surely, too, it must count for something that we have found not a single court decision in over 200 years suggesting that the Eighth Amendment's meaning shifts in this way.  To the contrary, our precedent suggests just the opposite.  In the related context of an Eighth Amendment challenge to conditions of confinement, we have seen \"no basis whatever\" for applying a different legal standard to \"deprivations inflicted upon all prisoners\" and those \"inflicted upon particular prisoners.\"  Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.\u00a0S. 294, 299, n.\u00a01 (1991).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here's yet another problem with Mr. Bucklew's argument: It invites pleading games.  The line between facial and as-applied challenges can sometimes prove \"amorphous,\" Elgin v. Department of Treasury, 567 U.\u00a0S. 1, 15 (2012), and \"not so well defined,\" Citizens United, 558 U.\u00a0S., at 331.  Consider an example.  Suppose an inmate claims that the State's lethal injection protocol violates the Eighth Amendment when used to execute anyone with a very common but not quite universal health condition.  Should such a claim be regarded as facial or as-applied?  In another context, we sidestepped a debate over how to categorize a comparable claim--one that neither sought \"to strike [the challenged law] in all its applications\" nor was \"limited to plaintiff's particular case\"--by concluding that \"[t]he label is not what matters.\"  Doe v. Reed, 561 U.\u00a0S. 186, 194 (2010).  To hold now, for the first time, that choosing a label changes the meaning of the Constitution would only guarantee a good deal of litigation over labels, with lawyers on each side seeking to classify cases to maximize their tactical advantage.  Unless increasing the delay and cost involved in carrying out executions is the point of the exercise, it's hard to see the benefit in placing so much weight on what can be an abstruse exercise.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the burden Mr. Bucklew must shoulder under the Baze-Glossip test can be overstated.  An inmate seeking to identify an alternative method of execution is not limited to choosing among those presently authorized by a particular State's law.  Missouri itself seemed to acknowledge as much at oral argument.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 65.  So, for example, a prisoner may point to a well-established protocol in another State as a potentially viable option.  Of course, in a case like that a court would have to inquire into the possibility that one State possessed a legitimate reason for declining to adopt the protocol of another.  See supra, at 13-14.  And existing state law might be relevant to determining the proper procedural vehicle for the inmate's claim.  See Hill v. McDonough, 547 U.\u00a0S. 573, 582-583 (2006) (if the relief sought in a 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983 action would \"foreclose the State from implementing the [inmate's] sentence under present law,\" then \"recharacterizing a complaint as an action for habeas corpus might be proper\").  But the Eighth Amendment is the supreme law of the land, and the comparative assessment it requires can't be controlled by the State's choice of which methods to authorize in its statutes.  In light of this, we see little likelihood that an inmate facing a serious risk of pain will be unable to identify an available alternative--assuming, of course, that the inmate is more interested in avoiding unnecessary pain than in delaying his execution.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having (re)confirmed that anyone bringing a method of execution claim alleging the infliction of unconstitutionally cruel pain must meet the Baze-Glossip test, we can now turn to the question whether Mr. Bucklew is able to satisfy that test.  Has he identified a feasible and readily implemented alternative method of execution the State refused to adopt without a legitimate reason, even though it would significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain?  Because the case comes to us after the entry of summary judgment, this appeal turns on whether Mr. Bucklew has shown a genuine issue of material fact warranting a trial.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We begin with the question of a proposed alternative method.  Through much of this case and despite many opportunities, Mr. Bucklew refused to identify any alternative method of execution, choosing instead to stand on his argument that Baze and Glossip's legal standard doesn't govern as-applied challenges like his (even after the Eighth Circuit rejected that argument).  Only when the district court warned that his continued refusal to abide this Court's precedents would result in immediate dismissal did Mr. Bucklew finally point to nitrogen hypoxia.  The district court then afforded Mr. Bucklew \"extensive discovery\" to explore the viability of that alternative.  883 F.\u00a03d, at 1094.  But even after all that, we conclude Mr. Bucklew has failed for two independent reasons to present a triable question on the viability of nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative to the State's lethal injection protocol.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, an inmate must show that his proposed alternative method is not just theoretically \"\u00a0'feasible'\u00a0\" but also \"\u00a0'readily implemented.'\u00a0\"  Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 12-13).  This means the inmate's proposal must be sufficiently detailed to permit a finding that the State could carry it out \"relatively easily and reasonably quickly.\"  McGehee v. Hutchinson, 854 F.\u00a03d 488, 493 (CA8 2017); Arthur v. Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections, 840 F.\u00a03d 1268, 1300 (CA11 2016).  Mr. Bucklew's bare-bones proposal falls well short of that standard.  He has presented no evidence on essential questions like how nitrogen gas should be administered (using a gas chamber, a tent, a hood, a mask, or some other delivery device); in what concentration (pure nitrogen or some mixture of gases); how quickly and for how long it should be introduced; or how the State might ensure the safety of the execution team, including protecting them against the risk of gas leaks.  Instead of presenting the State with a readily implemented alternative method, Mr. Bucklew (and the principal dissent) point to reports from correctional authorities in other States indicating that additional study is needed to develop a protocol for execution by nitrogen hypoxia.  See App. 697 (Oklahoma grand jury report recommending that the State \"retain experts\" and conduct \"further research\" to \"determine how to carry out the sentence of death by this method\"); id., at 736 (report of Louisiana Dept. of Public Safety & Corrections stating that \"[r]esearch .\u00a0.\u00a0. is ongoing\" to develop a nitrogen hypoxia protocol).  That is a proposal for more research, not the readily implemented alternative that Baze and Glossip require.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, and relatedly, the State had a \"legitimate\" reason for declining to switch from its current method of execution as a matter of law.  Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 52.  Rather than point to a proven alternative method, Mr. Bucklew sought the adoption of an entirely new method--one that had \"never been used to carry out an execution\" and had \"no track record of successful use.\"  McGehee, 854 F.\u00a03d, at 493.  But choosing not to be the first to experiment with a new method of execution is a legitimate reason to reject it.  In Baze we observed that \"no other State ha[d] adopted\" the one-drug protocol the inmates sought and they had \"proffered no study showing\" their one-drug protocol would be as effective and humane as the State's existing three-drug protocol.  553 U.\u00a0S., at 57.  Under those circumstances, we held as a matter of law that Kentucky's refusal to adopt the inmates' proffered protocol could not \"constitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment.\"  Ibid.  The Eighth Amendment prohibits States from dredging up archaic cruel punishments or perhaps inventing new ones, but it does not compel a State to adopt \"untried and untested\" (and thus unusual in the constitutional sense) methods of execution.  Id., at 41.1\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if a prisoner can carry his burden of showing a readily available alternative, he must still show that it would significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain.  Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13); Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 52.  A minor reduction in risk is insufficient; the difference must be clear and considerable.  Over the course of this litigation, Mr. Bucklew's explanation why nitrogen hypoxia meets this standard has evolved significantly.  But neither of the two theories he has advanced in this Court turns out to be supported by record evidence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, Mr. Bucklew points to several risks that he alleges could result from use of the State's lethal injection protocol that would not be present if the State used nitrogen gas.  For example, he says the execution team might try to insert an IV into one of his peripheral veins, which could cause the vein to rupture; or the team might instead use an allegedly painful \"cut-down\" procedure to access his femoral vein.  He also says that he might be forced to lie flat on his back during the execution, which could impair his breathing even before the pentobarbital is administered.  And he says the stress from all this could cause his tumors to bleed, further impairing his breathing.  These risks, we may assume, would not exist if Mr. Bucklew were executed by his preferred method of nitrogen hypoxia.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The problem with all of these contentions is that they rest on speculation unsupported, if not affirmatively contradicted, by the evidence in this case.  Nor does the principal dissent contend otherwise.  So, for example, uncontroverted record evidence indicates that the execution team will have discretion to adjust the gurney to whatever position is in Mr. Bucklew's best medical interests.  883 F.\u00a03d, at 1092, n.\u00a03; App. 531.  Moreover, the State agreed in the district court that it would not try to place an IV in Mr. Bucklew's compromised peripheral veins.  Id., at 820; see Brief for Appellant in No. 17-3052 (CA8), p.\u00a07.  And, assuming without granting that using a cut-down would raise issues under the Eighth Amendment--but see Nooner v. Norris, 594 F.\u00a03d 592, 604 (CA8 2010) (holding otherwise)--the State's expert, Dr. Michael Antognini, testified without contradiction that it should be possible to place an IV in Mr. Bucklew's femoral vein without using a cut-down procedure, App. 350.  Mr. Bucklew responds by pointing to the warden's testimony that he once saw medical staff perform a cut-down as part of an execution; but there's no evidence that what the warden saw was an attempt to access a femoral vein, as opposed to some other vein.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, to the extent the record is unclear on any of these issues, Mr. Bucklew had ample opportunity to conduct discovery and develop a factual record concerning exactly what procedures the State planned to use.  He failed to do so--presumably because the thrust of his constitutional claim was that any attempt to execute him via lethal injection would be unconstitutional, regardless of the specific procedures the State might use.  As the court of appeals explained: \"Having taken the position that any lethal injection procedure would violate the Eighth Amendment,\" Mr. Bucklew \"made no effort to determine what changes, if any, the [State] would make in applying its lethal injection protocol\" to him, and he \"never urged the district court to establish a suitable fact-finding procedure .\u00a0.\u00a0. to define the as-applied lethal injection protocol [the State] intends to use.\"  883 F.\u00a03d, at 1095-1096.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, Mr. Bucklew contends that the lethal injection itself will expose him to a substantial risk of severe pain that could be eliminated by adopting his preferred method.  He claims that once the sedative pentobarbital is injected he will \"lose the ability to manage\" the tumors in his airway and, as a result, will experience a \"sense of suffocation\" for some period of time before the State's sedative renders him fully unconscious.  Brief for Petitioner 12-13.  \"It is during this in-between twilight stage,\" according to his expert, Dr. Zivot, \"that Mr. Bucklew is likely to experience prolonged feelings of suffocation and excruciating pain.\"  App. 234.  Mr. Bucklew admits that similar feelings of suffocation could occur with nitrogen, the only difference being the potential duration of the so-called \"twilight stage.\"  He contends that with nitrogen the stage would last at most 20 to 30 seconds, while with pentobarbital it could last up to several minutes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But here again the record contains insufficient evidence to permit Mr. Bucklew to avoid summary judgment.  For starters, in the courts below Mr. Bucklew maintained he would have trouble managing his airway only if he were forced to lie supine, which (as we've explained) the evidence shows he won't be.  (The dissenters don't address this point.)  But even indulging his new claim that he will have this difficulty regardless of position, he still has failed to present colorable evidence that nitrogen would significantly reduce his risk of pain.  We can assume for argument's sake that Mr. Bucklew is correct that with nitrogen the twilight stage would last 20 to 30 seconds.  The critical question, then, is how long that period might last with pentobarbital.  The State's expert, Dr. Antognini, testified that pentobarbital, too, would render Mr. Bucklew fully unconscious and incapable of experiencing pain within 20 to 30 seconds.  Id., at 299-301, 432-433.  Dr. Zivot disagreed; but when he was asked how long he thought the twilight stage would last with pentobarbital, his testimony was evasive.  Eventually, he said his \"number would be longer than\" 20 to 30 seconds, but he declined to say how much longer.  Id., at 195.  Instead, he referenced a 2015 study on euthanasia in horses.  He said the study found that when horses were given a large dose of pentobarbital (along with other drugs), they exhibited \"isoelectric EEG\"--a complete absence of detectable brain activity--after 52 to 240 seconds.  Id., at 194-196.  The district court assumed Dr. Zivot meant that \"pain might be felt until measurable brain activity ceases\" and that, extrapolating from the horse study, it might take up to four minutes for pentobarbital to \"induc[e] a state in which [Mr. Bucklew] could no longer sense that he is choking or unable to breathe.\"  The district court acknowledged, however, that this might be \"a generous interpretation of Dr. Zivot's testimony.\"  Id., at 822, and n.\u00a05.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In fact, there's nothing in the record to suggest that Mr. Bucklew will be capable of experiencing pain for significantly more than 20 to 30 seconds after being injected with pentobarbital.  For one thing, Mr. Bucklew's lawyer now admits that Dr. Zivot \"crossed up the numbers\" from the horse study.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 7-8, 11-12.  The study actually reported that the horses displayed isoelectric EEG between 2 and 52 seconds after infusion of pentobarbital was completed, with an average time of less than 24 seconds.  App. 267.  So if anything, the horse study appears to bolster Dr. Antognini's time estimate.  For another thing, everyone now also seems to acknowledge that isoelectric EEG is the wrong measure.  Dr. Zivot never claimed the horses were capable of experiencing pain until they reached isoelectric EEG.  And Mr. Bucklew's lawyer now concedes that doctors perform major surgery on human patients with measurable EEG readings, which strongly suggests that Mr. Bucklew will be insensible to pain before reaching isoelectric EEG.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.  Finally, the record evidence even allows the possibility that nitrogen could increase the risk of pain.  Because Dr. Zivot declined to testify about the likely effects of nitrogen gas, Mr. Bucklew must rely on Dr. Antognini's testimony.  And while Dr. Antognini did say he thought nitrogen's \"onset of action\" could be \"relatively fast,\" App. 458, he added that the effects of nitrogen could vary depending on exactly how it would be administered--information Mr. Bucklew hadn't provided.  Indeed, he stated that \"depending on .\u00a0.\u00a0. how it's used, you might get more suffering from nitrogen gas than you would have\" from the State's current protocol.  Id., at 460-461.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, the principal dissent maintains that Dr. Zivot's testimony supports an inference that pentobarbital might cause Mr. Bucklew to suffer for a prolonged period.  But its argument rests on a number of mistakes about the record.  For example, the dissent points to Dr. Zivot's remark that, with pentobarbital, \"\u00a0'the period of time between receiving the injection and death could range over a few minutes to many minutes.'\u00a0\"  Post, at 4, 6 (quoting App. 222).  From this, the dissent concludes that Mr. Bucklew may suffer for \"up to several minutes.\"  Post, at 1, 6, 9.  But everyone agrees that the relevant question isn't how long it will take for Mr. Bucklew to die, but how long he will be capable of feeling pain.  Seeking to address the problem, the dissent next points to another part of Dr. Zivot's testimony and says it means Mr. Bucklew could experience pain during the entire time between injection and death.  Post, at 6, 13 (quoting App. 222).  But the dissent clips the relevant quotation.  As the full quotation makes clear, Dr. Zivot claimed that Mr. Bucklew might be unable to \"maintain the integrity of his airway\" until he died--but he carefully avoided claiming that Mr. Bucklew would be capable of feeling pain until he died.3  To avoid this problem, the dissent quotes Dr. Zivot's assertions that pentobarbital might not produce \"\u00a0'rapid unconsciousness'\u00a0\" and that Mr. Bucklew's suffering with pentobarbital could be \"\u00a0'prolonged.'\u00a0\"  Post, at 4-6, 13 (quoting App. 233-234).  But Dr. Zivot's statements here, too, fail to specify how long Mr. Bucklew is likely to be able to feel pain.  The hard fact is that, when Dr. Zivot was finally compelled to offer a view on this question, his only response was to refer to the horse study.  Id., at 195-196.  The dissent's effort to suggest that Dr. Zivot \"did not rely exclusively or even heavily on that study,\" post, at 7, is belied by (among other things) Mr. Bucklew's own brief in this Court, which asserted that the twilight stage during which he might feel pain could last \"between 52 and 240 seconds,\" based entirely on a citation of Dr. Zivot's incorrect testimony about the horse study.  Brief for Petitioner 13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, even if execution by nitrogen hypoxia were a feasible and readily implemented alternative to the State's chosen method, Mr. Bucklew has still failed to present any evidence suggesting that it would significantly reduce his risk of pain.  For that reason as well, the State was entitled to summary judgment on Mr. Bucklew's Eighth Amendment claim.4\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Both the State and the victims of crime have an important interest in the timely enforcement of a sentence.\"  Hill, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 584.  Those interests have been frustrated in this case.  Mr. Bucklew committed his crimes more than two decades ago.  He exhausted his appeal and separate state and federal habeas challenges more than a decade ago.  Yet since then he has managed to secure delay through lawsuit after lawsuit.  He filed his current challenge just days before his scheduled execution.  That suit has now carried on for five years and yielded two appeals to the Eighth Circuit, two 11th-hour stays of execution, and plenary consideration in this Court.  And despite all this, his suit in the end amounts to little more than an attack on settled precedent, lacking enough evidence even to survive summary judgment--and on not just one but many essential legal elements set forth in our case law and required by the Constitution's original meaning.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The people of Missouri, the surviving victims of Mr. Bucklew's crimes, and others like them deserve better.  Even the principal dissent acknowledges that \"the long delays that now typically occur between the time an offender is sentenced to death and his execution\" are \"excessive.\"  Post, at 16.  The answer is not, as the dissent incongruously suggests, to reward those who interpose delay with a decree ending capital punishment by judicial fiat.  Post, at 18.  Under our Constitution, the question of capital punishment belongs to the people and their representatives, not the courts, to resolve.  The proper role of courts is to ensure that method-of-execution challenges to lawfully issued sentences are resolved fairly and expeditiously.  Courts should police carefully against attempts to use such challenges as tools to interpose unjustified delay.  Last-minute stays should be the extreme exception, not the norm, and \"the last-minute nature of an application\" that \"could have been brought\" earlier, or \"an applicant's attempt at manipulation,\" \"may be grounds for denial of a stay.\"  Hill, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 584 (internal quotation marks omitted).  So, for example, we have vacated a stay entered by a lower court as an abuse of discretion where the inmate waited to bring an available claim until just 10 days before his scheduled execution for a murder he had committed 24 years earlier.  See Dunn v. Ray, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019).5  If litigation is allowed to proceed, federal courts \"can and should\" protect settled state judgments from \"undue interference\" by invoking their \"equitable powers\" to dismiss or curtail suits that are pursued in a \"dilatory\" fashion or based on \"speculative\" theories.

Rees, 553 U.\u00a0S. 35, 94 (2008) (opinion concurring in judgment); ante, at 14.  Because there is no evidence that Missouri designed its protocol to inflict pain on anyone, let alone Russell Bucklew, I would end the inquiry there.  Nonetheless, I join the Court's opinion in full because it correctly explains why Bucklew's claim fails even under the Court's precedents.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I write separately to explain why Justice Breyer's dissenting opinion does not cast doubt on this standard.  Post, at 15-16.  As I explained in Baze, \"the evil the Eighth Amendment targets is intentional infliction of gratuitous pain.\"  553 U.\u00a0S., at 102 (opinion concurring in judgment).  The historical evidence shows that the Framers sought to disable Congress from imposing various kinds of torturous punishments, such as \"\u00a0'gibbeting,'\u00a0\" \"burning at the stake,\" and \"\u00a0'embowelling alive, beheading, and quartering.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 95-98 (quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *376 (Blackstone), and S. Banner, The Death Penalty: An American History 71-72 (2002)).  In England, these aggravated forms of capital punishment were \"\u00a0'superadded'\u00a0\" to increase terror and disgrace for \"\u00a0'very atrocious crimes,'\u00a0\" such as treason and murder.  See Baze, supra, at 96-97 (quoting 4 Blackstone *376).  The founding generation ratified the Eighth Amendment to reject that practice, contemplating that capital punishment would continue, but without those punishments deliberately designed to superadd pain.  See Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 97-98.  Under this view, the constitutionality of a particular execution thus turns on whether the Government \"deliberately designed\" the method of execution \"to inflict pain,\" id., at 94, without regard to the subjective intent of the executioner.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Contrary to Justice Breyer's suggestion, my view does not render the Eighth Amendment \"a static prohibition\" proscribing only \"the same things that it proscribed in the 18th century.\"  Post, at 15-16.  A method of execution not specifically contemplated at the founding could today be imposed to \"superad[d]\" \"terror, pain, or disgrace.\"  4 Blackstone *376.  Thankfully--and consistent with Justice Story's view that the Eighth Amendment is \"wholly unnecessary in a free government,\" 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 750 (1833)--States do not attempt to devise such diabolical punishments.  E.g., Baze, supra, at 107 (\"Kentucky adopted its lethal injection protocol in an effort to make capital punishment more humane\").  It is therefore unsurprising that, despite Justice Breyer's qualms about the death penalty, e.g., post, at 18, this Court has never held a method of execution unconstitutional.  Because the Court correctly declines to do so again today, I join in full.\n\nKavanaugh, J., concurring\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-8151\nRUSSELL BUCKLEW, PETITIONER v. ANNE L. PRECYTHE, DIRECTOR, MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit\n[April 1, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kavanaugh, concurring.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When an inmate raises an as-applied constitutional challenge to a particular method of execution--that is, a challenge to a method of execution that is constitutional in general but that the inmate says is very likely to cause him severe pain--one question is whether the inmate must identify an available alternative method of execution that would significantly reduce the risk of severe pain.  Applying our recent decisions in Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015), and Baze v. Rees, 553 U.\u00a0S. 35 (2008) (plurality opinion), the Court's answer to that question is yes.  Under those precedents, I agree with the Court's holding and join the Court's opinion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I write to underscore the Court's additional holding that the alternative method of execution need not be authorized under current state law--a legal issue that had been uncertain before today's decision.  See Arthur v. Dunn, 580 U. S. ___, ___-___ (2017) (slip op., at 9-11) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  Importantly, all nine Justices today agree on that point.  Ante, at 19; post, at 14 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court notes, it follows from that additional holding that the burden of the alternative-method requirement \"can be overstated.\"  Ante, at 19.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, the Court states: \"[W]e see little likelihood that an inmate facing a serious risk of pain will be unable to identify an available alternative.\"  Ante, at 20.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In other words, an inmate who contends that a particular method of execution is very likely to cause him severe pain should ordinarily be able to plead some alternative method of execution that would significantly reduce the risk of severe pain.  At oral argument in this Court, the State suggested that the firing squad would be such an available alternative, if adequately pleaded.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 63-64 (\"He can plead firing squad. . . . Of course, if he had .\u00a0.\u00a0. pleaded firing squad, it's possible that Missouri could have executed him by firing squad\").  Justice Sotomayor has likewise explained that the firing squad is an alternative method of execution that generally causes an immediate and certain death, with close to zero risk of a botched execution.  See Arthur, 580 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 17-18).  I do not here prejudge the question whether the firing squad, or any other alternative method of execution, would be a feasible and readily implemented alternative for every State.  See McGehee v. Hutchinson, 854 F.\u00a03d 488, 493-494 (CA8 2017).  Rather, I simply emphasize the Court's statement that \"we see little likelihood that an inmate facing a serious risk of pain will be unable to identify an available alternative.\"  Ante, at 20.\n\nBreyer, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-8151\nRUSSELL BUCKLEW, PETITIONER v. ANNE L. PRECYTHE, DIRECTOR, MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit\n[April 1, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan join as to all but Part III, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's decision in this case raises three questions.  The first is primarily a factual question, namely, whether Bucklew has established genuine issues of material fact concerning whether executing him by lethal injection would cause him excessive suffering.  The second is primarily a legal question, namely, whether a prisoner like Bucklew with a rare medical condition must identify an alternative method by which the State may execute him.  And the third is a more general question, namely, how to minimize delays in executing offenders who have been condemned to death.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I disagree with the majority's answers to all three questions.  Bucklew cites evidence that executing him by lethal injection will cause the tumors that grow in his throat to rupture during his execution, causing him to sputter, choke, and suffocate on his own blood for up to several minutes before he dies.  That evidence establishes at this stage of the proceedings that executing Bucklew by lethal injection risks subjecting him to constitutionally impermissible suffering.  The majority holds that the State may execute him anyway.  In my view, that holding violates the clear command of the Eighth Amendment.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I begin with a factual question: whether Bucklew has established that, because of his rare medical condition, the State's current method of execution risks subjecting him to excessive suffering.  See Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 13) (requiring \"a demonstrated risk of severe pain\"); see also Baze v. Rees, 553 U.\u00a0S.  35, 50 (2008) (plurality opinion) (requiring \"a substantial risk of serious harm\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is no dispute as to the applicable summary judgment standard.  Because the State moved for summary judgment, it can prevail if, but only if, it \"shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact.\"  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.\u00a0S. 242, 248 (1986).  On review, we examine the record as a whole, which includes \"depositions, documents, [and] affidavits or declarations.\"  Rule 56(c).  And we must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to Bucklew and draw every justifiable inference in his favor.  See Tolan v. Cotton, 572 U.\u00a0S. 650, 651 (2014) (per curiam).\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bucklew has easily established a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether an execution by lethal injection would subject him to impermissible suffering.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The record indicates that Bucklew suffers from a congenital condition known as cavernous hemangioma that causes tumors filled with blood vessels to grow throughout his body, including in his head, face, neck, and oral cavity.  The condition is rare.  One study estimates that hemangiomas in the oral cavity occur in less than one percent of the population, and that hemangiomas like Bucklew's have been identified in five cases.  See Wang, Chen, Mojica, & Chen, Cavernous Hemangioma of the Uvula, 8 N. Am. J. Med. & Sci. 56, 56-59 (2015).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tumors grow out of Bucklew's lip and over his mouth, as well as on his hard and soft palates.  One tumor also grows directly on Bucklew's uvula, which has become \"grossly enlarged\" as a result.  App. 225.  (The uvula is the \"pendent fleshy lobe\" that hangs from the back of the throat.  Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1379 (11th ed. 2003).)  Bucklew's tumors obstruct his airway and make it difficult for him to breathe.  His difficulty breathing is chronic, but is particularly acute when he lies flat and gravity pulls his engorged uvula into his airway.  He often has to adjust the positioning of his head to prevent his uvula from obstructing his breathing.  He sleeps at a 45-degree angle to facilitate breathing, and he often wakes up in the middle of the night gasping for air.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Due to the sensitivity of his tumors, even minimal contact may cause them to hemorrhage.  He has described past hemorrhages as \"\u00a0'squirting'\u00a0\" or \"leaking\" blood, and he states that the first thing he does each morning is to wipe the blood off his face that leaked from his nose and mouth as he slept.  Bucklew's condition is progressive and, due to the risk of significant blood loss caused by the sensitivity of his tumors, cannot be treated by surgery.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bucklew maintains that, as a result of this medical condition, executing him by lethal injection would prove excruciatingly painful.  In support of this claim, Bucklew submitted sworn declarations and deposition testimony from an expert witness, Dr. Joel Zivot, an anesthesiologist.  Dr. Zivot provided extensive testimony regarding the pain that Bucklew would likely endure in an execution by lethal injection:\nDr. Zivot testified that in light of \"the degree to which Mr. Bucklew's airway is compromised by the hemangiomas\" and \"the particular psychological and physical effects of lethal injection, it is highly likely that Mr. Bucklew would be unable to maintain the integrity of his airway during the time after receiving the lethal injection and before death.\"  App. 221.\nDr. Zivot explained that, as a result of \"the highly friable and fragile state of the tissue of Mr. Bucklew's mouth and airway,\" Bucklew \"will likely experience hemorrhaging and\/or the possible rupture of the tumor\" on his uvula during his execution.  Id., at 222.\nDr. Zivot added that the \"hemorrhaging will further impede Mr. Bucklew's airway by filling his mouth and airway with blood, causing him to choke and cough on his own blood.\"  Ibid. \nDr. Zivot concluded that \"it is highly likely that Mr. Bucklew, given his specific congenital medical condition, cannot undergo lethal injection without experiencing the excruciating pain and suffering\" of \"suffocation, convulsions, and visible hemorrhaging.\"  Id., at 223.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Zivot also testified about the duration of pain to which an execution by lethal injection would subject Bucklew, describing it as \"prolonged.\"  Id., at 234.\nDr. Zivot stated that the effects of a pentobarbital injection \"are highly unlikely to be instantaneous and the period of time between receiving the injection and death could range over a few minutes to many minutes.\"  Id., at 222 (emphasis added).\nDr. Zivot \"strongly disagree[d] with [the State's expert's] repeated claim that the pentobarbital injection would result in 'rapid unconsciousness.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 233.\nDr. Zivot explained that Bucklew \"would likely experience unconsciousness that sets in progressively as the chemical circulates through his system\" and that it was during this period that Bucklew was \"likely to experience prolonged feelings of suffocation and excruciating pain.\"  Id., at 233-234.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State asked the District Court to grant summary judgment in its favor on the theory that Bucklew failed to identify a genuine factual issue regarding whether an execution by lethal injection would be impermissibly painful.  The District Court refused.  The court believed that Bucklew had adequately shown that for up to several minutes he \"could be aware that he is choking or unable to breathe but be unable to 'adjust' his breathing to remedy the situation.\"  Id., at 827.  Recognizing that the State's evidence suggested that Bucklew would experience this choking sensation for a shorter period, the District Court concluded that the dispute between the experts was \"a factual dispute that the Court cannot resolve on summary judgment, and would have to be resolved at trial.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court was right.  The evidence, taken in the light most favorable to Bucklew, creates a genuine factual issue as to whether Missouri's lethal injection protocol would subject him to several minutes of \"severe pain and suffering,\" Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13), during which he would choke and suffocate on his own blood.  In my view, executing Bucklew by forcing him to choke on his grossly enlarged uvula and suffocate on his blood would exceed \"the limits of civilized standards.\"  Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.\u00a0S. 407, 435 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.\u00a0S.  86, 100-101 (1958) (plurality opinion).  The experts dispute whether Bucklew's execution will prove as unusually painful as he claims, but resolution of that dispute is a matter for trial.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority, while characterizing the matter as \"critical,\" says that there is \"nothing in the record to suggest that Mr. Bucklew will be capable of experiencing pain for significantly more than 20 to 30 seconds after being injected with pentobarbital.\"  Ante, at 26.  But what about Dr. Zivot's testimony that the time between injection and death \"could range over a few minutes to many minutes\"?  App. 222.  What about Dr. Zivot's characterization of the pain involved as \"prolonged\"?  Id., at 234.  What about Dr. Zivot's \"stron[g] disagree[ment] with [the State's expert's] repeated claim that the pentobarbital injection would result in 'rapid unconsciousness'\u00a0\"?  Id., at 233.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority construes Dr. Zivot's testimony to show only that Bucklew might remain alive for several minutes after the injection, not that he will be capable of feeling pain for several minutes after the injection.  Ante, at 27.  But immediately following his prediction that the time between injection and death could range up to many minutes, Dr. Zivot stated that \"beginning with the injection of the Pentobarbital solution and ending with Mr. Bucklew's death several minutes to as long as many minutes later, Mr. Bucklew would be highly likely to experience feelings of 'air hunger' and the excruciating pain of prolonged suffocation.\"  App. 222 (emphasis added).  Dr. Zivot thus testified both that lethal injection would take up to several minutes to kill Bucklew and that Bucklew would experience excruciating pain during this period.  And it is not the case, as the majority believes, that Dr. Zivot \"carefully avoided claiming that Mr. Bucklew would be capable of feeling pain until he died,\" ante, at 28, particularly given that the record must be construed in the light most favorable to Bucklew.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority also justifies its refusal to credit Dr. Zivot's testimony on the ground that Dr. Zivot gave a response during his deposition suggesting that he misinterpreted a study of euthanasia in horses.  Ante, at 26-27.  Bucklew's expert, however, did not rely exclusively or even heavily upon that study; he mentioned it only in response to a question posed in his deposition.  To the contrary, Dr. Zivot explained that his testimony regarding the pain to which Bucklew would be subjected was \"supported both by [his] own professional knowledge of how chemicals of this type are likely to exert their effects in the body as well as by the terms of Missouri's Execution Procedure.\"  App. 222.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whether any mistake about the importance of a single study makes all the difference to Bucklew's case is a matter not for this Court to decide at summary judgment, but for the factfinder to resolve at trial.  As Judge Colloton pointed out in dissent below, attacks on the \"reliability and credibility of Dr. Zivot's opinion,\" including \"his possible misreading of the horse study on which he partially relied,\" give rise to factual disputes.  See 883 F.\u00a03d 1087, 1099 (CA8 2018).  Judge Colloton therefore concluded that \"[t]he district court did not err in concluding that it could not resolve the dispute between the experts on summary judgment.\"  Ibid.  I agree.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case next presents a legal question.  The Court in Glossip held in the context of a facial challenge to a State's execution protocol that the plaintiffs were required not only to establish that the execution method gave rise to a \"demonstrated risk of severe pain,\" but also to identify a \"known and available\" alternative method.  576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  The Court added that the alternative must be \"feasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduc[e] a substantial risk of severe pain.\"  Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 12-13) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I joined the dissent in Glossip, but for present purposes I accept the Glossip majority opinion as governing.  I nonetheless do not believe its \"alternative method\" requirement applies in this case.  We \"often read general language in judicial opinion[s] as referring in context to circumstances similar to the circumstances then before the Court and not referring to quite different circumstances that the Court was not then considering.\"  Illinois v. Lidster, 540 U.\u00a0S.  419, 424 (2004).  And while I acknowledge that the Court in Glossip spoke in unqualified terms, the circumstances in Glossip were indeed \"different\" in relevant respects from the circumstances presented here.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plaintiffs in Glossip undertook an across-the-board attack against the use of a particular execution method, which they maintained violated the Eighth Amendment categorically.  In this case, by contrast, Bucklew does not attack Missouri's lethal injection protocol categorically, or even in respect to any execution other than his own.  Instead, he maintains that he is special; that he suffers from a nearly unique illness; and that, by virtue of that illness, Missouri's execution method will be excruciatingly painful for him even though it would not affect others in the same way.  These differences make a difference.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, these differences show that the reasons that underlie Glossip's \"alternative method\" requirement do not apply here.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Glossip Court stressed the importance of preventing method-of-execution challenges from becoming a backdoor means to abolish capital punishment in general.  The Court wrote that \"because it is settled that capital punishment is constitutional, it necessarily follows that there must be a constitutional means of carrying it out.\"  Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (alterations omitted).  The Court added that \"we have time and again reaffirmed that capital punishment is not per se unconstitutional.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 16).  And the Court feared that allowing prisoners to invalidate a State's method of execution without identifying an alternative would \"effectively overrule these decisions.\"  Ibid.  But there is no such risk here.  Holding Missouri's lethal injection protocol unconstitutional as applied to Bucklew--who has a condition that has been identified in only five people, see supra, at 2-3--would not risk invalidating the death penalty in Missouri.  And, because the State would remain free to execute prisoners by other permissible means, declining to extend Glossip's \"alternative method\" requirement in this context would be unlikely to exempt Bucklew or any other prisoner from the death penalty.  Even in the unlikely event that the State could not identify a permissible alternative in a particular case, it would be perverse to treat that as a reason to execute a prisoner by the method he has shown to involve excessive suffering.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Glossip Court, in adopting the \"alternative method\" requirement, relied on The Chief Justice's plurality opinion in Baze, which discussed the need to avoid \"intrud[ing] on the role of state legislatures in implementing their execution procedures.\"  553 U.\u00a0S., at 51; see also ante, at 13 (we owe \"a measure of deference to a State's choice of execution procedures\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  But no such intrusion problem exists in a case like this one.  When adopting a method of execution, a state legislature will rarely consider the method's application to an individual who, like Bucklew, suffers from a rare disease.  It is impossible to believe that Missouri's legislature, when adopting lethal injection, considered the possibility that it would cause prisoners to choke on their own blood for up to several minutes before they die.  Exempting a prisoner from the State's chosen method of execution in these circumstances does not interfere with any legislative judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court in Glossip may have also believed that the identification of a permissible alternative method of execution would provide a reference point to assist in determining how much pain in an execution is too much pain.  See 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 12-13); Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 47, 51 (plurality opinion); see also ante, at 15 (arguing that determining the constitutionality of a method of execution \"is a necessarily comparative exercise\").  But there is no need for any such reference point in a case like this.  Bucklew accepts the constitutionality of Missouri's chosen execution method as to prisoners who do not share his medical condition.  See Brief for Petitioner 36.  We are informed that this method has been used in 20 executions, apparently without subjecting prisoners to undue pain.  See Brief for Respondents 5.  To the extent that any comparator is needed, those executions provide a readymade, built-in comparator against which a court can measure the degree of excessive pain Bucklew will suffer.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, precedent counsels against extending Glossip.  Neither this Court's oldest method-of-execution case, Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.\u00a0S. 130 (1879), nor any subsequent decision of this Court until Glossip, held that prisoners who challenge a State's method of execution must identify an alternative means by which the State may execute them.\u00a0 To the contrary, in Hill v. McDonough, 547 U.\u00a0S.  573 (2006), the Court squarely and unanimously rejected the argument that a prisoner must \"identif[y] an alternative, authorized method of execution.\"  Id., at 582.  The Court noted that any such requirement would \"change the traditional pleading requirements for \u00a71983 actions,\" which we were not at liberty to do.  Ibid.  It is thus difficult to see how the \"alternative-method\" requirement could be \"compelled by our understanding of the Constitution,\" ante, at 17, even though the Constitution itself never hints at such a requirement, even though we did not apply such a requirement in more than a century of method-of-execution cases, and even though we unanimously rejected such a requirement in Hill.  And while the Court in Glossip did not understand itself to be bound by Hill, see Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15) (distinguishing Hill on the theory that Hill merely rejected a heightened pleading requirement for \u00a71983 suits), the two decisions remain in considerable tension.  Confining Glossip's \"alternative method\" requirement to facial challenges would help to reconcile them.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, the troubling implications of today's ruling provide the best reason for declining to extend Glossip's \"alternative method\" requirement.  The majority acknowledges that the Eighth Amendment prohibits States from executing prisoners by \"\u00a0'horrid modes of torture'\u00a0\" such as burning at the stake.  Ante, at 10.  But the majority's decision permits a State to execute a prisoner who suffers from a medical condition that would render his execution no less painful.  Bucklew has provided evidence of a serious risk that his execution will be excruciating and grotesque.  The majority holds that the State may execute him anyway.  That decision confirms the warning leveled by the Glossip dissent--that the Court has converted the Eighth Amendment's \"categorical prohibition into a conditional one.\"  576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (opinion of Sotomayor, J.) (slip op., at 24). \nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even assuming for argument's sake that Bucklew must bear the burden of showing the existence of a \"known and available\" alternative method of execution that \"significantly reduces a substantial risk of severe pain,\" id., at ___ (majority opinion) (slip op., at 13) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted), Bucklew has satisfied that burden.  The record contains more than enough evidence on the point to raise genuine and material factual issues that preclude summary judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bucklew identified as an alternative method of execution the use of nitrogen hypoxia, which is a form of execution by lethal gas.  Missouri law permits the use of this method of execution.  See Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7546.720 (2002).  Three other States--Alabama, Mississippi, and Okla-homa--have specifically authorized nitrogen hypoxia as a method of execution.  See ante, at 22, n.\u00a01.  And Bucklew introduced into the record reports from Oklahoma and Louisiana indicating that nitrogen hypoxia would be simple and painless.  These reports summarized the scientific literature as indicating that there is \"no reported physical discom[fort] associated with inhaling pure nitrogen,\" App. 742, that the \"onset of hypoxia is typically so subtle that it is unnoticeable to the subject,\" id., at 745, and that nitrogen hypoxia would take an estimated \"seventeen-to-twenty seconds\" to render a subject unconscious, id., at 746-747.  The Oklahoma study concluded that nitrogen hypoxia is \"the most humane method\" of execution available.  Id., at 736.  And the Louisiana study stated that the \"[u]se of nitrogen as a method of execution can assure a quick and painless death of the offender.\"  Id., at 746.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How then can the majority conclude that Bucklew has failed to identify an alternative method of execution?  The majority finds Bucklew's evidence inadequate in part because, in the majority's view, it does not show that nitrogen hypoxia will \"significantly reduce\" Bucklew's risk of pain as compared with lethal injection.  Ante, at 23. But the majority does not dispute the evidence suggesting that nitrogen hypoxia would be \"quick and painless\" and would take effect in 20 to 30 seconds.  The majority instead believes that \"nothing in the record\" suggests that lethal injection would take longer than nitrogen gas to take effect.  Ante, at 26.  As I have already explained, the majority reaches this conclusion by overlooking considerable evidence to the contrary--such as Dr. Zivot's testimony that Bucklew's pain would likely prove \"prolonged,\" App. 234, that lethal injection would not \"result in 'rapid unconsciousness,'\u00a0\" id., at 233, and that from the time of injection to \"Mr. Bucklew's death several minutes to as long as many minutes later, Mr. Bucklew would be highly likely to experience .\u00a0.\u00a0. the excruciating pain of prolonged suffocation,\" id., at 222.  In discounting this evidence, the majority simply fails \"to adhere to the axiom that in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.\"  Tolan, 572 U.\u00a0S., at 651 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority additionally believes that Bucklew's evidence fails to show that nitrogen hypoxia would be easy to implement.  Ante, at 21.  But the reports from Oklahoma and Louisiana tell a different story.  The Louisiana report states that nitrogen hypoxia would be \"simple to administer.\"  App. 737.  The Oklahoma report similarly concludes that \"[d]eath sentences carried out by nitrogen inhalation would be simple to administer.\"  Id., at 746; see also id., at 696.  The reports explain that nitrogen hypoxia would \"not require the use of a complex medical procedure or pharmaceutical products,\" id., at 747, would \"not require the assistance of licensed medical professionals,\" id., 736, and would require only materials that are \"readily available for purchase,\" id., at 739.  Further, \"[b]ecause the protocol involved in nitrogen induced hypoxia is so simple, mistakes are unlikely to occur.\"  Id., at 748.  And both studies recommend the development of protocols for actual implementation.  See id., at 697 (Oklahoma report recommending development of \"a nitrogen hypoxia protocol\"); id., at 736 (Louisiana report noting that although \"the exact protocol\" has not been finalized, the report recommends \"that hypoxia induced by the inhalation of nitrogen be considered for adoption\"); see also Murphy, Oklahoma Says It Plans To Use Nitrogen for Executions, USA Today, Mar. 15, 2018 (quoting the Oklahoma attorney general's statement that nitrogen \"will be effective, simple to administer, easy to obtain and requires no complex medical procedures\"); but cf. ante, at 21.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presented with evidence such as Bucklew's, I believe a State should take at least minimal steps to determine the feasibility of the proposed alternative.  The responsible state official in this case, however, acknowledged that he \"did not conduct research concerning the feasibility of lethal gas as a method of execution in Missouri.\"  Id., at 713; see also Record in No. 14-800 (WD Mo.), Doc. 182-6, p.\u00a016 (different official acknowledging that, \"to be candid, no, I did not go out and try to find answers to those questions\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority sensibly recognizes that an inmate seeking to identify an alternative method of execution \"is not limited to choosing among those presently authorized by a particular State's law.\"  Ante, at 19.  But the majority faults Bucklew for failing to provide guidance about the administration of nitrogen hypoxia down to the last detail.  The majority believes that Bucklew failed to present evidence \"on essential questions\" such as whether the nitrogen should be administered \"using a gas chamber, a tent, a hood, [or] a mask\"; or \"in what concentration (pure nitrogen or some mixture of gases)\" it should be administered; or even how the State might \"protec[t the execution team] against the risk of gas leaks.\"  Ante, at 21.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps Bucklew did not provide these details.  But Glossip did not refer to any of these requirements; today's majority invents them.  And to insist upon them is to create what, in a case like this one, would amount to an insurmountable hurdle for prisoners like Bucklew.  That hurdle, I fear, could permit States to execute even those who will endure the most serious pain and suffering, irrespective of how exceptional their case and irrespective of how thoroughly they prove it.  I cannot reconcile the majority's decision with a constitutional Amendment that forbids all \"cruel and unusual punishments.\"  Amdt. 8.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas concurs in the majority's imposition of an \"alternative method\" requirement, but would also permit Bucklew's execution on the theory that a method of execution violates the Eighth Amendment \"\u00a0'only if it is deliberately designed to inflict pain.'\u00a0\"  Ante, at 1 (concurring opinion) (quoting Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 94 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment)).  But that is not the proper standard.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For one thing, Justice Thomas' view would make the constitutionality of a particular execution turn on the intent of the person inflicting it.  But it is not correct that concededly torturous methods of execution such as burning alive are impermissible when imposed to inflict pain but not when imposed for a subjectively different purpose.  To the prisoner who faces the prospect of a torturous execution, the intent of the person inflicting the punishment makes no difference.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For another thing, we have repeatedly held that the Eighth Amendment is not a static prohibition that proscribes the same things that it proscribed in the 18th century.  Rather, it forbids punishments that would be considered cruel and unusual today.  The Amendment prohibits \"unnecessary suffering\" in the infliction of punishment, which this Court has understood to prohibit punishments that are \"grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime\" as well as punishments that do not serve any \"penological purpose.\"  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.\u00a0S. 97, 103, and n. 7 (1976).  The Constitution prohibits gruesome punishments even though they may have been common at the time of the founding.  Few would dispute, for example, the unconstitutionality of \"a new law providing public lashing, or branding of the right hand, as punishment .\u00a0.\u00a0. [e]ven if it could be demonstrated unequivocally that these were not cruel and unusual measures in 1791.\"  Scalia, Originalism: The Lesser Evil, 57 U. Cin. L. Rev. 849, 861 (1989).  The question is not, as Justice Thomas maintains, whether a punishment is deliberately inflicted to cause unnecessary pain, but rather whether we would today consider the punishment to cause excessive suffering.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Implicitly at the beginning of its opinion and explicitly at the end, the majority invokes the long delays that now typically occur between the time an offender is sentenced to death and his execution.  Bucklew was arrested for the crime that led to his death sentence more than 20 years ago.  And Bucklew's case is not an anomaly.  The average time between sentencing and execution approaches 18 years and in some instances rises to more than 40 years.  See Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Breyer, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 18); Reynolds v. Florida, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (Breyer, J., statement respecting denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I agree with the majority that these delays are excessive.  Undue delays in death penalty cases frustrate the interests of the State and of surviving victims, who have \"an important interest\" in seeing justice done quickly.  Hill, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 584.  Delays also exacerbate the suffering that accompanies an execution itself.  Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (Breyer, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 19-23).  Delays can \"aggravate the cruelty of capital punishment\" by subjecting the offender to years in solitary confinement, and delays also \"undermine [capital punishment's] jurisprudential rationale\" by reducing its deterrent effect and retributive value.  Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 28, 32).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority responds to these delays by curtailing the constitutional guarantees afforded to prisoners like Bucklew who have been sentenced to death.  By adopting elaborate new rules regarding the need to show an alternative method of execution, the majority places unwarranted obstacles in the path of prisoners who assert that an execution would subject them to cruel and unusual punishment.  These obstacles in turn give rise to an unacceptable risk that Bucklew, or others in yet more difficult circumstances, may be executed in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  Given the rarity with which cases like this one will arise, an unfortunate irony of today's decision is that the majority's new rules are not even likely to improve the problems of delay at which they are directed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In support of the need to end delays in capital cases, the majority refers to Dunn v. Ray, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019).  In that case, the Court vacated a stay of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought his claim too late.  The prisoner in that case, however, brought his claim only five days after he was notified of the policy he sought to challenge.  See id., at ___ (Kagan, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3).  And in the view of some of us, the prisoner's claim--that prisoners of some faiths were entitled to have a minister present at their executions while prisoners of other faiths were not--raised a serious constitutional question.  See id., at  ___ (slip op., at 2) (characterizing the Court's decision as \"profoundly wrong\").  And therein lies the problem.  It might be possible to end delays by limiting constitutional protections for prisoners on death row.  But to do so would require us to pay too high a constitutional price.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today's majority appears to believe that because \"[t]he Constitution allows capital punishment,\" ante, at 8, the Constitution must allow capital punishment to occur quickly.  In reaching that conclusion the majority echoes an argument expressed by the Court in Glossip, namely, that \"because it is settled that capital punishment is constitutional, it necessarily follows that there must be a constitutional means of carrying it out.\"  576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (emphasis added; alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These conclusions do not follow.  It may be that there is no way to execute a prisoner quickly while affording him the protections that our Constitution guarantees to those who have been singled out for our law's most severe sanction.  And it may be that, as our Nation comes to place ever greater importance upon ensuring that we accurately identify, through procedurally fair methods, those who may lawfully be put to death, there simply is no constitutional way to implement the death penalty.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have elsewhere written about these problems.  See id., at ___-___ (Breyer, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 29-33).  And I simply conclude here that the law entitles Bucklew to an opportunity to prove his claim at trial.  I note, however, that this case adds to the mounting evidence that we can either have a death penalty that avoids excessive delays and \"arguably serves legitimate penological purposes,\" or we can have a death penalty that \"seeks reliability and fairness in the death penalty's application\" and avoids the infliction of cruel and unusual punishments.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 32).  It may well be that we \"cannot have both.\"  Ibid.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent.\n\nSotomayor, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-8151\nRUSSELL BUCKLEW, PETITIONER v. ANNE L. PRECYTHE, DIRECTOR, MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit\n[April 1, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I have maintained ever since the Court started down this wayward path in Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015), there is no sound basis in the Constitution for requiring condemned inmates to identify an available means for their own executions.  Justice Breyer ably explains why today's extension of Glossip's alternative-method requirement is misguided (even on that precedent's own terms), and why (with or without that requirement) a trial is needed to determine whether Missouri's planned means of executing Russell Bucklew creates an intolerable risk of suffering in light of his rare medical condition.  I join Justice Breyer's dissent, except for Part IV.  I write separately to address the troubling dicta with which the Court concludes its opinion.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the majority's ominous words about late-arising death penalty litigation, ante, at 29-30, one might assume there is some legal question before us concerning delay.  Make no mistake: There is not.  The majority's commentary on once and future stay applications is not only inessential but also wholly irrelevant to its resolution of any issue before us.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority seems to imply that this litigation has been no more than manipulation of the judicial process for the purpose of delaying Bucklew's execution.  Ante, at 29.  When Bucklew commenced this case, however, there was nothing \"settled,\" ibid., about whether the interaction of Missouri's lethal-injection protocol and his rare medical condition would be tolerable under the Eighth Amendment.  At that time, Glossip had not yet been decided, much less extended to any as-applied challenge like Bucklew's.  In granting prior stay requests in this case, we acted as necessary to ensure sufficient time for sober review of Bucklew's claims.  The majority laments those decisions, but there is nothing unusual--and certainly nothing untoward--about parties pressing, and courts giving full consideration to, potentially meritorious constitutional claims, even when those claims do not ultimately succeed.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I am especially troubled by the majority's statement that \"[l]ast-minute stays should be the extreme exception,\" which could be read to intimate that late-occurring stay requests from capital prisoners should be reviewed with an especially jaundiced eye.  See ante, at 30.  Were those comments to be mistaken for a new governing standard, they would effect a radical reinvention of established law and the judicial role.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Courts' equitable discretion in handling stay requests is governed by well-established principles.  See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.\u00a0S. 418, 434 (2009).  Courts examine the stay applicant's likelihood of success on the merits, whether the applicant will suffer irreparable injury without a stay, whether other parties will suffer substantial injury from a stay, and public interest considerations.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is equally well established that \"[d]eath is a punish-ment different from all other sanctions in kind rather than degree.\"  Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.\u00a0S. 280, 303-304 (1976).  For that reason, the equities in a death penalty case will almost always favor the prisoner so long as he or she can show a reasonable probability of success on the merits.  See Nken, 556 U.\u00a0S., at 434 (noting that success on the merits and irreparable injury \"are the most critical\" factors); cf. Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (observing, in a preliminary-injunction posture, that \"[t]he parties agree that this case turns on whether petitioners are able to establish a likelihood of success on the merits\" and analyzing the case accordingly); accord, id., at ___ (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 22).  This accords with each court's \"\u00a0'duty to search for constitutional error with painstaking care'\u00a0\" in capital cases.  Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.\u00a0S. 419, 422 (1995).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is of course true that a court may deny relief when a party has \"unnecessarily\" delayed seeking it, Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.\u00a0S. 637, 649-650 (2004), and that courts should not grant equitable relief on clearly \"\u00a0'dilatory,'\u00a0\" \"\u00a0'speculative,'\u00a0\" or meritless grounds, ante, at 31 (quoting Hill v. McDonough, 547 U.\u00a0S. 573, 584-585 (2006)); see also Gomez v. United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 503 U.\u00a0S. 653, 654 (1992) (per curiam) (vacating a stay where an inmate's unjustified 10-year delay in bringing a claim was an \"obvious attempt at manipulation\").  That is hardly the same thing as treating late-arising claims as presumptively suspect.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The principles of federalism and finality that the majority invokes are already amply served by other constraints on our review of state judgments--most notably the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, but also statutes of limitations and other standard filters for dilatory claims.  We should not impose further constraints on judicial discretion in this area based on little more than our own policy impulses.  Finality and federalism need no extra thumb on the scale from this Court, least of all with a human life at stake.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The only sound approach is for courts to continue to afford each request for equitable relief a careful hearing on its own merits.  That responsibility is never graver than when the litigation concerns an impending execution.  See, e.g., Kyles, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 422; Woodson, 428 U.\u00a0S., at 303-304.  Meritorious claims can and do come to light even at the eleventh hour, and the cost of cursory review in such cases would be unacceptably high.  See Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (Breyer, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 21-22) (collecting examples of inmates who came \"within hours or days of execution before later being exonerated\").  A delay, moreover, may be entirely beyond a prisoner's control.  Execution methods, for example, have been moving targets subject to considerable secrecy in recent years, which means that constitutional concerns may surface only once a State settles on a procedure and communicates its choice to the prisoner.2  In other contexts, too, fortuity or the imminence of an execution may shake loose constitutionally significant information when time is short.3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are higher values than ensuring that executions run on time.  If a death sentence or the manner in which it is carried out violates the Constitution, that stain can never come out.  Our jurisprudence must remain one of vigilance and care, not one of dismissiveness.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0While this case has been pending, a few States have authorized nitrogen hypoxia as a method of execution.  See 2018 Ala. Acts no. 2018-353 (allowing condemned inmates to elect execution by nitrogen hypoxia); 2017 Miss. Laws ch. 406, p. 905 (authorizing execution by nitrogen hypoxia only if lethal injection is held unconstitutional or is otherwise unavailable); 2015 Okla. Sess. Laws ch. 75, p. 244 (same).  In March 2018, officials in Oklahoma announced that, due to the unavailability of lethal injection drugs, the State would use nitrogen gas for its executions going forward.  See Williams, Oklahoma Proposes To Use Nitrogen Gas for Executions by Asphyxiation, N. Y. Times, Mar. 15, 2018, p. A22.  But Oklahoma has so far been unable to find a manufacturer willing to sell it a gas delivery device for use in executions.  See Clay, State Not Ready for Executions, The Oklahoman, Jan. 27, 2019, p. A1.  To date, no one in this case has pointed us to an execution in this country using nitrogen gas.\nFootnote 2\u00a0While the district court allowed discovery on many other matters, Mr. Bucklew protests that it did not permit him to learn the identities of the lethal injection execution team members, to depose them, or to inquire into their qualifications, training, and experience.  Like the Eighth Circuit, we see no abuse of discretion in the district court's discovery rulings.  As the district court explained, Mr. Bucklew argues that there is no way he may be constitutionally executed by lethal injection, even with modifications to the State's lethal injection protocol.  And in a case like that, discovery into such granular matters as who administers the protocol simply is not relevant.\nFootnote 3\u00a0Here's the full quotation, with the portion quoted by the dissent underlined:\n\"As a result of his inability to maintain the integrity of his airway for the period of time beginning with the injection of the Pentobarbital solution and ending with Mr. Bucklew's death several minutes to as long as many minutes later, Mr. Bucklew would be highly likely to experience feelings of 'air hunger' and the excruciating pain of prolonged suffocation resulting from the complete obstruction of his airway by the large vascular tumor.\"  App. 222.\n\nFootnote 4\u00a0The State contends that Mr. Bucklew's claim should fail for yet another reason: because, in the State's view, the evidence does not show that he is very likely to suffer \"\u00a0'severe pain'\u00a0\" cognizable under the Eighth Amendment.  Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 13) (quoting Baze v. Rees, 553 U.\u00a0S. 35, 52 (2008); emphasis added).  We have no need, however, to address that argument because (as explained above) Mr. Bucklew fails even to show that a feasible and readily available alternative could significantly reduce the pain he alleges.\nFootnote 5\u00a0Seeking to relitigate Dunn v. Ray, the principal dissent asserts that that case involved no undue delay because the inmate \"brought his claim only five days after he was notified\" that the State would not allow his spiritual adviser to be present with him in the execution chamber itself, although it would allow the adviser to be present on the other side of a glass partition.  Post, at 17.  But a state statute listed \"[t]he spiritual adviser of the condemned\" as one of numerous individuals who would be allowed to \"be present at an execution,\" many of whom--such as \"newspaper reporters,\" \"relatives or friends of the condemned person,\" and \"the victim's immediate family members\"--obviously would not be allowed into the chamber itself.  Ala. Code \u00a715-18-83 (2018).  The inmate thus had long been on notice that there was a question whether his adviser would be allowed into the chamber or required to remain on the other side of the glass.  Yet although he had been on death row since 1999, and the State had set a date for his execution on November 6, 2018, he waited until January 23, 2019--just 15 days before the execution--to ask for clarification.  He then brought a claim 10 days before the execution and sought an indefinite stay.  This delay implicated the \"strong equitable presumption\" that no stay should be granted \"where a claim could have been brought at such a time as to allow consideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay.\"  Hill v. McDonough, 547 U.\u00a0S. 573, 584 (2006).\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0A skewed view of the facts caused the majority to misapply these principles and misuse its \"equitable powers,\" see ante, at 30, and n.\u00a05, in vacating the Court of Appeals' unanimous stay in Dunn v. Ray, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019).  Even today's belated explanation from the majority rests on the mistaken premise that Domineque Ray could have figured out sooner that Alabama planned to deny his imam access to the execution chamber.  But see id., at ___ (Kagan, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3) (noting that the governing statute authorized both the inmate's imam and the prison's Christian chaplain to attend the execution, and that \"the prison refused to give Ray a copy of its own practices and procedures\" that would have clarified the two clergymen's degrees of access); Ray v.

I write separately to set the record straight regarding the Court's earlier orders vacating the stays of execution entered by the District Court and the Court of Appeals in this case.  See Dunn v. Price, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019).  In a late-night dissenting opinion accompanying one of those orders, Justice Breyer asserted that petitioner's death sentence was being \"carried out in an arbitrary way\" and that Members of this Court deviated from \"basic principles of fairness.\"  Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 1, 7).  There is nothing of substance to these assertions.  An accurate recounting of the circumstances leading to the now-delayed execution makes clear that petitioner's execution was set to proceed in a procedurally unremarkable and constitutionally acceptable manner.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent omitted any discussion of the murder that warranted petitioner's sentence of death and the extensive procedural protections afforded to him before his last-minute, dilatory filings.  I therefore begin by more fully recounting the \"circumstances as they [were] presented to our Court.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the evening of Sunday, December 22, 1991, Bill Lynn, a minister, and his wife Bessie returned home after church.  Price v. State, 725 So.\u00a02d 1003, 1011 (Ala. Crim. App. 1997).  Bill began assembling Christmas toys for his grandchildren while Bessie prepared for bed.  Ibid.  After the electricity appeared to fail, Bill went outside to check the power box.  Ibid.  He was then brutally attacked with a sword and a knife by petitioner and his accomplice.  Id., at 1011, 1015.  According to the trial court, Bill suffered a total of 38 \"cuts, lacerations, and stab wounds.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert., O.T. 2018, No. 18-8766, p.\u00a0230a (18-8766 App.).  \"One of his arms was almost severed,\" and \"[h]is scalp was detached from [his] skull.\"  Ibid.  Bessie tried to call the police, but the phone lines were cut.  Price, 725 So.\u00a02d, at 1011.  When she tried to escape and go get help, petitioner and his accomplice ordered her out of the van and attacked her, too.  Ibid.  They also stole checks, cash, and firearms, and even demanded Bessie hand over her wedding bands.  Id., at 1011-1012.  Bill \"died a slow, lingering and painful death.\"  18-8766 App., at 230a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner later confessed, and an Alabama jury convicted him of capital murder and first-degree robbery.  Price, 725 So.\u00a02d, at 1011-1012.  The jury recommended death, which the trial court imposed after finding that the killing was committed during the course of a robbery and that it was particularly heinous, atrocious, or cruel.  Id., at 1011, 1034-1035.  Petitioner's conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal and his conviction became final in 1999.  See Price, 725 So.\u00a02d 1003, aff'd, Ex parte Price, 725 So.\u00a02d 1063 (Ala. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.\u00a0S. 1133 (1999).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Twenty years later, after multiple unsuccessful attempts to obtain postconviction relief,* petitioner brought an action under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983 attacking the constitutionality of the State's lethal injection protocol.  Record in Price v. Dunn, No. 14-cv-472 (SD Ala.), Doc. 1 (Record 14-cv-472).  Following our decision in Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 13), which confirmed that prisoners challenging a State's method of execution must \"establish the existence of a known and available alternative method of execution that would entail a significantly less severe risk\" of pain, petitioner amended his complaint to propose an alternative compounded drug.  See Record 14-cv-472, Doc. 32, p.\u00a019-20.  The District Court entered judgment for the State, explaining that petitioner had failed to show that this alternative was readily available.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 38a-39a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While petitioner's appeal was pending before the Eleventh Circuit, Alabama enacted Act 2018-353, which approved nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative to lethal injection.  Death-row inmates whose convictions were final before June 1, 2018, had 30 days from that date to elect to be executed via nitrogen hypoxia.  Ala. Code \u00a715-18-82.1(b)(2) (2018).  As the Eleventh Circuit noted in affirming the District Court, petitioner did not do so.  Price v. Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections, 752 Fed. Appx. 701, 703, n.\u00a03 (2018).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Justice Breyer, the warden may not have given petitioner an election form until \"72 hours\" before the June 30 deadline.  Price, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  That \"possibil[ity],\" ibid., even if true, is irrelevant.  As an initial matter, petitioner (like all other individuals) is presumed to be aware of the law and thus the June 30 deadline.  Moreover, the Alabama statute neither required special notice to inmates nor mandated the use of a particular form.  It merely required that the election be \"personally made by the [inmate] in writing and delivered to the warden.\"  Ala. Code \u00a715-18-82.1(b)(2).  Cynthia Stewart, the warden at Holman Correctional Facility, went beyond what the statute required by affirmatively providing death-row inmates at Holman a written election form and an envelope in which they could return it to her.  18-8766 App., at 181a.  No fewer than 48 other inmates took advantage of this election.  Petitioner did not, even though he was represented throughout this time period by a well-heeled Boston law firm.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not until January 27, 2019--two weeks after the State sought to set an execution date and six months after petitioner declined to elect nitrogen hypoxia--that petitioner's counsel asked the warden, for the first time, that petitioner be executed through nitrogen hypoxia instead of lethal injection.  The warden explained that she was unable to accept the belated request under state law.  Petitioner's counsel then approached the State's counsel, who gave the same response.  On February 8, petitioner filed another \u00a71983 action challenging the constitutionality of Alabama's lethal injection protocol under the Eighth Amendment and proposing nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative.  See Bucklew v. Precythe, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 20) (requiring a prisoner bringing a \u00a71983 method of execution claim to \"identif[y] a feasible and readily implemented alternative method of execution the State refused to adopt without a legitimate reason, even though it would significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain\").  On March 1, the Alabama Supreme Court set petitioner's execution date for April 11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On April 5, the District Court denied petitioner's motion for a preliminary injunction to stay his execution pending resolution of his new \u00a71983 claim.  18-8766 App., at 54a.  The court found that nitrogen hypoxia could not be \"readily implemented\" because although Alabama had legally approved nitrogen hypoxia as a future method of execution, the State was still preparing its execution protocol.  Id., at 48a-49a.  It also found that the State had \"legitimate reason[s]\" for declining to use nitrogen hypoxia--namely, that petitioner failed to comply with the statutory deadline.  Id., at 49a-50a.  But the court stated that petitioner was likely to prevail on the question whether execution by nitrogen \"would provide a significant reduction in the substantial risk of severe pain\" as compared to execution by lethal injection.  Id., at 52a.  That same day, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration in which he proposed, for the first time, his own one-page \"execution protocol\" for nitrogen hypoxia.  Record in Price v. Dunn, No. 19-0057, Doc. 33, at 4, and n.\u00a02 (Record No. 19-0057).  The court denied the motion because petitioner \"still fail[ed] to show that [a nitrogen hypoxia execution protocol] may be readily implemented by the State and that the State does not have [a] legitimate reason for refusing his untimely request.\"  18-8766 App., at 28a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On April 10, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed on alternative grounds and denied petitioner's motion to stay his execution.  Price v. Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections, 920 F.\u00a03d 1317 (2019).  The court acknowledged that petitioner \"did not come forward with sufficient detail about how the State could implement nitrogen hypoxia to satisfy Bucklew's requirement where the inmate proposes a new method of execution.\"  Id., at 1328.  But it concluded that this failure was irrelevant because the State had officially adopted that method of execution.  Id., at 1328-1329.  Nonetheless, the court held that the District Court erred in concluding that petitioner had met his burden to show that his proposed alternative method would significantly reduce the risk of substantial pain.  Id., at 1329-1331.  In particular, the court held that the District Court had before it \"no reliable evidence\" from which to conclude that nitrogen would reduce petitioner's risk of pain in execution, as compared to the lethal injection protocol.  Id., at 1330.  It noted that in reaching the contrary conclusion, the District Court had relied on a preliminary draft report by East Central University marked \"Do Not Cite.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few hours before his scheduled execution on April 11, petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari and an accompanying application for a stay of his execution.  Price v. Dunn, O.T. 2018, No. 18-8766 (18A1044).  While that petition and application were pending here, and before any mandate issued from the Eleventh Circuit, petitioner filed yet another motion for a preliminary injunction in the District Court.  Record No. 19-0057, Doc. 45.  Petitioner attached several affidavits and a final version of the report by the East Central University.  The District Court granted a stay approximately two hours before the scheduled execution time of 6 p.m. central time, holding that, in light of the Eleventh Circuit's opinion and the new submissions, petitioner had now demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.  Id., Doc. 49, at 9-10, 13.  The State immediately filed in the Eleventh Circuit a motion to vacate on the ground that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the case, which was still at the Eleventh Circuit.  But the Eleventh Circuit entered its own stay \"in light of the jurisdictional questions raised by the parties' motions.\"  2019 WL1591475, *1 (Apr. 11, 2019).  The State then promptly filed an application to vacate the stays in this Court so that it could carry out the execution as planned before the warrant expired at midnight.  Dunn v. Price, O.T. 2018, No. 18A1053.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted the State's application to vacate the stays.  Consistent with our usual practice in resolving eleventh-hour applications, we did not issue a full opinion explaining our reasoning.  Yet our brief order was not issued until hours after the execution warrant had already expired.  The Court's delay in issuing the order happens to have the same effect as Justice Breyer's preferred course of action.  As he explained in his dissent, he preferred to discuss the matter at Conference the following day, which would require the State to \"obtain a new execution warrant, thus delaying the execution.\"  Price, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 4-5).  Justice Breyer asserted that \"delay was warranted\" in part because the legal issues raised were \"substantial.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  That rationale does not withstand even minimal legal scrutiny.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer framed the issue before the Court as \"the right of a condemned inmate not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6).  That framing was incorrect.  The issue before the Court was whether the lower courts abused their discretion in staying the execution.  For three independent reasons--all raised by the State in its application--the State was entitled to vacatur.  The dissent failed to adequately address any of them.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the District Court abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction because it manifestly lacked jurisdiction over the case, which was pending in the Court of Appeals.  It is well settled that \"[f]iling a notice of appeal,\" as petitioner did, \"transfers adjudicatory authority from the district court to the court of appeals.\"  Manrique v. United States, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 3).  \"The filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance--it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.\"  Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.\u00a0S. 56, 58 (1982) (per curiam).  Thus, as the Eleventh Circuit has long recognized, \"a district court generally is without jurisdiction to rule in a case that is on appeal\"--even after the court has rendered a decision--\"until the mandate has issued.\"  Zaklama v. Mt. Sinai Medical Center, 906 F.\u00a02d 645, 649 (1990); see also Kusay v. United States, 62 F.\u00a03d 192, 194 (CA7 1995) (Easterbrook, J.) (until the Court of Appeals issues its mandate, the case remains in the Court of Appeals, and \"any action by the district court is a nullity\"); 16AA C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a73987, p. 612 (3d ed. 2008) (Wright & Miller).  In this case, there was no dispute that the Eleventh Circuit had not yet issued its mandate when petitioner sought a preliminary injunction from the District Court on the same issues pending in the Court of Appeals.  The District Court therefore lacked authority to grant the preliminary injunction, and the Court of Appeals abused its discretion in granting a stay instead of vacating the preliminary injunction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if the Eleventh Circuit believed that the jurisdictional issue was difficult, that belief still would not have been a sufficient reason to grant a stay.  Under the traditional stay factors, a petitioner is required to make \"\u00a0'a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits.'\u00a0\"  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.\u00a0S. 418, 434 (2009).  It is not enough, as the dissent suggests, that the question be \"substantial.\"  Price, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  But the question is not even \"substantial.\"  The dissent relied only on an out-of-context quote from a treatise to support its position that this jurisdictional question was difficult.  See id., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (\"\u00a0'An interlocutory appeal ordinarily suspends the power of the district court to modify the order subject to appeal, but does not oust district-court jurisdiction to continue with proceedings that do not threaten the orderly disposition of the interlocutory appeal'\u00a0\" (quoting 16A Wright & Miller \u00a73949.1, p.\u00a050)).  The section from which this statement is plucked, however, reiterates that a notice of appeal \"\u00a0'is an event of jurisdictional significance\" that \"divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.'\u00a0\"  See ibid. (quoting Griggs, supra at 58).  The exceptions to this rule pertain to matters outside the scope of the appeal or in aid of the Court of Appeals' jurisdiction, such as taxing costs, awarding attorney's fees, or reducing to writing an earlier oral decision without altering its substance.  16A Wright & Miller \u00a73949.1.  Those exceptions were not applicable to petitioner's case.  The issue before the Eleventh Circuit was whether petitioner was entitled to a preliminary injunction based on petitioner's claim that he should be executed using nitrogen hypoxia--the exact claim petitioner raised in the District Court.  There is no question that the District Court was deprived of jurisdiction to hear the identical claim and award the exact same relief petitioner sought from the Eleventh Circuit.  To suggest that this question was difficult or that the Court was \"deeply misguided\" to follow black-letter law is at best disingenuous.  See Price, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the Eleventh Circuit did not consider how petitioner's unjustified delay in presenting his \"new evidence\" to the District Court factored into the equitable considerations of a stay.  See Hill v. McDonough, 547 U.\u00a0S. 573, 584 (2006) (equity weighs against a stay when \"\u00a0'a claim could have been brought at such a time as to allow consideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay'\u00a0\").  Notably, the Eleventh Circuit did not conclude that petitioner's new affidavits or the \"final\" version of the report made him likely to succeed on the merits or that those materials were unavailable to him earlier.  And more broadly, petitioner delayed in bringing this successive \u00a71983 action until almost a year after Alabama enacted the legislation authorizing nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative method, six months after he forwent electing it as his preferred method, and weeks after the State sought to set an execution date.  There is simply no plausible explanation for the delay other than litigation strategy.  A stay under these circumstances--in which the petitioner inexcusably filed additional evidence hours before his scheduled execution after delaying bringing his challenge in the first place--only encourages the proliferation of dilatory litigation strategies that we have recently and repeatedly sought to discourage.  See Bucklew, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 30-31); Dunn v. Ray, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ____ (2019) (slip op., at 1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, petitioner was unlikely to succeed on the merits of his method-of-execution claim.  The three-drug protocol petitioner attacks is the very one we upheld in Glossip.  And the Eleventh Circuit's April 10 analysis about whether nitrogen hypoxia was \"available\" and could be \"readily implemented\" was suspect under our precedent.  As we recently held, \"the inmate's proposal must be sufficiently detailed to permit a finding that the State could carry it out relatively easily and reasonably quickly.\"  Bucklew, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 21) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, petitioner's haphazard, one-page proposed protocol--provided for the first time in his motion for reconsideration less than a week before his scheduled execution date--was, to put it charitably, untested.  It contemplated that the execution team could use a \"hose fitting\" to \"fill\" a \"hood\" with nitrogen gas, and then attempt to \"[p]lace [the] hood over [the] inmate's head\" and \"secure\" it with an \"elastic strap\/drawstring to ensure seal.\" Record 19-0057, Doc. 33, at 4.  Even if all the equipment were available on Amazon.com, as he alleged, many details remained unanswered, particularly regarding the actual process of administering the gas and, critically, the safety of the state employees administering it.  For instance, what does \"a robust yet controlled flow of nitrogen\" mean?  Ibid.  How full of nitrogen gas should the hood be before placing it over the inmate's head?  How does one prevent nitrogen from seeping out of the hood into the execution chamber before the hood is secured?  The need to settle on details like these explains why the State has repeatedly stated that it will not be ready to implement its nitrogen hypoxia method until the end of the summer or later (and why the State requested that inmates elect nitrogen within a set time period).  Petitioner's proposal certainly fell short of showing a safe alternative that could be \"readily implemented\" by Alabama, particularly in the week before his scheduled execution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The facts of this case cast serious doubt on the Eleventh Circuit's suggestion that the State bears a heavy burden of showing that a method of execution is unavailable as soon as its legislature authorizes it to employ a new method.  That kind of burden-shifting framework would perversely incentivize States to delay or even refrain from approving even the most humane methods of execution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for petition No. 18-8766--the challenge to the original order denying petitioner a preliminary injunction--and its accompanying stay application, four Justices noted, without explanation, that they would have stayed the execution to allow consideration of this petition as well.  It is unclear what legal issue they believed warranted our review.  Petitioner did not identify a lower court conflict on an important question of law--certainly not one passed on by the Eleventh Circuit.  Instead, petitioner asked the Court to engage in mere error correction about the scope of evidence that the District Court may consider in deciding whether to grant a preliminary-injunction motion, and about the scope of appellate review.  The dissenting Justices made no attempt to explain how those issues warranted our review.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, our decisions to vacate the stays entered by the lower courts and decline to grant a stay were undoubtedly correct.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given petitioner's weak position under the law, it is difficult to see his litigation strategy as anything other than an attempt to delay his execution.  Yet four Members of the Court would have countenanced his tactics without a shred of legal support.  Indeed, Justice Breyer's six-page dissent musters only one, nonprecedential case citation for a proposition of law.  See Price, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (citing Bowersox v. Williams, 517 U.\u00a0S. 345, 347 (1996) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting)).  To be sure, the dissent gestures at a compressed timeframe, as if to suggest the legal issues were too complicated to allow reasoned consideration before the State's execution warrant expired.  But as explained above, the legal issues were remarkably straightforward.  And any blame for decisions \"in the middle of the night,\" 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7), falls on petitioner, who filed the new preliminary injunction motion that resulted in the stays just five hours before his execution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Insofar as Justice Breyer was serious in suggesting that the Court simply \"take no action\" on the State's emergency motion to vacate until the following day, id., at ___ (slip op., at 4), it should be obvious that emergency applications ordinarily cannot be scheduled for discussion at weekly (or sometimes more infrequent) Conferences.  This approach would only further incentivize prisoners to file dilatory challenges to their executions by rewarding them with de\u00a0facto stays of execution while requiring timely petitioners to meet the ordinary legal standards for a stay.  Justice Breyer's approach would also have significant real-world consequences.  It would hamper the States' ability to carry out lawful judgments, while simultaneously flooding the courts with last-minute, meritless filings.  And this practice would harm victims.  Take Bessie Lynn, Bill's widow who witnessed his horrific slaying and was herself attacked by petitioner.  She waited for hours with her daughters to witness petitioner's execution, but was forced to leave without closure.  See Alabama, Running Out of Time, Halts Execution of Sword and Dagger Killer of Pastor,\" CBS News, (Apr. 12, 2019), https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com \/ news \/ alabama - sword - dagger - killer - christopher - lee - price - execution - halted - pastor - bill - lynn\/ (all Internet materials as last visited on May 9, 2019); Execution Called Off for Christopher Price; SCOTUS Decision Allowing It Came Too Late (Apr.  11 2019), https:\/\/www.al.com\/news\/birmingham\/2019\/04\/ christopher-price-set-to-be-executed-thursday-evening-for-1991-slaying-of-minister.html.  This \"injustice, in the form of justice delayed,\" ibid., would become the norm if the Court were to regularly delay resolution of emergency applications.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, the dissent got its way by default.  Petitioner's strategy is no secret, for it is the same strategy adopted by many death-row inmates with an impending execution: bring last-minute claims that will delay the execution, no matter how groundless.  The proper response to this maneuvering is to deny meritless requests expeditiously.  The Court instead failed to issue an order before the expiration of the warrant at midnight, forcing the State to \"cal[l] off\" the execution.  Price, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  To the extent the Court's failure to issue a timely order was attributable to our own dallying, such delay both rewards gamesmanship and threatens to make last-minute stay applications the norm instead of the exception.  See Bucklew, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 30).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps those who oppose capital punishment will celebrate the last-minute cancellation of lawful executions.  But \"[t]he Constitution allows capital punishment,\" id., 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___, (slip op., at 8), and by enabling the delay of petitioner's execution on April 11, we worked a \"miscarriage of justice\" on the State of Alabama, Bessie Lynn, and her family.

Jefferson S. Dunn, Commissioner,  Alabama Department of  Corrections, et al.\non petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\nNo. 18-1249\u2003Decided May 13, 2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Alito and Justice Gorsuch join, concurring in the denial of certiorari.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I concur in the denial of certiorari.  I write separately to set the record straight regarding the Court's earlier orders vacating the stays of execution entered by the District Court and the Court of Appeals in this case.  See Dunn v. Price, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019).  In a late-night dissenting opinion accompanying one of those orders, Justice Breyer asserted that petitioner's death sentence was being \"carried out in an arbitrary way\" and that Members of this Court deviated from \"basic principles of fairness.\"  Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 1, 7).  There is nothing of substance to these assertions.  An accurate recounting of the circumstances leading to the now-delayed execution makes clear that petitioner's execution was set to proceed in a procedurally unremarkable and constitutionally acceptable manner.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent omitted any discussion of the murder that warranted petitioner's sentence of death and the extensive procedural protections afforded to him before his last-minute, dilatory filings.  I therefore begin by more fully recounting the \"circumstances as they [were] presented to our Court.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the evening of Sunday, December 22, 1991, Bill Lynn, a minister, and his wife Bessie returned home after church.  Price v. State, 725 So.\u00a02d 1003, 1011 (Ala. Crim. App. 1997).  Bill began assembling Christmas toys for his grandchildren while Bessie prepared for bed.  Ibid.  After the electricity appeared to fail, Bill went outside to check the power box.  Ibid.  He was then brutally attacked with a sword and a knife by petitioner and his accomplice.  Id., at 1011, 1015.  According to the trial court, Bill suffered a total of 38 \"cuts, lacerations, and stab wounds.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert., O.T. 2018, No. 18-8766, p.\u00a0230a (18-8766 App.).  \"One of his arms was almost severed,\" and \"[h]is scalp was detached from [his] skull.\"  Ibid.  Bessie tried to call the police, but the phone lines were cut.  Price, 725 So.\u00a02d, at 1011.  When she tried to escape and go get help, petitioner and his accomplice ordered her out of the van and attacked her, too.  Ibid.  They also stole checks, cash, and firearms, and even demanded Bessie hand over her wedding bands.  Id., at 1011-1012.  Bill \"died a slow, lingering and painful death.\"  18-8766 App., at 230a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner later confessed, and an Alabama jury convicted him of capital murder and first-degree robbery.  Price, 725 So.\u00a02d, at 1011-1012.  The jury recommended death, which the trial court imposed after finding that the killing was committed during the course of a robbery and that it was particularly heinous, atrocious, or cruel.  Id., at 1011, 1034-1035.  Petitioner's conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal and his conviction became final in 1999.  See Price, 725 So.\u00a02d 1003, aff'd, Ex parte Price, 725 So.\u00a02d 1063 (Ala. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.\u00a0S. 1133 (1999).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Twenty years later, after multiple unsuccessful attempts to obtain postconviction relief,* petitioner brought an action under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983 attacking the constitutionality of the State's lethal injection protocol.  Record in Price v. Dunn, No. 14-cv-472 (SD Ala.), Doc. 1 (Record 14-cv-472).  Following our decision in Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 13), which confirmed that prisoners challenging a State's method of execution must \"establish the existence of a known and available alternative method of execution that would entail a significantly less severe risk\" of pain, petitioner amended his complaint to propose an alternative compounded drug.  See Record 14-cv-472, Doc. 32, p.\u00a019-20.  The District Court entered judgment for the State, explaining that petitioner had failed to show that this alternative was readily available.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 38a-39a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While petitioner's appeal was pending before the Eleventh Circuit, Alabama enacted Act 2018-353, which approved nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative to lethal injection.  Death-row inmates whose convictions were final before June 1, 2018, had 30 days from that date to elect to be executed via nitrogen hypoxia.  Ala. Code \u00a715-18-82.1(b)(2) (2018).  As the Eleventh Circuit noted in affirming the District Court, petitioner did not do so.  Price v. Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections, 752 Fed. Appx. 701, 703, n.\u00a03 (2018).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Justice Breyer, the warden may not have given petitioner an election form until \"72 hours\" before the June 30 deadline.  Price, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  That \"possibil[ity],\" ibid., even if true, is irrelevant.  As an initial matter, petitioner (like all other individuals) is presumed to be aware of the law and thus the June 30 deadline.  Moreover, the Alabama statute neither required special notice to inmates nor mandated the use of a particular form.  It merely required that the election be \"personally made by the [inmate] in writing and delivered to the warden.\"  Ala. Code \u00a715-18-82.1(b)(2).  Cynthia Stewart, the warden at Holman Correctional Facility, went beyond what the statute required by affirmatively providing death-row inmates at Holman a written election form and an envelope in which they could return it to her.  18-8766 App., at 181a.  No fewer than 48 other inmates took advantage of this election.  Petitioner did not, even though he was represented throughout this time period by a well-heeled Boston law firm.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not until January 27, 2019--two weeks after the State sought to set an execution date and six months after petitioner declined to elect nitrogen hypoxia--that petitioner's counsel asked the warden, for the first time, that petitioner be executed through nitrogen hypoxia instead of lethal injection.  The warden explained that she was unable to accept the belated request under state law.  Petitioner's counsel then approached the State's counsel, who gave the same response.  On February 8, petitioner filed another \u00a71983 action challenging the constitutionality of Alabama's lethal injection protocol under the Eighth Amendment and proposing nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative.  See Bucklew v. Precythe, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 20) (requiring a prisoner bringing a \u00a71983 method of execution claim to \"identif[y] a feasible and readily implemented alternative method of execution the State refused to adopt without a legitimate reason, even though it would significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain\").  On March 1, the Alabama Supreme Court set petitioner's execution date for April 11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On April 5, the District Court denied petitioner's motion for a preliminary injunction to stay his execution pending resolution of his new \u00a71983 claim.  18-8766 App., at 54a.  The court found that nitrogen hypoxia could not be \"readily implemented\" because although Alabama had legally approved nitrogen hypoxia as a future method of execution, the State was still preparing its execution protocol.  Id., at 48a-49a.  It also found that the State had \"legitimate reason[s]\" for declining to use nitrogen hypoxia--namely, that petitioner failed to comply with the statutory deadline.  Id., at 49a-50a.  But the court stated that petitioner was likely to prevail on the question whether execution by nitrogen \"would provide a significant reduction in the substantial risk of severe pain\" as compared to execution by lethal injection.  Id., at 52a.  That same day, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration in which he proposed, for the first time, his own one-page \"execution protocol\" for nitrogen hypoxia.  Record in Price v. Dunn, No. 19-0057, Doc. 33, at 4, and n.\u00a02 (Record No. 19-0057).  The court denied the motion because petitioner \"still fail[ed] to show that [a nitrogen hypoxia execution protocol] may be readily implemented by the State and that the State does not have [a] legitimate reason for refusing his untimely request.\"  18-8766 App., at 28a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On April 10, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed on alternative grounds and denied petitioner's motion to stay his execution.  Price v. Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections, 920 F.\u00a03d 1317 (2019).  The court acknowledged that petitioner \"did not come forward with sufficient detail about how the State could implement nitrogen hypoxia to satisfy Bucklew's requirement where the inmate proposes a new method of execution.\"  Id., at 1328.  But it concluded that this failure was irrelevant because the State had officially adopted that method of execution.  Id., at 1328-1329.  Nonetheless, the court held that the District Court erred in concluding that petitioner had met his burden to show that his proposed alternative method would significantly reduce the risk of substantial pain.  Id., at 1329-1331.  In particular, the court held that the District Court had before it \"no reliable evidence\" from which to conclude that nitrogen would reduce petitioner's risk of pain in execution, as compared to the lethal injection protocol.  Id., at 1330.  It noted that in reaching the contrary conclusion, the District Court had relied on a preliminary draft report by East Central University marked \"Do Not Cite.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few hours before his scheduled execution on April 11, petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari and an accompanying application for a stay of his execution.  Price v. Dunn, O.T. 2018, No. 18-8766 (18A1044).  While that petition and application were pending here, and before any mandate issued from the Eleventh Circuit, petitioner filed yet another motion for a preliminary injunction in the District Court.  Record No. 19-0057, Doc. 45.  Petitioner attached several affidavits and a final version of the report by the East Central University.  The District Court granted a stay approximately two hours before the scheduled execution time of 6 p.m. central time, holding that, in light of the Eleventh Circuit's opinion and the new submissions, petitioner had now demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.  Id., Doc. 49, at 9-10, 13.  The State immediately filed in the Eleventh Circuit a motion to vacate on the ground that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the case, which was still at the Eleventh Circuit.  But the Eleventh Circuit entered its own stay \"in light of the jurisdictional questions raised by the parties' motions.\"  2019 WL1591475, *1 (Apr. 11, 2019).  The State then promptly filed an application to vacate the stays in this Court so that it could carry out the execution as planned before the warrant expired at midnight.  Dunn v. Price, O.T. 2018, No. 18A1053.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted the State's application to vacate the stays.  Consistent with our usual practice in resolving eleventh-hour applications, we did not issue a full opinion explaining our reasoning.  Yet our brief order was not issued until hours after the execution warrant had already expired.  The Court's delay in issuing the order happens to have the same effect as Justice Breyer's preferred course of action.  As he explained in his dissent, he preferred to discuss the matter at Conference the following day, which would require the State to \"obtain a new execution warrant, thus delaying the execution.\"  Price, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 4-5).  Justice Breyer asserted that \"delay was warranted\" in part because the legal issues raised were \"substantial.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  That rationale does not withstand even minimal legal scrutiny.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer framed the issue before the Court as \"the right of a condemned inmate not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6).  That framing was incorrect.  The issue before the Court was whether the lower courts abused their discretion in staying the execution.  For three independent reasons--all raised by the State in its application--the State was entitled to vacatur.  The dissent failed to adequately address any of them.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the District Court abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction because it manifestly lacked jurisdiction over the case, which was pending in the Court of Appeals.  It is well settled that \"[f]iling a notice of appeal,\" as petitioner did, \"transfers adjudicatory authority from the district court to the court of appeals.\"  Manrique v. United States, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 3).  \"The filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance--it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.\"  Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.\u00a0S. 56, 58 (1982) (per curiam).  Thus, as the Eleventh Circuit has long recognized, \"a district court generally is without jurisdiction to rule in a case that is on appeal\"--even after the court has rendered a decision--\"until the mandate has issued.\"  Zaklama v. Mt. Sinai Medical Center, 906 F.\u00a02d 645, 649 (1990); see also Kusay v. United States, 62 F.\u00a03d 192, 194 (CA7 1995) (Easterbrook, J.) (until the Court of Appeals issues its mandate, the case remains in the Court of Appeals, and \"any action by the district court is a nullity\"); 16AA C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a73987, p. 612 (3d ed. 2008) (Wright & Miller).  In this case, there was no dispute that the Eleventh Circuit had not yet issued its mandate when petitioner sought a preliminary injunction from the District Court on the same issues pending in the Court of Appeals.  The District Court therefore lacked authority to grant the preliminary injunction, and the Court of Appeals abused its discretion in granting a stay instead of vacating the preliminary injunction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if the Eleventh Circuit believed that the jurisdictional issue was difficult, that belief still would not have been a sufficient reason to grant a stay.  Under the traditional stay factors, a petitioner is required to make \"\u00a0'a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits.'\u00a0\"  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.\u00a0S. 418, 434 (2009).  It is not enough, as the dissent suggests, that the question be \"substantial.\"  Price, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  But the question is not even \"substantial.\"  The dissent relied only on an out-of-context quote from a treatise to support its position that this jurisdictional question was difficult.  See id., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (\"\u00a0'An interlocutory appeal ordinarily suspends the power of the district court to modify the order subject to appeal, but does not oust district-court jurisdiction to continue with proceedings that do not threaten the orderly disposition of the interlocutory appeal'\u00a0\" (quoting 16A Wright & Miller \u00a73949.1, p.\u00a050)).  The section from which this statement is plucked, however, reiterates that a notice of appeal \"\u00a0'is an event of jurisdictional significance\" that \"divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.'\u00a0\"  See ibid. (quoting Griggs, supra at 58).  The exceptions to this rule pertain to matters outside the scope of the appeal or in aid of the Court of Appeals' jurisdiction, such as taxing costs, awarding attorney's fees, or reducing to writing an earlier oral decision without altering its substance.  16A Wright & Miller \u00a73949.1.  Those exceptions were not applicable to petitioner's case.  The issue before the Eleventh Circuit was whether petitioner was entitled to a preliminary injunction based on petitioner's claim that he should be executed using nitrogen hypoxia--the exact claim petitioner raised in the District Court.  There is no question that the District Court was deprived of jurisdiction to hear the identical claim and award the exact same relief petitioner sought from the Eleventh Circuit.  To suggest that this question was difficult or that the Court was \"deeply misguided\" to follow black-letter law is at best disingenuous.  See Price, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the Eleventh Circuit did not consider how petitioner's unjustified delay in presenting his \"new evidence\" to the District Court factored into the equitable considerations of a stay.  See Hill v. McDonough, 547 U.\u00a0S. 573, 584 (2006) (equity weighs against a stay when \"\u00a0'a claim could have been brought at such a time as to allow consideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay'\u00a0\").  Notably, the Eleventh Circuit did not conclude that petitioner's new affidavits or the \"final\" version of the report made him likely to succeed on the merits or that those materials were unavailable to him earlier.  And more broadly, petitioner delayed in bringing this successive \u00a71983 action until almost a year after Alabama enacted the legislation authorizing nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative method, six months after he forwent electing it as his preferred method, and weeks after the State sought to set an execution date.  There is simply no plausible explanation for the delay other than litigation strategy.  A stay under these circumstances--in which the petitioner inexcusably filed additional evidence hours before his scheduled execution after delaying bringing his challenge in the first place--only encourages the proliferation of dilatory litigation strategies that we have recently and repeatedly sought to discourage.  See Bucklew, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 30-31); Dunn v. Ray, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ____ (2019) (slip op., at 1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, petitioner was unlikely to succeed on the merits of his method-of-execution claim.  The three-drug protocol petitioner attacks is the very one we upheld in Glossip.  And the Eleventh Circuit's April 10 analysis about whether nitrogen hypoxia was \"available\" and could be \"readily implemented\" was suspect under our precedent.  As we recently held, \"the inmate's proposal must be sufficiently detailed to permit a finding that the State could carry it out relatively easily and reasonably quickly.\"  Bucklew, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 21) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, petitioner's haphazard, one-page proposed protocol--provided for the first time in his motion for reconsideration less than a week before his scheduled execution date--was, to put it charitably, untested.  It contemplated that the execution team could use a \"hose fitting\" to \"fill\" a \"hood\" with nitrogen gas, and then attempt to \"[p]lace [the] hood over [the] inmate's head\" and \"secure\" it with an \"elastic strap\/drawstring to ensure seal.\" Record 19-0057, Doc. 33, at 4.  Even if all the equipment were available on Amazon.com, as he alleged, many details remained unanswered, particularly regarding the actual process of administering the gas and, critically, the safety of the state employees administering it.  For instance, what does \"a robust yet controlled flow of nitrogen\" mean?  Ibid.  How full of nitrogen gas should the hood be before placing it over the inmate's head?  How does one prevent nitrogen from seeping out of the hood into the execution chamber before the hood is secured?  The need to settle on details like these explains why the State has repeatedly stated that it will not be ready to implement its nitrogen hypoxia method until the end of the summer or later (and why the State requested that inmates elect nitrogen within a set time period).  Petitioner's proposal certainly fell short of showing a safe alternative that could be \"readily implemented\" by Alabama, particularly in the week before his scheduled execution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The facts of this case cast serious doubt on the Eleventh Circuit's suggestion that the State bears a heavy burden of showing that a method of execution is unavailable as soon as its legislature authorizes it to employ a new method.  That kind of burden-shifting framework would perversely incentivize States to delay or even refrain from approving even the most humane methods of execution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for petition No. 18-8766--the challenge to the original order denying petitioner a preliminary injunction--and its accompanying stay application, four Justices noted, without explanation, that they would have stayed the execution to allow consideration of this petition as well.  It is unclear what legal issue they believed warranted our review.  Petitioner did not identify a lower court conflict on an important question of law--certainly not one passed on by the Eleventh Circuit.  Instead, petitioner asked the Court to engage in mere error correction about the scope of evidence that the District Court may consider in deciding whether to grant a preliminary-injunction motion, and about the scope of appellate review.  The dissenting Justices made no attempt to explain how those issues warranted our review.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, our decisions to vacate the stays entered by the lower courts and decline to grant a stay were undoubtedly correct.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given petitioner's weak position under the law, it is difficult to see his litigation strategy as anything other than an attempt to delay his execution.  Yet four Members of the Court would have countenanced his tactics without a shred of legal support.  Indeed, Justice Breyer's six-page dissent musters only one, nonprecedential case citation for a proposition of law.  See Price, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (citing Bowersox v. Williams, 517 U.\u00a0S. 345, 347 (1996) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting)).  To be sure, the dissent gestures at a compressed timeframe, as if to suggest the legal issues were too complicated to allow reasoned consideration before the State's execution warrant expired.  But as explained above, the legal issues were remarkably straightforward.  And any blame for decisions \"in the middle of the night,\" 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7), falls on petitioner, who filed the new preliminary injunction motion that resulted in the stays just five hours before his execution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Insofar as Justice Breyer was serious in suggesting that the Court simply \"take no action\" on the State's emergency motion to vacate until the following day, id., at ___ (slip op., at 4), it should be obvious that emergency applications ordinarily cannot be scheduled for discussion at weekly (or sometimes more infrequent) Conferences.  This approach would only further incentivize prisoners to file dilatory challenges to their executions by rewarding them with de\u00a0facto stays of execution while requiring timely petitioners to meet the ordinary legal standards for a stay.  Justice Breyer's approach would also have significant real-world consequences.  It would hamper the States' ability to carry out lawful judgments, while simultaneously flooding the courts with last-minute, meritless filings.  And this practice would harm victims.  Take Bessie Lynn, Bill's widow who witnessed his horrific slaying and was herself attacked by petitioner.  She waited for hours with her daughters to witness petitioner's execution, but was forced to leave without closure.  See Alabama, Running Out of Time, Halts Execution of Sword and Dagger Killer of Pastor,\" CBS News, (Apr. 12, 2019), https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com \/ news \/ alabama - sword - dagger - killer - christopher - lee - price - execution - halted - pastor - bill - lynn\/ (all Internet materials as last visited on May 9, 2019); Execution Called Off for Christopher Price; SCOTUS Decision Allowing It Came Too Late (Apr.  11 2019), https:\/\/www.al.com\/news\/birmingham\/2019\/04\/ christopher-price-set-to-be-executed-thursday-evening-for-1991-slaying-of-minister.html.  This \"injustice, in the form of justice delayed,\" ibid., would become the norm if the Court were to regularly delay resolution of emergency applications.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, the dissent got its way by default.  Petitioner's strategy is no secret, for it is the same strategy adopted by many death-row inmates with an impending execution: bring last-minute claims that will delay the execution, no matter how groundless.  The proper response to this maneuvering is to deny meritless requests expeditiously.  The Court instead failed to issue an order before the expiration of the warrant at midnight, forcing the State to \"cal[l] off\" the execution.  Price, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  To the extent the Court's failure to issue a timely order was attributable to our own dallying, such delay both rewards gamesmanship and threatens to make last-minute stay applications the norm instead of the exception.  See Bucklew, 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 30).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps those who oppose capital punishment will celebrate the last-minute cancellation of lawful executions.  But \"[t]he Constitution allows capital punishment,\" id., 587 U.\u00a0S., at ___, (slip op., at 8), and by enabling the delay of petitioner's execution on April 11, we worked a \"miscarriage of justice\" on the State of Alabama, Bessie Lynn, and her family.

HUNT(2019)\nNo. 18-315\nArgued: March 19, 2019Decided: May 13, 2019\n\n\nThe False Claims Act permits a private person, known as a relator, to bring a qui tam civil action \"in the name of the [Federal] Government,\" 31 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73730(b), against \"any person\" who \"knowingly presents .\u00a0.\u00a0. a false or fraudulent claim for payment\" to the Government or to certain third parties acting on the Government's behalf, \u00a7\u00a73729(a), (b)(2).  The Government may choose to intervene in the action.  See \u00a7\u00a73730(b)(2), (4).  Two limitations periods apply to a \"civil action under section 3730.\"  \u00a73731(b).  An action must be brought within either 6 years after the statutory violation occurred, \u00a73731(b)(1), or 3 years after the \"the official of the United States charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances\" knew or should have known the relevant facts, but not more than 10 years after the violation, \u00a73731(b)(2).  The period providing the later date serves as the limitations period.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In November 2013, respondent Hunt filed a complaint alleging that petitioners--two defense contractors (collectively, Cochise)--defrauded the Government by submitting false payment claims for providing security services in Iraq up until early 2007.  Hunt claims that he revealed Cochise's allegedly fraudulent scheme during a November 30, 2010, interview with federal officials about his role in an unrelated contracting fraud in Iraq.  The United States declined to intervene in the action, and Cochise moved to dismiss the complaint as barred by the statute of limitations.  Hunt countered that his complaint was timely under \u00a73731(b)(2).  In dismissing the action, the District Court considered three potential interpretations: that \u00a73731(b)(2) does not apply to a relator-initiated action in which the Government elects not to intervene; that \u00a73731(b)(2) applies in nonintervened actions, and the limitations period begins when the relator knew or should have known the relevant facts; or that \u00a73731(b)(2) applies in nonintervened actions, and the limitations period begins when the Government official responsible for acting knew or should have known the relevant facts.  The court rejected the third interpretation and found that Hunt's complaint would be untimely under either of the first two.  The Eleventh Circuit reversed and remanded, adopting the third interpretation.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0The limitations period in \u00a73731(b)(2) applies in a relator-initiated suit in which the Government has declined to intervene.  Both Government-initiated suits under \u00a73730(a) and relator-initiated suits under \u00a73730(b) are \"civil action[s] under section 3730.\"  Thus, the plain text of the statute makes the two limitations periods applicable in both types of suits.  Cochise claims that starting a limitations period when the party entitled to bring a claim learns the relevant facts is a default rule of tolling provisions, so subsection (b)(2) should apply only when the Government is a party.  But treating a relator-initiated, nonintervened suit as a \"civil action under section 3730\" for purposes of subsection (b)(1) but not subsection (b)(2) is at odds with fundamental rules of statutory interpretation.  Because a single use of a statutory phrase generally must have a fixed meaning, see Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.\u00a0S. 135, 143, interpretations that would \"attribute different meanings to the same phrase\" should be avoided, Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 528 U.\u00a0S. 320, 329.  Here, the clear text of the statute controls.  Cochise's reliance on Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U.\u00a0S. 409, is misplaced.  Nothing in Graham County supports giving the phrase \"civil action under section 3730\" in \u00a73731(b) two different meanings depending on whether the Government intervenes.  While the Graham County Court sought \"a construction that avoids .\u00a0.\u00a0. counterintuitive results,\" there the text \"admit[ted] of two plausible interpretations.\"  Id., at 421, 419, n. 2.  Here, Cochise points to no other plausible interpretation of the text, so the \"\u00a0'judicial inquiry is complete.'\u00a0\"  Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.\u00a0S. 438, 462.  Pp.\u00a04-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0The relator in a nonintervened suit is not \"the official of the United States\" whose knowledge triggers \u00a73731(b)(2)'s 3-year limitations period.  The statute provides no support for such a reading.  First, a private relator is neither appointed as an officer of the United States nor employed by the United States.  Second, the provision authorizing qui tam suits is entitled \"Actions by Private Persons.\"  \u00a73730(b).  Third, the statute refers to \"the\" official \"charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances.\"  Regardless of precisely which official or officials the statute is referring to, \u00a73731(b)(2)'s use of the definite article \"the\" suggests that Congress did not intend for private relators to be considered \"the official of the United States.\"  See Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.\u00a0S. 426, 434.  Nor are private relators \"charged with responsibility to act\" in the sense contemplated by \u00a73731(b), as they are not required to investigate or prosecute a False Claims Act action.

The first period requires that the action be brought within 6 years after the statutory violation occurred.  The second period requires that the action be brought within 3 years after the United States official charged with the responsibility to act knew or should have known the relevant facts, but not more than 10 years after the violation.  Whichever period provides the later date serves as the limitations period.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case requires us to decide how to calculate the limitations period for qui\u00a0tam suits in which the United States does not intervene.  The Court of Appeals held that these suits are \"civil action[s] under section 3730\" and that the limitations periods in \u00a73731(b) apply in accordance with their terms, regardless of whether the United States intervenes.  It further held that, for purposes of the second period, the private person who initiates the qui\u00a0tam suit cannot be deemed the official of the United States.  We agree, and therefore affirm.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As relevant, the False Claims Act imposes civil liability on \"any person\" who \"knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval\" to the Government or to certain third parties acting on the Government's behalf.  31 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a73729(a), (b)(2).  Section 3730 authorizes two types of actions: First, the Attorney General, who \"diligently shall investigate a violation under section 3729,\" may bring a civil action against the alleged false claimant.  \u00a73730(a).  Second, a private person, known as a relator, may bring a qui tam civil action \"for the person and for the United States Government\" against the alleged false claimant, \"in the name of the Government.\"  \u00a73730(b).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If a relator initiates the action, he must deliver a copy of the complaint and supporting evidence to the Government, which then has 60 days to intervene in the action.  \u00a7\u00a73730(b)(2), (4).  During this time, the complaint remains sealed.  \u00a73730(b)(2).  If the Government intervenes, it assumes primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, though the relator may continue to participate.  \u00a73730(c).  Otherwise, the relator has the right to pursue the action.  \u00a7\u00a73730(b)(4), (c)(3).  Even if it does not intervene, the Government is entitled to be served with all pleadings upon request and may intervene at any time with good cause.  \u00a73730(c)(3).  The relator receives a share of any proceeds from the action--generally 15 to 25 percent if the Government intervenes, and 25 to 30 percent if it does not--plus attorney's fees and costs.  \u00a7\u00a73730(d)(1)-(2).  See Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.\u00a0S. 765, 769-770 (2000).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At issue here is the Act's statute of limitations, which provides:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(b) A civil action under section 3730 may not be brought--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(1) more than 6 years after the date on which the violation of section 3729 is committed, or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(2) more than 3 years after the date when facts material to the right of action are known or reasonably should have been known by the official of the United States charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances, but in no event more than 10 years after the date on which the violation is committed,\n\"whichever occurs last.\"  \u00a73731(b).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On November 27, 2013, respondent Billy Joe Hunt filed a complaint alleging that petitioners--two defense contractors (collectively, Cochise)--defrauded the Government by submitting false claims for payment under a subcontract to provide security services in Iraq \"from some time prior to January 2006 until early 2007.\"  App. 43a.  A little less than three years before bringing his complaint, Hunt was interviewed by federal agents about his role in an unrelated contracting fraud in Iraq.  Hunt claims to have revealed Cochise's allegedly fraudulent scheme during this November 30, 2010, interview.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States declined to intervene in Hunt's action, and Cochise moved to dismiss the complaint as barred by the statute of limitations.  Hunt conceded that the 6-year limitations period in \u00a73731(b)(1) had elapsed before he filed suit on November 27, 2013.  But Hunt argued that his complaint was timely under \u00a73731(b)(2) because it was filed within 3 years of the interview in which he informed federal agents about the alleged fraud (and within 10 years after the violation occurred).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court dismissed the action.  It considered three potential interpretations of \u00a73731(b).  Under the first interpretation, \u00a73731(b)(2) does not apply to a relator-initiated action in which the Government elects not to intervene, so any such action must be filed within six years after the violation.  Under the second interpretation, \u00a73731(b)(2) applies in nonintervened actions, and the limitations period begins when the relator knew or should have known the relevant facts.  Under the third interpretation, \u00a73731(b)(2) applies in nonintervened actions, and the limitations period begins when \"the official of the United States charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances\" knew or should have known the relevant facts.  The District Court rejected the third interpretation and declined to choose between the first two because it found that Hunt's complaint would be untimely under either.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, adopting the third interpretation.  887 F.\u00a03d 1081 (CA11 2018).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given a conflict between the Courts of Appeals,* we granted certiorari.  586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first question before us is whether the limitations period in \u00a73731(b)(2) is available in a relator-initiated suit in which the Government has declined to intervene.  If so, the second question is whether the relator in such a case should be considered \"the official of the United States\" whose knowledge triggers \u00a73731(b)(2)'s 3-year limitations period.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 3731(b) sets forth two limitations periods that apply to \"civil action[s] under section 3730.\"  Both  Government-initiated suits under \u00a73730(a) and relator-initiated suits under \u00a73730(b) are \"civil action[s] under section 3730.\"  Thus, the plain text of the statute makes the two limitations periods applicable in both types of suits.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cochise agrees with that view as to the limitations period in \u00a73731(b)(1), but argues that the period in \u00a73731(b)(2) is available in a relator-initiated suit only if the Government intervenes.  According to Cochise, starting a limitations period when the party entitled to bring a claim learns the relevant facts is a default rule of tolling provisions, so subsection (b)(2) should be read to apply only when the Government is a party.  In short, under Cochise's reading, a relator-initiated, nonintervened suit is a \"civil action under section 3730\" for purposes of subsection (b)(1) but not subsection (b)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This reading is at odds with fundamental rules of statutory interpretation.  In all but the most unusual situations, a single use of a statutory phrase must have a fixed meaning.  See Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.\u00a0S. 135, 143 (1994).  We therefore avoid interpretations that would \"attribute different meanings to the same phrase.\"  Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 528 U.\u00a0S. 320, 329 (2000).  Here, either a relator-initiated, nonintervened suit is a \"civil action under section 3730\"--and thus subject to the limitations periods in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2)--or it is not.  It is such an action.  Whatever the default tolling rule might be, the clear text of the statute controls this case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Cochise's reading, a relator-initiated civil action would convert to \"[a] civil action under section 3730\" for purposes of subsection (b)(2) if and when the Government intervenes.  That reading cannot be correct.  If the Government intervenes, the civil action remains the same--it simply has one additional party.  There is no textual basis to base the meaning of \"[a] civil action under section 3730\" on whether the Government has intervened.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cochise relies on our decision in Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U.\u00a0S. 409 (2005), which addressed the question whether \u00a73731(b)(1) or federal common law provided the limitations period for \u00a73730(h) retaliation actions.  Section 3730(h) creates a cause of action for an employee who suffers retaliation for, among other things, assisting with the prosecution of a False Claims Act action.  At the time, \u00a73730(h) did not specify a time limit for bringing a retaliation action, so the question before us was whether the phrase \"civil action under section 3730\" in \u00a73731(b) encompassed actions under \u00a73730(h).  We considered the statute \"ambiguous because its text, literally read, admits of two plausible interpretations.\"  Id., at 419, n.\u00a02.  One reading was that a \"civil action under section 3730\" includes \u00a73730(h) actions because such actions arise under \u00a73730.  Id., at 415.  \"Another reasonable reading\" was that a \"civil action under section 3730\" \"applies only to actions arising under \u00a7\u00a73730(a) and (b)\" because \"\u00a73731(b)(1) t[ies] the start of the time limit to 'the date on which the violation of section 3729 is committed.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  That reading had force because retaliation claims need not involve an actual violation of \u00a73729.  Ibid.  Looking to statutory context, we explained that the phrase \"\u00a0'civil action under section 3730' means only those civil actions under \u00a73730 that have as an element a 'violation of section 3729,' that is, \u00a7\u00a73730(a) and (b) actions\"--not \u00a73730(h) retaliation actions.  Id., at 421-422.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A relator-initiated, nonintervened suit arises under \u00a73730(b) and has as an element a violation of \u00a73729.  Graham County supports our reading.  Nonetheless, Cochise points out that in considering the statutory context, we discussed a similar phrase contained in \u00a73731(c) (now \u00a73731(d)), which stated: \"In any action brought under section 3730, the United States shall be required to prove all essential elements of the cause of action, including damages, by a preponderance of the evidence.\"  (Emphasis added.)  We explained that \u00a73731(c) \"use[d] the similarly unqualified phrase 'action brought under section 3730' to refer only to \u00a7\u00a73730(a) and (b) actions.\"  Id., at 417-418.  We then stated: \"As [respondent] and the United States concede, the context of this provision implies that the phrase 'any action brought under section 3730' is limited to \u00a73730(a) actions brought by the United States and \u00a73730(b) actions in which the United States intervenes as a party, as those are the types of \u00a73730 actions in which the United States necessarily participates.\"  Id., at 418.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cochise contends that we should adopt a similar construction of the phrase \"civil action under section 3730\" in \u00a73731(b).  We disagree.  Our discussion of \u00a73731(c) was focused on \"the context of th[at] provision\" and on whether it could be read to impose the burden of proof on the Government even in cases where the Government did not participate.  Id., at 418.  Those considerations do not apply here; there is nothing illogical about reading \u00a73731(b) to apply in accordance with its plain terms.  Moreover, if a \"civil action under section 3730\" included only an action in which the Government participates for purposes of \u00a73731(b)(2), then we would be obligated to give it a like meaning for purposes of \u00a73731(b)(1).  This would mean that a relator-initiated, nonintervened suit would be subject to neither \u00a73731(b)(1) nor \u00a73731(b)(2)--a reading Cochise expressly disclaims.  See Brief for Petitioners 20, n.\u00a03.  Nothing in Graham County supports giving the same phrase in \u00a73731(b) two different meanings depending on whether the Government intervenes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Again pointing to Graham County, Cochise next contends that our reading would lead to \"\u00a0'counterintuitive results.'\u00a0\"  Brief for Petitioners 26.  For instance, if the Government discovers the fraud on the day it occurred, it would have 6 years to bring suit, but if a relator instead discovers the fraud on the day it occurred and the Government does not discover it, the relator could have as many as 10 years to bring suit.  That discrepancy arises because \u00a73731(b)(2) begins its limitations period on the date that \"the official of the United States charged with responsibility to act\" obtained knowledge of the relevant facts.  But we see nothing unusual about extending the limitations period when the Government official did not know and should not reasonably have known the relevant facts, given that the Government is the party harmed by the false claim and will receive the bulk of any recovery.  See \u00a73730(d).  In any event, a result that \"may seem odd .\u00a0.\u00a0. is not absurd.\"  Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U.\u00a0S. 546, 565 (2005).  Although in Graham County we sought \"a construction that avoids .\u00a0.\u00a0. counterintuitive results,\" there the text \"admit[ted] of two plausible interpretations.\"  545 U.\u00a0S., at 421, 419, n.\u00a02.  Here, Cochise points to no other plausible interpretation of the text, so the \"\u00a0'judicial inquiry is complete.'\u00a0\"  Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.\u00a0S. 438, 462 (2002).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cochise's fallback argument is that the relator in a nonintervened suit should be considered \"the official of the United States charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances,\" meaning that \u00a73731(b)(2)'s 3-year limitations period would start when the relator knew or should have known about the fraud.  But the statute provides no support for reading \"the official of the United States\" to encompass a private relator.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, a private relator is not an \"official of the United States\" in the ordinary sense of that phrase.  A relator is neither appointed as an officer of the United States, see U.\u00a0S. Const., Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2, nor employed by the United States.  Indeed, the provision that authorizes qui tam suits is entitled \"Actions by Private Persons.\"  \u00a73730(b).  Although that provision explains that the action is brought \"for the person and for the United States Government\" and \"in the name of the Government,\" ibid., it does not make the relator anything other than a private person, much less \"the official of the United States\" referenced by the statute.  Cf. Stevens, 529 U.\u00a0S., at 773, n.\u00a04 (\"[A] qui tam relator is, in effect, suing as a partial assignee of the United States\" (emphasis deleted)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the statute refers to \"the\" official \"charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances.\"  The Government argues that, in context, \"the\" official refers to the Attorney General (or his delegate), who by statute \"shall investigate a violation under section 3729.\"  \u00a73730(a).  Regardless of precisely which official or officials the statute is referring to, \u00a73731(b)(2)'s use of the definite article \"the\" suggests that Congress did not intend for any and all private relators to be considered \"the official of the United States.\"  See Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.\u00a0S. 426, 434 (2004) (explaining that the \"use of the definite article .\u00a0.\u00a0. indicates that there is generally only one\" person covered).  More fundamentally, private relators are not \"charged with responsibility to act\" in the sense contemplated by \u00a73731(b), as they are not required to investigate or prosecute a False Claims Act action.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\nAffirmed.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1*Compare 887 F.\u00a03d 1081, 1089-1097 (CA11 2018) (adopting the third interpretation), with United States ex rel.

His grievance not only insulted the guard, referring to her as a \"fat Hispanic,\" but contained language that may reasonably be construed as a threat.  Specifically, the grievance stated:\n\"It is no wonder [why] guards are assaulted and even killed by some prisoners.

Although the District Court originally dismissed Richey's claim, that decision was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which held that Richey stated a valid claim for relief under the First Amendment.  See Richey v. Dahne, 624 Fed. Appx. 525, 526 (2015).  In the decision below, the Ninth Circuit doubled down on its earlier ruling, holding that prisoners have a clearly established constitutional right to use \"disrespectful\" language in prison grievances and that Richey was entitled to summary judgment on his First Amendment claim.  733 Fed.

To maintain order, prison authorities may insist on compliance with rules that would not be permitted in the outside world.  See Turner v. Safley, 482 U.\u00a0S. 78, 89-91 (1987).  Even if a prison must accept grievances containing personal insults of guards, a proposition that is not self-evident,* does it follow that prisons must tolerate veiled threats?

STEAGER, WEST VIRGINIA STATE TAX COMMISSIONER(2019)\nNo. 17-419\nArgued: December 3, 2018Decided: February 20, 2019\n\n\nAfter petitioner James Dawson retired from the U.\u00a0S. Marshals Service, his home State of West Virginia taxed his federal pension benefits as it does all former federal employees.  The pension benefits of certain former state and local law enforcement employees, however, are exempt from state taxation.  See W.\u00a0Va. Code Ann. \u00a711-21-12(c)(6).  Mr. Dawson sued, alleging that the state statute violates the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine as codified at 4 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7111.  Under that statute, the United States consents to state taxation of the pay or compensation of federal employees, but only if the state tax does not discriminate on the basis of the source of the pay or compensation.  A West Virginia trial court found no significant differences between Mr. Dawson's job duties as a federal marshal and those of the state and local law enforcement officers exempted from taxation and held that the state statute violates \u00a7111's antidiscrimination provision.  Reversing, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals emphasized that the state tax exemption applies only to a narrow class of state retirees and was never intended to discriminate against former federal marshals.\nHeld:\u00a0The West Virginia statute unlawfully discriminates against Mr. Dawson as \u00a7111 forbids.  A State violates \u00a7111 when it treats retired state employees more favorably than retired federal employees and no \"significant differences between the two classes\" justify the differential treatment.  Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.\u00a0S. 803, 814-816.  Here, West Virginia expressly affords state law enforcement retirees a tax benefit that federal retirees cannot receive, and there are no \"significant differences\" between Mr. Dawson's former job responsibilities and those of the tax-exempt state law enforcement retirees.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The narrow preference should be permitted, the State argues, because it affects too few people to meaningfully interfere with federal government operations.  Section 111, however, disallows any state tax that discriminates against a federal officer or employee--not just those that seem especially cumbersome.  And in Davis the Court refused a similar invitation to add unwritten qualifications to \u00a7111.  That is not to say that the narrowness of a state tax exemption is irrelevant.  If a State exempts only a narrow subset of state retirees, it can comply with \u00a7111 by exempting only the comparable class of federal retirees.  The State also argues that the statute is not intended to harm federal retirees but to help certain state retirees.  The \"State's interest in adopting the discriminatory tax,\" however, \"is simply irrelevant.\"  Davis, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 816.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For reasons other than job responsibilities, the State insists, retired U.\u00a0S. Marshals and tax-exempt state law enforcement retirees are not \"similarly situated.\"  But the State's statute does not draw any such lines.  It singles out for preferential treatment retirement plans associated with particular state law enforcement officers.  The distinguishing characteristic of the retirement plans is the nature of the jobs previously held by retirees who may participate in them.  The state trial court found no \"significant differences\" between Mr. Dawson's former job responsibilities as a U.\u00a0S. Marshal and those of the state law enforcement retirees who qualify for the tax exemption, and the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals did not upset that finding.  By submitting that Mr. Dawson's former job responsibilities are also similar to those of other state law enforcement retirees who do not qualify for a tax exemption, the State mistakes the nature of the inquiry.  The relevant question under \u00a7111 is not whether federal retirees are similarly situated to state retirees who do not receive a tax break; it is whether they are similarly situated to those who do.  Finally, the State says that the real distinction may not be based on job duties at all but on the relative generosity of pension benefits.  The statute as enacted, however, does not classify persons or groups on that basis.  And an implicit but lawful distinction cannot save an express and unlawful one.  See, e.g., id., at 817.

DALEW. STEAGER, WEST VIRGINIA STATETAX COMMISSIONER\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of appeals of west virginia\n[February 20, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you spent your career as a state law enforcement officer in West Virginia, you're likely to be eligible for a generous tax exemption when you retire.  But if you served in federal law enforcement, West Virginia will deny you the same benefit.  The question we face is whether a State may discriminate against federal retirees in that way.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For most of his career, James Dawson worked in the U.\u00a0S. Marshals Service.  After he retired, he began looking into the tax treatment of his pension.  It turns out that his home State, West Virginia, doesn't tax the pension benefits of certain former state law enforcement employees.  But it does tax the benefits of all former federal employees.  So Mr. Dawson brought this lawsuit alleging that West Virginia violated 4 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7111.  In that statute,  the United States has consented to state taxation of the \"pay or compensation\" of \"officer[s] or employee[s] of the United States,\" but only if the \"taxation does not discriminate against the officer or employee because of the source of the pay or compensation.\"  \u00a7111(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 111 codifies a legal doctrine almost as old as the Nation.  In McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), this Court invoked the Constitution's Supremacy Clause to invalidate Maryland's effort to levy a tax on the Bank of the United States.  Chief Justice Marshall explained that \"the power to tax involves the power to destroy,\" and he reasoned that if States could tax the Bank they could \"defeat\" the federal legislative policy establishing it.  Id., at 431-432.  For the next few decades, this Court interpreted McCulloch \"to bar most taxation by one sovereign of the employees of another.\"  Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.\u00a0S. 803, 810 (1989).  In time, though, the Court softened its stance and upheld neutral income taxes--those that treated federal and state employees with an even hand.  See Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U.\u00a0S. 405 (1938); Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U.\u00a0S. 466 (1939).  So eventually the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine came to be understood to bar only discrimina- tory taxes.  It was this understanding that Congress \"consciously .\u00a0.\u00a0. drew upon\" when adopting \u00a7111 in 1939.  Davis, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 813.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is this understanding, too, that has animated our application of \u00a7111.  Since the statute's adoption, we have upheld an Alabama income tax that did not discriminate on the basis of the source of the employees' compensation.  Jefferson County v. Acker, 527 U.\u00a0S. 423 (1999).  But we have invalidated a Michigan tax that discriminated \"in favor of retired state employees and against retired federal employees.\"  Davis, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 814.  We have struck down a Kansas law that taxed the retirement benefits of federal military personnel at a higher rate than state and local government retirement benefits.  Barker v. Kansas, 503 U.\u00a0S. 594, 599 (1992).  And we have rejected a Texas scheme that imposed a property tax on a private company operating on land leased from the federal government, but a \"less burdensome\" tax on property leased from the State.  Phillips Chemical Co. v. Dumas Independent School Dist., 361 U.\u00a0S. 376, 378, 380 (1960).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Dawson's own attempt to invoke \u00a7111 met with mixed success.  A West Virginia trial court found it \"undisputed\" that \"there are no significant differences between Mr. Dawson's powers and duties as a US Marshal and the powers and duties of the state and local law enforcement officers\" that West Virginia exempts from income tax.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a.  In the trial court's judgment, the State's statute thus represented \"precisely the type of favoritism\" \u00a7111 prohibits.  Id., at 23a.  But the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals saw it differently.  In reversing, the court emphasized that relatively few state employees receive the tax break denied Mr. Dawson.  The court stressed, too, that the statute's \"intent .\u00a0.\u00a0. was to give a benefit to a narrow class of state retirees,\" not to harm federal retirees.  Id., at 15a.  Because cases in this field have yielded inconsistent results, much as this one has, we granted certiorari to afford additional guidance.  585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We believe the state trial court had it right.  A State violates \u00a7111 when it treats retired state employees more favorably than retired federal employees and no \"significant differences between the two classes\" justify the differential treatment.  Davis, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 814-816 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted); Phillips Chemical Co., 361 U.\u00a0S., at 383.  Here, West Virginia expressly affords state law enforcement retirees a tax benefit that federal retirees cannot receive.  And before us everyone accepts the trial court's factual finding that there aren't any \"significant differences\" between Mr. Dawson's former job responsibilities and those of the tax-exempt state law enforcement retirees.  Given all this, we have little difficulty concluding that West Virginia's law unlawfully \"discriminate[s]\" against Mr. Dawson \"because of the source of [his] pay or compensation,\" just as \u00a7111 forbids.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State offers this ambitious rejoinder.  Even if its statute favors some state law enforcement retirees, the favored class is very small.  Most state retirees are treated no better than Mr. Dawson.  And this narrow preference, the State suggests, should be permitted because it affects so few people that it couldn't meaningfully interfere with the operations of the federal government.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are unpersuaded.  Section 111 disallows any state tax that discriminates against a federal officer or employee--not just those that seem to us especially cumbersome.  Nor are we inclined to accept West Virginia's invitation to adorn \u00a7111 with a new and judicially manufactured qualification that cannot be found in its text.  In fact, we have already refused an almost identical request.  In Davis, we rejected Michigan's suggestion that a discriminatory state income tax should be allowed to stand so long as it treats federal employees or retirees the same as \"the vast majority of voters in the State.\"  489 U.\u00a0S., at 815, n.\u00a04.  We rejected, too, any suggestion that a discriminatory tax is permissible so long as it \"does not interfere with the Federal Government's ability to perform its governmental functions.\"  Id., at 814.  In fact, as long ago as McCulloch, Chief Justice Marshall warned against enmeshing courts in the \"perplexing\" business, \"so unfit for the judicial department,\" of attempting to delineate \"what degree of taxation is the legitimate use, and what degree may amount to the abuse of power.\"  4 Wheat., at 430.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That's not to say the breadth or narrowness of a state tax exemption is irrelevant.  Under \u00a7111, the scope of a State's tax exemption may affect the scope of its resulting duties.  So if a State exempts from taxation all state employees, it must likewise exempt all federal employees.  Conversely, if the State decides to exempt only a narrow subset of state retirees, the State can comply with \u00a7111 by exempting only the comparable class of federal retirees.  But the narrowness of a discriminatory state tax law has never been enough to render it necessarily lawful.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With its primary argument lost, the State now proceeds more modestly.  Echoing the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, the State argues that we should uphold its statute because it isn't intended to harm federal retirees, only to help certain state retirees.  But under the terms of \u00a7111, the \"State's interest in adopting the discriminatory tax, no matter how substantial, is simply irrelevant.\"  Davis, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 816.  We can safely assume that discriminatory laws like West Virginia's are almost always enacted with the purpose of benefiting state employees rather than harming their federal counterparts.  Yet that wasn't enough to save the state statutes in Davis, Barker, or Phillips, and it can't be enough here.  Under \u00a7111 what matters isn't the intent lurking behind the law but whether the letter of the law \"treat[s] those who deal with\" the federal government \"as well as it treats those with whom [the State] deals itself.\"  Phillips Chemical Co., 361 U.\u00a0S., at 385.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If treatment rather than intent is what matters, the State suggests that it should still prevail for other reasons.  Section 111 prohibits \"discriminat[ion],\" something we've often described as treating similarly situated persons differently.  See Davis, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 815-816; Phillips Chemical Co., 361 U.\u00a0S., at 383.  And before us West Virginia insists that even if retired U.\u00a0S. Marshals and tax-exempt state law enforcement retirees had similar job responsibilities, they aren't \"similarly situated\" for other reasons.  Put another way, the State contends that the difference in treatment its law commands doesn't qualify as unlawful discrimination because it is \"directly related to, and justified by,\" a lawful and \"significant difference\" between the two classes.  Davis, 489 U.\u00a0S., at 816 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In approaching this argument, everyone before us agrees on at least one thing.  Whether a State treats similarly situated state and federal employees differently depends on how the State has defined the favored class.  See id., at 817.  So if the State defines the favored class by reference to job responsibilities, a similarly situated federal worker will be one who performs comparable duties.  But if the State defines the class by reference to some other criteria, our attention should naturally turn there.  If a State gives a tax benefit to all retirees over a certain age, for example, the comparable federal retiree would be someone who is also over that age.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So how has West Virginia chosen to define the favored class in this case?  The state statute singles out for preferential treatment retirement plans associated with West Virginia police, firefighters, and deputy sheriffs.  See W. Va. Code Ann. \u00a711-21-12(c)(6) (Lexis 2017).  The distinguishing characteristic of these plans is the nature of the jobs previously held by retirees who may participate in them; thus, a similarly situated federal retiree is someone who had similar job responsibilities to a state police officer, firefighter, or deputy sheriff.  The state trial court correctly focused on this point of comparison and found no \"significant differences\" between Mr. Dawson's former job responsibilities as a U.\u00a0S. Marshal and those of the state law enforcement retirees who qualify for the tax exemption.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a.  Nor did the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals upset this factual finding.  So looking to how the State has chosen to define its favored class only seems to confirm that it has treated similarly situated persons differently because of the source of their compensation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, West Virginia sees it otherwise.  It accepts (for now) that its statute distinguishes between persons based on their former job duties.  It accepts, too, the trial court's finding that Mr. Dawson's former job responsibilities are materially identical to those of state retirees who qualify for its tax exemption.  But, the State submits, Mr. Dawson's former job responsibilities are also similar to those of other state law enforcement retirees who don't qualify for its tax exemption.  And, the State insists, the fact that it treats federal retirees no worse than (some) similarly situated state employees should be enough to save its statute.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this again mistakes the nature of our inquiry.  Under \u00a7111, the relevant question isn't whether federal retirees are similarly situated to state retirees who don't receive a tax benefit; the relevant question is whether they are similarly situated to those who do.  So, for example, in Phillips we compared the class of federal lessees with the favored class of state lessees, even though the State urged us to focus instead on the disfavored class of private lessees.  361 U.\u00a0S., at 381-382.  In Davis, we likewise rejected the State's effort to compare the class of federal retirees with state residents who did not benefit from the tax exemption rather than those who did.  See 489 U.\u00a0S., at 815, n.\u00a04.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point the State is left to play its final card.   Now, it says, maybe the real distinction its statute draws isn't based on former job duties at all.  Maybe its statute actually favors certain state law enforcement retirees only because their pensions are less generous than those of their federal law enforcement counterparts.  At the least, the State suggests, we should remand the case to the West Virginia courts to explore this possibility.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The problem here is fundamental.  While the State was free to draw whatever classifications it wished, the statute it enacted does not classify persons or groups based on the relative generosity of their pension benefits.  Instead, it extends a special tax benefit to retirees who served as West Virginia police officers, firefighters, or deputy sheriffs--and it categorically denies that same benefit to retirees who served in similar federal law enforcement positions.  Even if Mr. Dawson's pension turned out to be identical to a state law enforcement officer's pension, the law as written would deny him a tax exemption.  West Virginia's law thus discriminates \"because of the source of . . . compensation or pay\" in violation of \u00a7111.  Whether the unlawful classification found in the text of a statute might serve as some sort of proxy for a lawful classification hidden behind it is neither here nor there.  No more than a beneficent legislative intent, an implicit but lawful distinction cannot save an express and unlawful one.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our precedent confirms this too.  In Davis, Michigan argued that a state law expressly discriminating between federal and state retirees was really just distinguishing between those with more and less generous pensions.  Id., at 816.  We rejected this attempt to rerationalize the statute, explaining that \"[a] tax exemption truly intended to account for differences in retirement benefits would not discriminate on the basis of the source of those benefits\" but \"would discriminate on the basis of the amount of benefits received by individual retirees.\"  Id., at 817.  The fact is, when States seek to tax the use of a fellow sovereign's property, the Constitution and Congress have always carefully constrained their authority.  Id., at 810-814.  And in this sensitive field it is not too much to ask that, if a State wants to draw a distinction based on the generosity of pension benefits, it enact a law that actually does that.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because West Virginia's statute unlawfully discriminates against Mr. Dawson, we reverse the judgment of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, including the determination of an appropriate remedy.\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n","14":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEMULEX CORPORATION, ET AL., PETITIONERS  v.

The Act instructs a complainant, before commencing a Title VII action in court, to file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission).  \u00a72000e5(e)(1), (f)(1).  On receipt of a charge, the EEOC is to notify the employer and investigate the allegations.  \u00a72000e5(b).  The Commission may \"endeavor to eliminate [the] alleged unlawful employment practice by informal methods of .\u00a0.\u00a0. conciliation.\"  Ibid.  The EEOC also has first option to \"bring a civil action\" against the employer in court.  \u00a72000e5(f)(1).  But the Commission has no authority itself to adjudicate discrimination complaints.  If the EEOC chooses not to sue, and whether or not the EEOC otherwise acts on the charge, a complainant is entitled to a \"right-to-sue\" notice 180 days after the charge is filed.

Davis filed a charge against her employer, petitioner Fort Bend County.  Davis alleged sexual harassment and retaliation for reporting the harassment.  While her EEOC charge was pending, Fort Bend fired Davis because she failed to show up for work on a Sunday and went to a church event instead.  Davis attempted to supplement her EEOC charge by handwriting \"religion\" on a form called an \"intake questionnaire,\" but she did not amend the formal charge document.  Upon receiving a right-to-sue letter, Davis commenced suit in Federal District Court, alleging discrimination on account of religion and retaliation for reporting sexual harassment.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After years of litigation, only the religion-based discrimination claim remained in the case.  Fort Bend then asserted for the first time that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate Davis' case because her EEOC charge did not state a religion-based discrimination claim.  The District Court agreed and granted Fort Bend's motion to dismiss Davis' suit.  On appeal from the dismissal, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed.  Title VII's charge-filing requirement, the Court of Appeals held, is not jurisdictional; instead, the requirement is a prudential prerequisite to suit, forfeited in Davis' case because Fort Bend had waited too long to raise the objection. \nHeld:\u00a0Title VII's charge-filing requirement is not jurisdictional.

Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.\u00a0S. 443, 455.  A claim-processing rule requiring parties to take certain procedural steps in, or prior to, litigation, may be mandatory in the sense that a court must enforce the rule if timely raised.  Eberhart v.

The Act also prohibits retaliation against persons who assert rights under the statute.  \u00a72000e-3(a).  As a precondition to the commencement of a Title VII action in court, a complainant must first file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission).  \u00a72000e-5(e)(1), (f)(1).  The question this case presents: Is Title VII's charge-filing precondition to suit a \"jurisdictional\" requirement that can be raised at any stage of a proceeding; or is it a procedural prescription mandatory if timely raised, but subject to forfeiture if tardily asserted?  We hold that Title VII's charge-filing instruction is not jurisdictional, a term generally reserved to describe the classes of cases a court may entertain (subject-matter jurisdiction) or the persons over whom a court may exercise adjudicatory authority (personal jurisdiction).  Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.\u00a0S. 443, 455 (2004).  Prerequisites to suit like Title VII's charge-filing instruction are not of that character; they are properly ranked among the array of claim-processing rules that must be timely raised to come into play.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Title VII directs that a \"charge .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be filed\" with the EEOC \"by or on behalf of a person claiming to be aggrieved\" within 180 days \"after the alleged unlawful employment practice occur[s].\"  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e-5(b), (e)(1).  For complaints concerning a practice occurring in a State or political subdivision that has a fair employment agency of its own empowered \"to grant or seek relief,\" Title VII instructs the complainant to file her charge first with the state or local agency.  \u00a72000e-5(c).  The complainant then has 300 days following the challenged practice, or 30 days after receiving notice that state or local proceedings have ended, \"whichever is earlier,\" to file a charge with the EEOC.  \u00a72000e-5(e)(1).  If the state or local agency has a \"worksharing\" agreement with the EEOC, a complainant ordinarily need not file separately with federal and state agencies.  She may file her charge with one agency, and that agency will then relay the charge to the other.  See 29 CFR \u00a71601.13 (2018); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the EEOC receives a charge, in contrast to agencies like the National Labor Relations Board, 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7160, and the Merit Systems Protection Board, 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71204, it does not \"adjudicate [the] clai[m],\" Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.\u00a0S. 36, 44 (1974).  Instead, Title VII calls for the following course.  Upon receiving a charge, the EEOC notifies the employer and investigates the allegations.  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e-5(b).  If the Commission finds \"reasonable cause\" to believe the charge is true, the Act instructs the Commission to \"endeavor to eliminate [the] alleged unlawful employment practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion.\"  Ibid.  When informal methods do not resolve the charge, the EEOC has first option to \"bring a civil action\" against the employer in court.  \u00a72000e-5(f)(1).  Where the discrimination charge is lodged against state or local government employers, the Attorney General is the federal authority empowered to commence suit.  Ibid.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event that the EEOC determines there is \"n[o] reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true,\" the Commission is to dismiss the charge and notify the complainant of his or her right to sue in court.  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e-5(b), f(1); 29 CFR \u00a71601.28.  Whether or not the EEOC acts on the charge, a complainant is entitled to a \"right-to-sue\" notice 180 days after the charge is filed.  \u00a72000e-5(f)(1); 29 CFR \u00a71601.28.  And within 90 days following such notice, the complainant may commence a civil action against the allegedly offending employer.  \u00a72000e-5(f)(1).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent Lois M. Davis worked in information technology for petitioner Fort Bend County.  In 2010, she informed Fort Bend's human resources department that the director of information technology, Charles Cook, was sexually harassing her.  Following an investigation by Fort Bend, Cook resigned.  Davis' supervisor at Fort Bend, Kenneth Ford, was well acquainted with Cook.  After Cook resigned, Davis alleges, Ford began retaliating against her for reporting Cook's sexual harassment.  Ford did so, according to Davis, by, inter alia, curtailing her work responsibilities.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seeking redress for the asserted harassment and retaliation, Davis submitted an \"intake questionnaire\" in February 2011, followed by a charge in March 2011.2  While her EEOC charge was pending, Davis was told to report to work on an upcoming Sunday.  Davis informed her supervisor Ford that she had a commitment at church that Sunday, and she offered to arrange for another employee to replace her at work.  Ford responded that if Davis did not show up for the Sunday work, she would be subject to termination.  Davis went to church, not work, that Sunday.  Fort Bend thereupon fired her.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Attempting to supplement the allegations in her charge, Davis handwrote \"religion\" on the \"Employment Harms or Actions\" part of her intake questionnaire, and she checked boxes for \"discharge\" and \"reasonable accommodation\" on that form.  She made no change, however, in the formal charge document.  A few months later, the Department of Justice notified Davis of her right to sue.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In January 2012, Davis commenced a civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleging discrimination on account of religion and retaliation for reporting sexual harassment.3  The District Court granted Fort Bend's motion for summary judgment.  Davis v. Fort Bend County, 2013 WL 5157191 (SD Tex., Sept. 11, 2013).  On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed as to Davis' retaliation claim, but reversed as to her religion-based discrimination claim.  Davis v. Fort Bend County, 765 F.\u00a03d 480 (2014).  Fort Bend filed a petition for certiorari, which this Court denied.  576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the case returned to the District Court on Davis' claim of discrimination on account of religion, Fort Bend moved to dismiss the complaint.  Years into the litigation, Fort Bend asserted for the first time that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate Davis' religion-based discrimination claim because she had not stated such a claim in her EEOC charge.  Granting the motion, the District Court held that Davis had not satisfied the charge-filing requirement with respect to her claim of religion-based discrimination, and that the requirement qualified as \"jurisdictional,\" which made it nonforfeitable.  2016 WL 4479527 (SD Tex., Aug. 24, 2016).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Fifth Circuit reversed.  893 F.\u00a03d 300 (2018).  Title VII's charge-filing requirement, the Court of Appeals held, is not jurisdictional; instead, the requirement is a prudential prerequisite to suit, forfeited in Davis' case because Fort Bend did not raise it until after \"an entire round  of appeals all the way to the Supreme Court.\"  Id., at  307-308.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted Fort Bend's petition for certiorari, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019), to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appeals over whether Title VII's charge-filing requirement is jurisdictional.  Compare, e.g., 893 F.\u00a03d, at 306 (case below) (charge-filing requirement is nonjurisdictional), with, e.g., Jones v. Calvert Group, Ltd., 551 F.\u00a03d 297, 300 (CA4 2009) (federal courts lack subject-matter jurisdiction when the charge-filing requirement is not satisfied).\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Jurisdiction,\" the Court has observed, \"is a word of many, too many, meanings.\"  Kontrick, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 454 (quoting Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.\u00a0S. 83, 90 (1998)).4  In recent years, the Court has undertaken \"[t]o ward off profligate use of the term.\"  Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U.\u00a0S. 145, 153 (2013).  As earlier noted, see supra, at 1, the word \"jurisdictional\" is generally reserved for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases a court may entertain (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the persons over whom the court may exercise adjudicatory authority (personal jurisdiction).  Kontrick, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 455.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress may make other prescriptions jurisdictional by incorporating them into a jurisdictional provision, as Congress has done with the amount-in-controversy requirement for federal-court diversity jurisdiction.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71332(a) (\"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000 .\u00a0.\u00a0. and is between (1) citizens of different States .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\").  In addition, the Court has stated it would treat a requirement as \"jurisdictional\" when \"a long line of [Supreme] Cour[t] decisions left undisturbed by Congress\" attached a jurisdictional label to the prescription.  Union Pacific R.\u00a0Co. v. Locomotive Engineers, 558 U.\u00a0S. 67, 82 (2009) (citing Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.\u00a0S. 205, 209-211 (2007)).  See also John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U.\u00a0S. 130, 132 (2008).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Characterizing a rule as a limit on subject-matter jurisdiction \"renders it unique in our adversarial system.\"  Auburn, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 153.  Unlike most arguments, challenges to subject-matter jurisdiction may be raised by the defendant \"at any point in the litigation,\" and courts must consider them sua\u00a0sponte.  Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.\u00a0S. 134, 141 (2012).  \"[H]arsh consequences\" attend the jurisdictional brand.  United States v. Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U.\u00a0S. 402, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 6).  \"Tardy jurisdictional objections\" occasion wasted court resources and \"disturbingly disarm litigants.\"  Auburn, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 153.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has therefore stressed the distinction between jurisdictional prescriptions and nonjurisdictional claim-processing rules, which \"seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring that the parties take certain procedural steps at certain specified times.\"  Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.\u00a0S. 428, 435 (2011).  A claim-processing rule may be \"mandatory\" in the sense that a court must enforce the rule if a party \"properly raise[s]\" it.  Eberhart v. United States, 546 U.\u00a0S. 12, 19 (2005) (per curiam).  But an objection based on a mandatory claim-processing rule may be forfeited \"if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.\"  Id., at 15 (quoting Kontrick, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 456).5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has characterized as nonjurisdictional an array of mandatory claim-processing rules and other preconditions to relief.  These include: the Copyright Act's requirement that parties register their copyrights (or receive a denial of registration from the Copyright Register) before commencing an infringement action, Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U.\u00a0S. 154, 157, 163-164 (2010); the Railway Labor Act's direction that, before arbitrating, parties to certain railroad labor disputes \"attempt settlement 'in conference,'\u00a0\" Union Pacific, 558 U.\u00a0S., at 82 (quoting 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7152); the Clean Air Act's instruction that, to maintain an objection in court on certain issues, one must first raise the objection \"with reasonable specificity\" during agency rulemaking, EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L.\u00a0P., 572 U.\u00a0S. 489, 511-512 (2014) (quoting 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77607(d)(7)(B)); the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act's requirement that a certificate of appealability \"indicate [the] specific issue\" warranting issuance of the certificate, Gonzalez, 565 U.\u00a0S., at 137 (quoting 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72253(c)(3)); Title VII's limitation of covered \"employer[s]\" to those with 15 or more employees, Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.\u00a0S. 500, 503-504 (2006) (quoting 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e(b)); Title VII's time limit for filing a charge with the EEOC, Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.\u00a0S. 385, 393 (1982); and several other time prescriptions for procedural steps in judicial or agency forums.  See, e.g., Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Servs. of Chicago, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 1); Musacchio v. United States, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 8); Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9); Auburn, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 149; Henderson, 562 U.\u00a0S., at 431; Eberhart, 546 U.\u00a0S., at 13; Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U.\u00a0S. 401, 414 (2004); Kontrick, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 447.6\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While not demanding that Congress \"incant magic words\" to render a prescription jurisdictional, Auburn, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 153, the Court has clarified that it would \"leave the ball in Congress' court\": \"If the Legislature clearly states that a [prescription] count[s] as jurisdictional, then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue[;] [b]ut when Congress does not rank a [prescription] as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.\"  Arbaugh, 546 U.\u00a0S., at 515-516 (footnote and citation omitted).\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Title VII's charge-filing requirement is not of jurisdictional cast.  Federal courts exercise jurisdiction over Title VII actions pursuant to 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331's grant of general federal-question jurisdiction, and Title VII's own jurisdictional provision, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e-5(f)(3) (giving federal courts \"jurisdiction [over] actions brought under this subchapter\").7  Separate provisions of Title VII, \u00a72000e-5(e)(1) and (f)(1), contain the Act's charge-filing requirement.  Those provisions \"d[o] not speak to a court's authority,\" EME Homer, 572 U.\u00a0S., at 512, or \"refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts,\" Arbaugh, 546 U.\u00a0S., at 515 (quoting Zipes, 455 U.\u00a0S., at 394).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead, Title VII's charge-filing provisions \"speak to .\u00a0.\u00a0. a party's procedural obligations.\"  EME Homer, 572 U.\u00a0S., at 512.  They require complainants to submit information to the EEOC and to wait a specified period before commencing a civil action.  Like kindred provisions directing parties to raise objections in agency rulemaking, id., at 511-512; follow procedures governing copyright registration, Reed Elsevier, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 157; or attempt settlement, Union Pacific, 558 U.\u00a0S., at 82, Title VII's charge-filing requirement is a processing rule, albeit a mandatory one, not a jurisdictional prescription delineating the adjudicatory authority of courts.8\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resisting this conclusion, Fort Bend points to statutory schemes that channel certain claims to administrative agency adjudication first, followed by judicial review in a federal court.  In Elgin v. Department of Treasury, 567 U.\u00a0S. 1 (2012), for example, the Court held that claims earmarked for initial adjudication by the Merit Systems Protection Board, then review in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, may not proceed instead in federal district court.  Id., at 5-6, 8.  See also Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.\u00a0S. 200, 202-204 (1994) (no district court jurisdiction over claims assigned in the first instance to a mine safety commission, whose decisions are reviewable in a court of appeals).  Nowhere do these cases, or others cited by Fort Bend, address the issue here presented: whether a precondition to suit is a mandatory claim-processing rule subject to forfeiture, or a jurisdictional prescription.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fort Bend further maintains that \"[t]he congressional purposes embodied in the Title VII scheme,\" notably, encouraging conciliation and affording the EEOC first option to bring suit, support jurisdictional characterization of the charge-filing requirement.  Brief for Petitioner 27.  But a prescription does not become jurisdictional whenever it \"promotes important congressional objectives.\"  Reed Elsevier, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 169, n.\u00a09.  And recognizing that the charge-filing requirement is nonjurisdictional gives plaintiffs scant incentive to skirt the instruction.  Defendants, after all, have good reason promptly to raise an objection that may rid them of the lawsuit filed against them.  A Title VII complainant would be foolhardy consciously to take the risk that the employer would forgo a potentially dispositive defense.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, a rule may be mandatory without being jurisdictional, and Title VII's charge-filing requirement fits that bill.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is\nAffirmed.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0A different provision of Title VII, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e16, prohibits employment discrimination by the Federal Government and sets out procedures applicable to claims by federal employees.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Davis submitted these documents to the Texas Workforce Commission.  Complaints lodged with that commission are relayed to the EEOC, under a \"worksharing\" agreement between the two agencies.  See How To Submit an Employment Discrimination Complaint, Texas Workforce Commission, https:\/\/twc.texas.gov\/jobseekers\/how-submit-employment-discrimination-complaint (as last visited May 30, 2019).\nFootnote 3\u00a0Davis also alleged intentional infliction of emotional distress, but she did not appeal the District Court's grant of summary judgment to Fort Bend on that claim.\nFootnote 4\u00a0\"Courts, including this Court, .\u00a0.\u00a0. have more than occasionally [mis]used the term 'jurisdictional'\u00a0\" to refer to nonjurisdictional prescriptions.  Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U.\u00a0S. 401, 413 (2004) (quoting Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.\u00a0S. 443, 454 (2004) (alterations in original)).  Passing references to Title VII's charge-filing requirement as \"jurisdictional\" in prior Court opinions, see, e.g., McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.\u00a0S. 792, 798 (1973), display the terminology employed when the Court's use of \"jurisdictional\" was \"less than meticulous,\" Kontrick, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 454.\nFootnote 5\u00a0The Court has \"reserved whether mandatory claim-processing rules may [ever] be subject to equitable exceptions.\"  Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Servs. of Chicago, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n.\u00a03 (2017) (slip op., at 3, n.\u00a03).\nFootnote 6\u00a0\"If a time prescription governing the transfer of adjudicatory authority from one Article III court to another appears in a statute, the limitation [will rank as] jurisdictional; otherwise, the time specification fits within the claim-processing category.\"  Hamer, 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (citation omitted).\nFootnote 7\u00a0When Title VII was passed in 1964, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331's grant of general federal-question jurisdiction included an amount-in-controversy requirement.  See \u00a71331(a) (1964 ed.).  To ensure that this \"limitation would not impede an employment-discrimination complainant's access to a federal forum,\" Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.\u00a0S. 500, 505 (2006), Congress enacted Title VII's jurisdiction-conferring provision, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e5(f\u00a0)(3).  See Arbaugh, 546 U.\u00a0S., at 505506.  In 1980, Congress eliminated \u00a71331's amount-in-controversy requirement.  See Federal Question Jurisdictional Amendments Act of 1980, \u00a72, 94 Stat. 2369.  Since then, \"Title VII's own jurisdictional provision, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e5(f\u00a0)(3), has served simply to underscore Congress' intention to provide a federal forum for the adjudication of Title VII claims.\"  Arbaugh, 546 U.\u00a0S., at 506.  Title VII also contains a separate jurisdictional provision, \u00a72000e6(b), giving federal courts jurisdiction over actions by the Federal Government to enjoin \"pattern or practice\" discrimination.\nFootnote 8\u00a0Fort Bend argues that Title VII's charge-filing requirement is jurisdictional because it is \"textually linked\" to Title VII's jurisdictional provision.  Brief for Petitioner 50.  Title VII states in 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e5(f\u00a0)(1) that \"a civil action may be brought\" after the charge-filing procedures are followed.  Section 2000e5(f\u00a0)(3) gives federal courts jurisdiction over \"actions brought under this subchapter,\" a subchapter that includes \u00a72000e5(f\u00a0)(1).  Therefore, Fort Bend insists, federal jurisdiction lies under \u00a72000e5(f\u00a0)(3) only when a proper EEOC charge is filed.  But as just observed, see supra, at 9, the charge-filing requirement is stated in provisions discrete from Title VII's conferral of jurisdiction on federal courts.  See Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U.\u00a0S. 145, 155 (2013) (a requirement \"does not become jurisdictional simply because it is placed in a section of a statute that also contains jurisdictional provisions\"); Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.\u00a0S. 134, 145 (2012) (a nonjurisdictional provision does not metamorphose into a jurisdictional limitation by cross-referencing a jurisdictional provision).\n\n\n","16":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFOURTH ESTATE PUBLIC BENEFIT CORP. v. WALL-STREET.COM, LLC, ET AL.(2019)\nNo. 17-571\nArgued: January 8, 2019Decided: March 4, 2019\n\n\nPetitioner Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corporation (Fourth Estate), a news organization, licensed works to respondent Wall-Street.com, LLC (Wall-Street), a news website.  Fourth Estate sued Wall-Street and its owner for copyright infringement of news articles that Wall-Street failed to remove from its website after canceling the parties' license agreement.  Fourth Estate had filed applications to register the articles with the Copyright Office, but the Register of Copyrights had not acted on those applications.  Title 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7411(a) states that \"no civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United States work shall be instituted until .\u00a0.\u00a0. registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title.\"  The District Court dismissed the complaint, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that \"registration .\u00a0.\u00a0. has [not] been made\" under \u00a7411(a) until the Copyright Office registers a copyright. \nHeld:\u00a0Registration occurs, and a copyright claimant may commence an infringement suit, when the Copyright Office registers a copyright.  Upon registration of the copyright, however, a copyright owner can recover for infringement that occurred both before and after registration.  Pp.\u00a03-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Under the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended, a copyright author gains \"exclusive rights\" in her work immediately upon the work's creation.  17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7106.  A copyright owner may institute a civil action for infringement of those exclusive rights, \u00a7501(b), but generally only after complying with \u00a7411(a)'s requirement that \"registration .\u00a0.\u00a0. has been made.\"  Registration is thus akin to an administrative exhaustion requirement that the owner must satisfy before suing to enforce ownership rights.  P.\u00a03.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0In limited circumstances, copyright owners may file an infringement suit before undertaking registration.  For example, a copyright owner who is preparing to distribute a work of a type vulnerable to predistribution infringement--e.g., a movie or musical  composition--may apply to the Copyright Office for preregistration.  \u00a7408(f)(2).  A copyright owner may also sue for infringement of a live broadcast before \"registration . . . has been made.\"  \u00a7411(c).  Outside of statutory exceptions not applicable here, however, \u00a7411(a) bars a copyright owner from suing for infringement until \"registration .\u00a0.\u00a0. has been made.\"  Fourth Estate advances the \"application approach\" to this provision, arguing that registration occurs when a copyright owner submits a proper application for registration.  Wall-Street advocates the \"registration approach,\" urging that registration occurs only when the Copyright Office grants registration of a copyright.  The registration approach reflects the only satisfactory reading of \u00a7411(a)'s text.  Pp.\u00a03-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1)\u00a0Read together, \u00a7411(a)'s first two sentences focus on action by the Copyright Office--namely, its registration or refusal to register a copyright claim.  If application alone sufficed to \"ma[ke]\" registration, \u00a7411(a)'s second sentence--which permits a copyright claimant to file suit when the Register has refused her application--would be superfluous.  Similarly, \u00a7411(a)'s third sentence--which allows the Register to \"become a party to the action with respect to the issue of registrability of the copyright claim\"--would be negated if an infringement suit could be filed and resolved before the Register acted on an application.  The registration approach reading of \u00a7411(a) is supported by other provisions of the Copyright Act.  In particular, \u00a7410 confirms that application is discrete from, and precedes, registration, while \u00a7408(f)'s preregistration option would have little utility if a completed application sufficed to make registration.  Pp.\u00a04-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2)\u00a0Fourth Estate primarily contends that the Copyright Act uses the phrases \"make registration\" and \"registration has been made\" to describe submissions by the copyright owner.  Fourth Estate therefore insists that \u00a7411(a)'s requirement that \"registration .\u00a0.\u00a0. has been made in accordance with this title\" most likely refers to a copyright owner's compliance with statutory requirements for registration applications.  Fourth Estate points to other Copyright Act provisions that appear to use the phrase \"make registration\" or one of its variants to describe what a copyright claimant does.  Fourth Estate acknowledges, however, that determining how the Copyright Act uses the word \"registration\" in a particular provision requires examining the \"specific context\" in which the term is used.  The \"specific context\" of \u00a7411(a) permits only one sensible reading: The phrase \"registration .\u00a0.\u00a0. has been made\" refers to the Copyright Office's act granting registration, not to the copyright claimant's request for registration.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth Estate's contrary reading stems in part from its misapprehension of the significance of certain 1976 revisions to the Copyright Act.  But in enacting \u00a7411(a), Congress both reaffirmed the general rule that registration must precede an infringement suit and added an exception in that provision's second sentence to cover instances in which registration is refused.  That exception would have no work to do if Congress intended the 1976 revisions to clarify that a copyright claimant may sue immediately upon applying for registration.  Noteworthy, too, in years following the 1976 revisions, Congress resisted efforts to eliminate \u00a7411(a), which contains the registration requirement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth Estate also argues that, because \"registration is not a condition of copyright protection,\" \u00a7408(a), \u00a7411(a) should not bar a copyright claimant from enforcing that protection in court once she has applied for registration.  But the Copyright Act safeguards copyright owners by vesting them with exclusive rights upon creation of their works and prohibiting infringement from that point forward.  To recover for such infringement, copyright owners must simply apply for registration and await the Register's decision.  Further, Congress has authorized preregistration infringement suits with respect to works vulnerable to predistribution infringement, and Fourth Estate's fear that a copyright owner might lose the ability to enforce her rights entirely is overstated.  True, registration processing times have increased from one to two weeks in 1956 to many months today.  Delays, in large part, are the result of Copyright Office staffing and budgetary shortages that Congress can alleviate, but courts cannot cure.  Unfortunate as the current administrative lag may be, that factor does not allow this Court to revise \u00a7411(a)'s congressionally composed text.

WALL-STREET.COM, LLC, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\n[March 4, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Impelling prompt registration of copyright claims, 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7411(a) states that \"no civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United States work shall be instituted until .\u00a0.\u00a0. registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title.\"  The question this case presents: Has \"registration .\u00a0.\u00a0. been made in accordance with [Title 17]\" as soon as the claimant delivers the required application, copies of the work, and fee to the Copyright Office; or has \"registration .\u00a0.\u00a0. been made\" only after the Copyright Office reviews and registers the copyright?  We hold, in accord with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, that registration occurs, and a copyright claimant may commence an infringement suit, when the Copyright Office registers a copyright.  Upon registration of the copyright, however, a copyright owner can recover for infringement that occurred both before and after registration.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corporation (Fourth Estate) is a news organization producing online journalism.  Fourth Estate licensed journalism works to respondent Wall-Street.com, LLC (Wall-Street), a news website.  The license agreement required Wall-Street to remove from its website all content produced by Fourth Estate before canceling the agreement.  Wall-Street canceled, but continued to display articles produced by Fourth Estate.  Fourth Estate sued Wall-Street and its owner, Jerrold Burden, for copyright infringement.  The complaint alleged that Fourth Estate had filed \"applications to register [the] articles [licensed to Wall-Street] with the Register of Copyrights.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a.1   Because the Register had not yet acted on Fourth Estate's applications,2 the District Court, on Wall-Street and Burden's motion, dismissed the complaint, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  856 F.\u00a03d 1338 (2017).  Thereafter, the Register of Copyrights refused registration of the articles Wall-Street had allegedly infringed.3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted Fourth Estate's petition for certiorari to resolve a division among U.\u00a0S. Courts of Appeals on when registration occurs in accordance with \u00a7411(a).  585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).  Compare, e.g., 856 F.\u00a03d, at 1341 (case below) (registration has been made under \u00a7411(a) when the Register of Copyrights registers a copyright), with, e.g., Cosmetic Ideas, Inc. v. IAC\/Interactivecorp, 606 F.\u00a03d 612, 621 (CA9 2010) (registration has been made under \u00a7411(a) when the copyright claimant's \"complete application\" for registration is received by the Copyright Office).\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended, copyright protection attaches to \"original works of authorship\"--prominent among them, literary, musical, and dramatic works--\"fixed in any tangible medium of expression.\"  17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7102(a).  An author gains \"exclusive rights\" in her work immediately upon the work's creation, including rights of reproduction, distribution, and display.  See \u00a7106; Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.\u00a0S. 186, 195 (2003) (\"[F]ederal copyright protection .\u00a0.\u00a0. run[s] from the work's creation.\").  The Copyright Act entitles a copyright owner to institute a civil action for infringement of those exclusive rights.  \u00a7501(b).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before pursuing an infringement claim in court, however, a copyright claimant generally must comply with \u00a7411(a)'s requirement that \"registration of the copyright claim has been made.\"  \u00a7411(a).  Therefore, although an owner's rights exist apart from registration, see \u00a7408(a), registration is akin to an administrative exhaustion requirement that the owner must satisfy before suing to enforce ownership rights, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 35.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In limited circumstances, copyright owners may file an infringement suit before undertaking registration.  If a copyright owner is preparing to distribute a work of a type vulnerable to predistribution infringement--notably, a movie or musical composition--the owner may apply for preregistration.  \u00a7408(f)(2); 37 CFR \u00a7202.16(b)(1) (2018).  The Copyright Office will \"conduct a limited review\" of the application and notify the claimant \"[u]pon completion of the preregistration.\"  \u00a7202.16(c)(7), (c)(10).  Once \"preregistration .\u00a0.\u00a0. has been made,\" the copyright claimant may institute a suit for infringement.  17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7411(a).  Preregistration, however, serves only as \"a preliminary step prior to a full registration.\"  Preregistration of Certain Unpublished Copyright Claims, 70 Fed. Reg. 42286 (2005).  An infringement suit brought in reliance on preregistration risks dismissal unless the copyright owner applies for registration promptly after the preregistered work's publication or infringement.  \u00a7408(f)(3)-(4).  A copyright owner may also sue for infringement of a live broadcast before \"registration .\u00a0.\u00a0. has been made,\" but faces dismissal of her suit if she fails to \"make registration for the work\" within three months of its first transmission.  \u00a7411(c).  Even in these exceptional scenarios, then, the copyright owner must eventually pursue registration in order to maintain a suit for infringement.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All parties agree that, outside of statutory exceptions not applicable here, \u00a7411(a) bars a copyright owner from suing for infringement until \"registration .\u00a0.\u00a0. has been made.\"  Fourth Estate and Wall-Street dispute, however, whether \"registration .\u00a0.\u00a0. has been made\" under \u00a7411(a) when a copyright owner submits the application, materials, and fee required for registration, or only when the Copyright Office grants registration.  Fourth Estate advances the former view--the \"application approach\"--while Wall-Street urges the latter reading--the \"registration approach.\"  The registration approach, we conclude, reflects the only satisfactory reading of \u00a7411(a)'s text.  We therefore reject Fourth Estate's application approach.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under \u00a7411(a), \"registration .\u00a0.\u00a0. has been made,\" and a copyright owner may sue for infringement, when the Copyright Office registers a copyright.4  Section 411(a)'s first sentence provides that no civil infringement action \"shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been made.\"  The section's next sentence sets out an exception to this rule: When the required \"deposit, application, and fee .\u00a0.\u00a0. have been delivered to the Copyright Office in proper form and registration has been refused,\" the claimant \"[may] institute a civil action, if notice thereof .\u00a0.\u00a0. is served on the Register.\"  Read together, \u00a7411(a)'s opening sentences focus not on the claimant's act of applying for registration, but on action by the Copyright Office--namely, its registration or refusal to register a copyright claim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If application alone sufficed to \"ma[ke]\" registration, \u00a7411(a)'s second sentence--allowing suit upon refusal of registration--would be superfluous.  What utility would that allowance have if a copyright claimant could sue for infringement immediately after applying for registration without awaiting the Register's decision on her application? Proponents of the application approach urge that \u00a7411(a)'s second sentence serves merely to require a copyright claimant to serve \"notice [of an infringement suit] .\u00a0.\u00a0. on the Register.\"  See Brief for Petitioner 29-32.  This reading, however, requires the implausible assumption that Congress gave \"registration\" different meanings in consecutive, related sentences within a single statutory provision.  In \u00a7411(a)'s first sentence, \"registration\" would mean the claimant's act of filing an application, while in the section's second sentence, \"registration\" would entail the Register's review of an application.  We resist this improbable construction.  See, e.g., Mid-Con Freight Systems, Inc. v. Michigan Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 545 U.\u00a0S. 440, 448 (2005) (declining to read \"the same words\" in consecutive sentences as \"refer[ring] to something totally different\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The third and final sentence of \u00a7411(a) further persuades us that the provision requires action by the Register before a copyright claimant may sue for infringement.  The sentence allows the Register to \"become a party to the action with respect to the issue of registrability of the copyright claim.\"  This allowance would be negated, and the court conducting an infringement suit would lack the benefit of the Register's assessment, if an infringement suit could be filed and resolved before the Register acted on an application.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other provisions of the Copyright Act support our reading of \"registration,\" as used in \u00a7411(a), to mean action by the Register.  Section 410 states that, \"after examination,\" if the Register determines that \"the material deposited constitutes copyrightable subject matter\" and \"other legal and formal requirements .\u00a0.\u00a0. [are] met, the Register shall register the claim and issue to the applicant a certificate of registration.\"  \u00a7410(a).  But if the Register determines that the deposited material \"does not constitute copyrightable subject matter or that the claim is invalid for any other reason, the Register shall refuse registration.\"  \u00a7410(b).  Section 410 thus confirms that application is discrete from, and precedes, registration.  Section 410(d), furthermore, provides that if the Copyright Office registers a claim, or if a court later determines that a refused claim was registrable, the \"effective date of [the work's] copyright registration is the day on which\" the copyright owner made a proper submission to the Copyright Office.  There would be no need thus to specify the \"effective date of a copyright registration\" if submission of the required materials qualified as \"registration.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 408(f)'s preregistration option, too, would have little utility if a completed application constituted registration.  Preregistration, as noted supra, at 3-4, allows the author of a work vulnerable to predistribution infringement to enforce her exclusive rights in court before obtaining registration or refusal thereof.  A copyright owner who fears prepublication infringement would have no reason to apply for preregistration, however, if she could instead simply complete an application for registration and immediately commence an infringement suit.  Cf. TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.\u00a0S. 19, 29 (2001) (rejecting an interpretation that \"would in practical effect render [a provision] superfluous in all but the most unusual circumstances\").\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Challenging the Eleventh Circuit's judgment, Fourth Estate primarily contends that the Copyright Act uses \"the phrase 'make registration' and its passive-voice counterpart 'registration has been made'\u00a0\" to describe submissions by the copyright owner, rather than Copyright Office responses to those submissions.  Brief for Petitioner 21.  Section 411(a)'s requirement that \"registration .\u00a0.\u00a0. has been made in accordance with this title,\" Fourth Estate insists, most likely refers to a copyright owner's compliance with the statutory specifications for registration applications.  In support, Fourth Estate points to Copyright Act provisions that appear to use the phrase \"make registration\" or one of its variants to describe what a copyright claimant does.  See id., at 22-26 (citing 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7110, 205(c), 408(c)(3), 411(c), 412(2)).  Furthermore, Fourth Estate urges that its reading reflects the reality that, eventually, the vast majority of applications are granted.  See Brief for Petitioner 41.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth Estate acknowledges, however, that the Copyright Act sometimes uses \"registration\" to refer to activity by the Copyright Office, not activity undertaken by a copyright claimant.  See id., at 27-28 (citing 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7708(a)).  Fourth Estate thus agrees that, to determine how the statute uses the word \"registration\" in a particular prescription, one must \"look to the specific context\" in which the term is used.  Brief for Petitioner 29.  As explained supra, at 4-7, the \"specific context\" of \u00a7411(a) permits only one sensible reading: The phrase \"registration .\u00a0.\u00a0. has been made\" refers to the Copyright Office's act granting registration, not to the copyright claimant's request for registration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth Estate's contrary reading of \u00a7411(a) stems in part from its misapprehension of the significance of certain 1976 revisions to the Copyright Act.  Before that year, \u00a7411(a)'s precursor provided that \"[n]o action or proceeding shall be maintained for infringement of copyright in any work until the provisions of this title with respect to the deposit of copies and registration of such work shall have been complied with.\"  17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a713 (1970 ed.).  Fourth Estate urges that this provision posed the very question we resolve today--namely, whether a claimant's application alone effects registration.  The Second Circuit addressed that question, Fourth Estate observes, in Vacheron & Constantin-Le Coultre Watches, Inc. v. Benrus Watch Co., 260 F.\u00a02d 637 (1958).  Brief for Petitioner 32-34.  In that case, in an opinion by Judge Learned Hand, the court held that a copyright owner who completed an application could not sue for infringement immediately upon the Copyright Office's refusal to register.  Vacheron, 260 F.\u00a03d, at 640-641. Instead, the owner first had to obtain a registration certificate by bringing a mandamus action against the Register.  The Second Circuit dissenter would have treated the owner's application as sufficient to permit commencement of an action for infringement.  Id., at 645.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth Estate sees Congress' 1976 revision of the registration requirement as an endorsement of the Vacheron dissenter's position.  Brief for Petitioner 34-36.  We disagree.  The changes made in 1976 instead indicate Congress' agreement with Judge Hand that it is the Register's action that triggers a copyright owner's entitlement to sue.  In enacting 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7411(a), Congress both reaffirmed the general rule that registration must precede an infringement suit, and added an exception in that provision's second sentence to cover instances in which registration is refused.  See H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 941476, p. 157 (1976).  That exception would have no work to do if, as Fourth Estate urges, Congress intended the 1976 revisions to clarify that a copyright claimant may sue immediately upon applying for registration.  A copyright claimant would need no statutory authorization to sue after refusal of her application if she could institute suit as soon as she has filed the application.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Noteworthy, too, in years following the 1976 revisions, Congress resisted efforts to eliminate \u00a7411(a) and the registration requirement embedded in it.  In 1988, Congress removed foreign works from \u00a7411(a)'s dominion in order to comply with the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works' bar on copyright formalities for such works.  See \u00a79(b)(1), 102 Stat. 2859.  Despite proposals to repeal \u00a7411(a)'s registration requirement entirely, however, see S.\u00a0Rep. No. 100352, p. 36 (1988), Congress maintained the requirement for domestic works, see \u00a7411(a).  Subsequently, in 1993, Congress considered, but declined to adopt, a proposal to allow suit immediately upon submission of a registration application.  See H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 103-338, p.\u00a04 (1993).  And in 2005, Congress made a preregistration option available for works vulnerable to predistribution infringement.  See Artists' Rights and Theft Prevention Act of 2005, \u00a7104, 119 Stat. 221.  See also supra, at 3-4.  Congress chose that course in face of calls to eliminate registration in cases of predistribution infringement.  70 Fed. Reg. 42286.  Time and again, then, Congress has maintained registration as prerequisite to suit, and rejected proposals that would have eliminated registration or tied it to the copyright claimant's application instead of the Register's action.5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth Estate additionally argues that, as \"registration is not a condition of copyright protection,\" 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7408(a), \u00a7411(a) should not be read to bar a copyright claimant from enforcing that protection in court once she has submitted a proper application for registration.  Brief for Petitioner 37.  But as explained supra, at 3, the Copyright Act safeguards copyright owners, irrespective of registration, by vesting them with exclusive rights upon creation of their works and prohibiting infringement from that point forward.  If infringement occurs before a copyright owner applies for registration, that owner may eventually recover damages for the past infringement, as well as the infringer's profits.  \u00a7504.  She must simply apply for registration and receive the Copyright Office's decision on her application before instituting suit.  Once the Register grants or refuses registration, the copyright owner may also seek an injunction barring the infringer from continued violation of her exclusive rights and an order requiring the infringer to destroy infringing materials.  \u00a7\u00a7502, 503(b).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth Estate maintains, however, that if infringement occurs while the Copyright Office is reviewing a registration application, the registration approach will deprive the owner of her rights during the waiting period.  Brief for Petitioner 41.  See also 1 P. Goldstein, Copyright \u00a73.15, p.\u00a03:154.2 (3d ed. 2018 Supp.) (finding application approach \"the better rule\"); 2 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Copyright \u00a77.16[B][3][a], [b][ii] (2018) (infringement suit is conditioned on application, while prima facie presumption of validity depends on certificate of registration).  The Copyright Act's explicit carveouts from \u00a7411(a)'s general registration rule, however, show that Congress adverted to this concern.  In the preregistration option, \u00a7408(f\u00a0), Congress provided that owners of works especially susceptible to prepublication infringement should be allowed to institute suit before the Register has granted or refused registration.  See \u00a7411(a).  Congress made the same determination as to live broadcasts.  \u00a7411(c); see supra, at 4.6  As to all other works, however, \u00a7411(a)'s general rule requires owners to await action by the Register before filing suit for infringement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth Estate raises the specter that a copyright owner may lose the ability to enforce her rights if the Copyright Act's three-year statute of limitations runs out before the Copyright Office acts on her application for registration.  Brief for Petitioner 41.  Fourth Estate's fear is overstated, as the average processing time for registration applications is currently seven months, leaving ample time to sue after the Register's decision, even for infringement that began before submission of an application.  See U.\u00a0S. Copyright Office, Registration Processing Times (Oct. 2, 2018) (Registration Processing Times), https:\/\/www.copyright.gov\/ registration\/docs\/processing-times-faqs.pdf (as last visited Mar. 1, 2019).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0True, the statutory scheme has not worked as Congress likely envisioned.  Registration processing times have increased from one or two weeks in 1956 to many months today.  See GAO, Improving Productivity in Copyright Registration 3 (GAO-AFMD-83-13 1982); Registration Processing Times.  Delays in Copyright Office processing of applications, it appears, are attributable, in large measure, to staffing and budgetary shortages that Congress can alleviate, but courts cannot cure.  See 5 W. Patry, Copyright \u00a717:83 (2019).  Unfortunate as the current administrative lag may be, that factor does not allow us to revise \u00a7411(a)'s congressionally composed text.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated, we conclude that \"registration .\u00a0.\u00a0. has been made\" within the meaning of 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7411(a) not when an application for registration is filed, but when the Register has registered a copyright after examining a properly filed application.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is accordingly\nAffirmed.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The Register of Copyrights is the \"director of the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress\" and is appointed by the Librarian of Congress.  17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7701(a).

In any case, however, where the deposit, application, and fee required for registration have been delivered to the Copyright Office in proper form and registration has been refused, the applicant is entitled to institute a civil action for infringement if notice thereof, with a copy of the complaint, is served on the Register of Copyrights.  The Register may, at his or her option, become a party to the action with respect to the issue of registrability of the copyright claim .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"\nFootnote 5\u00a0Fourth Estate asserts that, if a copyright owner encounters a lengthy delay in the Copyright Office, she may be forced to file a mandamus action to compel the Register to rule on her application, the very problem exposed in Vacheron & Constantin-Le Coultre Watches, Inc. v. Benrus Watch Co., 260 F. 2d 637 (CA2 1958), see supra, at 8.  But Congress' answer to Vacheron, codified in \u00a7411(a)'s second sentence, was to permit an infringement suit upon refusal of registration, not to eliminate Copyright Office action as the trigger for an infringement suit.\nFootnote 6\u00a0Further, in addition to the Act's provisions for preregistration suit, the Copyright Office allows copyright claimants to seek expedited processing of a claim for an additional $800 fee.  See U.\u00a0S. Copyright Office, Special Handling: Circular No. 10, pp. 1-2 (2017).

The Nevada Supreme Court rejected the Board's argument that the Full Faith and Credit Clause required Nevada courts to apply California law and immunize the Board from liability.  The court held instead that general principles of comity entitled the Board only to the same immunity that Nevada law afforded Nevada agencies.  This Court affirmed, holding that the Full Faith and Credit Clause did not prohibit Nevada from applying its own immunity law.  On remand, the Nevada Supreme Court declined to apply a cap on tort liability applicable to Nevada state agencies.  This Court reversed, holding that the Full Faith and Credit Clause required Nevada courts to grant the Board the same immunity that Nevada agencies enjoy.  The Court was equally divided, however, on whether to overrule Nevada v. Hall, 440 U.\u00a0S. 410, which held that the Constitution does not bar suits brought by an individual against a State in the courts of another State.  On remand, the Nevada Supreme Court instructed the trial court to enter damages in accordance with Nevada's statutory cap.

The Court concluded that the Founders assumed that \"prevailing notions of comity would provide adequate protection against the unlikely prospect of an attempt by the courts of one State to assert jurisdiction over another.\"  Id., at 419.  The Court's view rested primarily on the idea that the States maintained sovereign immunity vis-\u00e0-vis each other in the same way that foreign nations do.  Pp.\u00a04-5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Hall's determination misreads the historical record and misapprehends the constitutional design created by the Framers.  Although the Constitution assumes that the States retain their sovereign immunity except as otherwise provided, it also fundamentally adjusts the States' relationship with each other and curtails the States' ability, as sovereigns, to decline to recognize each other's immunity in their own courts.  Pp.\u00a05-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1)\u00a0At the time of the founding, it was well settled that States were immune from suit both under the common law and under the law of nations.  The States retained these aspects of sovereignty, \"except as altered by the plan of the Convention or certain constitutional Amendments.\"  Alden v. Maine, 527 U.\u00a0S. 706, 713.  Pp.\u00a06-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2)\u00a0Article III abrogated certain aspects of the States' traditional immunity by providing a neutral federal forum in which the States agreed to be amenable to suits brought by other States.  And in ratifying the Constitution, the States similarly surrendered a portion of their immunity by consenting to suits brought against them by the United States in federal courts.  When this Court held in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, that Article III extended the federal judicial power over controversies between a State and citizens of another State, Congress and the States acted swiftly to draft and ratify the Eleventh Amendment, which confirms that the Constitution was not meant to \"rais[e] up\" any suits against the States that were \"anomalous and unheard of when the Constitution was adopted,\" Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.\u00a0S. 1, 18.  The \"natural inference\" from the Amendment's speedy adoption is that \"the Constitution was understood, in light of its history and structure, to preserve the States' traditional immunity from private suits.\"  Alden, supra, at 723-724.  This view of the States' sovereign immunity accorded with the understanding of the Constitution by its leading advocates, including Hamilton, Madison, and Marshall, when it was ratified.  Pp.\u00a09-12.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(3)\u00a0 State sovereign immunity in another State's courts is integral to the structure of the Constitution.  The problem with Hyatt's argument--that interstate sovereign immunity exists only as a matter of comity and can be disregarded by the forum State--is that the Constitution affirmatively altered the relationships between the States so that they no longer relate to each other as true foreign sovereigns.  Numerous provisions reflect this reality.  Article I divests the States of the traditional diplomatic and military tools that foreign sovereigns possess.  And Article IV imposes duties on the States not required by international law.  The Constitution also reflects alterations to the States' relationships with each other, confirming that they are no longer fully independent nations free to disregard each other's sovereignty.  See New Hampshire v. Louisiana, 108 U.\u00a0S. 76, 90.  Hyatt's argument is precisely the type of \"ahistorical literalism\" this Court has rejected when \"interpreting the scope of the States' sovereign immunity since the discredited decision in Chisholm.\"  Alden, supra, at 730.  Moreover, his argument proves too much.  Many constitutional doctrines not spelled out in the Constitution are nevertheless implicit in its structure and supported by historical practice, e.g., judicial review, Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176-180.  Pp.\u00a012-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Stare decisis is \"\u00a0'not an inexorable command,'\u00a0\" Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.\u00a0S. 223, 233, and is \"at its weakest\" when interpreting the Constitution, Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.\u00a0S. 203, 235.  The Court's precedents identify, as relevant here, four factors to consider: the quality of the decision's reasoning, its consistency with related decisions, legal developments since the decision, and reliance on the decision.  See Janus v. State, County, and Municipal Employees, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___.  The first three factors support overruling Hall.  As to the fourth, case-specific reliance interests are not sufficient to persuade this Court to adhere to an incorrect resolution of an important constitutional question.

GILBERT P. HYATT\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of nevada\n[May 13, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case, now before us for the third time, requires us to decide whether the Constitution permits a State to be sued by a private party without its consent in the courts of a different State.  We hold that it does not and overrule our decision to the contrary in Nevada v. Hall, 440 U.\u00a0S. 410 (1979).\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the early 1990s, respondent Gilbert Hyatt earned substantial income from a technology patent for a computer formed on a single integrated circuit chip.  Although Hyatt's claim was later canceled, see Hyatt v. Boone, 146 F.\u00a03d 1348 (CA Fed. 1998), his royalties in the interim totaled millions of dollars.  Prior to receiving the patent, Hyatt had been a long-time resident of California.  But in 1991, Hyatt sold his house in California and rented an apartment, registered to vote, obtained insurance, opened a bank account, and acquired a driver's license in Nevada.  When he filed his 1991 and 1992 tax returns, he claimed Nevada--which collects no personal income tax, see Nev. Const., Art. 10, \u00a71(9)--as his primary place of residence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Franchise Tax Board of California (Board), the state agency responsible for assessing personal income tax, suspected that Hyatt's move was a sham.  Thus, in 1993, the Board launched an audit to determine whether Hyatt underpaid his 1991 and 1992 state income taxes by misrepresenting his residency.  In the course of the audit, employees of the Board traveled to Nevada to conduct interviews with Hyatt's estranged family members and shared his personal information with business contacts.  In total, the Board sent more than 100 letters and demands for information to third parties.  The Board ultimately concluded that Hyatt had not moved to Nevada until April 1992 and owed California more than $10 million in back taxes, interest, and penalties.  Hyatt protested the audit before the Board, which upheld the audit after an 11-year administrative proceeding.  The appeal of that decision remains pending before the California Office of Tax Appeals.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1998, Hyatt sued the Board in Nevada state court for torts he alleged the agency committed during the audit.  After the trial court denied in part the Board's motion for summary judgment, the Board petitioned the Nevada Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus ordering dismissal on the ground that the State of California was immune from suit.  The Board argued that, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Nevada courts must apply California's statute immunizing the Board from liability for all injuries caused by its tax collection.  See U.\u00a0S. Const., Art.\u00a0IV, \u00a71; Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \u00a7860.2 (West 1995).  The Nevada Supreme Court rejected that argument and held that, under general principles of comity, the Board was entitled to the same immunity that Nevada law afforded Nevada agencies--that is, immunity for negligent but not intentional torts.  We granted certiorari and unanimously affirmed, holding that the Full Faith and Credit Clause did not prohibit Nevada from applying its own immunity law to the case.  Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Hyatt, 538 U.\u00a0S. 488, 498-499 (2003) (Hyatt I).  Because the Board did not ask us to overrule Nevada v. Hall, supra, we did not revisit that decision.  Hyatt I, supra, at 497.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On remand, the trial court conducted a 4-month jury trial that culminated in a verdict for Hyatt that, with prejudgment interest and costs, exceeded $490 million.  On appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court rejected most of the damages awarded by the lower court, upholding only a $1 million judgment on one of Hyatt's claims and remanding for a new damages trial on another.  Although the court recognized that tort liability for Nevada state agencies was capped at $50,000 under state law, it nonetheless held that Nevada public policy precluded it from applying that limitation to the California agency in this case.  We again granted certiorari and this time reversed, holding that the Full Faith and Credit Clause required Nevada courts to grant the Board the same immunity that Nevada agencies enjoy.  Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Hyatt, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2016) (slip op., at 4-9) (Hyatt II\u00a0).  Although the question was briefed and argued, the Court was equally divided on whether to overrule Hall and thus affirmed the jurisdiction of the Nevada Supreme Court.  Hyatt II, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 1).  On remand, the Nevada Supreme Court instructed the trial court to enter damages in accordance with the statutory cap for Nevada agencies. 133 Nev. ___, 407 P. 3d 717 (2017).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted, for a third time, the Board's petition for certiorari, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).  The sole question presented is whether Nevada v. Hall should be overruled.1\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevada v. Hall is contrary to our constitutional design and the understanding of sovereign immunity shared by the States that ratified the Constitution.  Stare decisis does not compel continued adherence to this erroneous precedent.  We therefore overrule Hall and hold that States retain their sovereign immunity from private suits brought in the courts of other States.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hall held that the Constitution does not bar private suits against a State in the courts of another State.  440 U.\u00a0S., at 416-421.  The opinion conceded that States were immune from such actions at the time of the founding, but it nonetheless concluded that nothing \"implicit in the Constitution\" requires States \"to adhere to the sovereign-immunity doctrine as it prevailed when the Constitution was adopted.\"  Id., at 417-418, 424-427.  Instead, the Court concluded that the Founders assumed that \"prevailing notions of comity would provide adequate protection against the unlikely prospect of an attempt by the courts of one State to assert jurisdiction over another.\"  Id., at 419.  The Court's view rested primarily on the idea that the States maintained sovereign immunity vis-\u00e0-vis each other in the same way that foreign nations do, meaning that immunity is available only if the forum State \"voluntar[ily]\" decides \"to respect the dignity of the [defendant State] as a matter of comity.\"  Id., at 416; see also id., at 424-427.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Hall majority was unpersuaded that the Constitution implicitly altered the relationship between the States.  In the Court's view, the ratification debates, the Eleventh Amendment, and our sovereign-immunity precedents did not bear on the question because they \"concerned questions of federal-court jurisdiction.\"  Id., at 420.  The Court also found unpersuasive the fact that the Constitution delineates several limitations on States' authority, such as Article I powers granted exclusively to Congress and Article IV requirements imposed on States.  Id., at 425.  Despite acknowledging \"that ours is not a union of 50 wholly independent sovereigns,\" Hall inferred from the lack of an express sovereign immunity granted to the States and from the Tenth Amendment that the States retained the power in their own courts to deny immunity to other States.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Justice Burger, Justice Blackmun, and Justice Rehnquist dissented.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hall's determination that the Constitution does not contemplate sovereign immunity for each State in a sister State's courts misreads the historical record and misapprehends the \"implicit ordering of relationships within the federal system necessary to make the Constitution a workable governing charter and to give each provision within that document the full effect intended by the Framers.\"  Id., at 433 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).  As Chief Justice Marshall explained, the Founders did not state every postulate on which they formed our Republic--\"we must never forget, that it is a constitution we are expounding.\"  McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407 (1819).  And although the Constitution assumes that the States retain their sovereign immunity except as otherwise provided, it also fundamentally adjusts the States' relationship with each other and curtails their ability, as sovereigns, to decline to recognize each other's immunity.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  After independence, the States considered themselves fully sovereign nations.  As the Colonies proclaimed in 1776, they were \"Free and Independent States\" with \"full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.\"  Declaration of Independence \u00b64.  Under international law, then, independence \"entitled\" the Colonies \"to all the rights and powers of sovereign states.\"  McIlvaine v. Coxe's Lessee, 4 Cranch 209, 212 (1808).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"An integral component\" of the States' sovereignty was \"their immunity from private suits.\"  Federal Maritime Comm'n v. South Carolina Ports Authority, 535 U.\u00a0S. 743, 751-752 (2002); see Alden v. Maine, 527 U.\u00a0S. 706, 713 (1999) (\"[A]s the Constitution's structure, its history, and the authoritative interpretations by this Court make clear, the States' immunity from suit is a fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the States enjoyed before the ratification of the Constitution, and which they retain today\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0\").  This fundamental aspect of the States' \"inviolable sovereignty\" was well established and widely accepted at the founding.  The Federalist No. 39, p. 245 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison); see Alden, supra, at 715-716 (\"[T]he doctrine that a sovereign could not be sued without its consent was universal in the States when the Constitution was drafted and ratified\").  As Alexander Hamilton explained:\n\"It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent.  This is the general sense and the general practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of the attributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every State in the Union.\"  The Federalist No. 81, at 487 (emphasis deleted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Founders believed that both \"common law sovereign immunity\" and \"law-of-nations sovereign immunity\" prevented States from being amenable to process in any court without their consent.  See Pfander, Rethinking the Supreme Court's Original Jurisdiction in State-Party Cases, 82 Cal. L. Rev. 555, 581-588 (1994);  see also Nelson, Sovereign Immunity as a Doctrine of Personal Jurisdiction, 115 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 1559, 1574-1579 (2002).  The common-law rule was that \"no suit or action can be brought against the king, even in civil matters, because no court can have jurisdiction over him.\"  1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 235 (1765) (Blackstone).  The law-of-nations rule followed from the \"perfect equality and absolute independence of sovereigns\" under that body of international law.  Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, 137 (1812); see C. Phillipson, Wheaton's Elements of International Law 261 (5th ed. 1916) (recognizing that sovereigns \"enjoy equality before international law\"); 1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 20 (G. Comstock ed. 1867).  According to the founding era's foremost expert on the law of nations, \"[i]t does not .\u00a0.\u00a0. belong to any foreign power to take cognisance of the administration of [another] sovereign, to set himself up for a judge of his conduct, and to oblige him to alter it.\"  2  E. de Vattel, The Law of Nations \u00a755, p. 155 (J. Chitty ed. 1883).  The sovereign is \"exemp[t] .\u00a0.\u00a0. from all [foreign] jurisdiction.\"  4 id., \u00a7108, at 486.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The founding generation thus took as given that States could not be haled involuntarily before each other's courts.  See Woolhandler, Interstate Sovereign Immunity, 2006 S.\u00a0Ct. Rev. 249, 254-259.  This understanding is perhaps best illustrated by preratification examples.  In 1781, a creditor named Simon Nathan tried to recover a debt that Virginia allegedly owed him by attaching some of its property in Philadelphia.  James Madison and other Virginia delegates to the Confederation Congress responded by sending a communique to Pennsylvania requesting that its executive branch have the action dismissed.  See Letter from Virginia Delegates to Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania (July 9, 1781), in 3 The Papers of James Madison, 184-185 (W. Hutchinson & W. Rachal eds. 1963).  As Madison framed it, the Commonwealth's property could not be attached by process issuing from a court of \"any other State in the Union.\"  Id., at 184.  To permit otherwise would require Virginia to \"abandon its Sovereignty by descending to answer before the Tribunal of another Power.\"  Ibid.  Pennsylvania Attorney General William Bradford intervened, urging the Court of Common Pleas to dismiss the action.  See Nathan v. Virginia, 1 Dall. 77, 78 (C. P. Phila. Cty. 1781).  According to Bradford, the suit violated international law because \"all sovereigns are in a state of equality and independence, exempt from each other's jurisdiction.\"  Ibid.  \"[A]ll jurisdiction implies superiority over the party,\" Bradford argued, \"but there could be no superiority\" between the States, and thus no jurisdiction, because the States were \"perfect[\u00a0ly] equa[l]\" and \"entire[ly] independen[t].\"  Ibid.  The court agreed and refused to grant Nathan the writ of attachment.  Id., at 80.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, a Pennsylvania Admiralty Court that very same year dismissed a libel action against a South Carolina warship, brought by its crew to recover unpaid wages.  The court reasoned that the vessel was owned by a \"sovereign independent state.\"  Moitez v. The South Carolina, 17 F. Cas. 574 (No. 9697) (1781).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Founders were well aware of the international-law immunity principles behind these cases.  Federalists and Antifederalists alike agreed in their preratification debates that States could not be sued in the courts of other States.  One Federalist, who argued that Article III would waive the States' immunity in federal court, admitted that the waiver was desirable because of the \"impossibility of calling a sovereign state before the jurisdiction of another sovereign state.\"  3 Debates on the Constitution 549 (J. Elliot ed. 1876) (Pendleton) (Elliot's Debates).  Two of the most prominent Antifederalists--Federal Farmer and Brutus--disagreed with the Federalists about the desirability of a federal forum in which States could be sued, but did so for the very reason that the States had previously been \"subject to no such actions\" in any court and were not \"oblige[d]\" \"to answer to an individual in a court of law.\"  Federal Farmer No. 3 (Oct. 10, 1787), in 4 The Founders' Constitution 227 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds. 1987).  They found it \"humiliating and degrading\" that a State might have to answer \"the suit of an individual.\"  Brutus No. 13 (Feb. 21, 1788), in id., at 238.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, at the time of the founding, it was well settled that States were immune under both the common law and the law of nations.  The Constitution's use of the term \"States\" reflects both of these kinds of traditional immunity.  And the States retained these aspects of sovereignty, \"except as altered by the plan of the Convention or certain constitutional Amendments.\"  Alden, 527 U.\u00a0S., at 713.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One constitutional provision that abrogated certain aspects of this traditional immunity was Article III, which provided a neutral federal forum in which the States agreed to be amenable to suits brought by other States.  Art.\u00a0III, \u00a72; see Alden, supra, at 755.  \"The establishment of a permanent tribunal with adequate authority to determine controversies between the States, in place of an inadequate scheme of arbitration, was essential to the peace of the Union.\"  Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U.\u00a0S. 313, 328 (1934).  As James Madison explained during the Convention debates, \"there can be no impropriety in referring such disputes\" between coequal sovereigns to a superior tribunal.   Elliot's Debates 532.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The States, in ratifying the Constitution, similarly surrendered a portion of their immunity by consenting to suits brought against them by the United States in federal courts.  See Monaco, supra, at 328; Federal Maritime Comm'n, 535 U.\u00a0S., at 752.  \"While that jurisdiction is not conferred by the Constitution in express words, it is inherent in the constitutional plan.\"  Monaco, supra, at 329.  Given that \"all jurisdiction implies superiority of power,\" Blackstone 235, the only forums in which the States have consented to suits by one another and by the Federal Government are Article III courts.  See Federal Maritime Comm'n, supra, at 752.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Antifederalists worried that Article III went even further by extending the federal judicial power over controversies \"between a State and Citizens of another State.\"  They suggested that this provision implicitly waived the States' sovereign immunity against private suits in federal courts.  But \"[t]he leading advocates of the Constitution assured the people in no uncertain terms\" that this reading was incorrect.  Alden, 527 U.\u00a0S., at 716; see id., at 716-718 (citing arguments by Hamilton, Madison, and John Marshall).  According to Madison:\n\"[A federal court's] jurisdiction in controversies between a state and citizens of another state is much objected to, and perhaps without reason.  It is not in the power of individuals to call any state into court.  The only operation it can have, is that, if a state should wish to bring a suit against a citizen, it must be brought before the federal court.  This will give satisfaction to individuals, as it will prevent citizens, on whom a state may have a claim, being dissatisfied with the state courts.\"  Elliot's Debates 533.\nJohn Marshall echoed these sentiments:\n\"With respect to disputes between a state and the citizens of another state, its jurisdiction has been decried with unusual vehemence.  I hope no gentleman will think that a state will be called at the bar of the federal court. .\u00a0.\u00a0. The intent is, to enable states to recover claims of individuals residing in other states.  I contend this construction is warranted by the words.\"  Id., at 555 (emphasis in original).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not long after the founding, however, the Antifederalists' fears were realized.  In Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), the Court held that Article III allowed the very suits that the \"Madison-Marshall-Hamilton triumvirate\" insisted it did not.  Hall, 440 U.\u00a0S., at 437 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).  That decision precipitated an immediate \"furor\" and \"uproar\" across the country.  1 J. Goebel, Antecedents and Beginnings to 1801, History of the Supreme Court of the United States 734, 737 (1971); see id., at 734-741.  Congress and the States accordingly acted swiftly to remedy the Court's blunder by drafting and ratifying the Eleventh Amendment.2  See Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.\u00a0S. 651, 660-662 (1974); see also Federal Maritime Comm'n, supra, at 753 (acknowledging that Chisholm was incorrect); Alden, supra, at 721-722 (same).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Eleventh Amendment confirmed that the Constitution was not meant to \"rais[e] up\" any suits against the States that were \"anomalous and unheard of when the Constitution was adopted.\"  Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.\u00a0S. 1, 18 (1890).  Although the terms of that Amendment address only \"the specific provisions of the Constitution that had raised concerns during the ratification debates and formed the basis of the Chisholm decision,\" the \"natural inference\" from its speedy adoption is that \"the Constitution was understood, in light of its history and structure, to preserve the States' traditional immunity from private suits.\"  Alden, supra, at 723-724.  We have often emphasized that \"[t]he Amendment is rooted in a recognition that the States, although a union, maintain certain attributes of sovereignty, including sovereign immunity.\"  Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.\u00a0S. 139, 146 (1993).  In proposing the Amendment, \"Congress acted not to change but to restore the original constitutional design.\"  Alden, 527 U.\u00a0S., at 722.  The \"sovereign immunity of the States,\" we have said, \"neither derives from, nor is limited by, the terms of the Eleventh Amendment.\"  Id., at 713.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistent with this understanding of state sovereign immunity, this Court has held that the Constitution bars suits against nonconsenting States in a wide range of cases.  See, e.g., Federal Maritime Comm'n, supra (actions by private parties before federal administrative agencies); Alden, supra (suits by private parties against a State in its own courts); Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U.\u00a0S. 775 (1991) (suits by Indian tribes in federal court); Monaco, 292 U.\u00a0S. 313 (suits by foreign states in federal court); Ex parte New York, 256 U.\u00a0S. 490 (1921) (admiralty suits by private parties in federal court); Smith v. Reeves, 178 U.\u00a0S. 436 (1900) (suits by federal corporations in federal court).\n3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite this historical evidence that interstate sovereign immunity is preserved in the constitutional design, Hyatt insists that such immunity exists only as a \"matter of comity\" and can be disregarded by the forum State.  Hall, supra, at 416.  He reasons that, before the Constitution was ratified, the States had the power of fully independent nations to deny immunity to fellow sovereigns; thus, the States must retain that power today with respect to each other because \"nothing in the Constitution or formation of the Union altered that balance among the still-sovereign states.\"  Brief for Respondent 14.  Like the majority in Hall, he relies primarily on our early foreign immunity decisions.  For instance, he cites Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, in which the Court dismissed a libel action against a French warship docked in Philadelphia because, under the law of nations, a sovereign's warships entering the ports of a friendly nation are exempt from the jurisdiction of its courts.  7 Cranch, at 145-146.  But whether the host nation respects that sovereign immunity, Chief Justice Marshall noted, is for the host nation to decide, for \"[t]he jurisdiction of [a] nation within its own territory is necessarily exclusive and absolute\" and \"is susceptible of no limitation not imposed by itself.\"  Id., at 136.  Similar reasoning is found in The Santissima Trinidad, 7 Wheat. 283, 353 (1822), where Justice Story noted that the host nation's consent to provide immunity \"may be withdrawn upon notice at any time, without just offence.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The problem with Hyatt's argument is that the Constitution affirmatively altered the relationships between the States, so that they no longer relate to each other solely as foreign sovereigns.  Each State's equal dignity and sovereignty under the Constitution implies certain constitutional \"limitation[s] on the sovereignty of all of its sister States.\"  World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.\u00a0S. 286, 293 (1980).  One such limitation is the inability of one State to hale another into its courts without the latter's consent.  The Constitution does not merely allow States to afford each other immunity as a matter of comity; it embeds interstate sovereign immunity within the constitutional design.  Numerous provisions reflect this reality.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To begin, Article I divests the States of the traditional diplomatic and military tools that foreign sovereigns possess.  Specifically, the States can no longer prevent or remedy departures from customary international law because the Constitution deprives them of the independent power to lay imposts or duties on imports and exports, to enter into treaties or compacts, and to wage war.  Compare Art. I, \u00a710, with Declaration of Independence \u00b64 (asserting the power to \"levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, [and] establish Commerce\"); see Kansas v. Colorado, 185 U. S. 125, 143 (1902).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article IV also imposes duties on the States not required by international law.  The Court's Full Faith and Credit Clause precedents, for example, demand that state-court judgments be accorded full effect in other States and preclude States from \"adopt[ing] any policy of hostility to the public Acts\" of other States.  Hyatt II, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Art.\u00a0IV, \u00a71.  States must also afford citizens of each State \"all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States\" and honor extradition requests upon \"Demand of the executive Authority of the State\" from which the fugitive fled.  Art.\u00a0IV, \u00a72.  Foreign sovereigns cannot demand these kinds of reciprocal responsibilities absent consent or compact.  But the Constitution imposes them as part of its transformation of the States from a loose league of friendship into a perpetual Union based on the \"fundamental principle of equal sovereignty among the States.\"  Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.\u00a0S. 529, 544 (2013) (emphasis in original and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Constitution also reflects implicit alterations to the States' relationships with each other, confirming that they are no longer fully independent nations.  See New Hampshire v. Louisiana, 108 U.\u00a0S. 76, 90 (1883).  For example, States may not supply rules of decision governing \"disputes implicating the[ir] conflicting rights.\"  Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U. S. 630, 641 (1981).  Thus, no State can apply its own law to interstate disputes over borders, Cissna v. Tennessee, 246 U. S. 289, 295 (1918), water rights, Hinderlider v. La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U.\u00a0S. 92, 110 (1938), or the interpretation of interstate compacts, Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm'n, 359 U.\u00a0S. 275, 278-279 (1959).  The States would have had the raw power to apply their own law to such matters before they entered the Union, but the Constitution implicitly forbids that exercise of power because the \"interstate .\u00a0.\u00a0. nature of the controversy makes it inappropriate for state law to control.\"  Texas Industries, supra, at 641.  Some subjects that were decided by pure \"political power\" before ratification now turn on federal \"rules of law.\"  Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 737 (1838).  See Clark, Federal Common Law: A Structural Reinterpretation, 144 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1245, 1322-1331 (1996).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Interstate sovereign immunity is similarly integral to the structure of the Constitution.  Like a dispute over borders or water rights, a State's assertion of compulsory judicial process over another State involves a direct conflict between sovereigns.  The Constitution implicitly strips States of any power they once had to refuse each other sovereign immunity, just as it denies them the power to resolve border disputes by political means.  Interstate immunity, in other words, is \"implied as an essential component of federalism.\"  Hall, 440 U.\u00a0S., at 430-431 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hyatt argues that we should find no right to sovereign immunity in another State's courts because no constitutional provision explicitly grants that immunity.  But this is precisely the type of \"ahistorical literalism\" that we have rejected when \"interpreting the scope of the States' sovereign immunity since the discredited decision in Chisholm.\"  Alden, 527 U.\u00a0S., at 730; see id., at 736 (\"[T]he bare text of the Amendment is not an exhaustive description of the States' constitutional immunity from suit\").  In light of our constitutional structure, the historical understanding of state immunity, and the swift enactment of the Eleventh Amendment after the Court departed from this understanding in Chisholm, \"[i]t is not rational to suppose that the sovereign power should be dragged before a court.\"  Elliot's Debates 555 (Marshall).  Indeed, the spirited historical debate over Article III courts and the immediate reaction to Chisholm make little sense if the Eleventh Amendment were the only source of sovereign immunity and private suits against the States could already be brought in \"partial, local tribunals.\"  Elliot's Debates 532 (Madison).  Nor would the Founders have objected so strenuously to a neutral federal forum for private suits against States if they were open to a State being sued in a different State's courts.  Hyatt's view thus inverts the Founders' concerns about state-court parochialism.  Hall, supra, at 439 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, Hyatt's ahistorical literalism proves too much.  There are many other constitutional doctrines that are not spelled out in the Constitution but are nevertheless implicit in its structure and supported by historical practice--including, for example, judicial review, Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176-180 (1803); intergovernmental tax immunity, McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 435-436; executive privilege, United States v. Nixon, 418 U.\u00a0S. 683, 705-706 (1974); executive immunity, Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.\u00a0S. 731, 755-758 (1982); and the President's removal power, Myers v. United States, 272 U.\u00a0S. 52, 163-164 (1926).  Like these doctrines, the States' sovereign immunity is a historically rooted principle embedded in the text and structure of the Constitution.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the historical record and precedent against him, Hyatt defends Hall on the basis of stare decisis.  But stare decisis is \"\u00a0'not an inexorable command,'\u00a0\" Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.\u00a0S. 223, 233 (2009), and we have held that it is \"at its weakest when we interpret the Constitution because our interpretation can be altered only by constitutional amendment,\" Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.\u00a0S. 203, 235 (1997).  The Court's precedents identify a number of factors to consider, four of which warrant mention here: the quality of the decision's reasoning; its consistency with related decisions; legal developments since the decision; and reliance on the decision.  See Janus v. State, County, and Municipal Employees, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2018) (slip op., at 34-35); United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.\u00a0S. 506, 521 (1995).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first three factors support our decision to overrule Hall. We have already explained that Hall failed to account for the historical understanding of state sovereign immunity and that it failed to consider how the deprivation of traditional diplomatic tools reordered the States' relationships with one another.  We have also demonstrated that Hall stands as an outlier in our sovereign-immunity jurisprudence, particularly when compared to more recent decisions.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the fourth factor, we acknowledge that some plaintiffs, such as Hyatt, have relied on Hall by suing sovereign States.  Because of our decision to overrule Hall, Hyatt unfortunately will suffer the loss of two decades of litigation expenses and a final judgment against the Board for its egregious conduct.  But in virtually every case that overrules a controlling precedent, the party relying on that precedent will incur the loss of litigation expenses and a favorable decision below.  Those case-specific costs are not among the reliance interests that would persuade us to adhere to an incorrect resolution of an important constitutional question.  \n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevada v. Hall is irreconcilable with our constitutional structure and with the historical evidence showing a widespread preratification understanding that States retained immunity from private suits, both in their own courts and in other courts.  We therefore overrule that decision.  Because the Board is thus immune from Hyatt's suit in Nevada's courts, the judgment of the Nevada Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nBreyer, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1299\nFRANCHISE TAX BOARD OF CALIFORNIA, PETITIONER v. GILBERT P. HYATT\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of nevada\n[May 13, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can a private citizen sue one State in the courts of another?  Normally the answer to this question is no, because the State where the suit is brought will choose to grant its sister States immunity.  But the question here is whether the Federal Constitution requires each State to grant its sister States immunity, or whether the Constitution instead permits a State to grant or deny its sister States immunity as it chooses.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We answered that question 40 years ago in Nevada v. Hall, 440 U.\u00a0S. 410 (1979).  The Court in Hall held that the Constitution took the permissive approach, leaving it up to each State to decide whether to grant or deny its sister States sovereign immunity.  Today, the majority takes the contrary approach--the absolute approach--and overrules Hall.  I can find no good reason to overrule Hall, however, and I consequently dissent.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hall involved a suit brought by a California resident against the State of Nevada in the California courts.  We rejected the claim that the Constitution entitled Nevada to absolute immunity.  We first considered the immunity that States possessed as independent sovereigns before the Constitution was ratified.  And we then asked whether ratification of the Constitution altered the principles of state sovereign immunity in any relevant respect.  At both steps, we concluded, the relevant history and precedent refuted the claim that States are entitled to absolute immunity in each other's courts.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hall first considered the immunity that States possessed before ratification.  \"States considered themselves fully sovereign nations\" during this period, ante, at 6, and the Court in Hall therefore asked whether sovereign nations would have enjoyed absolute immunity in each other's courts at the time of our founding.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer was no.  At the time of the founding, nations granted other nations sovereign immunity in their courts not as a matter of legal obligation but as a matter of choice, i.e., of comity or grace or consent.  Foreign sovereign immunity was a doctrine \"of implied consent by the territorial sovereign .\u00a0.\u00a0. deriving from standards of public morality, fair dealing, reciprocal self-interest, and respect.\"  National City Bank of N. Y. v. Republic of China, 348 U.\u00a0S. 356, 362 (1955).  Since customary international law made the matter one of choice, a nation could withdraw that sovereign immunity if it so chose.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court took that view of foreign sovereign immunity in two founding-era decisions that forecast the result in Hall.  In Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116 (1812), when considering whether an American citizen could impose a lien upon a French warship, Chief Justice John Marshall wrote for the Court that international law did not require the United States to grant France sovereign immunity.  Any such requirement, he reasoned, \"would imply a diminution\" of American \"sovereignty.\"  Id., at 136.  Instead, Chief Justice Marshall observed that any \"exceptions\" to \"the full and complete power of a nation within its own territories, must be traced up to the consent of the nation itself\" and \"can flow from no other legitimate source.\"  Ibid. (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court ultimately held in Schooner Exchange that the United States had consented implicitly to give immunity to the French warship.  See id., at 147.  But that was because \"national ships of war, entering the port of a friendly power open for their reception, [we]re to be considered as exempted by the consent of that power from its jurisdiction.\"  Id., at 145-146.  And the Chief Justice was careful to note that this implication of consent could be \"destroy[ed]\" in various ways, including by subjecting the foreign nation \"to the ordinary tribunals.\"  Id., at 146.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ten years later, in The Santissima Trinidad, 7 Wheat. 283 (1822), this Court unanimously reaffirmed Schooner Exchange's conclusion that foreign sovereign immunity was not an absolute right.  The Court in Santissima Trinidad was called upon to determine whether the cargo of an Argentine ship, found in Baltimore Harbor, was immune from seizure.  The ship's commander asserted that Argentina had an absolute right to immunity from suit, claiming that \"no sovereign is answerable for his acts to the tribunals of any foreign sovereign.\"  Id., at 352.  But Justice Joseph Story, writing for the Court, squarely rejected the \"notion that a foreign sovereign had an absolute right, in virtue of his sovereignty, to an exemption of his property from the local jurisdiction of another sovereign, when it came within his territory.\"  Ibid.  Rather, any exception to jurisdiction, including sovereign immunity, \"stands upon principles of public comity and convenience, and arises from the presumed consent or license of nations.\"  Id., at 353.  Accordingly, Justice Story explained, the right to assert sovereign immunity \"may be withdrawn upon notice at any time, without just offence.\"  Ibid. (emphasis added).  Justice Story then held that the Argentine ship's cargo was not immune from seizure.  Id., at 354.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court in Hall relied on this reasoning.  See 440 U.\u00a0S., at 416-417.  Drawing on the comparison to foreign nations, the Court in Hall emphasized that California had made a sovereign decision not to \"exten[d] immunity to Nevada as a matter of comity.\"  Id., at 418.  Unless some constitutional rule required California to grant immunity that it had chosen to withhold, the Court \"ha[d] no power to disturb the judgment of the California courts.\"  Ibid.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court in Hall next held that ratification of the Constitution did not alter principles of state sovereign immunity in any relevant respect.  The Court concluded that express provisions of the Constitution--such as the Eleventh Amendment and the Full Faith and Credit Clause of Article IV--did not require States to accord each other sovereign immunity.  See id., at 418-424.  And the Court held that nothing \"implicit in the Constitution\" treats States differently in respect to immunity than international law treats sovereign nations.  Id., at 418; see also id., at 424-427.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the contrary, the Court in Hall observed that an express provision of the Constitution undermined the assertion that States were absolutely immune in each other's courts.  Unlike suits brought against a State in the State's own courts, Hall noted, a suit against a State in the courts of a different State \"necessarily implicates the power and authority of\" both States.  Id., at 416.  The defendant State has a sovereign interest in immunity from suit, while the forum State has a sovereign interest in defining the jurisdiction of its own courts.  The Court in Hall therefore justified its decision in part by reference to \"the Tenth Amendment's reminder that powers not delegated to the Federal Government nor prohibited to the States are reserved to the States or to the people.\"  Id., at 425.  Compelling States to grant immunity to their sister States would risk interfering with sovereign rights that the Tenth Amendment leaves to the States.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To illustrate that principle, Hall cited Georgia v. Chattanooga, 264 U.\u00a0S. 472 (1924), which concerned condemnation proceedings brought by a municipality against property owned by a neighboring State.  See Hall, 440 U.\u00a0S., at 426, n. 29.  The Court in Chattanooga held that one State (Georgia) that had purchased property for a railroad in a neighboring State (Tennessee) could not exempt itself from the eminent domain power of the Tennessee city in which the property was located.  264 U.\u00a0S., at 480.  The reason was obvious:  \"The power of eminent domain is an attribute of sovereignty,\" and Tennessee did not surrender that sovereign power simply by selling land to Georgia.  Ibid.  In light of the competing sovereignty interests on both sides of the matter, the Court in Chattanooga found no basis to interpose a federally mandated resolution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similar reasoning applied in Hall.  Mandating absolute interstate immunity \"by inference from the structure of our Constitution and nothing else\" would \"intru[de] on the sovereignty of the States--and the power of the people--in our Union.\"  440 U.\u00a0S., at 426-427.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority disputes both Hall's historical conclusion regarding state immunity before ratification and its conclusion that the Constitution did not alter that immunity.  But I do not find the majority's arguments convincing.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority asserts that before ratification \"it was well settled that States were immune under both the common law and the law of nations.\"  Ante, at 9.  The majority thus maintains that States were exempt from suit in each other's courts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the question in Hall concerned the basis for that exemption.  Did one sovereign have an absolute right to an exemption from the jurisdiction of the courts of another, or was that exemption a customary matter, a matter of consent that a sovereign might withdraw?  As to that question, nothing in the majority's opinion casts doubt on Hall's conclusion that States--like foreign nations--were accorded immunity as a matter of consent rather than absolute right.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority refers to \"the founding era's foremost expert on the law of nations,\" Emer de Vattel, who stated that a \"sovereign is 'exempt from all foreign jurisdiction.'\u00a0\"  Ante, at 7 (quoting 4 E. de Vattel, The Law of Nations 486 (J. Chitty ed. 1883) (Vattel); alterations omitted).  But Vattel made clear that the source of a sovereign's immunity in a foreign sovereign's courts is the \"\u00a0'consen[t]'\u00a0\" of the foreign sovereign, which, he added, reflects a \"\u00a0'tacit convention'\u00a0\" among nations.  Schooner Exchange, 7 Cranch, at 143 (quoting 4 Vattel 472).  And Schooner Exchange and Santissima Trinidad underscore that such a tacit convention can be rejected, and that consent can be \"withdrawn upon notice at any time.\"  Santissima Trinidad, 7 Wheat., at 353.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority also draws on statements of the Founders concerning the importance of sovereign immunity generally.  But, as Hall noted, those statements concerned matters entirely distinct from the question of state immunity at issue here.  Those statements instead \"concerned questions of federal-court jurisdiction and the extent to which the States, by ratifying the Constitution and creating federal courts, had authorized suits against themselves in those courts.\"  440 U.\u00a0S., at 420-421 (emphasis added).  That issue was \"a matter of importance in the early days of independence,\" for it concerned the ability of holders of Revolutionary War debt owed by States to collect that debt in a federal forum.  Id., at 418.  There is no evidence that the Founders who made those statements intended to express views on the question before us.  And it seems particularly unlikely that John Marshall, one of those to whom the Court refers, see ante, at 10-11, would have held views of the law in respect to States that he later repudiated in respect to sovereign nations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority cites Nathan v. Virginia, 1 Dall. 77, n. (C. P. Phila. Cty. 1781).  As the majority points out, that case involved a Pennsylvania citizen who filed a suit in Pennsylvania's courts seeking to attach property belonging to Virginia.  The Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas accepted Virginia's claim of sovereign immunity and dismissed the suit.  But it did so only after \"delegates in Congress from Virginia .\u00a0.\u00a0. applied to the supreme executive council of Pennsylvania\" for immunity, and Pennsylvania's Attorney General, representing its Executive, asked the court to dismiss the case.  Id., at 78, n.  The Pennsylvania court thus granted immunity only after Virginia \"followed the usual diplomatic course.\"  Pfander, Rethinking the Supreme Court's Original Jurisdiction in State-Party Cases, 82 Cal. L. Rev. 555, 585 (1994).  Given the participation of Pennsylvania's Executive in this diplomatic matter, the case likely involved Pennsylvania's consent to a claim of sovereign immunity, rather than a view that Virginia had an absolute right to immunity.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority next argues that \"the Constitution affirmatively altered the relationships between the States\" by giving them immunity that they did not possess when they were fully independent.  Ante, at 13.  The majority thus maintains that, whatever the nature of state immunity before ratification, the Constitution accorded States an absolute immunity that they did not previously possess.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The most obvious problem with this argument is that no provision of the Constitution gives States absolute immunity in each other's courts.  The majority does not attempt to situate its newfound constitutional immunity in any provision of the Constitution itself.  Instead, the majority maintains that a State's immunity in other States' courts is \"implicit\" in the Constitution, ante, at 16, \"embed[ded] .\u00a0.\u00a0. within the constitutional design,\" ante, at 13, and reflected in \"\u00a0'the plan of the Convention,'\u00a0\" ante, at 9.  See also Hall, 440 U.\u00a0S., at 430 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (arguing that immunity in this context is found \"not in an express provision of the Constitution but in a guarantee that is implied as an essential component of federalism\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I agree with today's majority and the dissenters in Hall that the Constitution contains implicit guarantees as well as explicit ones.  But, as I have previously noted, concepts like the \"constitutional design\" and \"plan of the Convention\" are \"highly abstract, making them difficult to apply\"--at least absent support in \"considerations of history, of constitutional purpose, or of related consequence.\"  Federal Maritime Comm'n v. South Carolina Ports Authority, 535 U.\u00a0S. 743, 778 (2002) (Breyer, J., dissenting).  Such concepts \"invite differing interpretations at least as much as do the Constitution's own broad liberty-protecting phrases\" such as \"\u00a0'due process'\u00a0\" and \"\u00a0'liberty,'\u00a0\" and \"they suffer the additional disadvantage that they do not actually appear anywhere in the Constitution.\"  Ibid. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At any rate, I can find nothing in the \"plan of the Convention\" or elsewhere to suggest that the Constitution converted what had been the customary practice of extending immunity by consent into an absolute federal requirement that no State could withdraw.  None of the majority's arguments indicates that the Constitution accomplished any such transformation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority argues that the Constitution sought to preserve States' \"equal dignity and sovereignty.\"  Ante, at 13. That is true, but tells us nothing useful here.  When a citizen brings suit against one State in the courts of another, both States have strong sovereignty-based interests.  In contrast to a State's power to assert sovereign immunity in its own courts, sovereignty interests here lie on both sides of the constitutional equation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority also says--also correctly--that the Constitution demanded that States give up certain sovereign rights that they would have retained had they remained independent nations.  From there the majority infers that the Constitution must have implicitly given States immunity in each other's courts to provide protection that they gave up when they entered the Federal Union.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But where the Constitution alters the authority of States vis-\u00e0-vis other States, it tends to do so explicitly.  The Import-Export Clause cited by the majority, for example, creates \"harmony among the States\" by preventing them from \"burden[ing] commerce .\u00a0.\u00a0. among themselves.\"  Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U.\u00a0S. 276, 283, 285 (1976).  The Full Faith and Credit Clause, also invoked by the majority, prohibits States from adopting a \"policy of hostility to the public Acts\" of another State.  Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Hyatt, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 2).  By contrast, the Constitution says nothing explicit about interstate sovereign immunity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor does there seem to be any need to create implicit constitutional protections for States.  As the history of this case shows, the Constitution's express provisions seem adequate to prohibit one State from treating its sister States unfairly--even if the State permits suits against its sister States in its courts.  See id., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (holding that the Full Faith and Credit Clause prohibits Nevada from subjecting the Board to greater liability than Nevada would impose upon its own agency in similar circumstances).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority may believe that the distinction between permissive and absolute immunity was too nuanced for the Framers.  The Framers might have understood that most nations did in fact allow other nations to assert sovereign immunity in their courts.  And they might have stopped there, ignoring the fact that, under international law, a nation had the sovereign power to change its mind.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But there is simply nothing in the Constitution or its history to suggest that anyone reasoned in that way.  No constitutional language supports that view.  Chief Justice Marshall, Justice Story, and the Court itself took a somewhat contrary view without mentioning the matter.  And there is no strong reason for treating States differently than foreign nations in this context.  Why would the Framers, silently and without any evident reason, have transformed sovereign immunity from a permissive immunity predicated on comity and consent into an absolute immunity that States must accord one another?  The Court in Hall could identify no such reason.  Nor can I.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, stare decisis requires us to follow Hall, not overrule it.  See Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.\u00a0S. 833, 854-855 (1992); see also Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2015) (slip op., at 7-8).  Overruling a case always requires \"\u00a0'special justification.'\u00a0\"  Kimble, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  What could that justification be in this case?  The majority does not find one.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority believes that Hall was wrongly decided.  But \"an argument that we got something wrong--even a good argument to that effect--cannot by itself justify scrapping settled precedent.\"  Kimble, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  Three dissenters in Hall also believed that Hall was wrong, but they recognized that the Court's opinion was \"plausible.\"  440 U.\u00a0S., at 427 (opinion of Blackmun, J.).  While reasonable jurists might disagree about whether Hall was correct, that very fact--that Hall is not obviously wrong--shows that today's majority is obviously wrong to overrule it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The law has not changed significantly since this Court decided Hall, and has not left Hall a relic of an abandoned doctrine.  To the contrary, Hall relied on this Court's precedent in reaching its conclusion, and this Court's subsequent cases are consistent with Hall.  As noted earlier, Hall drew its historical analysis from earlier decisions such as Schooner Exchange, written by Chief Justice Marshall.  And our post-Hall decisions regarding the immunity of foreign nations are consistent with those earlier decisions.  The Court has recently reaffirmed \"Chief Justice Marshall's observation that foreign sovereign immunity is a matter of grace and comity rather than a constitutional requirement.\"  Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U.\u00a0S. 677, 689 (2004).  And the Court has reiterated that a nation may decline to grant other nations sovereign immunity in its courts.  Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.\u00a0S. 480, 486 (1983).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor has our understanding of state sovereign immunity evolved to undermine Hall.  The Court has decided several state sovereign immunity cases since Hall, but these cases have all involved a State's immunity in a federal forum or in the State's own courts.  Compare Federal Maritime Comm'n, 535 U.\u00a0S., at 769 (state immunity in a federal forum); Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.\u00a0S. 44, 47 (1996) (same); Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U.\u00a0S. 775, 782 (1991) (same), with Alden v. Maine, 527 U.\u00a0S. 706, 715 (1999) (state immunity in a State's \"own courts\"); Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U.\u00a0S. 58, 67 (1989) (same).  None involved immunity asserted by one State in the courts of another.  And our most recent case to address Hall in any detail endorses it.  See Alden, 527 U.\u00a0S., at 739-740 (noting that Hall's distinction \"between a sovereign's immunity in its own courts and its immunity in the courts of another sovereign\" is \"consistent with, and even support[s],\" modern cases).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissenters in Hall feared its \"practical implications.\"  440 U.\u00a0S., at 443 (opinion of Rehnquist, J.).  But I can find nothing in the intervening 40 years to suggest that this fear was well founded.  The Board and its amici have, by my count, identified only 14 cases in 40 years in which one State has entertained a private citizen's suit against another State in its courts.  See Brief for Petitioner 46-47; Brief for State of Indiana et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 13-14.  In at least one of those 14 cases, moreover, the state court eventually agreed to dismiss the suit against its sister State as a matter of comity.  See Monta\u00f1o v. Frezza, 2017-NMSC-015, 393 P. 3d 700, 710.  How can it be that these cases, decided over a period of four decades, show Hall to be unworkable?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Hall issue so rarely arises because most States, like most sovereign nations, are reluctant to deny a sister State the immunity that they would prefer to enjoy reciprocally.  Thus, even in the absence of constitutionally mandated immunity, States normally grant sovereign immunity voluntarily.  States that fear that this practice will be insufficiently protective are free to enter into an interstate compact to guarantee that the normal practice of granting immunity will continue.  See Cuyler v. Adams, 449 U.\u00a0S. 433, 440 (1981).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although many States have filed an amicus brief in this case asking us to overturn Hall, I can find nothing in the brief that indicates that reaffirming Hall would affront \"the dignity and respect due sovereign entities.\"  Federal Maritime Comm'n, 535 U.\u00a0S., at 769. As already explained, sovereign interests fall on both sides of this question.  While reaffirming Hall might harm States seeking sovereign immunity, overruling Hall would harm States seeking to control their own courts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the majority believes that there has been insufficient reliance on Hall to justify preserving it.  But any such belief would ignore an important feature of reliance.  The people of this Nation rely upon stability in the law.  Legal stability allows lawyers to give clients sound advice and allows ordinary citizens to plan their lives.  Each time the Court overrules a case, the Court produces increased uncertainty.  To overrule a sound decision like Hall is to encourage litigants to seek to overrule other cases; it is to make it more difficult for lawyers to refrain from challenging settled law; and it is to cause the public to become increasingly uncertain about which cases the Court will overrule and which cases are here to stay.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I understand that judges, including Justices of this Court, may decide cases wrongly.  I also understand that later-appointed judges may come to believe that earlier-appointed judges made just such an error.  And I understand that, because opportunities to correct old errors are rare, judges may be tempted to seize every opportunity to overrule cases they believe to have been wrongly decided.  But the law can retain the necessary stability only if this Court resists that temptation, overruling prior precedent only when the circumstances demand it.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is one thing to overrule a case when it \"def\u00a0[ies] practical workability,\" when \"related principles of law have so far developed as to have left the old rule no more than a remnant of abandoned doctrine,\" or when \"facts have so changed, or come to be seen so differently, as to have robbed the old rule of significant application or justification.\"  Casey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 854-855.  It is far more dangerous to overrule a decision only because five Members of a later Court come to agree with earlier dissenters on a difficult legal question.  The majority has surrendered to the temptation to overrule Hall even though it is a well-reasoned decision that has caused no serious practical problems in the four decades since we decided it.  Today's decision can only cause one to wonder which cases the Court will overrule next.  I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Hyatt argues that the law-of-the-case doctrine precludes our review of this question, but he failed to raise that nonjurisdictional issue in his brief in opposition.  We therefore deem this argument waived.  See this Court's Rule 15.2; Arizona v. California, 460 U.\u00a0S. 605, 618 (1983) (\"Law of the case directs a court's discretion, it does not limit the tribunal's power\").  We also reject Hyatt's argument that the Board waived its immunity.  The Board has raised an immunity-based argument from this suit's inception, though it was initially based on the Full Faith and Credit Clause.\nFootnote 2\u00a0The Eleventh Amendment provides: \"The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\"\n\n\n","18":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGAMBLE v. UNITED STATES(2019)\nNo. 17-646\nArgued: December 6, 2018Decided: June 17, 2019\n\n\nPetitioner Gamble pleaded guilty to a charge of violating Alabama's felon-in-possession-of-a-firearm statute.  Federal prosecutors then indicted him for the same instance of possession under federal law.  Gamble moved to dismiss, arguing that the federal indictment was for \"the same offence\" as the one at issue in his state conviction, thus exposing him to double jeopardy under the Fifth Amendment.  The District Court denied this motion, invoking the dual-sovereignty doctrine, according to which two offenses \"are not the 'same offence'\u00a0\" for double jeopardy purposes if \"prosecuted by different sovereigns,\" Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.\u00a0S. 82, 92.  Gamble pleaded guilty to the federal offense but appealed on double jeopardy grounds.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\u00a0This Court declines to overturn the longstanding dual-sovereignty doctrine.  Pp.\u00a03-31.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The dual-sovereignty doctrine is not an exception to the double jeopardy right but follows from the Fifth Amendment's text.  The Double Jeopardy Clause protects individuals from being \"twice put in jeopardy\" \"for the same offence.\"  As originally understood, an \"offence\" is defined by a law, and each law is defined by a sovereign.  Thus, where there are two sovereigns, there are two laws and two \"offences.\"  Gamble attempts to show from the Clause's drafting history that Congress must have intended to bar successive prosecutions regardless of the sovereign bringing the charge.  But even if conjectures about subjective goals were allowed to inform this Court's reading of the text, the Government's contrary arguments on that score would prevail.  Pp.\u00a03-5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0This Court's cases reflect the sovereign-specific reading of the phrase \"same offence.\"  Three antebellum cases--Fox v. Ohio, 5 How. 410; United States v. Marigold, 9 How. 560; and Moore v. Illinois, 14 How. 13--laid the foundation that a crime against two sovereigns constitutes two offenses because each sovereign has an interest to vindicate.  Seventy years later, that foundation was cemented in United States v. Lanza, 260 U.\u00a0S. 377, which upheld a federal prosecution that followed one by a State.  This Court applied that precedent for decades until 1959, when it refused two requests to reverse course, see Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.\u00a0S. 121; Abbate v. United States, 359 U.\u00a0S. 187, and it has reinforced that precedent over the following six decades, see, e.g., Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___.  Pp.\u00a05-10.   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Gamble claims that this Court's precedent contradicts the common-law rights that the Double Jeopardy Clause was originally understood to engraft onto the Constitution, pointing to English and American cases and treatises.  A departure from precedent, however, \"demands special justification,\" Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U.\u00a0S. 203, 212, and Gamble's historical evidence is too feeble to break the chain of precedent linking dozens of cases over 170 years.  This Court has previously concluded that the probative value of early English decisions on which Gamble relies was \"dubious\" due to \"confused and inadequate reporting.\"  Bartkus, 359 U.\u00a0S., at 128, n.\u00a09.  On closer inspection, that assessment has proven accurate; the passing years have not made those early cases any clearer or more valuable.  Nor do the treatises cited by Gamble come close to settling the historical question with enough force to meet his particular burden.  His position is also not supported by state court cases, which are equivocal at best.  Less useful still are the two federal cases cited by Gamble--Houston v. Moore, 5 Wheat. 1, which squares with the dual-sovereignty doctrine, and United States v. Furlong, 5 Wheat. 184, which actually supports it.  Pp. 11-28.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0Gamble's attempts to blunt the force of stare decisis here do not succeed.  He contends that the recognition of the Double Jeopardy Clause's incorporation against the States washed away any theoretical foundation for the dual-sovereignty rule.  But this rule rests on the fact that only same-sovereign prosecutions can involve the \"same offence,\" and that is just as true after incorporation as before.  Gamble also argues that the proliferation of federal criminal laws has raised the risk of successive prosecutions under state and federal law for the same criminal conduct, thus compounding the harm inflicted by precedent.  But this objection obviously assumes that precedent was erroneous from the start, so it is only as strong as the historical arguments found wanting.  In any case, eliminating the dual-sovereignty rule would do little to trim the reach of federal criminal law or prevent many successive state and federal prosecutions for the same criminal conduct, see Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.\u00a0S. 299.  Pp. 28-31.\n 694 Fed.

That Clause provides that no person may be \"twice put in jeopardy\" \"for the same offence.\"  Our double jeopardy case law is complex, but at its core, the Clause means that those acquitted or convicted of a particular \"offence\" cannot be tried a second time for the same \"offence.\"  But what does the Clause mean by an \"offence\"?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have long held that a crime under one sovereign's laws is not \"the same offence\" as a crime under the laws of another sovereign.  Under this \"dual-sovereignty\" doctrine, a State may prosecute a defendant under state law even if the Federal Government has prosecuted him for the same conduct under a federal statute.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or the reverse may happen, as it did here.  Terance Gamble, convicted by Alabama for possessing a firearm as a felon, now faces prosecution by the United States under its own felon-in-possession law.  Attacking this second prosecution on double jeopardy grounds, Gamble asks us to overrule the dual-sovereignty doctrine.  He contends that it departs from the founding-era understanding of the right enshrined by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  But the historical evidence assembled by Gamble is feeble; pointing the other way are the Clause's text, other historical evidence, and 170 years of precedent.  Today we affirm that precedent, and with it the decision below.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In November 2015, a local police officer in Mobile, Alabama, pulled Gamble over for a damaged headlight.  Smelling marijuana, the officer searched Gamble's car, where he found a loaded 9-mm handgun.  Since Gamble had been convicted of second-degree robbery, his possession of the handgun violated an Alabama law providing that no one convicted of \"a crime of violence\" \"shall own a firearm or have one in his or her possession.\"  Ala. Code \u00a713A-11-72(a) (2015); see \u00a713A-11-70(2) (defining \"crime of violence\" to include robbery).  After Gamble pleaded guilty to this state offense, federal prosecutors indicted him for the same instance of possession under a federal law--one forbidding those convicted of \"a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year .\u00a0.\u00a0. to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition.\"  18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gamble moved to dismiss on one ground: The federal indictment was for \"the same offence\" as the one at issue in his state conviction and thus exposed him to double jeopardy.  But because this Court has long held that two offenses \"are not the 'same offence'\u00a0\" for double jeopardy purposes if \"prosecuted by different sovereigns,\" Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.\u00a0S. 82, 92 (1985), the District Court denied Gamble's motion to dismiss.  Gamble then pleaded guilty to the federal offense while preserving his right to challenge the denial of his motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds.  But on appeal the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, citing the dual-sovereignty doctrine.  694 Fed. Appx. 750 (2017). We granted certiorari to determine whether to overturn that doctrine.1  585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gamble contends that the Double Jeopardy Clause must forbid successive prosecutions by different sovereigns because that is what the founding-era common law did.  But before turning to that historical claim, see Part III infra, we review the Clause's text and some of the cases Gamble asks us to overturn.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We start with the text of the Fifth Amendment.  Although the dual-sovereignty rule is often dubbed an \"exception\" to the double jeopardy right, it is not an exception at all.  On the contrary, it follows from the text that defines that right in the first place.  \"[T]he language of the Clause .\u00a0.\u00a0. protects individuals from being twice put in jeopardy 'for the same offence,' not for the same conduct or actions,\" Grady v. Corbin, 495 U.\u00a0S. 508, 529 (1990), as Justice Scalia wrote in a soon-vindicated dissent, see United States v. Dixon, 509 U.\u00a0S. 688 (1993) (overruling Grady).  And the term \"\u00a0'[o]ffence' was commonly understood in 1791 to mean 'transgression,' that is, 'the Violation or Breaking of a Law.'\u00a0\"  Grady, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 529 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quoting Dictionarium Britannicum (Bailey ed. 1730)).  See also 2 R. Burn & J. Burn, A New Law Dictionary 167 (1792) (\"OFFENCE, is an act committed against law, or omitted where the law requires it\").  As originally understood, then, an \"offence\" is defined by a law, and each law is defined by a sovereign.  So where there are two sovereigns, there are two laws, and two \"offences.\"  See Grady, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 529 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"If the same conduct violates two (or more) laws, then each offense may be separately prosecuted\"); Moore v. Illinois, 14 How. 13, 17 (1852) (\"The constitutional provision is not, that no person shall be subject, for the same act, to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; but for the same offence, the same violation of law, no person's life or limb shall be twice put in jeopardy\" (emphasis added)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Faced with this reading, Gamble falls back on an episode from the Double Jeopardy Clause's drafting history.2  The first Congress, working on an earlier draft that would have banned \"\u00a0'more than one trial or one punishment for the same offence,'\u00a0\" voted down a proposal to add \"\u00a0'by any law of the United States.'\u00a0\"  1 Annals of Cong. 753 (1789).  In rejecting this addition, Gamble surmises, Congress must have intended to bar successive prosecutions regardless of the sovereign bringing the charge.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if that inference were justified--something that the Government disputes--it would count for little.  The private intent behind a drafter's rejection of one version of a text is shoddy evidence of the public meaning of an altogether different text.  Cf. United States v. Craft, 535 U.\u00a0S. 274, 287 (2002) (\"[F]ailed legislative proposals are a particularly dangerous ground on which to rest an interpretation of a prior statute\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Besides, if we allowed conjectures about purpose to inform our reading of the text, the Government's conjecture would prevail.  The Government notes that the Declaration of Independence denounced King George III for \"protecting [British troops] by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States.\"  \u00b6 17.  The Declaration was alluding to \"the so-called Murderers' Act, passed by Parliament after the Boston Massacre,\" Amar, Sixth Amendment First Principles, 84 Geo. L. J. 641, 687, n. 181 (1996), a law that allowed British officials indicted for murder in America to be \"\u00a0'tried in England, beyond the control of local juries.'\u00a0\"  Ibid. (quoting J. Blum et al., The National Experience 95 (3d ed. 1973)).  \"During the late colonial period, Americans strongly objected to .\u00a0.\u00a0. [t]his circumvention of the judgment of the victimized community.\" Amar, 84 Geo. L.\u00a0Rev., at 687, n. 181.  Yet on Gamble's reading, the same Founders who quite literally revolted against the use of acquittals abroad to bar criminal prosecutions here would soon give us an Amendment allowing foreign acquittals to spare domestic criminals.  We doubt it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We see no reason to abandon the sovereign-specific reading of the phrase \"same offence,\" from which the dual-sovereignty rule immediately follows.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our cases reflect the same reading.  A close look at them reveals how fidelity to the Double Jeopardy Clause's text does more than honor the formal difference between two distinct criminal codes.  It honors the substantive differences between the interests that two sovereigns can have in punishing the same act.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question of successive federal and state prosecutions arose in three antebellum cases implying and then spelling out the dual-sovereignty doctrine.  The first, Fox v. Ohio, 5 How. 410 (1847), involved an Ohio prosecution for the passing of counterfeit coins.  The defendant argued that since Congress can punish counterfeiting, the States must be barred from doing so, or else a person could face two trials for the same offense, contrary to the Fifth Amendment.  We rejected the defendant's premise that under the Double Jeopardy Clause \"offences falling within the competency of different authorities to restrain or punish them would not properly be subjected to the consequences which those authorities might ordain and affix to their perpetration.\"  Id., at 435.  Indeed, we observed, the nature of the crime or its effects on \"public safety\" might well \"deman[d]\" separate prosecutions.  Ibid.  Generalizing from this point, we declared in a second case that \"the same act might, as to its character and tendencies, and the consequences it involved, constitute an offence against both the State and Federal governments, and might draw to its commission the penalties denounced by either, as appropriate to its character in reference to each.\"  United States v. Marigold, 9 How. 560, 569 (1850).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A third antebellum case, Moore v. Illinois, 14 How. 13, expanded on this concern for the different interests of separate sovereigns, after tracing it to the text in the manner set forth above.  Recalling that the Fifth Amendment prohibits double jeopardy not \"for the same ac[t]\" but \"for the same offence,\" and that \"[a]n offence, in its legal signification, means the transgression of a law,\" id., at 19, we drew the now-familiar inference: A single act \"may be an offence or transgression of the laws of\" two sovereigns, and hence punishable by both, id., at 20.  Then we gave color to this abstract principle--and to the diverse interests it might vindicate--with an example.  An assault on a United States marshal, we said, would offend against the Nation and a State: the first by \"hindering\" the \"execution of legal process,\" and the second by \"breach[ing]\" the \"peace of the State.\"  Ibid.  That duality of harm explains how \"one act\" could constitute \"two offences, for each of which [the offender] is justly punishable.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This principle comes into still sharper relief when we consider a prosecution in this country for crimes committed abroad.  If, as Gamble suggests, only one sovereign may prosecute for a single act, no American court--state or federal--could prosecute conduct already tried in a foreign court.  Imagine, for example, that a U.\u00a0S. national has been murdered in another country.  That country could rightfully seek to punish the killer for committing an act of violence within its territory.  The foreign country's interest lies in protecting the peace in that territory rather than protecting the American specifically.  But the United States looks at the same conduct and sees an act of violence against one of its nationals, a person under the particular protection of its laws.  The murder of a U.\u00a0S. national is an offense to the United States as much as it is to the country where the murder occurred and to which the victim is a stranger.  That is why the killing of an American abroad is a federal offense that can be prosecuted in our courts, see 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72332(a)(1), and  why customary international law allows this exercise of jurisdiction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are other reasons not to offload all prosecutions for crimes involving Americans abroad.  We may lack confidence in the competence or honesty of the other country's legal system.  Less cynically, we may think that special protection for U.\u00a0S. nationals serves key national interests related to security, trade, commerce, or scholarship.  Such interests might also give us a stake in punishing crimes committed by U.\u00a0S. nationals abroad--especially crimes that might do harm to our national security or foreign relations.  See, e.g., \u00a72332a(b) (bombings).  These examples reinforce the foundation laid in our antebellum cases: that a crime against two sovereigns constitutes two offenses because each sovereign has an interest to vindicate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We cemented that foundation 70 years after the last of those antebellum cases, in a decision upholding a federal prosecution that followed one by a State.  See United States v. Lanza, 260 U.\u00a0S. 377, 382 (1922) (\"[A]n act denounced as a crime by both national and state sovereignties is an offense against the peace and dignity of both and may be punished by each\").  And for decades more, we applied our precedent without qualm or quibble.  See, e.g., Screws v. United States, 325 U.\u00a0S. 91 (1945); Jerome v. United States, 318 U.\u00a0S. 101 (1943); Puerto Rico v. Shell Co. (P.\u00a0R.), Ltd., 302 U.\u00a0S. 253 (1937); Westfall v. United States, 274 U.\u00a0S. 256 (1927); Hebert v. Louisiana, 272 U.\u00a0S. 312 (1926).  When petitioners in 1959 asked us twice to reverse course, we twice refused, finding \"[n]o consideration or persuasive reason not presented to the Court in the prior cases\" for disturbing our \"firmly established\" doctrine.  Abbate v. United States, 359 U.\u00a0S. 187, 195; see also Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.\u00a0S. 121.  And then we went on enforcing it, adding another six decades of cases to the doctrine's history.  See, e.g., Puerto Rico v. S\u00e1nchez Valle, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016); Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.\u00a0S. 82 (1985); United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.\u00a0S. 313 (1978); Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.\u00a0S. 22 (1977) (\u00a0per curiam).\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We briefly address two objections to this analysis.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the dissents contend that our dual-sovereignty rule errs in treating the Federal and State Governments as two separate sovereigns when in fact sovereignty belongs to the people.  See post, at 3 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.); post, at 7 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.). This argument is based on a non sequitur.  Yes, our Constitution rests on the principle that the people are sovereign, but that does not mean that they have conferred all the attributes of sovereignty on a single government.  Instead, the people, by adopting the Constitution, \"\u00a0'split the atom of sovereignty.'\u00a0\"  Alden v. Maine, 527 U.\u00a0S. 706, 751 (1999) (alteration omitted) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  As we explained last Term: \n\"When the original States declared their independence, they claimed the powers inherent in sovereignty .\u00a0.\u00a0. .  The Constitution limited but did not abolish the sovereign powers of the States, which retained 'a residuary and inviolable sovereignty.'  The Federalist No. 39, p. 245 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).  Thus, both the Federal Government and the States wield sovereign powers, and that is why our system of government is said to be one of 'dual sovereignty.'  Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.\u00a0S. 452, 457 (1991).\"  Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn., 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 14).\nIt is true that the Republic is \"\u00a0'ONE WHOLE,'\u00a0\" post, at 3 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.) (quoting The Federalist No. 82, p. 493 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton)); accord, post, at 7 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.).  But there is a difference between the whole and a single part, and that difference underlies decisions as foundational to our legal system as McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819).  There, in terms so directly relevant as to seem presciently tailored to answer this very objection, Chief Justice Marshall distinguished precisely between \"the people of a State\" and \"[t]he people of all the States,\" id., at 428, 435; between the \"sovereignty which the people of a single state possess\" and the sovereign powers \"conferred by the people of the United States on the government of the Union,\" id., at 429-430; and thus between \"the action of a part\" and \"the action of the whole,\" id., at 435-436.  In short, McCulloch's famous holding that a State may not tax the national bank rested on a recognition that the States and the Nation have different \"interests\" and \"right[s].\"  Id., 431, 436.  One strains to imagine a clearer statement of the premises of our dual-sovereignty rule, or a more authoritative source.  The United States is a federal republic; it is not, contrary to Justice Gorsuch's suggestion, post, at 10-11, a unitary state like the United Kingdom.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gamble and the dissents lodge a second objection to this line of reasoning.  They suggest that because the division of federal and state power was meant to promote liberty, it cannot support a rule that exposes Gamble to a second sentence.  See post, at 3-4 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.); post, at 8-9 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.).  This argument fundamentally misunderstands the governmental structure established by our Constitution.  Our federal system advances individual liberty in many ways.  Among other things, it limits the powers of the Federal Government and protects certain basic liberties from infringement.  But because the powers of the Federal Government and the States often overlap, allowing both to regulate often results in two layers of regulation.  Taxation is an example that comes immediately to mind.  It is also not at all uncommon for the Federal Government to permit activities that a State chooses to forbid or heavily restrict--for example, gambling and the sale of alcohol.  And a State may choose to legalize an activity that federal law prohibits, such as the sale of marijuana.  So while our system of federalism is fundamental to the protection of liberty, it does not always maximize individual liberty at the expense of other interests.  And it is thus quite extraordinary to say that the venerable dual-sovereignty doctrine represents a \"\u00a0'desecrat[ion]'\u00a0\" of federalism.  Post, at 9 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.).\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gamble claims that our precedent contradicts the common-law rights that the Double Jeopardy Clause was  originally understood to engraft onto the Constitution--rights stemming from the \"common-law pleas of auterfoits acquit [former acquittal] and auterfoits convict [former conviction].\"  Grady, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 530 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  These pleas were treated as \"reason[s] why the prisoner ought not to answer [an indictment] at all, nor put himself upon his trial for the crime alleged.\"  4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 335 (1773) (Blackstone).  Gamble argues that those who ratified the Fifth Amendment understood these common-law principles (which the Amendment constitutionalized) to bar a domestic prosecution following one by a foreign nation.  For support, he appeals to early English and American cases and treatises.  We have highlighted one hurdle to Gamble's reading: the sovereign-specific original meaning of \"offence.\"  But the doctrine of stare decisis is another obstacle.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stare decisis \"promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\"  Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.\u00a0S. 808, 827 (1991).  Of course, it is also important to be right, especially on constitutional matters, where Congress cannot override our errors by ordinary legislation.  But even in constitutional cases, a departure from precedent \"demands special justification.\"  Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U.\u00a0S. 203, 212 (1984).  This means that something more than \"ambiguous historical evidence\" is required before we will \"flatly overrule a number of major decisions of this Court.\"  Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U.\u00a0S. 468, 479 (1987).  And the strength of the case for adhering to such decisions grows in proportion to their \"antiquity.\"  Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U.\u00a0S. 778, 792 (2009).  Here, as noted, Gamble's historical arguments must overcome numerous \"major decisions of this Court\" spanning 170 years.  In light of these factors, Gamble's historical evidence must, at a minimum, be better than middling.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it is not.  The English cases are a muddle.  Treatises offer spotty support.  And early state and federal cases are by turns equivocal and downright harmful to Gamble's position.  All told, this evidence does not establish that those who ratified the Fifth Amendment took it to bar successive prosecutions under different sovereigns' laws--much less do so with enough force to break a chain of precedent linking dozens of cases over 170 years.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gamble's core claim is that early English cases reflect an established common-law rule barring domestic prosecution following a prosecution for the same act under a different sovereign's laws.  But from the very dawn of the common law in medieval England until the adoption of the Fifth Amendment in 1791, there is not one reported decision barring a prosecution based on a prior trial under foreign law.  We repeat: Gamble has not cited and we have not found a single pre-Fifth Amendment case in which a foreign acquittal or conviction barred a second trial in a British or American court.  Given this void, Gamble faces a considerable challenge in convincing us that the Fifth Amendment was originally understood to establish such a bar.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Attempting to show that such a bar was available, Gamble points to five early English decisions for which we have case reports.  We will examine these in some detail, but we note at the outset that they play only a secondary role for Gamble.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The foundation of his argument is a decision for which we have no case report: the prosecution in England in 1677 of a man named Hutchinson.  (We have a report of a decision denying Hutchinson bail but no report of his trial.)  As told by Gamble, Hutchinson, having been tried and acquitted in a foreign court for a murder committed abroad, was accused of the same homicide in an English tribunal, but the English court held that the foreign prosecution barred retrial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Everything for Gamble stems from this one unreported decision.  To the extent that the cases he cites provide any support for his argument--and for the most part, they do not--those cases purport to take their cue from the Hutchinson episode; the same is true of the treatises on which Gamble relies.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So what evidence do we have about what actually happened to Hutchinson?  The most direct evidence is a report of his application for bail before the Court of King's Bench.  The report spans all of one sentence:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"On Habeas Corpus it appeared the Defendant was committed to Newgate on suspicion of Murder in Portugal, which by Mr. Attorny being a Fact out of the Kings Dominions, is not triable by Commission, upon 35 H. 8. Cap. 2. \u00a7. I. N.\u00a02. but by a Constable and Marshal, and the Court refused to Bail him, & c.\"  Rex v. Hutchinson, 3 Keb. 785, 84 Eng. Rep. 1011 (1677).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From this report, all that we can tell about the court's thinking is that it found no convincing reason to grant bail, as was typical in murder cases.3  The rest of the report concerns claims by an attorney.  We are told that he contested the jurisdiction of the commission before which Hutchinson was to be tried, apparently a special commission that would have issued pursuant to a statute enacted under Henry VIII.4  The commission lacked jurisdiction, the attorney seemed to suggest, because the crime had occurred in Portugal and thus \"out of the Kings Dominions.\"  The attorney claimed that jurisdiction lay instead with \"a Constable and Marshal\"--an apparent reference to the High Court of Chivalry, which dealt with treason and murder committed abroad.5  But what, if anything, did the King's Bench make of the attorney's jurisdictional claims?  And more to the point, what happened after bail was denied?  The bail report does not say.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Hutchinson did ultimately appear before the Court of Chivalry--and if that court accepted a plea of prior acquittal in Portugal--this would be paltry evidence of any common-law principle, which is what Gamble cites Hutchinson to establish.  After all, the High Court of Chivalry was a civil-law court prohibited from proceeding under the common law (unlike every other English court of the time save Admiralty).  8 Ric. 2 ch. 5; see also Squibb 162; id., at xxv-xxvi (\"The essential distinction between the Court of Chivalry and other courts is .\u00a0.\u00a0. that it administers justice in relation to those military matters which are not governed by the common law\").  Nor would it be any surprise that we have no report of the proceeding; in fact, \"[t]here is no report of a case in which a judge of the Court [of Chivalry] has set out the reasons for his decision earlier than the [20th] century.\"  Id., at 162.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the end, we have only two early accounts from judges of what finally became of Hutchinson, and both are indirect and shaky.  First, they appear in the reports of cases decided in the Court of Chancery more than a half century after Hutchinson.  Second, both judges cite only one source, and it is of lower authority than their own: namely, an account of Hutchinson given by an interested party  (a defendant) in a previous, non-criminal case--an account on which the court in that case did not rely or even comment.6  Insofar as our two judges seem to add their own details to the Hutchinson saga, we are not told where they obtained this information or whether it reflects mere guesses as to how gaps in the story should be filled in, decades after the fact.  Finally, the two judges' accounts are not entirely consistent.  Still, they are the only early judicial glosses on Hutchinson that we have, so we will work with them.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The more extensive account appears in the case of Gage v. Bulkeley, Ridg. T. H. 263, 27 Eng. Rep. 824 (Ch. 1744), and what the court said there--far from supporting Gamble's argument--cuts against it.  Gage involved a bill in chancery for an account of money deposited with a banker in Paris.  The defendants pleaded, as a bar to this lawsuit, \"a sentence\" \"given upon\" the same demand in a French court.  Ibid.  In addressing this plea, Lord Chancellor Hardwicke first determined that foreign judgments are not binding in an English court of law.  Here his reasoning was very similar to that found in our dual-sovereignty decisions.  Because each judgment rests on the authority of a particular sovereign, the Chancellor thought, it cannot bind foreign courts, which operate by the power of a different sovereign.  Id., at 263-264, 27 Eng. Rep., at 824.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning next to courts of equity, the Lord Chancellor saw no reason that the rule should be any different; there too, he thought, a foreign judgment is not binding.  Id., at 273, 27 Eng. Rep., at 827.  But he did allow that in equity a foreign judgment could serve as \"evidence, which may affect the right of [a plaintiff] when the cause comes to be heard.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Elaborating on why foreign judgments did not bind English courts, whether of law or equity, the Lord Chancellor explained why Hutchinson was \"no proof\" to the contrary.  In the Chancellor's telling, Hutchinson was not indicted by the Court of King's Bench, which could have tried a murder committed in England,7 because that court had no jurisdiction over a homicide committed in Portugal.  Gage, Ridge. T. H., at 271, 27 Eng. Rep., at 826-827.  Instead, Hutchinson was (as the bail decision indicates) before that court on a writ of habeas corpus, and his case \"was referred to the judges to know whether a commission should issue\" under a statute similar to the one mentioned in the bail decision.  Ibid., 27 Eng. Rep., at 827; see 33 Hen. 8 ch. 28 (1541-1542).8  \"And,\" he explained, \"the judges very rightly and mercifully thought not, because he had undergone one trial already.\"  Gage, Ridg. T. H., at 271-272, 27 Eng. Rep., at 827 (emphasis added).  This suggests that Hutchinson was spared retrial as a matter of discretion (\"merc[y]\")--which must be true if the Chancellor was right that foreign judgments were not binding.  Indeed, at least one modern scholar agrees (on other grounds as well) that the result in Hutchinson may have been based on \"expediency rather than law.\"  M. Friedland, Double Jeopardy 362-363 (1969).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the end, then, Gage is doubly damaging to Gamble.  First, it squarely rejects the proposition that a litigant in an English court--even a civil litigant in equity--had a right to the benefit of a foreign judgment, a right that the Fifth Amendment might have codified.  And second, Gage undermines Gamble's chief historical example, Hutchinson, by giving a contrary reading of that case--and doing so, no less, in one of the only two judicial accounts of Hutchinson that we have from before the Fifth Amendment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The other account appears in Burrows v. Jemino, 2 Str. 733, 93 Eng. Rep. 815 (K. B. 1726).9  In Burrows, a party that was sued in England on a bill of exchange sought an injunction against this suit in the Court of Chancery, contending that the suit was barred by the judgment of a court in Italy.  In explaining why he would grant the injunction, Lord Chancellor King cited Hutchinson, which he thought had involved an acquittal in Spanish court that was \"allowed to be a good bar to any proceedings here.\"  2 Str., at 733, 93 Eng. Rep., at 815.  This remark, showing that at least one English judge before the founding saw Hutchinson as Gamble does, provides a modicum of support for Gamble's argument.  But that support softens just a few lines down in the report, where the Chancellor discusses the status of foreign judgments in courts of law in particular (as distinct from courts of equity like his own)--i.e., the courts that actually applied the common-law rules later codified by the Fifth Amendment.   Here the Chancellor explained that while he personally would have accepted an Italian judgment as barring any suit at law, \"other Judges might be of a different opinion.\"  Ibid.  As a whole, then, the Chancellor's comments in Burrows can hardly be cited to prove that the common law had made up its mind on this matter; just the opposite.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gamble's other cases have even less force.  The \"most instructive\" case, he claims, see Brief for Petitioner 13, is the 1775 case of King v. Roche, 1 Leach 134,10 168 Eng. Rep. 169 (K.B.), but that is a curious choice since the Roche court does not so much as mention Hutchinson or even tacitly affirm its supposed holding.  The defendant in Roche entered two pleas: prior acquittal abroad and not guilty of the charged crime.  All that the Roche court held was that, as a procedural matter, it made no sense to charge the jury with both pleas at once, because a finding for Roche on the first (prior acquittal) would, if successful, bar consideration of the second (not guilty).  Roche, 1 Leach, at 135, 168 Eng. Rep., at 169.  But on our key question--whether a plea based on a foreign acquittal could be successful--the Roche court said absolutely nothing; it had no occasion to do so.  Before the prosecution could reply to Roche's plea of prior acquittal, he withdrew it, opting for a full trial.  The name Hutchinson does not appear even in the marginalia of the 1789 edition of Roche, which existed in 1791.  See Captain Roche's Case, 1 Leach at 138-139.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hutchinson is mentioned in connection with Roche only after the Fifth Amendment's ratification, and only in a compiler's annotation to the 1800 edition of the Roche case report.  See 168 Eng. Rep., at 169, n. (a).  That annotation in turn cites one case as support for its reading of Hutchinson: Beak v. Thyrwhit, 3 Mod. 194, 87 Eng. Rep. 124 (K. B. 1688).  But Beak did not involve a foreign prosecution; indeed, it did not involve a prosecution at all. It was an admiralty case for trover and conversion of a ship, and--more to the point--Hutchinson is discussed only in the defendant's argument in that case, not the court's response.  A report relaying the actual decision in Beak shows that the court ultimately said nothing about the defendant's Hutchinson argument one way or another.  See Beake v. Tyrrell, 1 Show. K. B. 6, 89 Eng. Rep. 411 (1688).11  This same defendant's argument was the only source of information about Hutchinson on which the Chancellors in Gage and Burrows explicitly relied, as we noted above.  All later accounts of Hutchinson seem to stem from this one shallow root.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The last of Gamble's five pre-Fifth Amendment cases, Rex v. Thomas, 1 Lev. 118, 83 Eng. Rep. 326 (K. B. 1664), did not even involve a foreign prosecution.  The defendant was indicted for murder in England, and he pleaded a prior acquittal by a Welsh court.  But Wales was then part of the \"kingdom of England\"; its laws were \"the laws of England and no other.\"  1 Blackstone 94-95; see Thomas, 1 Lev., at 118, 83 Eng. Rep., at 326-327.  So the prior trial in Thomas was not under another sovereign's laws, making it totally irrelevant for present purposes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Summing up the import of the preratification cases on which Gamble's argument rests, we have the following: (1) not a single reported case in which a foreign acquittal or conviction barred a later prosecution for the same act in either Britain or America; (2) not a single reported decision in which a foreign judgment was held to be binding in a civil case in a court of law; (3) fragmentary and not entirely consistent evidence about a 17th-century case in which a defendant named Hutchinson, having been tried and acquitted for murder someplace in the Iberian Peninsula, is said to have been spared a second trial for this crime on some ground, perhaps out of \"merc[y],\" not as a matter of right; (4) two cases (one criminal, one in admiralty) in which a party invoked a prior foreign judgment, but the court did not endorse or rest anything on the party's reliance on that judgment; and (5) two Court of Chancery cases actually holding that foreign judgments were not (or not generally) treated as barring trial at common law.  This is the flimsy foundation in case law for Gamble's argument that when the Fifth Amendment was ratified, it was well understood that a foreign criminal judgment would bar retrial for the same act.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Surveying the pre-Fifth Amendment cases in 1959, we concluded that their probative value was \"dubious\" due to \"confused and inadequate reporting.\"  Bartkus, 359 U.\u00a0S., at 128, n. 9.  Our assessment was accurate then, and the passing years have not made those early cases any clearer or more valuable.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not to worry, Gamble responds: Whatever the English courts actually did prior to adoption of the Fifth Amendment, by that time the early English cases were widely thought to support his view.  This is a curious argument indeed.  It would have us hold that the Fifth Amendment codified a common-law right that existed in legend, not case law.  In any event, the evidence that this right was thought to be settled is very thin.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gamble's argument is based on treatises, but they are not nearly as helpful as he claims.  Alone they do not come close to settling the historical question with enough force to meet Gamble's particular burden under stare decisis.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gamble begins with Blackstone, but he reads volumes into a flyspeck.  In the body of his Commentaries, all that Blackstone stated was that successive prosecutions could be barred by prior acquittals by \"any court having competent jurisdiction of the offence.\"  4 Blackstone 335.  This is simply a statement of the general double-jeopardy rule, without a word on separate sovereigns.  So Gamble directs our attention to a footnote that appears after the phrase \"any court having competent jurisdiction.\"  The footnote refers to the report of Beak v. Thyrwhit, which, as noted, merely rehearses the argument of the defendant in that case, who in turn mentioned Hutchinson--but not in a criminal prosecution, much less one preceded by a foreign trial.  This thread tying Blackstone to Hutchinson--a thread woven through footnotes and reports of reports but not a single statement by a court (or even by a party to an actual prosecution)--is tenuous evidence that Blackstone endorsed Gamble's reading of Hutchinson.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Gamble's attorney was asked at argument which other treatises he found most likely to have informed those who ratified the Fifth Amendment, he offered four.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 30-31.  But two of the four treatises did not exist when the Fifth Amendment was ratified.  See 1 J. Chitty, Criminal Law 458 (1816); 1 T. Starkie,  Criminal Pleading 300-301, n. h (1814).  And a third discusses not a single case involving a prior prosecution under foreign law.  See 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown 372 (1739).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That leaves one treatise cited by Gamble that spoke to this issue before ratification, F. Buller, An Introduction to the Law Relative to Trials at Nisi Prius (5th ed. 1788).  That treatise concerned the trial of civil cases, id., at 2, and its discussion of prior judgments appeared under the heading \"Of Evidence in general,\" id., at 221.  After considering the evidentiary value of such documents as acts of Parliament, deeds, and depositions, Buller addressed what we would later call issue preclusion.  Lifting language from an earlier publication, H. Bathurst, The Theory of Evidence 39 (1761), Buller wrote that a final judgment was \"conclusive Evidence\" \"against all the World\" of the factual determinations underlying the judgment.  Buller, Nisi Prius, at 245.  And it is on this basis that Buller (again lifting from Bathurst) said that even someone acquitted of a crime in Spain \"might,\" upon indictment in England, \"plead the Acquittal in Spain in Bar.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This endorsement of the preclusive effect of a foreign judgment in civil litigation (which even today is not uniformly accepted in this country12) provides no direct support for Gamble since his prior judgment was one of conviction, not acquittal.  (There is, after all, a major difference between the preclusive effect of a prior acquittal and that of a prior conviction: Only the first would make a subsequent prosecution pointless, by requiring later courts to assume a defendant's innocence from the start.)  And in any case, the fleeting references in the Buller and Bathurst treatises are hardly sufficient to show that the Members of the First Congress and the state legislators who ratified the Fifth Amendment understood the Double Jeopardy Clause to bar a prosecution in this country after acquittal abroad for the same criminal conduct.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gamble attempts to augment his support by citing treatises published after the Fifth Amendment was adopted.13  And he notes that the Court in District of Columbia  v. Heller, 554 U.\u00a0S. 570, 605-610 (2008), took treatises of a similar vintage to shed light on the public understanding in 1791 of the right codified by the Second Amendment.  But the Heller Court turned to these later treatises only after surveying what it regarded as a wealth of authority for its reading--including the text of the Second Amendment and state constitutions.  The 19th-century treatises were treated as mere confirmation of what the Court thought had already been established.  Here Gamble's evidence as to the understanding in 1791 of the double jeopardy right is not at all comparable.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When we turn from 19th-century treatises to 19th-century state cases, Gamble's argument appears no stronger.  The last time we looked, we found these state cases to be \"inconclusive.\"  Bartkus, 359 U.\u00a0S., at 131.  They seemed to be evenly split and to \"manifest conflict[s] in conscience\" rather than confident conclusions about the common law.  Ibid.  Indeed, two of those cases manifested nothing more than a misreading of a then-recent decision of ours.  Id., at 130.  We see things no differently today.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The distinction between believing successive prosecutions by separate sovereigns unjust and holding them unlawful appears right on the face of the first state case that Gamble discusses.  In State v. Brown, 2 N. C. 100, 101 (1794), the court opined that it would be \"against natural justice\" for a man who stole a horse in the Ohio Territory to be punished for theft in North Carolina just for having brought the horse to that State.  To avoid this result, the Brown court simply construed North Carolina's theft law not to reach the defendant's conduct.  But it did so precisely because the defendant otherwise could face two prosecutions for the same act of theft--despite the common-law rule against double jeopardy for the same \"offence\"--since \"the offence against the laws of this State, and the offence against the laws of [the Ohio Territory] are distinct; and satisfaction made for the offence committed against this State, is no satisfaction for the offence committed against the laws there.\"  Ibid.  Far from undermining the dual-sovereignty rule, Brown expressly affirms it, rejecting outright the idea that a judgment in one sovereign's court could \"be pleadable in bar to an indictment\" in another's.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other state courts were divided.  Massachusetts and Michigan courts thought that at least some trials in either federal or state court could bar prosecution in the other, see Commonwealth v. Fuller, 49 Mass. 313, 318 (1844); Harlan v. People, 1 Doug. 207, 212 (Mich. 1843), but those antebellum cases are poor images of the founding-era common law, resting as they do on what we have explained, see Bartkus, 359 U.\u00a0S., at 130, was a misreading of our then-recent decision in Houston v. Moore, 5 Wheat. 1 (1820), which we discuss below.  A Vermont court did take the same view based on its own analysis of the question, State v. Randall, 2 Aik. 89, 100-101 (1827), but just a few years later a Virginia court declared the opposite, Hendrick v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. 707, 713 (1834) (punishment for forgery under both federal and Virginia law is not double punishment for the \"same offence\" since \"the law of Virginia punishes the forgery, not because it is an offence against the U. States, but because it is an offence against this commonwealth\").  And South Carolina--a perfect emblem of the time--produced cases cutting both ways.  See State v. Antonio, 2 Tread. 776, 781 (1816); State v. Tutt, 2 Bail. 44, 47-48 (1831).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is not the quantum of support for Gamble's claim about early American common law that might withstand his burden under stare decisis.  And once we look beyond the Nation's earliest years, the body of state-court decisions appears even less helpful to Gamble's position.  We aptly summarized those cases in Bartkus, 359 U.\u00a0S., at 134-136, and need not add to that discussion here.14\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Less useful still, for Gamble's purposes, are the two early Supreme Court cases on which he relies.  In the first, a member of the Pennsylvania militia was tried by a state court-martial for the federal offense of deserting the militia.  See Houston v. Moore, 5 Wheat. 1 (1820).  The accused objected that the state court-martial lacked jurisdiction to try this federal offense.  Since the offense could be tried in federal court, the defendant argued, allowing the state court-martial to try him for this crime could expose him to successive federal and state prosecutions for the same offense.  Justice Washington answered that a ruling in either federal or state court would bar a second trial in the other.  See id., at 31.  But as we later explained,\n\"that language by Mr. Justice Washington reflected his belief that the state statute imposed state sanctions for violation of a federal criminal law.  As he viewed the matter, the two trials would not be of similar crimes arising out of the same conduct; they would be of the same crime.  Mr. Justice Johnson agreed that if the state courts had become empowered to try the defendant for the federal offense, then such a state trial would bar a federal prosecution.  Thus Houston v. Moore can be cited only for the presence of a bar in a case in which the second trial is for a violation of the very statute whose violation by the same conduct has already been tried in the courts of another government empowered to try that question.\"  Bartkus, 359 U.\u00a0S., at 130 (citations omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In other words, Justice Washington taught only that the law prohibits two sovereigns (in that case, Pennsylvania and the United States) from both trying an offense against one of them (the United States).  That is consistent with our doctrine allowing successive prosecutions for offenses against separate sovereigns.  In light of this reading of Houston, the case does not undercut our dual-sovereignty doctrine.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It may seem strange to think of state courts as prosecuting crimes against the United States, but that is just what state courts and commentators writing within a decade of Houston thought it involved.  See, e.g., Tutt, 2 Bail., at 47 (\"In [Houston], the act punished by the law of the State, was certainly and exclusively an offence against the general Government .\u00a0.\u00a0. [whereas h]ere, certainly there is an offence against the State, and a very different one from that committed against the United States\" (emphasis added)); 1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 373-374 (1826) (\"[M]any .\u00a0.\u00a0. acts of [C]ongress .\u00a0.\u00a0. permit jurisdiction, over the offences therein described, to be exercised by state magistrates and courts,\" and what Houston bars are successive prosecutions for the same \"crime against the United States\").  Even the scholar Gamble cites for his cause finds Houston not \"[o]n point\" because it \"was discussing the jurisdiction of the state court to try a crime against the nation and impose a fine payable to the latter government.\" Grant, Successive Prosecutions by State and Nation: Common Law and British Empire Comparisons, 4 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 7, and n. 27 (1956) (citing Warren, Federal Criminal Laws and the State Courts, 38 Harv. L. Rev. 545 (1925)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps feeling Houston wobble, Gamble says pre-emptively that if it is \"inconclusive,\" Brief for Petitioner 26, other cases are clear.  But the other federal case on which he leans is worse for his argument.  In United States v. Furlong, 5 Wheat. 184, 197 (1820), we said that an acquittal of piracy in the court of any \"civilized State\" would bar prosecution in any other nation because piracy, as an \"offence within the criminal jurisdiction of all nations,\" is \"punished by all.\"15  Ending his quotation from Furlong at this point, Gamble gives the impression that Furlong rejects any dual-sovereignty rule.  But that impression is shattered by the next sentence: \"Not so with the crime of murder.\"  Ibid.  As to that crime, the Furlong Court was \"inclined to think that an acquittal\" in the United States \"would not have been a good plea in a Court of Great Britain.\"  Ibid. (emphasis added).  And that was precisely because murder is \"punishable under the laws of each State\" rather than falling under some \"universal jurisdiction.\"  Ibid. (emphasis added).  When it came to crimes that were understood to offend against more than one sovereign, Furlong treated them as separate offenses--just as we have a dozen times since, and just as we do today.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, of the two federal cases that Gamble cites against the dual-sovereignty rule, Houston squares with it and Furlong supports it.  Together with the muddle in the early state cases, this undermines Gamble's claim that the early American bench and bar took the Fifth Amendment to proscribe successive prosecutions by different sovereigns.  And without making a splash in the legal practice of the time, a few early treatises by themselves cannot unsettle almost two centuries of precedent.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Besides appealing to the remote past, Gamble contends that recent changes--one doctrinal, one practical--blunt the force of stare decisis here.  They do not.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If historical claims form the chorus of Gamble's argument, his refrain is \"incorporation.\"  In Gamble's telling, the recognition of the Double Jeopardy Clause's incorporation against the States, see Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.\u00a0S. 784, 794 (1969), washed away any theoretical foundation for the dual-sovereignty rule, see United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.\u00a0S. 506, 521 (1995) (abrogating precedent when \"subsequent decisions of this Court\" have \"eroded\" its foundations).  But this incorporation-changes-everything argument trades on a false analogy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The analogy Gamble draws is to the evolution of our doctrine on the Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures.16  We have long enforced this right by barring courts from relying on evidence gathered in an illegal search.  Thus, in Weeks v. United States, 232 U.\u00a0S. 383, 391-393 (1914), the Court held that federal prosecutors could not rely on the fruits of an unreasonable search undertaken by federal agents.  But what if state or local police conducted a search that would have violated the Fourth Amendment if conducted by federal agents?  Before incorporation, the state search would not have violated the Federal Constitution, so federal law would not have barred admission of the resulting evidence in a state prosecution.  But by the very same token, under what was termed \"the silver-platter doctrine,\" state authorities could hand such evidence over to federal prosecutors for use in a federal case.  See id., at 398.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once the Fourth Amendment was held to apply to the States as well as the Federal Government, however, the silver-platter doctrine was scuttled.  See Elkins v. United States, 364 U.\u00a0S. 206 (1960); Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.\u00a0S. 25 (1949).  Now the fruits of unreasonable state searches are inadmissible in federal and state courts alike.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gamble contends that the incorporation of the Double Jeopardy Clause should likewise end the dual-sovereignty rule, but his analogy fails.  The silver-platter doctrine was based on the fact that the state searches to which it applied did not at that time violate federal law.  Once the Fourth Amendment was incorporated against the States, the status of those state searches changed.  Now they did violate federal law, so the basis for the silver-platter doctrine was gone.  See Elkins, 364 U.\u00a0S., at 213 (\"The foundation upon which the admissibility of state-seized evidence in a federal trial originally rested--that unreasonable state searches did not violate the Federal Constitution--thus disappeared [with incorporation]\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, the premises of the dual-sovereignty doctrine have survived incorporation intact.  Incorporation meant that the States were now required to abide by this Court's interpretation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  But that interpretation has long included the dual-sovereignty doctrine, and there is no logical reason why incorporation should change it.  After all, the doctrine rests on the fact that only same-sovereign successive prosecutions are prosecutions for the \"same offense,\" see Part II, supra--and that is just as true after incorporation as before.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If incorporation is the doctrinal shift that Gamble invokes to justify a departure from precedent, the practical change he cites is the proliferation of federal criminal law.  Gamble says that the resulting overlap of federal and criminal codes heightens the risk of successive prosecutions under state and federal law for the same criminal conduct.  Thus, Gamble contends, our precedent should yield to \"\u00a0'far-reaching systemic and structural changes'\u00a0\" that make our \"earlier error all the more egregious and harmful.\"  South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 18).  But unlike Gamble's appeal to incorporation, this argument obviously assumes that the dual-sovereignty doctrine was legal error from the start.  So the argument is only as strong as Gamble's argument about the original understanding of double jeopardy rights, an argument that we have found wanting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Insofar as the expansion of the reach of federal criminal law has been questioned on constitutional rather than policy grounds, the argument has focused on whether Congress has overstepped its legislative powers under the Constitution.  See, e.g., Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.\u00a0S. 1, 57-74 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Eliminating the dual-sovereignty rule would do little to trim the reach of federal criminal law, and it would not even prevent many successive state and federal prosecutions for the same criminal conduct unless we also overruled the long-settled rule that an \"offence\" for double jeopardy purposes is defined by statutory elements, not by what might be described in a looser sense as a unit of criminal conduct.  See Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.\u00a0S. 299 (1932).  Perhaps believing that two revolutionary assaults in the same case would be too much, Gamble has not asked us to overrule Blockburger along with the dual-sovereignty rule.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nThomas, J., concurring\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-646\nTERANCE MARTEZ GAMBLE, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\n[June 17, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, concurring.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I agree that the historical record does not bear out my initial skepticism of the dual-sovereignty doctrine.  See Puerto Rico v. S\u00e1nchez Valle, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016) (Ginsburg, J., joined by Thomas, J. concurring).   The founding generation foresaw very limited potential for overlapping criminal prosecutions by the States and the Federal Government.1  The Founders therefore had no reason to address the double jeopardy question that the Court resolves today.  Given their understanding of Congress' limited criminal jurisdiction and the absence of an analogous dual-sovereign system in England, it is difficult to conclude that the People who ratified the Fifth Amendment understood it to prohibit prosecution by a State and the Federal Government for the same offense.  And, of course, we are not entitled to interpret the Constitution to align it with our personal sensibilities about \"\u00a0'unjust'\u00a0\" prosecutions.  Post, at 6 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); see Currier v. Virginia, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 16) (\"While the growing number of criminal offenses in our statute books may be cause for concern, no one should expect (or want) judges to revise the Constitution to address every social problem they happen to perceive\" (citation omitted)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I write separately to address the proper role of the doctrine of stare decisis.  In my view, the Court's typical formulation of the stare decisis standard does not comport with our judicial duty under Article III because it elevates demonstrably erroneous decisions--meaning decisions outside the realm of permissible interpretation--over the text of the Constitution and other duly enacted federal law.  It is always \"tempting for judges to confuse our own preferences with the requirements of the law,\" Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3), and the Court's stare decisis doctrine exacerbates that temptation by giving the venire of respectability to our continued application of demonstrably incorrect precedents.  By applying demonstrably erroneous precedent instead of the relevant law's text--as the Court is particularly prone to do when expanding federal power or crafting new individual rights--the Court exercises \"force\" and \"will,\" two attributes the People did not give it.  The Federalist No. 78, p. 465 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (capitalization omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We should restore our stare decisis jurisprudence to ensure that we exercise \"mer[e] judgment,\" ibid., which can be achieved through adherence to the correct, original meaning of the laws we are charged with applying.  In my view, anything less invites arbitrariness into judging.2\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court currently views stare decisis as a \"\u00a0'principle of policy'\u00a0\" that balances several factors to decide whether the scales tip in favor of overruling precedent.  Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm'n, 558 U.\u00a0S. 310, 363 (2010) (quoting Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U.\u00a0S. 106, 119 (1940)).  Among these factors are the \"workability\" of the standard, \"the antiquity of the precedent, the reliance interests at stake, and of course whether the decision was well reasoned.\"  Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U.\u00a0S. 778, 792-793 (2009).  The influence of this last factor tends to ebb and flow with the Court's desire to achieve a particular end, and the Court may cite additional, ad hoc factors to reinforce the result it chooses.  But the shared theme is the need for a \"special reason over and above the belief that a prior case was wrongly decided\" to overrule a precedent.  Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.\u00a0S. 833, 864 (1992).  The Court has advanced this view of stare decisis on the ground that \"it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles\" and \"contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\"  Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.\u00a0S. 808, 827 (1991).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This approach to stare decisis might have made sense in a common-law legal system in which courts systematically developed the law through judicial decisions apart from written law.  But our federal system is different.  The Constitution tasks the political branches--not the Judiciary--with systematically developing the laws that govern our society.  The Court's role, by contrast, is to exercise the \"judicial Power,\" faithfully interpreting the Constitution and the laws enacted by those branches.  Art.\u00a0III, \u00a71.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A proper understanding of stare decisis in our constitutional structure requires a proper understanding of the nature of the \"judicial Power\" vested in the federal courts.  That \"Power\" is--as Chief Justice Marshall put it--the power \"to say what the law is\" in the context of a particular \"case\" or \"controversy\" before the court.  Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803); Art.\u00a0III, \u00a72.  Phrased differently, the \"judicial Power\" \"is fundamentally the power to decide cases in accordance with law.\"  Lawson, The Constitutional Case Against Precedent, 17 Harv. J.\u00a0L. & Pub. Pol'y 23, 26 (1994) (Lawson).  It refers to the duty to exercise \"judicial discretion\" as distinct from \"arbitrary discretion.\"  The Federalist No. 78, at 468, 471.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That means two things, the first prohibitory and the second obligatory.  First, the Judiciary lacks \"force\" (the power to execute the law) and \"will\" (the power to legislate).  Id., at 465 (capitalization omitted).  Those powers are vested in the President and Congress, respectively.  \"Judicial power is never exercised for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the Judge; always for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the Legislature; or, in other words, to the will of the law.\"  Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 866 (1824) (Marshall, C.\u00a0J.).  The Judiciary thus may not \"substitute [its] own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature.\"  The Federalist No. 78, at 468-469.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, \"judicial discretion\" requires the \"liquidat[ion]\" or \"ascertain[ment]\" of the meaning of the law.  Id., at 467-468; see id., No. 37.  At the time of the founding, \"to liquidate\" meant \"to make clear or plain\"; \"to render unambiguous; to settle (differences, disputes).\"  Nelson, Stare Decisis and Demonstrably Erroneous Precedents, 87 Va. L.\u00a0Rev. 1, 13, and n.\u00a035 (2001) (Nelson) (quoting 8 Oxford English Dictionary 1012 (2d ed. 1991); (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Therefore, judicial discretion is not the power to \"alter\" the law; it is the duty to correctly \"expound\" it.  Letter from J. Madison to N. Trist (Dec. 1831), in 9 The Writings of James Madison 477 (G. Hunt ed. 1910) (Writings of Madison).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This understanding of the judicial power had long been accepted at the time of the founding.  But the federalist structure of the constitutional plan had significant implications for the exercise of that power by the newly created Federal Judiciary.  Whereas the common-law courts of England discerned and defined many legal principles in the first instance, the Constitution charged federal courts primarily with applying a limited body of written laws articulating those legal principles.  This shift profoundly affects the application of stare decisis today.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stare decisis has its pedigree in the unwritten common law of England.  As Blackstone explained, the common law included \"[e]stablished customs\" and \"[e]stablished rules and maxims\" that were discerned and articulated by judges.  1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 68-69 (1765) (Blackstone).  In the common-law system, stare decisis played an important role because \"judicial decisions [were] the principal and most authoritative evidence, that [could] be given, of the existence of such a custom as shall form a part of the common law.\"  Id., at 69.  Accordingly, \"precedents and rules must be followed, unless flatly absurd or unjust,\" because a judge must issue judgments \"according to the known laws and customs of the land\" and not \"according to his private sentiments\" or \"own private judgment.\"  Id., at 69-70.  In other words, judges were expected to adhere to precedents because they embodied the very law the judges were bound to apply.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"[C]ommon law doctrines, as articulated by judges, were seen as principles that had been discovered rather than new laws that were being made.\"  3-4 G. White, The Marshall Court and Cultural Change, 1815-35, History of the Supreme Court of the United States 129 (1988).3  \"It was the application of the dictates of natural justice, and of cultivated reason, to particular cases.\"  1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 439 (1826) (Kent); see id., at 439-440 (the common law is \"\u00a0'not the product of the wisdom of some one man, or society of men, in any one age; but of the wisdom, counsel, experience, and observation, of many ages of wise and observing men'\u00a0\").  The common law therefore rested on \"unarticulated social processes to mobilize and coordinate knowledge\" gained primarily through \"the social experience of the many,\" rather than the \"specifically articulated reason of the few.\"  T. Sowell, A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles 49, 42 (1987).  In other words, the common law was based in the collective, systematic development of the law through reason.  See id., at 49-55.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Importantly, however, the common law did not view precedent as unyielding when it was \"most evidently contrary to reason\" or \"divine law.\"  Blackstone 69-70.  The founding generation recognized that a \"judge may mistake the law.\"  Id., at 71; see also 1 Kent 444 (\"Even a series of decisions are not always conclusive evidence of what is law\").  And according to Blackstone, judges should disregard precedent that articulates a rule incorrectly when necessary \"to vindicate the old [rule] from misrepresentation.\"  Blackstone 70; see also 1 Kent 443 (\"If .\u00a0.\u00a0. any solemnly adjudged case can be shown to be founded in error, it is no doubt the right and the duty of the judges who have a similar case before them, to correct the error\").  He went further: When a \"former decision is manifestly absurd or unjust\" or fails to conform to reason, it is not simply \"bad law,\" but \"not law\" at all.  Blackstone 70 (emphasis).  This view--that demonstrably erroneous \"blunders\" of prior courts should be corrected--was accepted by state courts throughout the 19th century.  See, e.g., McDowell v. Oyer, 21 Pa. 417, 423 (1853); Guild v. Eager, 17 Mass. 615, 622 (1822).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This view of precedent implies that even common-law judges did not act as legislators, inserting their own preferences into the law as it developed.  Instead, consistent with the nature of the judicial power, common-law judges were tasked with identifying and applying objective principles of law--discerned from natural reason, custom, and other external sources--to particular cases.  See Nelson 23-27.  Thus, the founding generation understood that an important function of the Judiciary in a common-law system was to ascertain what reason or custom required; that it was possible for courts to err in doing so; and that it was the Judiciary's responsibility to \"examin[e] without fear, and revis[e] without reluctance,\" any \"hasty and crude decisions\" rather than leaving \"the character of [the] law impaired, and the beauty and harmony of the system destroyed by the perpetuity of error.\"  1 Kent 444.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Federal courts today look to different sources of law when exercising the judicial power than did the common-law courts of England.  The Court has long held that \"[t]here is no federal general common law.\"  Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.\u00a0S. 64, 78 (1938).  Instead, the federal courts primarily interpret and apply three bodies of federal positive law--the Constitution; federal statutes, rules, and regulations; and treaties.4  That removes most (if  not all) of the force that stare decisis held in the English common-law system, where judicial precedents were among the only documents identifying the governing \"customs\" or \"rules and maxims.\"  Blackstone 68.  We operate in a system of written law in which courts need not--and generally cannot--articulate the law in the first instance.  See U.\u00a0S. Const., Art.\u00a0I, \u00a71 (vesting \"[a]ll legislative Powers\" in Congress); Art. 1, \u00a77 (describing the bicameralism and presentment process).  The Constitution, federal statutes, and treaties are the law, and the systematic development of the law is accomplished democratically.  Our judicial task is modest: We interpret and apply written law to the facts of particular cases.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Underlying this legal system is the key premise that words, including written laws, are capable of objective, ascertainable meaning.  As I have previously explained, \"[m]y vision of the process of judging is unabashedly based on the proposition that there are right and wrong answers to legal questions.\"  Thomas, Judging, 45 U. Kan. L.\u00a0Rev. 1, 5 (1996).  Accordingly, judicial decisions may incorrectly interpret the law, and when they do, subsequent courts must confront the question when to depart from them.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given that the primary role of federal courts today is to interpret legal texts with ascertainable meanings, precedent plays a different role in our exercise of the \"judicial Power\" than it did at common law.  In my view, if the Court encounters a decision that is demonstrably erroneous--i.e., one that is not a permissible interpretation of the text--the Court should correct the error, regardless of whether other factors support overruling the precedent.  Federal courts may (but need not) adhere to an incorrect decision as precedent, but only when traditional tools of legal interpretation show that the earlier decision adopted a textually permissible interpretation of the law.  A demonstrably incorrect judicial decision, by contrast, is tantamount to making law, and adhering to it both disregards the supremacy of the Constitution and perpetuates a usurpation of the legislative power.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When faced with a demonstrably erroneous precedent, my rule is simple: We should not follow it.  This view of stare decisis follows directly from the Constitution's supremacy over other sources of law--including our own precedents.  That the Constitution outranks other sources of law is inherent in its nature.  See A. Amar, America's Constitution 5 (2005) (explaining that the Constitution is a constitutive document); Kesavan, The Three Tiers of Federal Law, 100 NW.U. L. Rev. 1479, 1499, n.\u00a099 (2006) (arguing that \"[i]t is unnecessary for the Constitution to specify that it is superior to other law because it is higher law made by We the People--and the only such law\").  The Constitution's supremacy is also reflected in its requirement that all judicial officers, executive officers, Congressmen, and state legislators take an oath to \"support this Constitution.\"  Art.\u00a0VI, cl. 3; see also Art.\u00a0II, \u00a71, cl. 8 (requiring the President to \"solemnly swear (or affirm)\" to \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States\").  Notably, the Constitution does not mandate that judicial officers swear to uphold judicial precedents.  And the Court has long recognized the supremacy of the Constitution with respect to executive action and \"legislative act[s] repugnant to\" it.  Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 177; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.\u00a0S. 579, 587-589 (1952); see also The Federalist No. 78, at 467 (\"No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same goes for judicial precedent.  The \"judicial Power\" must be understood in light of \"the Constitution's status as the supreme legal document\" over \"lesser sources of law.\"  Lawson, 29-30.  This status necessarily limits \"the power of a court to give legal effect to prior judicial decisions\" that articulate demonstrably erroneous interpretations of the Constitution because those prior decisions cannot take precedence over the Constitution itself.  Ibid.  Put differently, because the Constitution is supreme over other sources of law, it requires us to privilege its text over our own precedents when the two are in conflict.  I am aware of no legitimate reason why a court may privilege a demonstrably erroneous interpretation of the Constitution over the Constitution itself.5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same principle applies when interpreting statutes and other sources of law: If a prior decision demonstrably erred in interpreting such a law, federal judges should exercise the judicial power--not perpetuate a usurpation of the legislative power--and correct the error.  A contrary rule would permit judges to \"substitute their own pleasure\" for the law.  The Federalist No. 78, at 468; see id., at 466 (\"\u00a0'[T]here is no liberty if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers'\u00a0\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, my view of stare decisis requires adherence to decisions made by the People--that is, to the original understanding of the relevant legal text--which may not align with decisions made by the Court.  Accord, Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 16 How. 314, 343-344 (1854) (Daniel, J., dissenting) (\"Wherever the Constitution commands, discretion terminates\" because continued adherence to \"palpable error\" is a \"violation of duty, an usurpation\"); Commonwealth v. Posey, 8 Va. 109, 116 (1787) (opinion of Tazewell, J.) (\"[A]lthough I venerate precedents, I venerate the written law more\").  Thus, no \"\u00a0'special justification'\u00a0\" is needed for a federal court to depart from its own, demonstrably erroneous precedent.  Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc., 573 U.\u00a0S. 258, 266 (2014); see Nelson 62.  Considerations beyond the correct legal meaning, including reliance, workability, and whether a precedent \"has become well embedded in national culture,\" S. Breyer, Making our Democracy Work: A Judge's View 152 (2010), are inapposite.  In our constitutional structure, our role of upholding the law's original meaning is reason enough to correct course.6\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although precedent does not supersede the original meaning of a legal text, it may remain relevant when it is not demonstrably erroneous.  As discussed, the \"judicial Power\" requires the Court to clarify and settle--or, as Madison and Hamilton put it, to \"liquidate\"--the meaning of written laws.  The Federalist No. 78, at 468 (\"[I]t is the province of the courts to liquidate and fix [the] meaning and operation [of contradictory laws]\"); The Federalist No. 37, at 229 (explaining that the indeterminacy of laws requires courts to \"liquidat[e] and ascertai[n]\" their meaning \"by a series of particular discussions and adjudications\").  This need to liquidate arises from the inability of human language to be fully unequivocal in every context.  Written laws \"have a range of indeterminacy,\" and reasonable people may therefore arrive at different conclusions about the original meaning of a legal text after employing all relevant tools of interpretation.  See Nelson 11, 14.  It is within that range of permissible interpretations that precedent is relevant.  If, for example, the meaning of a statute has been \"liquidated\" in a way that is not demonstrably erroneous (i.e., not an impermissible interpretation of the text), the judicial policy of stare decisis permits courts to constitutionally adhere to that interpretation, even if a later court might have ruled another way as a matter of first impression.  Of course, a subsequent court may nonetheless conclude that an incorrect precedent should be abandoned, even if the precedent might fall within the range of permissible interpretations.  But nothing in the Constitution requires courts to take that step.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Put another way, there is room for honest disagreement, even as we endeavor to find the correct answer.  Compare ___ U.\u00a0S. ___, 358-371 ( ) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (concluding that the \"historical evidence from the framing\" supports the view that the First Amendment permitted anonymous speech), with id., at 371-385 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (concluding that the First Amendment does not protect anonymous speech based on a century of practice in the States).  Reasonable jurists can apply traditional tools of construction and arrive at different interpretations of legal texts.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"[L]iquidating\" indeterminacies in written laws is far removed from expanding or altering them.  See Writings of Madison 477 (explaining that judicial decisions cannot \"alter\" the Constitution, only \"expound\" it).  The original meaning of legal texts \"usually .\u00a0.\u00a0. is easy to discern and simple to apply.\"  A. Scalia, Common Law Courts in a Civil-Law System, in A Matter of Interpretation: Federal Courts and the Law 45 (A. Gutmann ed. 1997).  And even in difficult cases, that the original meaning is not obvious at first blush does not excuse the Court from diligently pursuing that meaning.  Stopping the interpretive inquiry short--or allowing personal views to color it--permits courts to substitute their own preferences over the text.  Although the law may be, on rare occasion, truly ambiguous--meaning susceptible to multiple, equally correct legal meanings--the law never \"runs out\" in the sense that a Court may adopt an interpretation beyond the bounds of permissible construction.7  In that regard, a legal text is not capable of multiple permissible interpretations merely because discerning its original meaning \"requires a taxing inquiry.\"  Pauley v. BethEnergy Mines, Inc., 501 U.\u00a0S. 680, 707 (1991) (Scalia, J., dissenting).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case is a good example.  The historical record presents knotty issues about the original meaning of the Fifth Amendment, and Justice Gorsuch does an admirable job arguing against our longstanding interpretation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Although Justice Gorsuch identifies support for his view in several postratification treatises, see post, at 13-15 (dissenting opinion), I do not find these treatises conclusive without a stronger showing that they reflected the understanding of the Fifth Amendment at the time of ratification.  At that time, the common law certainly had not coalesced around this view, see ante, at 10-21, and petitioner has not pointed to contemporaneous judicial opinions or other evidence establishing that his view was widely shared.  This lack of evidence, coupled with the unique two-sovereign federalist system created by our Constitution, leaves petitioner to rely on a general argument about \"liberty.\"  Ultimately, I am not persuaded that our precedent is incorrect as an original matter, much less demonstrably erroneous.\n3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although this case involves a constitutional provision, I would apply the same stare decisis principles to matters of statutory interpretation.  I am not aware of any legal (as opposed to practical) basis for applying a heightened version of stare decisis to statutory-interpretation decisions.  Statutes are easier to amend than the Constitution, but our judicial duty is to apply the law to the facts of the case, regardless of how easy it is for the law to change.  Cf. Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.\u00a0S. 371, 402 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (explaining that \"the realities of the legislative process\" will \"often preclude readopting the original meaning of a statute that we have upset\").  Moreover, to the extent the Court has justified statutory stare decisis based on legislative inaction, this view is based on the \"patently false premise that the correctness of statutory construction is to be measured by what the current Congress desires, rather than by what the law as enacted meant.\"  Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara Cty., 480 U.\u00a0S. 616, 671 (1987) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Finally, even if congressional silence could be meaningfully understood as acquiescence, it still falls short of the bicameralism and presentment required by Article I and therefore is not a \"valid way for our elected representatives to express their collective judgment.\"  Nelson 76.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons explained above, the Court's multifactor approach to stare decisis invites conflict with its constitutional duty.  Whatever benefits may be seen to inhere in that approach--e.g., \"stability\" in the law, preservation of reliance interests, or judicial \"humility,\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 20, 41-42--they cannot overcome that fundamental flaw.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, these oft-cited benefits are frequently illusory.  The Court's multifactor balancing test for invoking stare decisis has resulted in policy-driven, \"arbitrary discretion.\"  The Federalist No. 78, at 471.  The inquiry attempts to quantify the unquantifiable and, by frequently sweeping in subjective factors, provides a ready means of justifying whatever result five Members of the Court seek to achieve.  See Holder v. Hall, 512 U.\u00a0S. 874, 943-944 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (describing a \"\u00a0'totality of circumstances'\u00a0\" test as \"an empty incantation--a mere conjurer's trick\"); Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.\u00a0S. 558, 577 (2003) (acknowledging that stare decisis is \"\u00a0'a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula'\u00a0\"); see also Casey, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 854-856 (invoking the \"kind of reliance that would lend a special hardship to the consequences of overruling and add inequity to the cost of repudiation\").  These are not legal questions with right and wrong answers; they are policy choices.  See, e.g., A. Goldberg, Equal Justice: The Warren Era of the Supreme Court 96 (1971) (\"[T]his concept of stare decisis both justifies the overruling involved in the expansion of human liberties during the Warren years and counsels against  the future overruling of the Warren Court libertarian decisions\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Members of this Court have lamented the supposed \"uncertainty\" created when the Court overrules its precedent.  See Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Hyatt, ante, at ___-___ (Breyer, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 12-13).  But see Lawrence, supra, at 577 (asserting that not overruling precedent would \"caus[e] uncertainty\").  As I see it, we would eliminate a significant amount of uncertainty and provide the very stability sought if we replaced our malleable balancing test with a clear, principled rule grounded in the meaning of the text.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The true irony of our modern stare decisis doctrine lies in the fact that proponents of stare decisis tend to invoke it most fervently when the precedent at issue is least defensible.  See, e.g., Holder, supra, at 944-945 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (\"Stare decisis should not bind the Court to an interpretation of the Voting Rights Act that was based on a flawed method of statutory construction from its inception\" and that has created \"an irreconcilable conflict\" between the Act and the Equal Protection Clause and requires \"methodically carving the country into racially designated electoral districts\").  It is no secret that stare decisis has had a \"ratchet-like effect,\" cementing certain grievous departures from the law into the Court's jurisprudence.  Goldberg, supra, at 96.  Perhaps the most egregious example of this illegitimate use of stare decisis can be found in our \"substantive due process\" jurisprudence.  McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.\u00a0S. 742, 811 (2010) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  The Court does not seriously defend the \"legal fiction\" of substantive due process as consistent with the original understanding of the Due Process Clause.  Ibid.  And as I have explained before, \"this fiction is a particularly dangerous one\" because it \"lack[s] a guiding principle to distinguish 'fundamental' rights that warrant protection from nonfundamental rights that do not.\"  Ibid.  Unfortunately, the Court has doggedly adhered to these erroneous substantive-due-process precedents again and again, often to disastrous ends.  See, e.g., Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.\u00a0S. 914, 982 (2000) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\"The standard set forth in the Casey plurality has no historical or doctrinal pedigree\" and \"is the product of its authors' own philosophical views about abortion\" with \"no origins in or relationship to the Constitution\").  Likewise, the Court refuses to reexamine its jurisprudence about the Privileges or Immunities Clause, thereby relegating a \"\u00a0'clause in the constitution'\u00a0\" \"\u00a0'to be without effect.'\u00a0\"  McDonald, supra, at 813 (quoting Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 174); see Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (criticizing the Court's incorporation doctrine through a clause that addresses procedures).  No subjective balancing test can justify such a wholesale disregard of the People's individual rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our judicial duty to interpret the law requires adherence to the original meaning of the text.  For that reason, we should not invoke stare decisis to uphold precedents that are demonstrably erroneous.  Because petitioner and the dissenting opinions have not shown that the Court's dual-sovereignty doctrine is incorrect, much less demonstrably erroneous, I concur in the majority's opinion.\n\nGinsburg, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-646\nTERANCE MARTEZ GAMBLE, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\n[June, 17, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Ginsburg, dissenting\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Terance Martez Gamble pleaded guilty in Alabama state court to both possession of a firearm by a person convicted of \"a crime of violence\" and drug possession, and was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, all but one year suspended.  Apparently regarding Alabama's sentence as too lenient, federal prosecutors pursued a parallel charge, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of federal law.  Gamble again pleaded guilty and received nearly three more years in prison.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had either the Federal Government or Alabama brought the successive prosecutions, the second would have violated Gamble's right not to be \"twice put in jeopardy .\u00a0.\u00a0. for the same offence.\"  U.\u00a0S. Const., Amdt.\u00a05, cl.\u00a02.  Yet the Federal Government was able to multiply Gamble's time in prison because of the doctrine that, for double jeopardy purposes, identical criminal laws enacted by \"separate sovereigns\" are different \"offence[s].\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I dissent from the Court's adherence to that misguided doctrine.  Instead of \"fritter[ing] away [Gamble's] libert[y] upon a metaphysical subtlety, two sovereignties,\" Grant, The Lanza Rule of Successive Prosecutions, 32 Colum. L.\u00a0Rev. 1309, 1331 (1932), I would hold that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars \"successive prosecutions [for the same offense] by parts of the whole USA.\"  Puerto Rico v. S\u00e1nchez Valle, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2).\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gamble urges that the Double Jeopardy Clause incorporates English common law.  That law, he maintains, recognized a foreign acquittal or conviction as a bar to retrial in England for the same offense.  See Brief for Petitioner 11-15.  The Court, in turn, strives mightily to refute Gamble's account of the common law.  See ante, at 8-21.  This case, however, does not call for an inquiry into whether and when an 18th-century English court would have credited a foreign court's judgment in a criminal case.  Gamble was convicted in both Alabama and the United States, jurisdictions that are not foreign to each other.  English court decisions regarding the respect due to a foreign nation's judgment are therefore inapposite.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In United States v. Lanza, 260 U.\u00a0S. 377 (1922), this Court held that \"an act denounced as a crime by both national and state sovereignties is an offense against the peace and dignity of both and may be punished by each.\"  Id., at 382.  Decades later, a sharply divided Court reaffirmed this separate-sovereigns doctrine.  Abbate v. United States, 359 U.\u00a0S. 187 (1959); Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.\u00a0S. 121 (1959).  I would not cling to those ill-advised decisions.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justification for the separate-sovereigns doctrine centers on the word \"offence\": An \"offence,\" the argument runs, is the violation of a sovereign's law, the United States and each State are separate sovereigns, ergo successive state and federal prosecutions do not place a defendant in \"jeopardy .\u00a0.\u00a0. for the same offence.\"  Ante, at 1, 3-4 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This \"compact syllogism\" is fatally flawed.  See Braun, Praying to False Sovereigns: The Rule Permitting Successive Prosecutions in the Age of Cooperative Federalism, 20 Am. J. Crim. L. 1, 25 (1992).  The United States and its constituent States, unlike foreign nations, are \"kindred systems,\" \"parts of ONE WHOLE.\"  The Federalist No. 82, p. 493 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).  They compose one people, bound by an overriding Federal Constitution.  Within that \"WHOLE,\" the Federal and State Governments should be disabled from accomplishing together \"what neither government [could] do alone--prosecute an ordinary citizen twice for the same offence.\"  Amar & Marcus, Double Jeopardy Law After Rodney King, 95 Colum.\u00a0L.\u00a0Rev. 1, 2 (1995).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The notion that the Federal Government and the States are separate sovereigns overlooks a basic tenet of our federal system.  The doctrine treats governments as sovereign, with state power to prosecute carried over from years predating the Constitution.  See Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.\u00a0S. 82, 89 (1985) (citing Lanza, 260 U.\u00a0S., at 382).  In the system established by the Federal Constitution, however, \"ultimate sovereignty\" resides in the governed.  Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Comm'n, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 31); Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 324-325 (1816); Braun, supra, at 26-30.  Insofar as a crime offends the \"peace and dignity\" of a sovereign, Lanza, 260 U.\u00a0S., at 382, that \"sovereign\" is the people, the \"original fountain of all legitimate authority,\" The Federalist No. 22, at 152 (A. Hamilton); see Note, Double Prosecution by State and Federal Governments: Another Exercise in Federalism, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 1538, 1542 (1967).  States may be separate, but their populations are part of the people composing the United States.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In our \"compound republic,\" the division of authority between the United States and the States was meant to operate as \"a double security [for] the rights of the people.\"  The Federalist No. 51, at 323 (J. Madison); see Bond v. United States, 564 U.\u00a0S. 211, 221 (2011).  The separate-sovereigns doctrine, however, scarcely shores up people's rights.  Instead, it invokes federalism to withhold liberty.  See Bartkus, 359 U.\u00a0S., at 155-156 (Black, J., dissenting).1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is the doctrine's premise that each government has--and must be allowed to vindicate--a distinct interest in enforcing its own criminal laws.  That is a peculiar way to look at the Double Jeopardy Clause, which by its terms safeguards the \"person\" and restrains the government.  See, e.g., id., at 155; United States v. All Assets of G.P.S. Automotive Corp., 66 F.\u00a03d 483, 498 (CA2 1995) (Calabresi, J., concurring).  The Double Jeopardy Clause embodies a principle, \"deeply ingrained\" in our system of justice,\n\"that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\"  Green v. United States, 355 U.\u00a0S. 184, 187-188 (1957).\n\"Looked at from the standpoint of the individual who is being prosecuted,\" the liberty-denying potential of successive prosecutions, when Federal and State Governments prosecute in tandem, is the same as it is when either prosecutes twice.  Bartkus, 359 U.\u00a0S., at 155 (Black, J., dissenting).\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I turn, next, to further justifications the Court has supplied for the separate-sovereigns doctrine.  None should survive close inspection.\na\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One rationale emphasizes that the Double Jeopardy Clause originally restrained only the Federal Government and did not bar successive state prosecutions.  Id., at 124; Lanza, 260 U.\u00a0S., at 382; Fox v. Ohio, 5 How. 410, 434-435 (1847).  Incorporation of the Clause as a restraint on action by the States, effected in Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.\u00a0S. 784 (1969), has rendered this rationale obsolete.\nb\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another justification is precedent.  In adopting and reaffirming the separate-sovereigns doctrine, the Court relied on dicta from 19th-century opinions.  See Abbate, 359 U.\u00a0S., at\u00a0190-193; Bartkus, 359 U.\u00a0S., at\u00a0129-132; Lanza, 260 U.\u00a0S., at 382-384.  The persuasive force of those opinions is diminished by their dubious reasoning.  See supra, at 2-4.  While drawing upon dicta from prior opinions, the Court gave short shrift to contrary authority.  See Braun, supra, at 20-23.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Framers of the Bill of Rights voted down an amendment that would have permitted the Federal Government to reprosecute a defendant initially tried by a State.  1 Annals of Cong. 753 (1789); J. Sigler, Double Jeopardy: The Development of a Legal and Social Policy 30-31 (1969).  But cf. ante, at 4-5.  Nevermind that this amendment failed; the Court has attributed to the Clause the very meaning the First Congress refrained from adopting.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, early American courts regarded with disfavor the prospect of successive prosecutions by the Federal and State Governments.  In Houston v. Moore, 5 Wheat. 1 (1820), Justice Washington expressed concern that such prosecutions would be \"very much like oppression, if not worse\"; he noted that an acquittal or conviction by one sovereign \"might be pleaded in bar of the prosecution before the other.\"  Id., at 23, 31.  The Court today follows Bartkus in distinguishing Justice Washington's opinion as addressing only the \"strange\" situation in which a State has prosecuted an offense \"against the United States.\"  Ante, at 24; see Bartkus, 359 U.\u00a0S., at 130.  The distinction is thin, given the encompassing language in Justice Washington's opinion.  Justice Story's dissent, moreover, declared successive prosecutions for the same offense contrary to \"the principles of the common law, and the genius of our free government.\"  Houston, 5 Wheat., at\u00a072.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Most of the early state decisions cited by the parties regarded successive federal-state prosecutions as unacceptable.  See Bartkus, 359 U.\u00a0S., at 158-159 (Black, J., dissenting).  Only one court roundly endorsed a separate-sovereigns theory.  Hendrick v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. 707, 713 (1834).  The Court reads the state-court opinions as \"distin[guishing] between believing successive prosecutions by separate sovereigns unjust and holding them unlawful.\"  Ante, at 21.  I would not read the Double Jeopardy Clause to tolerate \"unjust\" prosecutions and believe early American courts would have questioned the Court's distinction.  See State v. Brown, 2 N.\u00a0C. 100, 101 (1794) (allowing successive prosecutions would be \"against natural justice, and therefore I cannot believe it to be law\").\nc\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Court has reasoned that the separate-sovereigns doctrine is necessary to prevent either the Federal Government or a State from encroaching on the other's law enforcement prerogatives.  Without this doctrine, the Court has observed, the Federal Government, by prosecuting first, could bar a State from pursuing more serious charges for the same offense, Bartkus, 359 U.\u00a0S., at 137; and conversely, a State, by prosecuting first, could effectively nullify federal law, Abbate, 359 U.\u00a0S., at 195.  This concern envisions federal and state prosecutors working at cross purposes, but cooperation between authorities is the norm.  See Bartkus, 359 U.\u00a0S., at 123.  And when federal-state tension exists, successive prosecutions for the federal and state offenses may escape double-jeopardy blockage under the test prescribed in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.\u00a0S. 299 (1932).  Offenses are distinct, Blockburger held, if \"each .\u00a0.\u00a0. requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\"  Id., at 304; see Amar, 95 Colum.\u00a0L.\u00a0Rev., at 45-46 (violation of federal civil rights law and state assault law are different offenses).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The separate-sovereigns doctrine, I acknowledge, has been embraced repeatedly by the Court.  But \"[s]tare decisis is not an inexorable command.\"  Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.\u00a0S. 808, 828 (1991).  Our adherence to precedent is weakest in cases \"concerning procedural rules that implicate fundamental constitutional protections.\"  Alleyne v. United States, 570 U.\u00a0S. 99, 116, n.\u00a05 (2013).  Gamble's case fits that bill.  I would lay the \"separate-sovereigns\" rationale to rest for the aforesaid reasons and those stated below.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.\u00a0S. 784, which rendered the double jeopardy safeguard applicable to the States, left the separate-sovereigns doctrine the sort of \"legal last-man-standing for which we sometimes depart from stare decisis.\"  Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 11).  In adopting and cleaving to the doctrine, the Court stressed that originally, the Clause restrained only federal, not state, action.  E.g., Bartkus, 359 U.\u00a0S., at 127; Lanza, 260 U.\u00a0S., at 382; cf. Abbate, 359 U.\u00a0S., at 190.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before incorporation, the separate-sovereigns doctrine had a certain logic: Without a carve-out for successive prosecutions by separate sovereigns, the Double Jeopardy Clause would have barred the Federal Government from prosecuting a defendant previously tried by a State, but would not have prevented a State from prosecuting a defendant previously tried by the Federal Government.  Incorporation changed this.  Operative against the States since 1969, when the Court decided Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.\u00a0S. 784, the double jeopardy proscription now applies to the Federal Government and the States alike.  The remaining office of the separate-sovereigns doctrine, then, is to enable federal and state prosecutors, proceeding one after the other, to expose defendants to double jeopardy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The separate-sovereigns doctrine's persistence contrasts with the fate of analogous dual-sovereignty doctrines following application of the rights at issue to the States.  Prior to incorporation of the Fourth Amendment as a restraint on state action, federal prosecutors were free to use evidence obtained illegally by state or local officers, then served up to federal officers on a \"silver platter.\"  See Elkins v. United States, 364 U.\u00a0S. 206, 208-214 (1960); Weeks v. United States, 232 U.\u00a0S. 383, 398 (1914).  Once the Fourth Amendment applied to the States, abandonment of this \"silver platter doctrine\" was impelled by \"principles of logic\" and the reality that, from the perspective of the victim of an unreasonable search and seizure, it mattered not at all \"whether his constitutional right ha[d] been invaded by a federal agent or by a state officer.\"  Elkins, 364 U.\u00a0S., at 208, 215.  As observed by Justice Harlan, Elkins' abandonment of a separate-sovereigns exception to the exclusionary rule was at odds with retention of the separate-sovereigns doctrine for double jeopardy purposes in Abbate and Bartkus.  See 364 U.\u00a0S., at 252.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, before incorporation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, the Court held that the privilege did not prevent state authorities from compelling a defendant to provide testimony that could incriminate him or her in another jurisdiction.  Knapp v. Schweitzer, 357 U.\u00a0S. 371, 375-381 (1958).  After application of the self-incrimination privilege to the States, the Court concluded that its prior position was incompatible with the \"policies and purposes\" of the privilege.  Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n of N. Y. Harbor, 378 U.\u00a0S. 52, 55, 77 (1964).  No longer, the Court held, could a witness \"\u00a0be whipsawed into incriminating himself under both state and federal law even though the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is applicable to each.\"  Id., at 55 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court regards incorporation as immaterial because application of the Double Jeopardy Clause to the States did not affect comprehension of the word \"offence\" to mean the violation of one sovereign's law.  Ante, at 28.  But the Court attributed a separate-sovereigns meaning to \"offence\" at least in part because the Double Jeopardy Clause did not apply to the States.  See supra, at 5.  Incorporation of the Clause should prompt the Court to consider the protection against double jeopardy from the defendant's perspective and to ask why each of two governments within the United States should be permitted to try a defendant once for the same offense when neither could try him or her twice.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The expansion of federal criminal law has exacerbated the problems created by the separate-sovereigns doctrine.  Ill effects of the doctrine might once have been tempered by the limited overlap between federal and state criminal law.  All Assets of G.P.S. Automotive, 66 F.\u00a03d, at 498 (Calabresi, J., concurring).  In the last half century, however, federal criminal law has been extended pervasively into areas once left to the States.  Guerra, The Myth of Dual Sovereignty: Multijurisdictional Drug Law Enforcement and Double Jeopardy, 73 N.\u00a0C. L.\u00a0Rev. 1159, 1165-1192 (1995); Brief for Sen. Orrin Hatch as Amicus Curiae 8-14.  This new \"age of 'cooperative federalism,' [in which] the Federal and State Governments are waging a united front against many types of criminal activity,\" Murphy, 378 U.\u00a0S., at 55-56, provides new opportunities for federal and state prosecutors to \"join together to take a second bite at the apple,\" All Assets of G.P.S. Automotive, 66 F.\u00a03d, at 498 (Calabresi, J., concurring).3  This situation might be less troublesome if successive prosecutions occurred only in \"instances of peculiar enormity, or where the public safety demanded extraordinary rigor.\"  Fox, 5 How., at 435.  The run-of-the-mill felon-in-possession charges Gamble encountered indicate that, in practice, successive prosecutions are not limited to exceptional circumstances.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Against all this, there is little to be said for keeping the separate-sovereigns doctrine.  Gamble's case \"do[es] not implicate the reliance interests of private parties.\"  Alleyne, 570 U.\u00a0S., at 119 (Sotomayor, J., concurring).  The closest thing to a reliance interest would be the interest Federal and State Governments have in avoiding avulsive changes that could complicate ongoing prosecutions.  As the Court correctly explains, however, overruling the separate-sovereigns doctrine would not affect large numbers of cases.  See ante, at 28-29.  In prosecutions based on the same conduct, federal and state prosecutors will often charge offenses having different elements, charges that, under Blockburger, will not trigger double jeopardy protection.  See Poulin, Double Jeopardy Protection From Successive Prosecution: A Proposed Approach, 92 Geo. L.\u00a0J. 1183, 1244-1245 (2004); Brief for Criminal Defense Experts as Amici Curiae 5-11.4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notably, the Federal Government has endeavored to reduce the incidence of \"same offense\" prosecutions.  Under the Petite policy adopted by the Department of Justice,5 the Department will pursue a federal prosecution \"based on substantially the same act(s) or transaction(s)\" previously prosecuted in state court only if the first prosecution left a \"substantial federal interest .\u00a0.\u00a0. demonstrably unvindicated\" and a Department senior official authorizes the prosecution.  Dept. of Justice, Justice Manual \u00a79-2.031(A) (rev. July 2009).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At oral argument, the Government estimated that it authorizes only \"about a hundred\" Petite prosecutions per year.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 54.  But see id., at 65-66 (referring to the \"few hundred successive prosecutions that [the Government] bring[s] each year\").  Some of these prosecutions will not implicate double jeopardy, as the Petite policy uses a same-conduct test that is broader than the Blockburger same-elements test.  And more than half the States forbid successive prosecutions for all or some offenses previously resolved on the merits by a federal or state court.  Brief for Criminal Defense Experts as Amici Curiae 4-5, and n.\u00a02 (collecting statutes); Brief for State of Texas et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 28-30, and nn.\u00a06-15 (same).  In short, it is safe to predict that eliminating the separate-sovereigns doctrine would spark no large disruption in practice.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The separate-sovereigns doctrine, especially since Bartkus and Abbate, has been subject to relentless criticism by members of the bench, bar, and academy.  Nevertheless, the Court reaffirms the doctrine, thereby diminishing the individual rights shielded by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Different parts of the \"WHOLE\" United States should not be positioned to prosecute a defendant a second time for the same offense.  I would reverse Gamble's federal conviction.\n\nGorsuch, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-646\nTERANCE MARTEZ GAMBLE, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\n[June 17, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A free society does not allow its government to try the same individual for the same crime until it's happy with the result.  Unfortunately, the Court today endorses a colossal exception to this ancient rule against double jeopardy.  My colleagues say that the federal government and each State are \"separate sovereigns\" entitled to try the same person for the same crime.  So if all the might of one \"sovereign\" cannot succeed against the presumptively free individual, another may insist on the chance to try again.  And if both manage to succeed, so much the better; they can add one punishment on top of the other.  But this \"separate sovereigns exception\" to the bar against double jeopardy finds no meaningful support in the text of the Constitution, its original public meaning, structure, or history.  Instead, the Constitution promises all Americans that they will never suffer double jeopardy.  I would enforce that guarantee. \nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Fear and abhorrence of governmental power to try people twice for the same conduct is one of the oldest ideas found in western civilization.\"1  Throughout history, people have worried about the vast disparity of power between governments and individuals, the capacity of the state to bring charges repeatedly until it wins the result it wants, and what little would be left of human liberty if that power remained unchecked.  To address the problem, the law in ancient Athens held that \"[a] man could not be tried twice for the same offense.\"2  The Roman Republic and Empire incorporated a form of double jeopardy protection in their laws.3  The Old Testament and later church teachings endorsed the bar against double jeopardy too.4  And from the earliest days of the common law, courts recognized that to \"punish a man twice over for one offence\" would be deeply unjust.5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rule against double jeopardy was firmly entrenched in both the American colonies and England at the time of our Revolution.6  And the Fifth Amendment, which prohibits placing a defendant \"twice .\u00a0.\u00a0. in jeopardy of life or limb\" for \"the same offence\" sought to carry the traditional common law rule into our Constitution.7  As Joseph Story put it, the Constitution's prohibition against double jeopardy grew from a \"great privilege secured by the common law\" and meant \"that a party shall not be tried a second time for the same offence, after he has once been convicted, or acquitted of the offence charged, by the verdict of a jury, and judgment has passed thereon for or against him.\"8\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given all this, it might seem that Mr. Gamble should win this case handily.  Alabama prosecuted him for violating a state law that \"prohibits a convicted felon from possessing a pistol\" and sentenced him to a year in prison.9  But then the federal government, apparently displeased with the sentence, charged Mr. Gamble under 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(1) with being a felon in possession of a firearm based on the same facts that gave rise to the state prosecution.  Ultimately, a federal court sentenced him to 46 months in prison and three years of supervised release.  Most any ordinary speaker of English would say that Mr. Gamble was tried twice for \"the same offence,\" precisely what the Fifth Amendment prohibits.  Tellingly, no one before us doubts that if either the federal government or Alabama had prosecuted Mr. Gamble twice on these facts and in this manner, it surely would have violated the Constitution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So how does the government manage to evade the Fifth Amendment's seemingly plain command?  On the government's account, the fact that federal and state authorities split up the prosecutions makes all the difference.  Though the Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't say anything about allowing \"separate sovereigns\" to do sequentially what neither may do separately, the government assures us the Fifth Amendment's phrase \"same offence\" does this work.  Adopting the government's argument, the Court supplies the following syllogism: \"[A]n 'offence' is defined by a law, and each law is defined by a sovereign.  So where there are two sovereigns, there are two laws, and two 'offences.'\u00a0\"  Ante, at 3-4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the major premise of this argument--that \"where there are two laws there are 'two offenses'\u00a0\"--is mistaken.  We know that the Constitution is not so easily evaded and that two statutes can punish the same offense.10  The framers understood the term \"offence\" to mean a \"transgression.\"11  And they understood that the same transgression might be punished by two pieces of positive law: After all, constitutional protections were not meant to be flimsy things but to embody \"principles that are permanent, uniform, and universal.\"12  As this Court explained long ago in Blockburger v. United States, \"where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\"13  So if two laws demand proof of the same facts to secure a conviction, they constitute a single offense under our Constitution and a second trial is forbidden.  And by everyone's admission, that is exactly what we have here: The statute under which the federal government proceeded required it to prove no facts beyond those Alabama needed to prove under state law to win its conviction; the two prosecutions were for the same offense.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That leaves the government and the Court to rest on the fact that distinct governmental entities, federal and state, enacted these identical laws.  This, we are told, is enough to transform what everyone agrees would otherwise be the same offense into two different offenses.  But where is that distinction to be found in the Constitution's text or original public understanding?  We know that the framers didn't conceive of the term \"same offence\" in some technical way as referring only to the same statute.  And if double jeopardy prevents one government from prosecuting a defendant multiple times for the same offense under the banner of separate statutory labels, on what account can it make a difference when many governments collectively seek to do the same thing?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The government identifies no evidence suggesting that the framers understood the term \"same offence\" to bear such a lawyerly sovereign-specific meaning.  Meanwhile, Blackstone's Commentaries explained how \"Roman law,\" \"Athens,\" \"the Jewish republic,\" and \"English Law\" addressed the singular \"offence of homicide,\" and how the Roman, Gothic, and ancient Saxon law approached the singular \"offence of arson.\"14  Other treatises of the period contain similar taxonomies of \"offences\" that are not sovereign-specific.15  Members of the Continental Congress, too, used the word \"offence\" in this same way.  In 1786, a congressional committee endorsed federal control over import duties because otherwise \"thirteen separate authorities\" might \"ordain various penalties for the same offence.\"16  In 1778, the Continental Congress passed a resolution declaring that a person should not be tried in state court \"for the same offense, for which he had previous thereto been tried by a Court Martial.\"17  And in 1785, the Continental Congress considered an ordinance declaring that a defendant could \"plead a formal Acquital on a Trial\" in a maritime court \"for the same supposed Offences, in a similar Court in one of the other United States.\"18  In all of these examples, early legislators--including many of the same people who would vote to add the Fifth Amendment to the Bill of Rights just a few years later--recognized that transgressions of state and federal law could constitute the \"same offence.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The history of the Double Jeopardy Clause itself supplies more evidence yet.  The original draft prohibited \"more than one trial or one punishment for the same offence.\"19  One representative then proposed adding the words \"by any law of the United States\" after \"same offence.\"20  That proposal clearly would have codified the government's sovereign-specific view of the Clause's operation.  Yet, Congress proceeded to reject it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Viewed from the perspective of an ordinary reader of the Fifth Amendment, whether at the time of its adoption or in our own time, none of this can come as a surprise.  Imagine trying to explain the Court's separate sovereigns rule to a criminal defendant, then or now.  Yes, you were sentenced to state prison for being a felon in possession of a firearm.  And don't worry--the State can't prosecute you again.  But a federal prosecutor can send you to prison again for exactly the same thing.  What's more, that federal prosecutor may work hand-in-hand with the same state prosecutor who already went after you.  They can share evidence and discuss what worked and what didn't the first time around.  And the federal prosecutor can pursue you even if you were acquitted in the state case.  None of that offends the Constitution's plain words protecting a person from being placed \"twice .\u00a0.\u00a0. in jeopardy of life or limb\" for \"the same offence.\"  Really?\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without meaningful support in the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause, the government insists that the separate sovereigns exception is at least compelled by the structure of our Constitution.  On its view, adopted by the Court today, allowing the federal and state governments to punish the same defendant for the same conduct \"honors the substantive differences between the interests that two sovereigns can have\" in our federal system.  Ante, at 5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this argument errs from the outset.  The Court seems to assume that sovereignty in this country belongs to the state and federal governments, much as it once belonged to the King of England.  But as Chief Justice Marshall explained, \"[t]he government of the Union .\u00a0.\u00a0. is emphatically, and truly, a government of the people,\" and all sovereignty \"emanates from them.\"21  Alexander Hamilton put the point this way: \"[T]he national and State systems are to be regarded\" not as different sovereigns foreign to one another but \"as ONE WHOLE.\"22  Under our Constitution, the federal and state governments are but two expressions of a single and sovereign people.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This principle resonates throughout our history and law.  State courts that refused to entertain federal causes of action found little sympathy when attempting the very separate sovereigns theory underlying today's decision.23  In time, too, it became clear that federal courts may decide state-law issues, and state courts may decide federal questions.24  Even in the criminal context, this Court has upheld removal of some state criminal actions to federal court.25  And any remaining doubt about whether the States and the federal government are truly separate sovereigns was ultimately \"resolved by war.\"26\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From its mistaken premise, the Court continues to the flawed conclusion that the federal and state governments can successively prosecute the same person for the same offense.  This turns the point of our federal experiment on its head.  When the \"ONE WHOLE\" people of the United States assigned different aspects of their sovereign power to the federal and state governments, they sought not to multiply governmental power but to limit it.  As this Court has explained, \"[b]y denying any one government complete jurisdiction over all the concerns of public life, federalism protects the liberty of the individual from arbitrary power.\"27  Yet today's Court invokes federalism not to protect individual liberty but to threaten it, allowing two governments to achieve together an objective denied to each.  The Court brushes this concern aside because \"the powers of the Federal Government and the States often overlap,\" which \"often results in two layers of regulation.\"  Ante, at 10.  But the Court's examples--taxation, alcohol, and marijuana--involve areas that the federal and state governments each may regulate separately under the Constitution as interpreted by this Court.  That is miles away from the separate sovereigns exception, which allows the federal and state governments to accomplish together what neither may do separately consistent with the Constitution's commands.  As Justice Black understood, the Court's view today \"misuse[s] and desecrat[es] .\u00a0.\u00a0. the concept\" of federalism.28  For \"it is just as much an affront to .\u00a0.\u00a0. human freedom for a man to be punished twice for the same offense\" by two parts of the people's government \"as it would be for one .\u00a0.\u00a0. to throw him in prison twice for the offense.\"29\nIII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the Constitution's text and structure do not supply persuasive support for the government's position, what about a more thorough exploration of the common law from which the Fifth Amendment was drawn?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By 1791 when the Fifth Amendment was adopted, an array of common law authorities suggested that a prosecution in any court, so long as the court had jurisdiction over the offense, was enough to bar future reprosecution in another court.  Blackstone, for example, reported that an acquittal \"before any court having competent jurisdiction of the offence\" could be pleaded \"in bar of any subsequent accusation for the same crime.\"30  For support, Blackstone pointed to Beak v. Tyrhwhit,31 a 1688 case in which the reporter described an acquittal in a foreign country followed by an attempted second prosecution in England that the court held impermissible.  Another treatise by William Hawkins likewise considered it \"settled\" as early as 1716 \"[t]hat an Acquittal in any Court whatsoever, which has a Jurisdiction of the Cause, is as good a Bar of any subsequent Prosecution for the same Crime.\"32\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What these authorities suggest many more confirm.  Henry Bathurst's 1761 treatise on evidence taught that \"a final Determination in a Court having competent Jurisdiction is conclusive in all Courts of concurrent Jurisdiction.\"33  Nor was this merely a rule about the competency of evidence, as the next sentence reveals: \"If A. having killed a Person in Spain was there prosecuted, tried, and acquitted, and afterwards was indicted here [in England], he might plead the Acquittal in Spain in Bar.\"34  Francis Buller's 1772 treatise repeated the same rule, articulating it the same way.35  And to illustrate their point, both treatises cited the 1678 English case of King v. Hutchinson.  Although no surviving written report of Hutchinson remains, several early common law cases--including Beak v. Thyrwhit,36 Burrows v. Jemino,37 and King v. Roche38--described its holding in exactly the same way the treatise writers did: All agreed that it barred the retrial in England of a defendant previously tried for murder in Spain or Portugal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When they envisioned the relationship between the national government and the States under the new Constitution, the framers sometimes referenced by way of comparison the relationship between Wales, Scotland, and England.39  And prosecutions in one of these places pretty plainly barred subsequent prosecutions for the same offense in the others.  So, for example, treatises explained that \"an Acquittal of Murder at a Grand Sessions in Wales, may be pleaded to an Indictment for the same Murder in England.  For the Rule is, That a Man's Life shall not be brought into Danger for the same Offence more than once.\"40  Indeed, when an English county indicted a defendant \"for a murder committed .\u00a0.\u00a0. in Wales,\" it was barred from proceeding when the court learned that the defendant had already been tried and acquitted \"of the same offence\" in Wales.41\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Against this uniform body of common law weighs Gage v. Bulkeley--a civil, not criminal, case from 1744 that suggested Hutchinson had held only that the English courts lacked jurisdiction to try a defendant for an offense committed in Portugal.  Because \"the murder was committed in Portugal,\" Gage argued, \"the Court of King's Bench could not indict him, and there was no method of trying him but upon a special commission.\"42  But no one else--not the treatise writers or the other English cases that favorably cited Hutchinson--adopted Gage's restrictive reading of that precedent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the end, then, it's hard to see how anyone consulting the common law in 1791 could have avoided this conclusion: While the issue may not have arisen often, the great weight of authority indicated that successive prosecutions by different sovereigns--even sovereigns as foreign to each other as England and Portugal--were out of bounds.  And anyone familiar with the American federal system likely would have thought the rule applied with even greater force to successive prosecutions by the United States and a constituent State, given that both governments derive their sovereignty from the American people.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unable to summon any useful preratification common law sources of its own, the government is left to nitpick those that undermine its position.  For example, the Court dismisses Beak because \"Hutchinson is discussed only in the defendant's argument in that case, not the court's response.\"  Ante, at 16.  But the Beak court did not reject the Hutchinson argument, and counsel's use of the case sheds light on how 17th- and 18th-century lawyers understood the double jeopardy bar.  The Court likewise derides King v. Thomas as \"totally irrelevant\" because in the 17th century, Wales and England shared the same laws.  But our federal and state governments share the same fundamental law and source of authority, and the Wales example is at least somewhat analogous to our federal system.43  Finally, the Court complains that Roche's footnote citing Hutchinson was added only in 1800, after the Fifth Amendment's ratification.  Ante, at 16.  But that is hardly a point for the government, because even so it provides an example of a later reporter attempting to describe the pre-existing state of the law; nor, as it turns out, was the footnote even essential to the Roche court's original analysis and conclusion reached in 1775, well before the Fifth Amendment's ratification.44  And among all these complaints, we should not lose the forest for the trees.  The Court's attempts to explain away so many uncomfortable authorities are lengthy, detailed, even herculean.  But in the end, neither it nor the government has mustered a single preratification common law authority approving a case of successive prosecutions by separate sovereigns for the same offense.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What we know about the common law before the Fifth Amendment's ratification in 1791 finds further confirmation in how later legal thinkers in both England and America described the rule they had inherited.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Start with England.  As it turns out, \"it would have been difficult to have made more than the most cursory examination of nineteenth century or later English treatises or digests without encountering\" the Hutchinson rule.45  In 1802, a British treatise explained that \"an acquittal on a criminal charge in a foreign country may be pleaded in bar of an indictment for the same offence in England.\"46  Three decades later, another treatise observed (citing Hutchinson) that \"[a]n acquittal by a competent jurisdiction abroad is a bar to an indictment for the same offence before any other tribunal.\"47  In 1846, the Scottish High Court of Justiciary declared that \"[i]f a man has been tried for theft in England, we would not try him again here.\"48  Twentieth century treatises recited the same rule.49  In 1931, the American Law Institute stated that \"[i]f a person has been acquitted in a court of competent jurisdiction for an offense in another country he may not be tried for the same offense again in an English Court.\"50  And in 1971, an English judge explained that the bar on \"double jeopardy .\u00a0.\u00a0. has always applied whether the previous conviction or acquittal based on the same facts was by an English court or by a foreign court.\"51  The Court today asks us to assume that all these legal authorities misunderstood the common law's ancient rule.  I would not.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even more pertinently, consider how 18th-century Americans understood the double jeopardy provision they had adopted.  The legal treatises an American lawyer practicing between the founding and the Civil War might have consulted uniformly recited the Hutchinson rule as black letter law.  Chancellor Kent wrote that \"the plea of autrefois acquit, resting on a prosecution [in] any civilized state, would be a good plea in any other civilized state.\"52  Thomas Sergeant explained that \"[w]here the jurisdiction of the United States court and of a state Court is concurrent, the sentence of either court, whether of conviction or acquittal, may be pleaded in bar to a prosecution in the other.\"53  William Rawle echoed that conclusion in virtually identical words.54  Indeed, one early commentator wrote that a \"principal reason\" for the Double Jeopardy Clause was to prevent successive state and federal prosecutions, which he considered to be against \"[n]atural justice.\"55  Nor did these treatises purport to invent a new rule; they claimed only to recite the traditional one.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court's early decisions reflected the same principle.  In Houston v. Moore, a Pennsylvania court-martial tried a member of the state militia for desertion under an \"act of the legislature of Pennsylvania.\"56  The defendant objected that the state court-martial lacked jurisdiction because federal law criminalized the same conduct and prosecuting him in the state court could thus expose him to double jeopardy.  In an opinion by Justice Washington, the Court disagreed and allowed the prosecution, but reassured the defendant that \"if the jurisdiction of the two Courts be concurrent, the sentence of either Court, either of conviction or acquittal, might be [later] pleaded in bar of the prosecution before the other.\"57  In dissent, Justice Story thought the state court lacked jurisdiction because otherwise the defendant would be \"liable to be twice tried and punished for the same offence, against the manifest intent of the act of Congress, the principles of the common law, and the genius of our free government.\"58  But notice the point of agreement between majority and dissent: Both acknowledged that a second prosecution for the same underlying offense would be prohibited even if brought by a separate government.59\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another case decided the same year also reflected the Hutchinson rule.  In United States v. Furlong, one British subject killed another on the high seas, and the killer was indicted in an American federal court for robbery and murder.  This Court unanimously held that \"[r]obbery on the seas is considered as an offence within the criminal jurisdiction of all nations\" that can therefore be \"punished by all,\" and there can be \"no doubt that the plea of autre fois acquit [double jeopardy] would be good in any civilized State, though resting on a prosecution instituted in the Courts of any other civilized State.\"60\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A number of early state cases followed the same rule.  Indeed, the Court today acknowledges that Massachusetts, Michigan, and Vermont all followed Hutchinson.  Ante, at 22.61  The Court agrees that South Carolina did too,62 but it believes that a later South Carolina case might have deviated from the Hutchinson rule.  That decision, however, contains at best only \"an inconclusive discussion coming from a State whose highest court had previously stated unequivocally that a bar against double prosecutions would exist.\"63\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the face of so much contrary authority, the Court winds up leaning heavily on a single 1794 North Carolina Superior Court decision, State v. Brown.  But the Court's choice here is revealing.  True, Brown said that a verdict in North Carolina would not be \"pleadable in bar to an indictment preferred against [the defendant] in the Territory South of the Ohio.\"64  But the Court leaves out what happened next.  Brown went on to reject concurrent jurisdiction because trying the defendant \"according to the several laws of each State\" could result in him being \"cropped in one, branded and whipped in another, imprisoned in a third, and hanged in a fourth; and all for one and the same offence.\"65  The North Carolina court viewed that result as \"against natural justice\" and \"therefore [could] not believe it to be law.\"66  So it is that the principal support the Court cites for its position is a state case that both (1)\u00a0regarded transgressions of the laws of a State and a U.\u00a0S. territory as the \"same offence,\" and (2)\u00a0expressed aversion at the thought of both jurisdictions punishing the defendant for that singular offense.67\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the text, principles of federalism, and history now arrayed against it, the government is left to suggest that we should retain the separate sovereigns exception under the doctrine of stare decisis.  But if that's the real basis for today's result, let's at least acknowledge this: By all appearances, the Constitution as originally adopted and understood did not allow successive state and federal prosecutions for the same offense, yet the government wants this Court to tolerate the practice anyway.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stare decisis has many virtues, but when it comes to enforcing the Constitution this Court must take (and always has taken) special care in the doctrine's application.  After all, judges swear to protect and defend the Constitution, not to protect what it prohibits.  And while we rightly pay heed to the considered views of those who have come before us, especially in close cases, stare decisis isn't supposed to be \"the art of being methodically ignorant of what everyone knows.\"68  Indeed, blind obedience to stare decisis would leave this Court still abiding grotesque errors like Dred Scott v. Sandford,69 Plessy v. Ferguson,70 and Korematsu v. United States.71  As Justice Brandeis explained, \"in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions.  The Court bows to the lessons of experience and the force of better reasoning, recognizing that the process of trial and error, so fruitful in the physical sciences, is appropriate also in the judicial function.\"72\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For all these reasons, while stare decisis warrants respect, it has never been \"\u00a0'an inexorable command,'\u00a0\"73 and it is \"at its weakest when we interpret the Constitution.\"74  In deciding whether one of our cases should be retained or overruled, this Court has traditionally considered \"the quality of the decision's reasoning; its consistency with related decisions; legal developments since the decision; and reliance on the decision.\"75  Each of these factors, I believe, suggests we should reject the separate sovereigns exception.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take the \"quality of [the] reasoning.\"76  The first cases to suggest that successive prosecutions by state and federal authorities might be permissible did not seek to address the original meaning of the word \"offence,\" the troubling federalism implications of the exception, or the relevant historical sources.  Between 1847 and 1850, the Court decided a pair of cases, United States v. Marigold77 and Fox v. Ohio.78  While addressing other matters in those decisions, the Court offered passing approval to the possibility of successive state and federal prosecutions, but did so without analysis and without actually upholding a successive conviction.  Indeed, in place of a careful constitutional analysis, the Fox Court merely offered its judgment that \"the benignant spirit\" of prosecutors could be relied on to protect individuals from too many repetitive prosecutions.79  We do not normally give precedential effect to such stray commentary.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the first real roots of the separate sovereigns exception can be traced to this Court's 1852 decision in Moore v. Illinois.80  As it did five years later and more notoriously in Dred Scott,81 the Court in Moore did violence to the Constitution in the name of protecting slavery and slaveowners.  In Dred Scott the Court held that the Due Process Clause prevented Congress from prohibiting slavery in the territories, though of course the Clause did nothing of the sort.82  And in Moore the Court upheld a state fugitive slave law that it judged important because the States supposedly needed \"to protect themselves against the influx either of liberated or fugitive slaves, and to repel from their soil a population likely to become burdensome and injurious, either as paupers or criminals.\"83  The defendant, who had harbored a fugitive slave, objected that upholding the state law could potentially expose him to double prosecutions by the state and federal governments.  The Court rejected that argument, reasoning simply that such double punishment could be consistent with the Constitution if the defendant had violated both state and federal law.84  Yet notably, even here, the Court did not actually approve a successive prosecution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor did the trajectory of the separate sovereigns exception improve much from there.  The first time the Court actually approved an \"instance of double prosecution [and] failed to find some remedy .\u00a0.\u00a0. to avoid it\" didn't arrive until 1922.85  In that case, United States v. Lanza,86 the federal government prosecuted the defendants for manufacturing, transporting, and possessing alcohol in violation of the National Prohibition Act.  The defendants argued that they had already been prosecuted by the State of Washington for the same offense.  But, notably, the defendants did not directly question the permissibility of successive prosecutions for the same offense under state and federal law.  Instead, the defendants argued that both of the laws under which they were punished really derived from the \"same sovereign:\" the national government, by way of the Eighteenth Amendment that authorized Prohibition.  After rejecting that argument as an \"erroneous view of the matter,\" the Court proceeded on, perhaps unnecessarily, to offer its view that \"an act denounced as a crime by both national and state sovereignties is an offense against the peace and dignity of both and may be punished by each.\"87  Given that the Court was not asked directly to consider the propriety of successive prosecutions under separate state and federal laws for the same offense, it is perhaps unsurprising the Court did not consult the original meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause or consult virtually any of the relevant historical sources before offering its dictum.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It matters, too, that these cases \"were decided by the narrowest of margins, over spirited dissents challenging the basic underpinnings of those decisions.\"88  In Moore, Justice McLean wrote that although \"the Federal and State Governments emanate from different sovereignties,\" they \"operate upon the same people, and should have the same end in view.\"89  He \"deeply regret[ted] that our government should be an exception to a great principle of action, sanctioned by humanity and justice.\"90 Bartkus and Abbate, cases decided in the 1950s that more clearly approved the separate sovereigns exception, were decided only by 5-to-4 and 6-to-3 margins, and Justice Black's eloquent dissents in those cases have triggered an avalanche of persuasive academic support.91\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is more, the \"underpinnings\" of the separate sovereigns exception have been \"erode[d] by subsequent decisions of this Court.\"92  When this Court decided Moore, Lanza, Bartkus, and Abbate, the Double Jeopardy Clause applied only to the federal government under this Court's decision in Palko v. Connecticut.93  In those days, one might have thought, the separate sovereigns exception at least served to level the playing field between the federal government and the States: If a State could retry a defendant after a federal trial, then the federal government ought to be able to retry a defendant after a state trial.  But in time the Court overruled Palko and held that the Double Jeopardy Clause does apply to the States--and, with that, a premise once thought important to the exception fell away.94\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor has only the law changed; the world has too.  And when \"far-reaching systemic and structural changes\" make an \"earlier error all the more egregious and harmful,\" stare decisis can lose its force.95  In the era when the separate sovereigns exception first emerged, the federal criminal code was new, thin, modest, and restrained.  Today, it can make none of those of boasts.  Some suggest that \"the federal government has [now] duplicated vir-tually every major state crime.\"96  Others estimate that the U.\u00a0S. Code contains more than 4,500 criminal statutes, not even counting the hundreds of thousands of federal regulations that can trigger criminal penalties.97  Still others suggest that \"\u00a0'[t]here is no one in the United States over the age of 18 who cannot be indicted for some federal crime.'\u00a0\"98  If long ago the Court could have thought \"the benignant spirit\" of prosecutors rather than unwavering enforcement of the Constitution sufficient protection against the threat of double prosecutions, it's unclear how we still might.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That leaves reliance.  But the only people who have relied on the separate sovereigns exception are prosecutors who have sought to double-prosecute and double-punish.  And this Court has long rejected the idea that \"law enforcement reliance interests outweig[h] the interest in protecting individual constitutional rights so as to warrant fidelity to an unjustifiable rule.\"99  Instead, \"[i]f it is clear that a practice is unlawful, individuals' interest in its discontinuance clearly outweighs any law enforcement 'entitlement' to its persistence.\"100  That is the case here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court today disregards these lessons.  It worries that overturning the separate sovereigns rule could undermine the reliance interests of prosecutors in transnational cases who might be prohibited from trying individuals already acquitted by a foreign court.  Ante, at 7.  Yet even on its own terms, this argument is unpersuasive.  The government has not even attempted to quantify the scope of the alleged \"problem,\" and perhaps for good reason. Domestic prosecutors regularly coordinate with their foreign counterparts when pursuing transnational criminals, so they can often choose the most favorable forum for their mutual efforts.  And because Blockburger requires an identity of elements before the double jeopardy bar can take hold, domestic prosecutors, armed with their own abundant criminal codes, will often be able to find new offenses to charge if they are unsatisfied with outcomes elsewhere.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Enforcing the Constitution always bears its costs.  But when the people adopted the Constitution and its Bill of Rights, they thought the liberties promised there worth the costs.  It is not for this Court to reassess this judgment to make the prosecutor's job easier.  Nor is there any doubt that the benefits the framers saw in prohibiting double prosecutions remain real, and maybe more vital than ever, today.  When governments may unleash all their might in multiple prosecutions against an individual, exhausting themselves only when those who hold the reins of power are content with the result, it is \"the poor and the weak,\"101 and the unpopular and controversial, who suffer first--and there is nothing to stop them from being the last.  The separate sovereigns exception was wrong when it was invented, and it remains wrong today.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0In addressing that question, we follow the parties' lead and assume, without deciding, that the state and federal offenses at issue here satisfy the other criteria for being the \"same offence\" under our double jeopardy precedent.  See Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.\u00a0S. 299, 304 (1932).\nFootnote 2\u00a0Gamble also cites founding-era uses of the word \"offence\" that are not tied to violations of a sovereign's laws, but the examples are not very telling.  Some, for instance, play on the unremarkable fact that at the founding, \"offence\" could take on a different sense in nonlegal settings, much as \"offense\" does today.  In this vein, Gamble cites a 19th-century dictionary defining \"offense\" broadly as \"any transgression of law, divine or human; a crime; sin; act of wickedness or omission of duty.\"  2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828).  But the question is what \"offence\" meant in legal contexts.  See Moore v. Illinois, 14 How. 13, 19 (1852) (\"An offence, in its legal signification, means the transgression of a law.\u00a0.\u00a0.\" (emphasis added)).\nFootnote 3\u00a0See J. Beattie, Crime and the Courts in England: 1660-1800, pp. 281-282 (1986).\nFootnote 4\u00a0Although this Act reached conduct committed \"out of the King Majesties Realme of Englande and other his Graces [Dominions],\" Acte concerning the triall of Treasons 1543-1544, 35 Hen. 8 ch. 2 (1543-1544), it applied only to treasons and misprisions of treason--not to homicide, of which Hutchinson was accused.\nFootnote 5\u00a0See G.

B. 1688)--mentions Hutchinson only in summarizing a defendant's argument.  So does the only other source cited by either judge.  See Gage, Ridg. T. H., at 271, 27 Eng. Rep., at 826-827 (citing Beak v. Thyrwhit, 3 Mod. 194, 87 Eng. Rep. 124 (K. B. 1688)).  Below we discuss in detail the case that figures in these two reports.  See infra, at 19, and n. 11.\nFootnote 7\u00a04 Blackstone 262.\nFootnote 8\u00a0This statute authorized commissioners to try certain defendants for acts of treason or murder committed \"in whatsoever other Shire or place, within the King's dominions or without.\"  But \"[d]espite the words 'or without', contemporary opinion seems not to have regarded the extra-territorial operation of this Act as clear.\"  Squibb 149.  Indeed, the statute cited in the Hutchinson bail report, dated to just two years later, cited lingering \"doubtes and questions\" about whether English courts could try treason committed abroad (in the course of clarifying that treason and misprisions of treason abroad could indeed be tried in England).  35 Hen. 8 ch. 2, \u00a7 I.\nFootnote 9\u00a0This case is also reported as Burrows v.

MacNally, The Rules of Evidence on Pleas of the Crown 428 (1802).\nFootnote 14\u00a0As we put it in Bartkus, 359 U.\u00a0S., at 134-136:\n\"Of the twenty-eight States which have considered the validity of successive state and federal prosecutions as against a challenge of violation of either a state constitutional double-jeopardy provision or a common-law evidentiary rule of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict, twenty-seven have refused to rule that the second prosecution was or would be barred.  These States were not bound to follow this Court and its interpretation of the Fifth Amendment.  The rules, constitutional, statutory, or common law which bound them, drew upon the same experience as did the Fifth Amendment, but were and are of separate and independent authority.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Not all of the state cases manifest careful reasoning, for in some of them the language concerning double jeopardy is but offhand dictum.  But in an array of state cases there may be found full consideration of the arguments supporting and denying a bar to a second prosecution.  These courts interpreted their rules as not proscribing a second prosecution where the first was by a different government and for violation of a different statute.\"  (Footnote omitted.)\nFootnote 15\u00a0Piracy was understood as a violation of the law of nations, which was seen as common to all.  That is why any successive prosecution for piracy, being under the same law, would have been for the same offense.  See United States v. Smith, 5 Wheat. 153, 163, n. a (1820) (quoting definitions of piracy by several ancient and more recent authorities).  See also 4 Blackstone 71 (\"[T]he crime of piracy, or robbery and depredation upon the high seas, is an offence against the universal law of society; a pirate being, according to Sir Edward Coke, hostis humani generis [enemies of mankind].  As therefore he has renounced all the benefits of society and government, and has reduced himself afresh to the savage state of nature, by declaring war against all mankind, all mankind must declare war against him: so that every community has a right, by the rule of self-defence, to inflict that punishment upon him, which every individual would in a state of nature have been otherwise entitled to do, for any invasion of his person or personal property\" (footnote omitted)).\nFootnote 16\u00a0He draws a similar analogy to the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, but our response to his Fourth Amendment analogy would answer that argument as well.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0As the Court suggests, Congress is responsible for the proliferation of duplicative prosecutions for the same offenses by the States and the Federal Government.  Ante, at 28.  By legislating beyond its limited powers, Congress has taken from the People authority that they never gave.  U.\u00a0S. Const., Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78; The Federalist No. 22, p. 152 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (\"all legitimate authority\" derives from \"the consent of the people\" (capitalization omitted)).  And the Court has been complicit by blessing this questionable expansion of the Commerce Clause.  See, e.g., Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.\u00a0S. 1, 57-74 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Indeed, it seems possible that much of Title 18, among other parts of the U.\u00a0S. Code, is premised on the Court's incorrect interpretation of the Commerce Clause and is thus an incursion into the States' general criminal jurisdiction and an imposition on the People's liberty.\nFootnote 2\u00a0My focus in this opinion is on this Court's adherence to its own precedents.  I make no claim about any obligation of \"inferior\" federal courts, U.\u00a0S. Const., Art.\u00a0III, \u00a71, or state courts to follow Supreme Court precedent.\nFootnote 3\u00a0Our founding documents similarly rest on the premise that certain fundamental principles are both knowable and objectively true.  See, e.g., Declaration of Independence (\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness\").\nFootnote 4\u00a0There are certain exceptions to this general rule, including areas of law in which federal common law has historically been understood to govern (e.g., admiralty) and well-established judicial doctrines that are applied in the federal courts (e.g., issue preclusion).  Additionally, federal courts apply state law where it governs.\nFootnote 5\u00a0Congress and the Executive likewise must independently evaluate the constitutionality of their actions; they take an oath to uphold the Constitution, not to blindly follow judicial precedent.  In the context of a judicial case or controversy, however, their determinations do not bind the Judiciary in performing its constitutionally assigned role.  See, e.g., Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.\u00a0S. 189, 197 (2012) (noting that there is \"no exclusive commitment to the Executive of the power to determine the constitutionality of a statute\"); INS v. Chadha, 462 U.\u00a0S. 919, 944 (1983) (Congress' and President's endorsement of \"legislative veto\" \"sharpened rather than blunted\" Court's judicial review).  Of course, consistent with the nature of the \"judicial Power,\" the federal courts' judgments bind all parties to the case, including Government officials and agencies.\nFootnote 6\u00a0I am not suggesting that the Court must independently assure itself that each precedent relied on in every opinion is correct as a matter of original understanding.  We may, consistent with our constitutional duty and the Judiciary's historical practice, proceed on the understanding that our predecessors properly discharged their constitutional role until we have reason to think otherwise--as, for example, when a party raises the issue or a previous opinion persuasively critiques the dis-puted precedent.\nFootnote 7\u00a0Indeed, if a statute contained no objective meaning, it might constitute an improper delegation of legislative power to the Judicial Branch, among other problems.  See Touby v. United States, 500 U.\u00a0S. 160, 165 (1991) (discussing the nondelegation doctrine).\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The Court writes that federalism \"advances individual liberty in many ways,\" but does not always do so.  Ante, at 10 (citing, for example, state prohibition of activities authorized by federal law).  The analogy of the separate-sovereigns doctrine to dual regulation is inapt.  The former erodes a constitutional safeguard against successive prosecutions, while the Constitution contains no guarantee against dual regulation. \nFootnote 2\u00a0The Court sees this history as poor evidence of congressional intent.  See ante, at 4.  On another day, the Court looked to the First Congress' rejection of proposed amendments as instructive.  See Cook v. Gralike, 531 U.\u00a0S. 510, 521 (2001).  Moreover, a \"compelling\" principle of statutory interpretation is \"the proposition that Congress does not intend sub silentio to enact statutory language that it has earlier discarded in favor of other language.\"  INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.\u00a0S. 421, 442-443 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nFootnote 3\u00a0Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.\u00a0S. 121 (1959), left open the prospect that the double jeopardy ban might block a successive state prosecution that was merely \"a sham and a cover for a federal prosecution.\"  Id., at 123-124.  The Courts of Appeals have read this potential exception narrowly.  See, e.g., United States v. Figueroa-Soto, 938 F.\u00a02d 1015, 1019 (CA9 1991).\nFootnote 4\u00a0The Government implies there is tension between Gamble's position and Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.\u00a0S. 299 (1932).  Brief for United States 18-20.  But if courts can ascertain how laws enacted by different Congresses fare under Blockburger, they can do the same for laws enacted by Congress and a State, or by two States.  But cf. Amar & Marcus, Double Jeopardy Law After Rodney King, 95 Colum. L.\u00a0Rev. 1, 39 (1995) (\"Because different legislatures often do not work from the same linguistic building blocks, they will not use uniform language to describe an offence, even when each is indeed outlawing the same crime with the same elements.\").\nFootnote 5\u00a0Formally the \"Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy,\" the policy is popularly known by the name of the case in which this Court first took note of it, Petite v. United States, 361 U.\u00a0S. 529 (1960) (per curiam).  The policy was adopted \"in direct response to\" Bartkus and Abbate v. United States, 359 U.\u00a0S. 187 (1959).  Rinaldi v.

The Court tries to make the most of McCulloch, pointing out that Chief Justice Marshall distinguished between \"\u00a0'the people of a State'\u00a0\" and \"\u00a0'the people of all the States.'\u00a0\"  Ante, at 9.  But of course our federal republic is composed of separate governments.  My point is that the federal and state governments ultimately derive their sovereignty from one and the same source; they are not truly \"separate\" in the manner of, say, the governments of England and Portugal.  The American people \"\u00a0'split the atom of sovereignty,'\u00a0\" ante, at 9, to set two levels of government against each other, not to set both against the people.  McCulloch is consistent with that understanding.  In holding that the States could not tax the national bank, McCulloch sought to ensure that the national and state governments remained each in its proper sphere; it did not hold that the two governments could work in concert to abridge the people's liberty in a way that neither could on its own.\nFootnote 27\u00a0Bond v.

In response, the prosecution asked the court to charge the jury both with \"this issue [the plea of autrefois acquit], and that of Not guilty.\"  Ibid.  The court rejected that proposal, reasoning that \"if the first finding was for the prisoner, they could not go to the second, because that finding would be a bar.\"  Ibid.  Far from saying \"absolutely nothing\" about double jeopardy, ante, at 16, Roche is a serious problem for the government because it explicitly recognizes that a successful plea of autrefois acquit, even one based on a foreign conviction, would bar a prosecution in England.  But the Court ignores this, focusing instead on the missing explanatory citation to Hutchinson that was, in any event, added shortly thereafter.\nFootnote 45\u00a0Grant, Successive Prosecutions by State and Nation: Common Law and British Empire Comparisons, 4 UCLA L.\u00a0Rev. 1, 9-11 (1956) (footnotes omitted).\nFootnote 46\u00a02 L.

But that was only because the British courts would not have recognized the jurisdiction of an American court to try a murder committed by a British subject on the high seas.

IDAHO(2019)\nNo. 17-1026\nArgued: October 30, 2018Decided: February 27, 2019\n\n\nPetitioner Gilberto Garza, Jr., signed two plea agreements, each arising from state criminal charges and each containing a clause stating that Garza waived his right to appeal.  Shortly after sentencing, Garza told his trial counsel that he wished to appeal.  Instead of filing a notice of appeal, counsel informed Garza that an appeal would be \"problematic\" given Garza's appeal waiver.  After the time period for Garza to preserve an appeal lapsed, he sought state postconviction relief, alleging that his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file a notice of appeal despite his repeated requests.  The Idaho trial court denied relief, and the Idaho Court of Appeals affirmed.  Also affirming, the Idaho Supreme Court held that Garza could not show the requisite deficient performance by counsel and resulting prejudice.  In doing so, the court concluded that the presumption of prejudice recognized in Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.\u00a0S. 470, when trial counsel fails to file an appeal as instructed does not apply when the defendant has agreed to an appeal waiver. \nHeld:\u00a0Flores-Ortega's presumption of prejudice applies regardless of whether a defendant has signed an appeal waiver.  Pp.\u00a03-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S. 668, a defendant who claims ineffective assistance of counsel must prove (1) \"that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\" id., at 687-688, and (2) that any such deficiency was \"prejudicial to the defense,\" id., at 692.  However, \"prejudice is presumed\" in \"certain Sixth Amendment contexts,\" ibid., such as \"when counsel's constitutionally deficient performance deprives a defendant of an appeal that he otherwise would have taken,\" Flores-Ortega, 528 U.\u00a0S., at 484.  Pp.\u00a03-4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0This case hinges on two procedural devices: appeal waivers and notices of appeal.  No appeal waiver serves as an absolute bar to all appellate claims.  Because a plea agreement is essentially a contract, it does not bar claims outside its scope.  And, like any contract, the language of appeal waivers can vary widely, leaving many types of claims unwaived.  A waived appellate claim may also proceed if the prosecution forfeits or waives the waiver or if the Government breaches the agreement.  Separately, some claims are treated as unwaiveable.  Most fundamentally, courts agree that defendants retain the right to challenge whether the waiver itself was knowing and voluntary.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The filing of a notice of appeal is \"a purely ministerial task that imposes no great burden on counsel.\"  Flores-Ortega, 528 U.\u00a0S., at 474.  Filing requirements reflect that appellate claims are likely to be ill defined or unknown at the filing stage.  And within the division of labor between defendants and their attorneys, the \"ultimate authority\" to decide whether to \"take an appeal\" belongs to the accused.  Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.\u00a0S. 745, 751.  Pp.\u00a04-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Garza's attorney rendered deficient performance by not filing a notice of appeal in light of Garza's clear requests.  Given the possibility that a defendant will end up raising claims beyond an appeal waiver's scope, simply filing a notice of appeal does not necessarily breach a plea agreement.  Thus, counsel's choice to override Garza's instructions was not a strategic one.  In any event, the bare decision whether to appeal is ultimately the defendant's to make.  Pp.\u00a07-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0Because there is no dispute that Garza wished to appeal, a direct application of Flores-Ortega's language resolves this case.  Flores-Ortega reasoned that because a presumption of prejudice applies whenever \"\u00a0'the accused is denied counsel at a critical stage,'\u00a0\" it makes greater sense to presume prejudice when counsel's deficiency forfeits an \"appellate proceeding altogether.\"  528 U.\u00a0S., at 483.  Because Garza retained a right to appeal at least some issues despite his waivers, he had a right to a proceeding and was denied that proceeding altogether as a result of counsel's deficient performance.  That he surrendered many claims by signing appeal waivers does not change things.  First, the presumption of prejudice does not bend because a particular defendant seems to have had poor prospects.  See, e.g., Jae Lee v. United States, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___.  Second, while the defendant in Flores-Ortega did not sign an appeal waiver, he did plead guilty, which \"reduces the scope of potentially appealable issues\" on its own.  528 U.\u00a0S., at 480.  Pp.\u00a08-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(e)\u00a0Contrary to the argument by Idaho and the U.\u00a0S. Government, as amicus, that Garza never \"had a right\" to his appeal and thus that any deficient performance by counsel could not have caused the loss of any such appeal, Garza did retain a right to his appeal; he simply had fewer possible claims than some other appellants.  The Government also proposes a rule that would require a defendant to show--on a case-by-case basis--that he would have presented claims that would have been considered by the appellate court on the merits.  This Court, however, has already rejected attempts to condition the restoration of a defendant's appellate rights forfeited by ineffective counsel on proof that the defendant's appeal had merit.  See, e.g., Rodriquez v. United States, 395 U.\u00a0S. 327, 330.  Moreover, it is not the defendant's role to decide what arguments to press, making it especially improper to impose that role upon the defendant simply because his opportunity to appeal was relinquished by deficient counsel.  And because there is no right to counsel in postconviction proceedings and, thus, most applicants proceed pro se, the Government's proposal would be unfair, ill advised, and unworkable.

Flores-Ortega, 528 U.\u00a0S. 470 (2000), this Court held that when an attorney's deficient performance costs a defendant an appeal that the defendant would have otherwise pursued, prejudice to the defendant should be presumed \"with no further showing from the defendant of the merits of his underlying claims.\"  Id., at 484.  This case asks whether that rule applies even when the defendant has, in the course of pleading guilty, signed what is often called an \"appeal waiver\"--that is, an agreement forgoing certain, but not all, possible appellate claims.  We hold that the presumption of prejudice recognized in Flores-Ortega applies regardless of whether the defendant has signed an appeal waiver.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In early 2015, petitioner Gilberto Garza, Jr., signed two plea agreements, each arising from criminal charges brought by the State of Idaho.  Each agreement included a clause stating that Garza \"waive[d] his right to appeal.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a, 49a.  The Idaho trial court accepted the agreements and sentenced Garza to terms of prison in accordance with the agreements.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shortly after sentencing, Garza told his trial counsel that he wished to appeal.1  In the days that followed, he would later attest, Garza \"continuously reminded\" his attorney of this directive \"via phone calls and letters,\" Record 210, and Garza's trial counsel acknowledged in his own affidavit that Garza had \"told me he wanted to appeal the sentence(s) of the court,\" id., at 151.2  Garza's trial counsel, however, did not file a notice of appeal.  Instead, counsel \"informed Mr. Garza that an appeal was problematic because he waived his right to appeal.\"  Ibid.  The period of time for Garza's appeal to be preserved came and went with no notice having been filed on Garza's behalf.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Roughly four months after sentencing, Garza sought postconviction relief in Idaho state court.  As relevant here, Garza alleged that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file notices of appeal despite Garza's requests.  The Idaho trial court denied relief, and both the Idaho Court of Appeals and the Idaho Supreme Court affirmed that decision.  See 162 Idaho 791, 793, 405 P.\u00a03d 576, 578 (2017).  The Idaho Supreme Court ruled that Garza, given the appeal waivers, needed to show both deficient performance and resulting prejudice; it concluded that he could not.  See id., at 798, 405 P.\u00a03d, at 583.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In ruling that Garza needed to show prejudice, the Idaho Supreme Court acknowledged that it was aligning itself with the minority position among courts.  For example, 8 of the 10 Federal Courts of Appeals to have considered the question have applied Flores-Ortega's presumption of prejudice even when a defendant has signed an appeal waiver.3  162 Idaho, at 795, 405 P.\u00a03d, at 580.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to resolve the split of authority. 585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).  We now reverse.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants \"the right .\u00a0.\u00a0. to have the Assistance of Counsel for [their] defence.\"  The right to counsel includes \"\u00a0'the right to the effective assistance of counsel.'\u00a0\"  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S. 668, 686 (1984) (quoting McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.\u00a0S. 759, 771, n. 14 (1970)).  Under Strickland, a defendant who claims ineffective assistance of counsel must prove (1) \"that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\" 466 U.\u00a0S., at 687-688, and (2) that any such deficiency was \"prejudicial to the defense,\" id., at 692.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"In certain Sixth Amendment contexts,\" however, \"prejudice is presumed.\"  Ibid.  For example, no showing of prejudice is necessary \"if the accused is denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial,\" United States v. Cronic, 466 U.\u00a0S. 648, 659 (1984), or left \"entirely without the assistance of counsel on appeal,\" Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.\u00a0S. 75, 88 (1988).  Similarly, prejudice is presumed \"if counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing.\"  Cronic, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 659.  And, most relevant here, prejudice is presumed \"when counsel's constitutionally deficient performance deprives a defendant of an appeal that he otherwise would have taken.\"  Flores-Ortega, 528 U.\u00a0S., at 484.  We hold today that this final presumption applies even when the defendant has signed an appeal waiver.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is helpful, in analyzing Garza's case, to first address two procedural devices on which the case hinges: appeal waivers and notices of appeal.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We begin with the term \"appeal waivers.\"  While the term is useful shorthand for clauses like those in Garza's plea agreements, it can misleadingly suggest a monolithic end to all appellate rights.4  In fact, however, no appeal waiver serves as an absolute bar to all appellate claims.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As courts widely agree, \"[a] valid and enforceable appeal waiver .\u00a0.\u00a0. only precludes challenges that fall within its scope.\"  United States v. Hardman, 778 F.\u00a03d 896, 899 (CA11 2014); see also ibid., n.\u00a02 (collecting cases from the 11 other Federal Courts of Appeals with criminal jurisdiction); State v. Patton, 287 Kan. 200, 228-229, 195 P.\u00a03d 753, 771 (2008).  That an appeal waiver does not bar claims outside its scope follows from the fact that, \"[a]lthough the analogy may not hold in all respects, plea bargains are essentially contracts.\"  Puckett v. United States, 556 U.\u00a0S. 129, 137 (2009).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As with any type of contract, the language of appeal waivers can vary widely, with some waiver clauses leaving many types of claims unwaived.5  Additionally, even a waived appellate claim can still go forward if the prosecution forfeits or waives the waiver.  E.g., United States v. Story, 439 F.\u00a03d 226, 231 (CA5 2006).  Accordingly, a defendant who has signed an appeal waiver does not, in directing counsel to file a notice of appeal, necessarily undertake a quixotic or frivolous quest.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Separately, all jurisdictions appear to treat at least some claims as unwaiveable.  Most fundamentally, courts agree that defendants retain the right to challenge whether the waiver itself is valid and enforceable--for example, on the grounds that it was unknowing or involuntary.6  Consequently, while signing an appeal waiver means giving up some, many, or even most appellate claims, some claims nevertheless remain.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is also important to consider what it means--and does not mean--for trial counsel to file a notice of appeal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Filing such a notice is a purely ministerial task that imposes no great burden on counsel.\"  Flores-Ortega, 528 U.\u00a0S., at 474.  It typically takes place during a compressed window: 42 days in Idaho, for example, and just 14 days in federal court.  See Idaho Rule App. Proc. 14(a) (2017); Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(b)(1)(A).  By the time this window has closed, the defendant likely will not yet have important documents from the trial court, such as transcripts of key proceedings, see, e.g., Idaho Rules App. Proc. 19 and 25; Fed. Rule App. Proc. 10(b), and may well be in custody, making communication with counsel difficult, see Peguero v. United States, 526 U.\u00a0S. 23, 26 (1999).  And because some defendants receive new counsel for their appeals, the lawyer responsible for deciding which appellate claims to raise may not yet even be involved in the case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Filing requirements reflect that claims are, accordingly, likely to be ill defined or unknown at this stage.  In the federal system, for example, a notice of appeal need only identify who is appealing; what \"judgment, order, or part thereof\" is being appealed; and \"the court to which the appeal is taken.\"  Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3(c)(1).  Generally speaking, state requirements are similarly nonsubstantive.7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A notice of appeal also fits within a broader division of labor between defendants and their attorneys.  While \"the accused has the ultimate authority\" to decide whether to \"take an appeal,\" the choice of what specific arguments to make within that appeal belongs to appellate counsel.  Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.\u00a0S. 745, 751 (1983); see also McCoy v. Louisiana, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 6).  In other words, filing a notice of appeal is, generally speaking, a simple, nonsubstantive act that is within the defendant's prerogative.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With that context in mind, we turn to the precise legal issues here.  As an initial matter, we note that Garza's attorney rendered deficient performance by not filing the notice of appeal in light of Garza's clear requests.  As this Court explained in Flores-Ortega:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We have long held that a lawyer who disregards specific instructions from the defendant to file a notice of appeal acts in a manner that is professionally unreasonable.  This is so because a defendant who instructs counsel to initiate an appeal reasonably relies upon counsel to file the necessary notice.  Counsel's failure to do so cannot be considered a strategic decision; filing a notice of appeal is a purely ministerial task, and the failure to file reflects inattention to the defendant's wishes.\"  528 U.\u00a0S., at 477 (citations omitted); see also id., at 478.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Idaho maintains that the risk of breaching the defendant's plea agreement renders counsel's choice to override the defendant's instructions a strategic one.  See Strickland, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 690-691 (\"[S]trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. \").  That is not so.  While we do not address what constitutes a defendant's breach of an appeal waiver or any responsibility counsel may have to discuss the potential consequences of such a breach, it should be clear from the foregoing that simply filing a notice of appeal does not necessarily breach a plea agreement, given the possibility that the defendant will end up raising claims beyond the waiver's scope.  And in any event, the bare decision whether to appeal is ultimately the defendant's, not counsel's, to make.8  See McCoy, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6); Barnes, 463 U.\u00a0S., at 751.  Where, as here, a defendant has expressly requested an appeal, counsel performs deficiently by disregarding the defendant's instructions.9\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We now address the crux of this case: whether Flores-Ortega's presumption of prejudice applies despite an appeal waiver.  The holding, principles, and facts of Flores-Ortega show why that presumption applies equally here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to prejudice, Flores-Ortega held that, to succeed in an ineffective-assistance claim in this context, a defendant need make only one showing: \"that, but for counsel's deficient failure to consult with him about an appeal, he would have timely appealed.\"  528 U.\u00a0S., at 484.  So long as a defendant can show that \"counsel's constitutionally deficient performance deprive[d him] of an appeal that he otherwise would have taken,\" courts are to \"presum[e] prejudice with no further showing from the defendant of the merits of his underlying claims.\"  Ibid.  Because there is no dispute here that Garza wished to appeal, see supra, at 2, a direct application of Flores-Ortega's language resolves this case.  See 528 U.\u00a0S., at 484.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Flores-Ortega's reasoning shows why an appeal waiver does not complicate this straightforward application.  That case, like this one, involves a lawyer who forfeited an appellate proceeding by failing to file a notice of appeal.  Id., at 473-475.  As the Court explained, given that past precedents call for a presumption of prejudice whenever \"\u00a0'the accused is denied counsel at a critical stage,'\u00a0\" it makes even greater sense to presume prejudice when  counsel's deficiency forfeits an \"appellate proceeding altogether.\"  Id., at 483.  After all, there is no disciplined way to \"accord any 'presumption of reliability'.\u00a0.\u00a0. to judicial proceedings that never took place.\"  Ibid. (quoting Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.\u00a0S. 259, 286 (2000)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That rationale applies just as well here because, as discussed supra, at 4-6, Garza retained a right to appeal at least some issues despite the waivers he signed.10  In other words, Garza had a right to a proceeding, and he was denied that proceeding altogether as a result of counsel's deficient performance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That Garza surrendered many claims by signing his appeal waivers does not change things.  First, this Court has made clear that when deficient counsel causes the loss of an entire proceeding, it will not bend the presumption-of-prejudice rule simply because a particular defendant seems to have had poor prospects.  See, e.g., Jae Lee v. United States, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 9).  We hew to that principle again here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, while the defendant in Flores-Ortega did not sign an appeal waiver, he did plead guilty, and--as the Court pointed out--\"a guilty plea reduces the scope of potentially appealable issues\" on its own.  See 528 U.\u00a0S., at 480.  In other words, with regard to the defendant's appellate prospects, Flores-Ortega presented at most a difference of degree, not kind, and prescribed a presumption of prejudice regardless of how many appellate claims were foreclosed.  See id., at 484.  We do no different today.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead, we reaffirm that, \"when counsel's constitutionally deficient performance deprives a defendant of an appeal that he otherwise would have taken, the defendant has made out a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim entitling him to an appeal,\" with no need for a \"further showing\" of his claims' merit, ibid., regardless of whether the defendant has signed an appeal waiver.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Flores-Ortega states, in one sentence, that the loss of the \"entire [appellate] proceeding itself, which a defendant wanted at the time and to which he had a right, .\u00a0.\u00a0. demands a presumption of prejudice.\"  Id., at 483.  Idaho and the U.\u00a0S. Government, participating as an amicus on Idaho's behalf, seize on this language, asserting that Garza never \"had a right\" to his appeal and thus that any deficient performance by counsel could not have caused the loss of any such appeal.  See Brief for Respondent 11, 23-26; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 7, 13, 21-22.  These arguments miss the point.  Garza did retain a right to his appeal; he simply had fewer possible claims than some other appellants.  Especially because so much is unknown at the notice-of-appeal stage, see supra, at 6-7, it is wholly speculative to say that counsel's deficiency forfeits no proceeding to which a defendant like Garza has a right.11\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government also takes its causation argument one step further.  Arguing that, in the appeal-waiver context, \"a generalized request that an attorney file an appeal .\u00a0.\u00a0. is not enough to show that appellate merits review would have followed,\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22, the Government proposes a rule that would require a defendant to show--on a \"case-specific\" basis, id., at 23--either (1) \"that he in fact requested, or at least expressed interest in, an appeal on a non-waived issue,\" id., at 21-22, or alternatively (2) \"\u00a0'that there were nonfrivolous grounds for appeal' despite the waiver,\" id., at 22 (quoting Flores-Ortega, 528 U.\u00a0S., at 485).  We decline this suggestion, because it cannot be squared with our precedent and would likely prove both unfair and inefficient in practice.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has already rejected attempts to condition the restoration of a defendant's appellate rights forfeited by ineffective counsel on proof that the defendant's appeal had merit.  In Flores-Ortega, the Court explained that prejudice should be presumed \"with no further showing from the defendant of the merits of his underlying claims.\"  Id., at 484; see also id., at 486.  In Rodriquez v. United States, 395 U.\u00a0S. 327 (1969), similarly, the Court rejected a rule that required a defendant whose appeal had been forfeited by counsel \"to specify the points he would raise were his right to appeal reinstated.\"  Id., at 330.  So too here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, while it is the defendant's prerogative whether to appeal, it is not the defendant's role to decide what arguments to press.  See Barnes, 463 U.\u00a0S., at 751, 754.  That makes it especially improper to impose that role upon the defendant simply because his opportunity to appeal was relinquished by deficient counsel.  \"Those whose right to appeal has been frustrated should be treated exactly like any other appellants; they should not be  given an additional hurdle to clear just because their rights were violated at some earlier stage in the proceedings.\"  Rodriquez, 395 U.\u00a0S., at 330.  We accordingly decline to place a pleading barrier between a defendant and an opportunity to appeal that he never should have lost.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, the Government's assumption that unwaived claims can reliably be distinguished from waived claims through case-by-case postconviction review is dubious.  There is no right to counsel in postconviction proceedings, see Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U.\u00a0S. 551, 555 (1987), and most applicants proceed pro\u00a0se.12  That means that the Government effectively puts its faith in asking \"an indigent, perhaps pro\u00a0se, defendant to demonstrate that his hypothetical appeal might have had merit before any advocate has ever reviewed the record in his case in search of potentially meritorious grounds for appeal,\" Flores-Ortega, 528 U.\u00a0S., at 486.  We have already explained why this would be \"unfair\" and ill advised.  See ibid.; see also Rodriquez, 395 U.\u00a0S., at 330.  Compounding the trouble, defendants would be asked to make these showings in the face of the heightened standards and related hurdles that attend many postconviction proceedings.  See, e.g., 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a72254, 2255; see also Brief for Idaho Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 22-25.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government's proposal is also unworkable.  For one, it would be difficult and time consuming for a postconviction court to determine--perhaps years later--what appellate claims a defendant was contemplating at the time of conviction.13  Moreover, because most postconviction petitioners will be pro\u00a0se, courts would regularly have to parse both (1) what claims a pro\u00a0se defendant seeks to raise and (2) whether each plausibly invoked claim is subject to the defendant's appeal waiver (which can be complex, see supra, at 4-6), all without the assistance of counseled briefing.  We are not persuaded that this would be a more efficient or trustworthy process than the one we reaffirm today.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The more administrable and workable rule, rather, is the one compelled by our precedent: When counsel's deficient performance forfeits an appeal that a defendant otherwise would have taken, the defendant gets a new opportunity to appeal.  That is the rule already in use in 8 of the 10 Federal Circuits to have considered the question, see supra, at 3, and n.\u00a03, and neither Idaho nor its amici have pointed us to any evidence that it has proved unmanageable there.14  That rule does no more than restore the status quo that existed before counsel's deficient performance forfeited the appeal, and it allows an appellate court to consider the appeal as that court otherwise would have done--on direct review, and assisted by counsel's briefing.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hold today that the presumption of prejudice recognized in Flores-Ortega applies regardless of whether a defendant has signed an appeal waiver.  This ruling follows squarely from Flores-Ortega and from the fact that even the broadest appeal waiver does not deprive a defendant of all appellate claims.  Accordingly where, as here, an attorney performed deficiently in failing to file a notice of appeal despite the defendant's express instructions, prejudice is presumed \"with no further showing from the defendant of the merits of his underlying claims.\"  See Flores-Ortega, 528 U.\u00a0S., at 484.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Supreme Court of Idaho is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nThomas, J., dissenting\n\u2002586 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1026\nGILBERTO GARZA, Jr., PETITIONER v. IDAHO\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of idaho\n[February 27, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, and with whom Justice Alito joins as to Parts I and II, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Gilberto Garza avoided a potential life sentence by negotiating with the State of Idaho for reduced charges and a 10-year sentence.  In exchange, Garza waived several constitutional and statutory rights, including \"his right to appeal.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a, 49a.  Despite this express waiver, Garza asked his attorney to challenge on appeal the very sentence for which he had bargained.  Garza's counsel quite reasonably declined to file an appeal for that purpose, recognizing that his client had waived this right and that filing an appeal would potentially jeopardize his plea bargain.  Yet, the majority finds Garza's counsel constitutionally ineffective, holding that an attorney's performance is per\u00a0se deficient and per\u00a0se prejudicial any time the attorney declines a criminal defendant's request to appeal an issue that the defendant has waived.  In effect, this results in a \"defendant-always-wins\" rule that has no basis in Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.\u00a0S. 470 (2000), or our other ineffective-assistance precedents, and certainly no basis in the original meaning of the Sixth Amendment.  I respectfully dissent.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2015, in accordance with two plea agreements, Garza entered an Alford1 plea to aggravated assault and pleaded guilty to possession with intent to deliver methamphetamine.  Under the terms of the plea agreements, Idaho agreed not to (1) file additional burglary and grand theft charges; (2) refer Garza for federal prosecution on a charge of unlawful possession of ammunition by a felon, see 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(1); or (3) seek a \"Persistent violator\" sentencing enhancement that would expose Garza to a potential life sentence, see Idaho Code Ann. \u00a719-2514 (2017).  In exchange, Garza agreed to \"\u00a0'waiv[e] his right to appeal'\u00a0\" and his right to file a motion for correction or reduction of his sentence.2 Ante, at 2.  And both parties agreed to specific sentences totaling 10 years of imprisonment, which would be binding on the District Court if it accepted the plea agreements.  See Idaho Crim. Rules 11(f\u00a0)(1)(C) and (f\u00a0)(3) (2017) (allowing parties to agree to a binding sentence).  Thus, the judge could impose no sentence other than the 10 years for which Garza had bargained.3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trial court accepted the plea agreements and, as required, sentenced Garza to 10 years' imprisonment.  However, the court noted that if the cases had been \"considered individually,\" a \"harsher sentence\" might have been warranted due to Garza's \"history of violent crime\" and the \"gratuitous aggression\" displayed by Garza in the aggravated-assault case.  Record 336.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Four months later, Garza filed the petitions for postconviction relief at issue here.  Among other things, he claimed that his pleas were not voluntary and that his counsel had been constitutionally ineffective for failing to file an appeal despite repeated requests that he do so.  For relief, Garza requested that his sentences \"run concurrent.\"  Id., at 207.  The trial court appointed counsel to pursue Garza's collateral challenges.  It subsequently dismissed Garza's claim that his plea was involuntary for \"lack of supporting evidence,\" but it allowed the ineffective-assistance claim to proceed.  App. to Pet for Cert. 3a, 29a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In response to Garza's ineffective-assistance claim, Idaho submitted an affidavit from Garza's trial counsel, which stated, \"Garza indicated to me that he knew he agreed not to appeal his sentence(s) but he told me that he wanted to appeal the sentence(s)\" anyway.  Record 151.  The trial counsel explained that he did not honor that request because \"Garza received the sentence(s) he bargained for in his [Idaho Criminal Rule] 11(f\u00a0)(1)(c) Agreement,\" and he told Garza \"that an appeal was problematic because he waived his right to appeal in his Rule 11 agreements.\"  Ibid.  Garza, through his newly appointed collateral counsel, admitted that the appeal waiver \"was by the book,\" that he \"received exactly what he bargained for in exchange for his plea,\" and that there was \"no ambiguity\" as to the appropriate sentence.  Id., at 161-162, 276-277.  Garza also conceded that, if forced to identify an issue he would raise on appeal, \"[t]he only issue that could be identified is sentencing review.\"  Id., at 176, 371.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trial court granted summary judgment to Idaho.  It explained that Garza needed to identify \"non-frivolous grounds for contending on appeal either that (i) the appeal waiver is invalid or unenforceable, or (ii) the issues he wants to pursue on appeal are outside the waiver's scope.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 38a.  The Idaho Court of Appeals and the Idaho Supreme Court affirmed.  Notably, the Idaho Supreme Court declined to presume negligent performance because state law imposes a duty on counsel not to file frivolous litigation and to avoid taking actions that will jeopardize the benefit his client gained from the plea bargain.  The Idaho Supreme Court also found Flores-Ortega inapplicable, reasoning that once a defendant waives his appellate rights, he no longer has a right to an appellate proceeding at all.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As with most ineffective-assistance claims, a defendant seeking to show that counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to file an appeal must show deficient performance and prejudice.  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S. 668, 687 (1984).  Relying on Flores-Ortega, the majority finds that Garza has satisfied both prongs.  In so holding, it adopts a rule whereby a criminal defendant's invocation of the words \"I want to appeal\" can undo all sworn attestations to the contrary and resurrect waived statutory rights.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This rule is neither compelled by precedent nor consistent with the use of appeal waivers in plea bargaining.  In my view, a defendant who has executed an appeal waiver cannot show prejudice arising from his counsel's decision not to appeal unless he (1) identifies claims he would have pursued that were outside the appeal waiver; (2) shows that the plea was involuntary or unknowing; or (3) establishes that the government breached the plea agreement.  Garza has not made any such showing, so he cannot establish prejudice.  Furthermore, because Garza's counsel acted reasonably, Garza also cannot establish deficient performance.  I would therefore affirm.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority relies on Flores-Ortega to create its new rule, but if anything, that decision undermines the majority's per\u00a0se approach.  In Flores-Ortega, the defendant pleaded guilty to second-degree murder without waiving any of his appellate rights.  528 U.\u00a0S., at 473-474.  On federal collateral review, the defendant alleged that his counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal after she promised to do so.  Id., at 474.  The record contained conflicting evidence as to whether the defendant had communicated his desire to appeal, and the District Court concluded that he failed to carry his burden.  Id., at 475.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, reasoning that \"a habeas petitioner need only show that his counsel's failure to file a notice of appeal was without the petitioner's consent.\"  Id., at 475-476.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court reversed.  We first concluded that the Ninth Circuit's rule \"effectively impose[d] an obligation on counsel in all cases either (1) to file a notice of appeal, or (2) to discuss the possibility of an appeal with the defendant, ascertain his wishes, and act accordingly.\"  Id., at 478.  We rejected \"this per\u00a0se rule as inconsistent with Strickland's holding that 'the performance inquiry must be whether counsel's assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.'\u00a0\"  Ibid. (quoting 466 U.\u00a0S., at 688).  We also faulted the Ninth Circuit for \"fail[ing] to engage in the circumstance-specific reasonableness inquiry required by Strickland.\"  528 U.\u00a0S., at 478.  We concluded that this failure \"alone mandates vacatur and remand.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We further explained that counsel's failure to consult with the client about an appeal constitutes deficient performance only when counsel should have consulted.  Id., at 479.  The Court was clear: \"We cannot say, as a constitutional matter, that in every case counsel's failure to consult with the defendant about an appeal is necessarily unreasonable.\"  Ibid.  In determining whether counsel has a duty to consult, we stated that \"a highly relevant factor in this inquiry will be whether the conviction follows a trial or guilty plea, both because a guilty plea reduces the scope of potentially appealable issues and because such a plea may indicate that the defendant seeks an end to judicial proceedings.\"  Id., at 480.  Finally, \"[e]ven in cases when the defendant pleads guilty, the court must consider such factors as whether the defendant received the sentence bargained for as part of the plea and whether the plea expressly reserved or waived some or all appeal rights.\"  Ibid.  We rejected the argument that choosing not to consult was outside the scope of valid, strategic decisionmaking, as \"we have consistently declined to impose mechanical rules on counsel.\"  Id., at 481.  In sum, we \"reject[ed] a bright-line rule that counsel must always consult with the defendant regarding an appeal\" and instructed courts to evaluate whether the decision to consult was \"reasonable\" under the circumstances.  Id., at 480-481.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We also rejected the Ninth Circuit's \"per\u00a0se prejudice rule\" because it \"ignore[d] the critical requirement that counsel's deficient performance must actually cause the forfeiture of the defendant's appeal.\"  Id., at 484.  We held that, \"to show prejudice in these circumstances, a defendant must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's deficient failure to consult with him about an appeal, he would have timely appealed.\"  Ibid.  After the defendant makes that showing, we held that he was entitled to a presumption of prejudice because he was denied counsel during the entire appellate proceeding, rendering it presumptively unreliable.  Id., at 483-485.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court purports to follow Flores-Ortega, but glosses over the important factual and legal differences between that case and this one.  The most obvious difference is also the most crucial: There was no appellate waiver in Flores-Ortega.  The proximate cause of the defendant's failure to appeal in that case was his counsel's failure to file one.  Not so here.  Garza knowingly waived his appeal rights and never expressed a desire to withdraw his plea.  It was thus Garza's agreement to waive his appeal rights, not his attorney's actions, that caused the forfeiture of his appeal.  Thus, Flores-Ortega is inapposite.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because Flores-Ortega does not control cases involving defendants who voluntarily waive their appeal rights, this case should be resolved based on a straightforward application of Strickland.  Under that framework, Garza has failed to demonstrate either (1) that his counsel was deficient or (2) that he was prejudiced in any way by that alleged deficiency.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to deficiency, \"[n]o particular set of detailed rules for counsel's conduct can satisfactorily take account of the variety of circumstances faced by defense counsel.\"  Strickland, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 688-689.  Accordingly, \"[\u00a0j]udicial scrutiny of counsel's performance must be highly deferential\" and focus on \"the reasonableness of counsel's challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case.\"  Id., at 689-690.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Counsel's choice not to appeal Garza's sentence--the only issue Garza asked his counsel to challenge--was not only not deficient, it was the only professionally reasonable course of action for counsel under the circumstances.  That is because filing an appeal would have been worse than pointless even judging by Garza's own express desires; it would have created serious risks for Garza while having no chance at all of achieving Garza's stated goals for an appeal.  Garza had pleaded guilty under Rule 11, expressly waived his right to appeal his sentence, and stated that his desire in appealing was to have his consecutive sentences \"r[u]n concurrent.\"  Record 207.  But that kind of appeal challenges the defining feature of a Rule 11 plea: the agreed-upon sentence from which the trial court has no discretion to deviate.  Here, that sentence includes the consecutive sentences that Garza agreed to, then sought to challenge. Had Garza's counsel reflexively filed an appeal and triggered resentencing, Garza might have faced life in prison, especially in light of the trial court's concern that the agreed-upon sentence (from which it could not deviate under Rule 11) might have been too lenient.  And Garza's admissions at the plea hearings and his written plea form could have been (and thus likely would have been) used against him if he had proceeded to trial on any additional charges filed by the State after breaching the plea agreements.  See id., at 104 (\"[S]hould the court reinstate a plea of not guilty on his behalf, the State will use Defendant's testimony during his entry of plea of guilty and his written plea form, during the State's case at trial\"); id., at 92 (same).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under these circumstances, it is eminently reasonable for an attorney to \"respec[t] his client's formal waiver of appeal\" and uphold his duty \"to avoid taking steps that will cost the client the benefit of the plea bargain.\"  Nunez v. United States, 546 F.\u00a03d 450, 453, 455 (CA7 2008) (Easterbrook, C.\u00a0J.).  And because filing an appeal places the defendant's plea agreement in jeopardy, an attorney's decision not to file in the face of an appellate waiver does not amount to the failure to perform \"a purely ministerial task\" that \"cannot be considered a strategic decision.\"  Flores-Ortega, 528 U.\u00a0S., at 477.  Even where state law or a plea agreement preserves limited appeal rights, an attorney does not fail to \"show up for appeal\" by declining to challenge a waived issue.  Nunez, supra, at 454.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The deficiency analysis in this case would likely be different if Garza had informed his counsel that he desired to breach the plea agreements and file an appeal--despite the waiver and in full awareness of the associated risks-- for the sake of an identified goal that had any hope of being advanced by the filing of an appeal.  But the record shows that Garza simply sought a more lenient sentence.  Since that goal could not be advanced by an appeal in this case, counsel had no duty to file one.  The Constitution does not compel attorneys to take irrational means to their client's stated ends when doing so only courts disaster.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Garza ultimately faults his plea-stage attorney for failing to put his plea agreements in jeopardy.  But I have no doubt that if a similarly situated attorney breached a plea agreement by appealing a waived issue and subjected his client to an increased prison term, that defendant would argue that his counsel was ineffective for filing the appeal.  What Garza wants--and what the majority gives him--is a per\u00a0se deficiency rule ensuring that criminal defendants can always blame their plea-stage counsel on collateral review, even where they did not ask counsel to appeal nonwaived claims or breach the plea agreement for the sake of some further (achievable) goal.  Declining to file an appeal under these circumstances is reasonable, not deficient.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for prejudice, Garza cannot benefit from a presumed-prejudice finding since he cannot establish that his counsel caused the forfeiture of his appeal, as Flores-Ortega requires.  Garza knowingly and voluntarily bargained away his right to appeal in exchange for a lower sentence.  If any prejudice resulted from that decision, it cannot be attributed to his counsel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It does not matter that certain appellate issues--specifically, (1) the voluntariness of the plea agreement and (2) a breach of the agreement by the State--are not waivable.  Garza did not ask his counsel to appeal those issues.  In fact, Garza has not identified any nonwaived issue that he would have brought on direct appeal; he simply identified \"sentencing review\" as his primary objective.  Moreover, declining to file an appeal raising these nonwaivable claims is unlikely to be prejudicial; this Court has repeatedly stated that collateral review is a better avenue to address involuntariness and ineffective-assistance claims, as these claims often require extrarecord materials and present conflicts with counsel.  See generally Massaro v. United States, 538 U.\u00a0S. 500 (2003).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's decision in McCoy v. Louisiana, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018), does not change the analysis.  McCoy acknowledges that some decisions are \"reserved for the client,\" including the decision whether to \"forgo an appeal.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6).  But Garza exercised his right to decide whether to appeal.  He chose not to when he entered the plea agreements.  Like many constitutional and statutory rights, the right to appeal can be waived by the defendant, and once that choice is finally made, the defendant is bound by the decision and cannot fault his attorney for the self-inflicted prejudicial effects that he suffers.  For instance, a defendant cannot waive his right against self-incrimination by testifying at his trial, and then claim that his attorney prejudiced him by not moving to strike his damaging testimony from the record.  Nor can a defendant waive his right to a jury trial, and then later claim prejudice when his attorney declines to seek a mistrial on the ground that the judge found him guilty.  In the same way, Garza was not prejudiced by his attorney's refusal to file an appeal challenging his sentence, a right that he had expressly waived.  The lack of prejudice is especially pronounced in this case, as Garza's instruction to appeal did not acknowledge that he wanted to challenge or rescind the plea agreements.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is no persuasive reason to depart from an ordinary Strickland analysis in cases involving an attorney's decision to honor his client's agreement to waive his appeal rights.  Garza contends that it is unfair to require pro\u00a0se defendants to identify the issues they would have raised on appeal.  But pro\u00a0se defendants always bear the burden of showing ineffective assistance of counsel; I see no reason why this kind of ineffective-assistance claim should be any different.  Regardless, Garza's fairness argument rings hollow because Garza has been represented by counsel at every stage of this collateral litigation and has yet to articulate a single nonfrivolous, nonwaived issue that he would have raised on appeal.  His inability to identify any issues that he preserved simply underscores the fact that he waived them all.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's rule may be easy to \"administ[er],\" ante, at 13, but it undermines the finality of criminal judgments--a primary purpose of plea agreements--and disadvantages the public by allowing defendants to relitigate issues that they waived in exchange for substantial benefits.  The Court's rule also burdens the appellate courts that must address the new, meritless appeals authorized by today's decision.  And, ironically, the Court's rule may prejudice the defendants it is designed to help, as prosecutors may understandably be less willing to offer generous plea agreements when courts refuse to afford the government the benefit of its bargain--fewer resources spent defending appeals.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, because Garza's requested relief is categorically barred by the plea agreements, the majority offers Garza an appeal he is certain to lose.  And should Garza accept the majority's invitation, he could give up much more.  If Garza appeals his sentence and thereby breaches his plea agreements, Idaho will be free to file additional charges against him, argue for a \"Persistent violator\" sentencing enhancement that could land him in prison for life, and refer him for federal prosecution.  It simply defies logic to describe counsel's attempt to avoid those consequences as deficient or prejudicial.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to breaking from this Court's precedent, today's decision moves the Court another step further from the original meaning of the Sixth Amendment.  The Sixth Amendment provides that, \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right .\u00a0.\u00a0. to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\"  That provision \"as originally understood and ratified meant only that a defendant had a right to employ counsel, or to use volunteered services of counsel.\"  Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.\u00a0S. 356, 389 (2010) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Yet, the Court has read the Constitution to require not only a right to counsel at taxpayers' expense, but a right to effective counsel.  The result is that convicted criminals can relitigate their trial and appellate claims through collateral challenges couched as ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims.  Because little available evidence suggests that this reading is correct as an original matter, the Court should tread carefully before extending our precedents in this area.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel grew out of the Founders' reaction to the English common-law rule that denied counsel for treason and felony offenses with respect to issues of fact, while allowing counsel for misdemeanors.  See 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 349-350 (1769); 1 J. Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England 341 (1883); Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.\u00a0S. 45, 60 (1932) (\"Originally, in England, a person charged with treason or felony was denied the aid of counsel, except in respect of legal questions which the accused himself might suggest\").  It was not until 1696 that England created a narrow exception to this rule for individuals accused of treason or misprision of treason--by statute, Parliament provided both that the accused may retain counsel and that the court must appoint counsel if requested.  7 & 8 Will. 3, ch.\u00a03, \u00a71.  Only in 1836 did England permit all criminally accused to appear and defend with counsel, and even then it did not require court-appointed counsel at government expense.  6 & 7 Will. 4, ch. 114, \u00a71.  It would be another 67 years--112 years after the ratification of the Sixth Amendment, and 35 years after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment--before England provided court-appointed counsel for all felonies.  Poor Prisoners' Defence Act, 1903, 3 Edw. 7, ch. 38, \u00a71.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The traditional common-law rule that there was no right to assistance of counsel for felony offenses received widespread criticism.  As Blackstone noted, this rule \"seems to be not at all of a piece with the rest of the humane treatment of prisoners by the English law.\"  4 Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, at 349; see ibid. (\"[U]pon what face of reason can that assistance be denied to save the life of a man, which yet is allowed him in prosecutions for every petty trespass\").  The founding generation apparently shared this sentiment, as most States adopted some kind of statutory or constitutional provision providing the accused the right to retain counsel.  W. Beaney, The Right to Counsel in American Courts 14-22 (1955).  In fact, at least 12 of the 13 States at the ratification of the Constitution had rejected the English common-law rule, providing for the right to counsel in at least some circumstances.  See Powell, 287 U.\u00a0S., at 64-65; id., at 61-64 (surveying the States' right-to-counsel provisions); see also Betts v. Brady, 316 U.\u00a0S. 455, 465-467 (1942) (discussing early state constitutional provisions), overruled by Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.\u00a0S. 335 (1963).  Read against this backdrop, the Sixth Amendment appears to have been understood at the time of ratification as a rejection of the English common-law rule that prohibited counsel, not as a guarantee of government-funded counsel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This understanding--that the Sixth Amendment did not require appointed counsel for defendants--persisted in the Court's jurisprudence for nearly 150 years.  See United States v. Van Duzee, 140 U.\u00a0S. 169, 173 (1891) (\"There is, however, no general obligation on the part of the government [to] retain counsel for defendants or prisoners\"); Bute v. Illinois, 333 U.\u00a0S. 640, 661, n.\u00a017 (1948) (\"It is probably safe to say that from its adoption in 1791 until 1938, the right conferred on the accused by the Sixth Amendment .\u00a0.\u00a0. was not regarded as imposing on the trial judge in a Federal court the duty to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant\").  Nor evidently was there any suggestion that defendants could mount a constitutional attack based on their counsel's failure to render effective assistance.4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court began shifting direction in 1932, when it suggested that a right to appointed counsel might exist in at least some capital cases, albeit as a right guaranteed by the Due Process Clause.  Powell, supra, at 71.  Soon thereafter, the Court held that the Sixth Amendment secures a right to court-appointed counsel in all federal criminal cases.  Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.\u00a0S. 458, 462-463 (1938).  And in 1963, the Court applied this categorical rule to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, stating \"that in our adversary system of criminal justice, any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him.\"  Gideon, supra, at 344.  Neither of these opinions attempted to square the expansive rights they recognized with the original meaning of the \"right .\u00a0.\u00a0. to have the Assistance of Counsel.\"  Amdt. 6.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the Court announced a constitutional right to appointed counsel rooted in the Sixth Amendment, it went on to fashion a constitutional new-trial remedy for cases in which counsel performed poorly.  The Courts of Appeals had initially adopted a \"farce and mockery\" standard that they rooted in the Due Process Clause.  This standard permitted a defendant to make out an ineffective-assistance claim only \"where the circumstances surrounding the trial shocked the conscience of the court and made the proceedings a farce and a mockery of justice.\"  Diggs v. Welch, 148 F.\u00a02d 667, 670 (CADC 1945); see Bottiglio v. United States, 431 F.\u00a02d 930, 931 (CA1 1970) (per curiam); Williams v. Beto, 354 F.\u00a02d 698, 704 (CA5 1965); Frand v. United States, 301 F.\u00a02d 102, 103 (CA10 1962); O'Malley v. United States, 285 F.\u00a02d 733, 734 (CA6 1961); Snead v. Smyth, 273 F.\u00a02d 838, 842 (CA4 1959); Cofield v. United States, 263 F.\u00a02d 686, 689 (CA9), vacated on other grounds, 360 U.\u00a0S. 472 (1959); Johnston v. United States, 254 F.\u00a02d 239, 240 (CA8 1958); United States ex\u00a0rel. Feeley v. Ragen, 166 F.\u00a02d 976, 980-981 (CA7 1948); United States v. Wight, 176 F.\u00a02d 376, 379 (CA2 1949).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beginning in 1970, the Courts of Appeals moved from the \"farce and mockery\" standard to a \"reasonable competence\" standard.  See Trapnell v. United States, 725 F.\u00a02d 149, 151-152 (CA2 1983) (collecting cases). That same year, this Court similarly held that defendants are \"entitled to the effective assistance of competent counsel,\" defined as receipt of legal advice that is \"within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\"  McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.\u00a0S. 759, 771 (1970).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, in Strickland, the Court crafted the current standard for evaluating claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.  Without discussing the original meaning of the Sixth Amendment, the Court stated that \"[t]he Sixth Amendment recognizes the right to the assistance of counsel because it envisions counsel's playing a role that is critical to the ability of the adversarial system to produce just results.\"  466 U.\u00a0S., at 685.  The Court thus held that, to succeed on an ineffective-assistance claim, the defendant must show (1) \"that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\" and (2) \"that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"  Id., at 688, 694.  The Court applies this standard in most situations, but, as it does today, it has also created an increasing number of per\u00a0se rules in lieu of applying Strickland's fact-specific inquiry, thereby departing even further from the original meaning of the Sixth Amendment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are a few problems with these precedents that should cause us to pause before extending them.  First, the ineffective-assistance standard apparently originated not in the Sixth Amendment, but in our Due Process Clause jurisprudence.  See McMann, supra, at 771, n.\u00a014. Second, \"[t]he Constitution, by its terms, does not mandate any particular remedy for violations of its own provisions.\"  United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.\u00a0S. 140, 157 (2006) (Alito, J., dissenting); cf. Collins v. Virginia, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2-5) (explaining that the exclusionary rule is not required by the Fourth Amendment).  Strickland does not explain how the Constitution requires a new trial for violations of any right to counsel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, our precedents seek to use the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to achieve an end it is not designed to guarantee.  The right to counsel is not an assurance of an error-free trial or even a reliable result.  It ensures fairness in a single respect: permitting the accused to employ the services of an attorney.  The structural protections provided in the Sixth Amendment certainly seek to promote reliable criminal proceedings, but there is no substantive right to a particular level of reliability.  In assuming otherwise, our ever-growing right-to-counsel precedents directly conflict with the government's legitimate interest in the finality of criminal judgments.  I would proceed with far more caution than the Court has traditionally demonstrated in this area.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court should hesitate before further extending our precedents and imposing additional costs on the taxpayers and the Judiciary.5  History proves that the States and the Federal Government are capable of making the policy determinations necessary to assign public resources for appointed counsel.  The Court has acknowledged as much.  Betts, 316 U.\u00a0S., at 471 (declining to extend the right to counsel to the States because \"the matter has generally been deemed one of legislative policy\").  Before the Court decided Gideon, the Court noted that \"most of the States have by legislation authorized or even required the courts to assign counsel for the defense of indigent and unrepresented prisoners.  As to capital cases, all the States so provide.  Thirty-four States so provide for felonies and 28 for misdemeanors.\"  Bute, 333 U.\u00a0S., at 663 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It is beyond our constitutionally prescribed role to make these policy choices ourselves.  Even if we adhere to this line of precedents, our dubious authority in this area should give us pause before we extend these precedents further.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The record suggests that Garza may have been confused as to whether he had waived his appellate rights in the first place.  See Record 97 (answering \"No\" on a court advisory form asking whether Garza had \"waived [his] right to appeal [his] judgment of conviction and sentence as part of [his] plea agreement\"); see also id., at 118, 121, 132 (showing that Garza's sentencing judge and judgments of conviction provided, despite the appeal waiver, generalized notice of a \"right to appeal\").  Because our ruling does not turn on these facts, we do not address them further.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Garza's affidavit states that he wished to argue, at least in part, that he \"was persuaded to plead guilty by [the] prosecuting attorney and [his] counsel which was not voluntarily [sic].\"  Id., at 210.\nFootnote 3\u00a0Compare Campbell v. United States, 686 F.\u00a03d 353, 359 (CA6 2012); Watson v. United States, 493 F.\u00a03d 960, 964 (CA8 2007); United States v. Poindexter, 492 F.\u00a03d 263, 273 (CA4 2007); United States v.

At least two state courts have declined to apply Flores-Ortega in the face of appeal waivers.  See Buettner v. State, 382 Mont. 410, 363 P.\u00a03d 1147 (2015) (Table); Stewart v. United States, 37 A.\u00a03d 870, 877 (D.\u00a0C. 2012); see also Kargus v.

Barnes, 463 U.\u00a0S. 745, 751 (1983); see also Douglas v. California, 372 U.\u00a0S. 353 (1963); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.\u00a0S. 12, 18 (1956) (plurality opinion).  Today, criminal defendants in nearly all States have a right to appeal either by statute or by court rule.  See generally Robertson, The Right To Appeal, 91 N.\u00a0C. L.\u00a0Rev. 1219, 1222, and n.\u00a08 (2013).  Criminal defendants in federal court have appellate rights under 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73742(a) and 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71291.\nFootnote 5\u00a0See generally Brief for Idaho Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 6-10 (collecting examples of appeal waivers that allowed challenges to the defendant's sentence or conviction or allowed claims based on prosecutorial misconduct or changes in law).\nFootnote 6\u00a0See, e.g., United States v. Brown, 892 F.\u00a03d 385, 394 (CADC 2018) (\"Like all other courts of appeals, our circuit holds that a defendant 'may waive his right to appeal his sentence as long as his decision is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary'\u00a0\"); Spann v. State, 704 N.\u00a0W. 2d 486, 491 (Minn. 2005) (\"Jurisdictions allowing a defendant to waive his or her right to appeal a conviction require that the waiver be made 'intelligently, voluntarily, and with an understanding of the consequences'\u00a0\").  Lower courts have also applied exceptions for other kinds of claims, including \"claims that a sentence is based on race discrimination, exceeds the statutory maximum authorized, or is the product of ineffective assistance of counsel.\"  King & O'Neill, Appeal Waivers and the Future of Sentencing Policy, 55 Duke L.\u00a0J. 209, 224 (2005) (collecting federal cases); see also, e.g., United States v. Puentes-Hurtado, 794 F.\u00a03d 1278, 1284 (CA11 2015) (\"[A]ppellate review is also permitted when a defendant claims that the government breached the very plea agreement which purports to bar him from appealing or collaterally attacking his conviction and sentence\"); State v. Dye, 291 Neb. 989, 999, 870 N.\u00a0W. 2d 628, 634 (2015) (holding that appeal waivers are subject to a \"miscarriage of justice\" exception).  We make no statement today on what particular exceptions may be required.\nFootnote 7\u00a0E.g., Miss. Rule Crim. Proc. 29.1(b) (2017); Ohio Rule App. Proc. 3(D) (Lexis 2017).  While Idaho requires a notice of appeal to \"contain substantially .\u00a0.\u00a0. [a] preliminary statement of the issues on appeal which the appellant then intends to assert in the appeal,\" the Rule in question also makes clear that \"any such list of issues on appeal shall not prevent the appellant from asserting other issues on appeal.\"  Idaho Rule App. Proc. 17(f\u00a0).\nFootnote 8\u00a0That does not mean, of course, that appellate counsel must then make unsupportable arguments.  After an appeal has been preserved and counsel has reviewed the case, counsel may always, in keeping with longstanding precedent, \"advise the court and request permission to withdraw,\" while filing \"a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\"  Anders v. California, 386 U.\u00a0S. 738, 744 (1967).  The existence of this procedure reinforces that a defendant's appellate rights should not hinge \"on appointed counsel's bare assertion that he or she is of the opinion that there is no merit to the appeal.\"  Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.\u00a0S. 75, 80 (1988).\nFootnote 9\u00a0We leave undisturbed today Flores-Ortega's separate discussion of how to approach situations in which a defendant's wishes are less clear.  See 528 U.\u00a0S., at 478-481.\nFootnote 10\u00a0Or the State might not have invoked the waiver at all.  E.g., United States v. Archie, 771 F.\u00a03d 217, 223, n.\u00a02 (CA4 2014); State v. Rendon, 2012 WL 9492805, *1, n.\u00a01 (Idaho Ct. App., May 11, 2012).\nFootnote 11\u00a0The possibility that an appellate court confronted with a waived claim (and a motion to enforce the waiver) would technically \"dismiss the appeal without reaching the merits,\" see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17; see also Brief for Respondent 26, does not alter this conclusion.  Whatever the label, the defendant loses the opportunity to raise any appellate claims at all--including those that would, or at least could, be heard on the merits.\nFootnote 12\u00a0For example, researchers have found that over 90% of noncapital federal habeas petitioners proceed without counsel.  See N. King et al., Final Technical Report: Habeas Litigation in U.\u00a0S. District Courts 23 (2007).\nFootnote 13\u00a0To the extent relief would turn on what precisely a defendant said to counsel regarding specific claims, moreover, Garza rightly points out the serious risk of \"causing indigent defendants to forfeit their rights simply because they did not know what words to use.\"  Reply Brief 17.\nFootnote 14\u00a0It is, of course, inevitable that some defendants under this rule will seek to raise issues that are within the scope of their appeal waivers.  We are confident that courts can continue to deal efficiently with such cases via summary dispositions and the procedures outlined in Anders.  See 386 U.\u00a0S., at 744; n.\u00a09, supra.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0See North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.\u00a0S. 25, 37-38 (1970) (permitting courts to accept guilty pleas where defendants admit that there is a factual basis for the plea, but do not admit actual guilt).\nFootnote 2\u00a0The majority questions the validity of Garza's appellate waivers by suggesting that \"Garza may have been confused as to whether he had waived his appellate rights in the first place.\"  Ante, at 2, n.\u00a01.  I read the record differently.  It is true that, in the guilty form related to his possession charge, Garza checked \"no\" as to whether he was waiving his appeal rights.  But, in the guilty form related to his aggravated-assault charge, he checked \"yes\" to waiving his appeal rights.  And at the plea hearing for that offense, he acknowledged under oath that he understood all the questions, had received enough time with the guilty form, and answered each question honestly.  He also acknowledged at the sentencing hearing for both offenses that he would be \"go[ing] away for ten years,\" as negotiated for in the signed plea agreements that included the appeal waivers.  Record 131.  Finally, the trial court in postconviction proceedings concluded that Garza had never contended \"at any stage of these post-conviction cases\" that \"he did not appreciate or understand the appeal waivers when he entered his pleas.\"  Id., at 185.\nFootnote 3\u00a0See id., at 96, 108 (\"I understand that my plea agreement is a binding plea agreement.  This means that if the district court does not impose the specific sentence as recommended by both parties, I will be allowed to withdraw my plea of guilty pursuant to Rule 11(d)(4) of the Idaho Criminal Rules and proceed to a jury trial\"); see also id., at 128.\nFootnote 4\u00a0A defendant could bring a state-law tort action against his attorney.  As one commentator explained:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"An attorney is bound to exercise such skill, care and diligence in any matter entrusted to him, as members of the legal profession commonly possess and exercise in such matters. .\u00a0.\u00a0. He will be liable if his client's interests suffer on account of his failure to understand and apply those rules and principles of law that are well established and clearly defined in the elementary books, or which have been declared in adjudged cases that have been duly reported and published a sufficient length of time to have become known to those who exercise reasonable diligence in keeping pace with the literature of the profession.\"  T. Cooley, Law of Torts *779 (footnotes omitted).\nThus, reasonable choices not clearly foreclosed by law or precedent would apparently permit an attorney to successfully defend against the suit.\nFootnote 5\u00a0In 2018, the Federal Government's budget for defense counsel had grown to more than $1 billion.  See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Pub. L. 115-141, Div. E, Tit. III, 132 Stat. 348.  And the collateral challenges produced by the Court's right-to-counsel jurisprudence consume much of the federal courts' resources.  Cf. Statistical Tables for the Federal Judiciary--June 2018, Table B-7 (for 12-month period ending June 30, 2018, roughly 24% of appeals filed in the courts of appeals--8,914 of 37,487--were categorized as \"Habeas Corpus\" or \"Motions to Vacate Sentence\") https:\/\/www.uscourts.gov\/statistics-reports\/statistical-tables-federal-judiciary-june-2018 (as last visited Feb. 25, 2019); id., Table C-2 (22,478 of 281,202 cases filed in federal district court, or roughly 8%).\n\n\n","20":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGUNDY v. UNITED STATES(2019)\nNo. 17-6086\nArgued: October 2, 2018Decided: June 20, 2019\n\n\nCongress has sought, for the past quarter century, to combat sex crimes and crimes against children through sex-offender registration schemes.  The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) makes more \"uniform and effective\" the prior \"patchwork\" of registration systems.  Reynolds v. United States, 565 U.\u00a0S. 432, 435. To that end, it requires a broader range of sex offenders to register and backs up those requirements with criminal penalties.  Section 20913 elaborates the \"[i]nitial registration\" requirements for sex offenders.  34 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a720913(b), (d).  Subsection (b) sets out the general rule:  An offender must register \"before completing a sentence of imprisonment with respect to the offense giving rise to the registration requirement.\"  \u00a720913(b).  Subsection (d) addresses the \"[i]nitial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with subsection (b).\"  The provision states that, for individuals convicted of a sex offense before SORNA's enactment (\"pre-Act offenders\"), the Attorney General \"shall have the authority\" to \"specify the applicability\" of SORNA's registration requirements and \"to prescribe rules for [their] registration.\"  \u00a720913(d).  Under that delegated authority, the Attorney General issued a rule specifying that SORNA's registration requirements apply in full to pre-Act offenders.  Petitioner Herman Gundy, a pre-Act offender, was convicted of failing to register.  Both the District Court and the Second Circuit rejected his claim that Congress unconstitutionally delegated legislative power when it authorized the Attorney General to \"specify the applicability\" of SORNA's registration requirements to pre-Act offenders.\nHeld:\u00a0The judgment is affirmed.\n695 Fed. Appx. 639, affirmed.\nJustice Kagan, joined by Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor, concluded that \u00a720913(d) does not violate the nondelegation doctrine.  Pp.\u00a04-18.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Article I of the Constitution provides that \"[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.\"  \u00a71.  Based on that provision, this Court explained early on that Congress may not transfer to another branch \"powers which are strictly and exclusively legislative.\"  Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 42-43.  But Congress may confer substantial discretion on executive agencies to implement and enforce the laws.  Accordingly, the Court has held, time and time again, that a statutory delegation is constitutional as long as Congress \"\u00a0'lay[s] down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [exercise that authority] is directed to conform.'\u00a0\"  Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.\u00a0S. 361, 372.  Given that standard, a nondelegation inquiry always begins (and often almost ends) with statutory interpretation.  Only after a court has determined a challenged statute's meaning can it decide whether the law sufficiently guides executive discretion to accord with Article I.  Pp.\u00a04-6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0This Court has already interpreted \u00a720913(d) to require the Attorney General to apply SORNA to all pre-Act offenders as soon as feasible.  In Reynolds v. United States, 565 U.\u00a0S. 432, the Court held that SORNA's registration requirements did not apply of their own force to pre-Act offenders.  But in doing so, it made clear how far SORNA limited the Attorney General's authority and thereby effectively resolved this case.  The Court started from the premise that Congress meant for SORNA's registration requirements to apply to pre-Act offenders, based on the Act's statutory purpose, its definition of sex offender, and its history.  But the Court found that Congress had conditioned pre-Act offenders' duty to register on a prior ruling from the Attorney General because \"instantaneous registration\" of pre-Act offenders \"might not prove feasible.\"  Id., at 440-441.  SORNA, the majority explained, created a \"practical problem[\u00a0]\" because  it would require \"newly registering or reregistering a large number of pre-Act offenders.\"  Id., at 440.  In addition, many pre-Act offenders were already out of prison and could not comply with the requirement that they register before completing their sentences.  Congress therefore \"[a]sk[ed] the Department of Justice, charged with responsibility for implementation, to examine [the issues] and to apply the new registration requirements accordingly.\"  Id., at 441. On that understanding, the Attorney General's role under \u00a720913(d) was important but limited: It was to apply SORNA to pre-Act offenders as soon as he thought it feasible to do so.  Pp.\u00a06-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Gundy claims that \u00a720913(d) empowers the Attorney General to do whatever he wants as to pre-Act offenders, including exempting them from registration forever.  He bases that argument on the first half of \u00a720913(d), isolated from everything else.  But this Court has long refused to construe words \"in a vacuum,\" as Gundy attempts.  Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.\u00a0S. 803, 809. Rather, the Court interprets statutory provisions--including delegations--by reading the text in \"context\" and in light of the statutory \"purpose.\"  National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.\u00a0S. 190, 214, 216.  Applying that approach here, it is clear that \u00a720913(d) requires the Attorney General to register pre-Act offenders as soon as feasible.  In SORNA's statement of purpose, Congress announced that \"to protect the public,\" it was \"establish[ing] a comprehensive national system for the registration\" of \"sex offenders.\"  \u00a720901.  The term \"comprehensive\" means \"all-encompassing\" or \"sweeping.\"  That description could not fit the system SORNA created if the Attorney General could decline, for any reason or no reason at all, to apply SORNA to all pre-Act offenders.  The Act's definition of \"sex offender\" makes the same point.  Under that definition, a \"sex offender\" is \"an individual who was convicted of a sex offense.\"  \u00a720911(1).  Congress's use of the past tense shows that SORNA was not merely forward-looking and confirms that the delegation allows only temporary exclusions.  The Act's legislative history backs that all up, by showing that the need to register pre-Act offenders was front and center in Congress's thinking.  The text and title of \u00a720913(d) then pinpoint one of the practical problems discussed above: At the moment of SORNA's enactment, many pre-Act offenders were \"unable to comply\" with the Act's initial registration requirements.  \u00a720913(d).  In identifying that issue, \u00a720913(d) itself reveals the nature of the delegation to the Attorney General.  It was to give him the time needed (if any) to address the various implementation issues involved in getting pre-Act offenders into the registration system.  Thus, contrary to Gundy, \"specify the applicability\" does not mean \"specify whether to apply SORNA\" to pre-Act offenders at all.  The phrase instead means \"specify how to apply SORNA\" to pre-Act offenders if transitional difficulties require some delay.  And no Attorney General has used \u00a720913(d) in any more expansive way.  Pp.\u00a010-15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0Section 20913(d)'s delegation therefore falls well within constitutional bounds.  As noted, a delegation is constitutional so long as Congress sets out an intelligible principle to guide the delegee's exercise of authority.  The standards for that principle are not demanding.  See Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U.\u00a0S. 457, 474-475.  Only twice in this country's history has the Court found a delegation excessive, in each case because \"Congress had failed to articulate any policy or standard\" to confine discretion.  Mistretta, 488 U.\u00a0S., at 373, n.\u00a03; see A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.\u00a0S. 495; Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.\u00a0S. 388.  By contrast, the Court has over and over upheld even very broad delegations.  See, e.g., National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.\u00a0S. 190.  In that context, the delegation in SORNA easily passes muster.  The authority \u00a720913(d) confers, as compared to the delegations the Court has upheld in the past, is distinctly small bore.  Indeed, if SORNA's delegation is unconstitutional, then most of Government is unconstitutional--dependent as Congress is on the need to give discretion to executive officials to implement its programs.  Pp.\u00a015-18.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito concluded that he cannot say that the statute at issue lacks an adequately discernable standard under the nondelegation approach the Court has taken for the past 84 years, but would reconsider that approach in an appropriate case.

This case requires us to decide whether 34 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a720913(d), enacted as part of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), violates that doctrine.  We hold it does not.  Under \u00a720913(d), the Attorney General must apply SORNA's registration requirements as soon as feasible to offenders convicted before the statute's enactment.  That delegation easily passes constitutional muster.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress has sought, for the past quarter century, to combat sex crimes and crimes against children through sex-offender registration schemes.  In 1994, Congress first conditioned certain federal funds on States' adoption of registration laws meeting prescribed minimum standards.  See Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, \u00a7170101, 108 Stat. 2038, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a714071 et\u00a0seq. (1994 ed.). Two years later, Congress strengthened those standards, most notably by insisting that States inform local communities of registrants' addresses.  See Megan's Law, \u00a72, 110 Stat. 1345, note following 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a713701 (1994 ed., Supp. II).  By that time, every State and the District of Columbia had enacted a sex-offender registration law.  But the state statutes varied along many dimensions, and Congress came to realize that their \"loopholes and deficiencies\" had allowed over 100,000 sex offenders (about 20% of the total) to escape registration.  See H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 109-218, pt. 1, pp. 20, 23-24, 26 (2005) (referring to those sex offenders as \"missing\" or \"lost\").  In 2006, to address those failings, Congress enacted SORNA.  See 120 Stat. 590, 34 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a720901 et\u00a0seq.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SORNA makes \"more uniform and effective\" the prior \"patchwork\" of sex-offender registration systems.  Reynolds v. United States, 565 U.\u00a0S. 432, 435 (2012).  The Act's express \"purpose\" is \"to protect the public from sex offenders and offenders against children\" by \"establish[ing] a comprehensive national system for [their] registration.\"  \u00a720901.  To that end, SORNA covers more sex offenders, and imposes more onerous registration requirements, than most States had before.  The Act also backs up those requirements with new criminal penalties.  Any person required to register under SORNA who knowingly fails to do so (and who travels in interstate commerce) may be imprisoned for up to ten years.  See 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72250(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The basic registration scheme works as follows.  A \"sex offender\" is defined as \"an individual who was convicted of\" specified criminal offenses: all offenses \"involving a sexual act or sexual contact\" and additional offenses \"against a minor.\"  34 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a720911(1), (5)(A), (7).  Such an individual must register--provide his name, address, and certain other information--in every State where he resides, works, or studies.  See \u00a7\u00a720913(a), 20914.  And he must keep the registration current, and periodically report in person to a law enforcement office, for a period of between fifteen years and life (depending on the severity of his crime and his history of recidivism).  See \u00a7\u00a720915, 20918.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 20913--the disputed provision here--elaborates the \"[i]nitial registration\" requirements for sex offenders.  \u00a7\u00a720913(b), (d).  Subsection (b) sets out the general rule: An offender must register \"before completing a sentence of imprisonment with respect to the offense giving rise to the registration requirement\" (or, if the offender is not sentenced to prison, \"not later than [three] business days after being sentenced\").  Two provisions down, subsection (d) addresses (in its title's words) the \"[i]nitial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with subsection (b).\"  The provision states:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter .\u00a0.\u00a0. and to prescribe rules for the registration of any such sex offenders and for other categories of sex offenders who are unable to comply with subsection (b).\"\nSubsection (d), in other words, focuses on individuals convicted of a sex offense before SORNA's enactment--a group we will call pre-Act offenders.  Many of these individuals were unregistered at the time of SORNA's enactment, either because pre-existing law did not cover them or because they had successfully evaded that law (so were \"lost\" to the system).  See supra, at 2.  And of those potential new registrants, many or most could not comply with subsection (b)'s registration rule because they had already completed their prison sentences.  For the entire group of pre-Act offenders, once again, the Attorney General \"shall have the authority\" to \"specify the applicability\" of SORNA's registration requirements and \"to prescribe rules for [their] registration.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under that delegated authority, the Attorney General issued an interim rule in February 2007, specifying that SORNA's registration requirements apply in full to \"sex offenders convicted of the offense for which registration is required prior to the enactment of that Act.\"  72 Fed. Reg. 8897.  The final rule, issued in December 2010, reiterated that SORNA applies to all pre-Act offenders.  75 Fed. Reg. 81850.  That rule has remained the same to this day.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Herman Gundy is a pre-Act offender.  The year before SORNA's enactment, he pleaded guilty under Maryland law for sexually assaulting a minor.  After his release from prison in 2012, Gundy came to live in New York.  But he never registered there as a sex offender.  A few years later, he was convicted for failing to register, in violation of \u00a72250.  He argued below (among other things) that Congress unconstitutionally delegated legislative power when it authorized the Attorney General to \"specify the applicability\" of SORNA's registration requirements to pre-Act offenders.  \u00a720913(d).  The District Court and Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected that claim, see 695 Fed. Appx. 639 (2017), as had every other court (including eleven Courts of Appeals) to consider the issue.  We nonetheless granted certiorari.  583 U.\u00a0S. __ (2018).  Today, we join the consensus and affirm.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article I of the Constitution provides that \"[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.\"  \u00a71.  Accompanying that assignment of power to Congress is a bar on its further delegation.  Congress, this Court explained early on, may not transfer to another branch \"powers which are strictly and exclusively legislative.\"  Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 42-43 (1825).  But the Constitution does not \"deny[\u00a0] to the Congress the necessary resources of flexibility and practicality [that enable it] to perform its function[s].\"  Yakus v. United States, 321 U.\u00a0S. 414, 425 (1944) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Congress may \"obtain[\u00a0] the assistance of its coordinate Branches\"--and in particular, may confer substantial discretion on executive agencies to implement and enforce the laws.  Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.\u00a0S. 361, 372 (1989).  \"[I]n our increasingly complex society, replete with ever changing and more technical problems,\" this Court has understood that \"Congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives.\"  Ibid.  So we have held, time and again, that a statutory delegation is constitutional as long as Congress \"lay[s] down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [exercise the delegated authority] is directed to conform.\"  Ibid. (quoting J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U. S. 394, 409 (1928); brackets in original).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given that standard, a nondelegation inquiry always begins (and often almost ends) with statutory interpretation.  The constitutional question is whether Congress has supplied an intelligible principle to guide the delegee's use of discretion.  So the answer requires construing the challenged statute to figure out what task it delegates and what instructions it provides.  See, e.g., Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U.\u00a0S. 457, 473 (2001) (construing the text of a delegation to place constitutionally adequate \"limits on the EPA's discretion\"); American Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U.\u00a0S. 90, 104-105 (1946) (interpreting a statutory delegation, in light of its \"purpose[,] factual background[, and] context,\" to provide sufficiently \"definite\" standards).  Only after a court has determined a challenged statute's meaning can it decide whether the law sufficiently guides executive discretion to accord with Article I.  And indeed, once a court interprets the statute, it may find that the constitutional question all but answers itself.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That is the case here, because \u00a720913(d) does not give the Attorney General anything like the \"unguided\" and \"unchecked\" authority that Gundy says.  Brief for Petitioner 37, 45.  The provision, in Gundy's view, \"grants the Attorney General plenary power to determine SORNA's applicability to pre-Act offenders--to require them to register, or not, as she sees fit, and to change her policy for any reason and at any time.\"  Id., at 42.  If that were so, we would face a nondelegation question.  But it is not.  This Court has already interpreted \u00a720913(d) to say something different--to require the Attorney General to apply SORNA to all pre-Act offenders as soon as feasible.  See Reynolds, 565 U.\u00a0S., at 442-443.  And revisiting that issue yet more fully today, we reach the same conclusion.  The text, considered alongside its context, purpose, and history, makes clear that the Attorney General's discretion extends only to considering and addressing feasibility issues.  Given that statutory meaning, Gundy's constitutional claim must fail.  Section 20913(d)'s delegation falls well within permissible bounds.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is not the first time this Court has had to interpret \u00a720913(d).  In Reynolds, the Court considered whether SORNA's registration requirements applied of their own force to pre-Act offenders or instead applied only once the Attorney General said they did.  We read the statute as adopting the latter approach.  But even as we did so, we made clear how far SORNA limited the Attorney General's authority.  And in that way, we effectively resolved the case now before us.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Everything in Reynolds started from the premise that Congress meant for SORNA's registration requirements to apply to pre-Act offenders.  The majority recounted SORNA's \"basic statutory purpose,\" found in its text, as follows: \"the 'establish[ment of] a comprehensive national system for the registration of [sex] offenders' that includes offenders who committed their offenses before the Act became law.\"  565 U.\u00a0S., at 442 (quoting \u00a720901; emphasis and alterations in original; citation omitted).  That purpose, the majority further noted, informed SORNA's \"broad[\u00a0]\" definition of \"sex offender,\" which \"include[s] any 'individual who was convicted of a sex offense.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 442 (quoting \u00a720911(1); emphasis added).  And those two provisions were at one with \"[t]he Act's history.\"  Id., at 442.  Quoting statements from both the House and the Senate about the sex offenders then \"lost\" to the system, Reynolds explained that the Act's \"supporters placed considerable importance upon the registration of pre-Act offenders.\"  Ibid.  In recognizing all this, the majority (temporarily) bonded with the dissenting Justices, who found it obvious that SORNA was \"meant to cover pre-Act offenders.\"  Id., at 448 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  And indeed, the dissent emphasized that common ground, remarking that \"the Court acknowledges\" and \"rightly believes\" that registration of pre-Act offenders was \"what the statute sought to achieve.\"  Id., at 448-449.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if that was so, why had Congress (as the majority held) conditioned the pre-Act offenders' duty to register on a prior \"ruling from the Attorney General\"?  Id., at 441.  The majority had a simple answer: \"[I]nstantaneous registration\" of pre-Act offenders \"might not prove feasible,\" or \"[a]t least Congress might well have so thought.\"  Id., at 440-441, 443.  Here, the majority explained that SORNA's requirements diverged from prior state law.  See id., at 440; supra, at 2.  Some pre-Act offenders (as defined by SORNA) had never needed to register before; others had once had to register, but had fulfilled their old obligations.  And still others (the \"lost\" or \"missing\" offenders) should have registered, but had escaped the system.  As a result, SORNA created a \"practical problem[\u00a0]\": It would require \"newly registering or reregistering a large number of pre-Act offenders.\"  Reynolds, 565 U.\u00a0S., at 440 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And attached to that broad feasibility concern was a more technical one.  Recall that under SORNA \"a sex offender must initially register before completing his 'sentence of imprisonment.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 439 (quoting \u00a720913(b)); see supra, at 3.  But many pre-Act offenders were already out of prison, so could not comply with that requirement.  That inability raised questions about \"how[] the new registration requirements applied to them.\"  565 U.\u00a0S., at 441.  \"Congress['s] solution\" to both those difficulties was the same: Congress \"[a]sk[ed] the Department of Justice, charged with responsibility for implementation, to examine [the issues] and to apply the new registration requirements accordingly.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On that understanding, the Attorney General's role under \u00a720913(d) was important but limited: It was to apply SORNA to pre-Act offenders as soon as he thought it feasible to do so.  That statutory delegation, the Court explained, would \"involve[] implementation delay.\"  Id., at 443.  But no more than that.  Congress had made clear in SORNA's text that the new registration requirements would apply to pre-Act offenders.  See id., at 442-445.  So (the Court continued) \"there was no need\" for Congress to worry about the \"unrealistic possibility\" that \"the Attorney General would refuse to apply\" those requirements on some excessively broad view of his authority under \u00a720913(d).  Id., at 444-445.  Reasonably read, SORNA enabled the Attorney General only to address (as appropriate) the \"practical problems\" involving pre-Act offenders before requiring them to register.  Id., at 440.  The delegation was a stopgap, and nothing more.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gundy dismisses Reynolds's relevance, but his arguments come up short.  To begin, he contends that Rey- nolds spoke \"tentative[ly]\"--with \"might[s], may[s], or could[s]\"--about Congress's reasons for enacting \u00a720913(d).  Reply Brief 11; see supra, at 7 (quoting such phrases).  Gundy concludes from such constructions--which are indeed present--that the Court was \"not offering a definitive reading of the statute.\"  Reply Brief 11.  But the Court used those locutions to convey not its own uncertainty but Congress's.  The point of the opinion was that Congress had questions about how best to phase SORNA's application to pre-Act offenders, so gave the Attorney General flexibility on timing.  The \"mights, mays, and coulds\" were there to describe the legislative mindset responsible for \u00a720913(d), and thus formed part of the Court's own--yes, \"definitive\"--view of that provision's meaning.  Anticipating that explanation, Gundy falls back on the claim that the Court's account of Congress's motivations \"cannot supply the intelligible principle Congress failed to enact into law.\"  Id., at 12 (citing Whitman, 531 U.\u00a0S., at 473).  But the Court in Reynolds did not invent a standard Congress omitted.  Rather, the Court read the statute to contain a standard--again, that the Attorney General should apply SORNA to pre-Act offenders as soon as feasible.  And as the next part of this opinion shows, in somewhat greater detail than Reynolds thought necessary, we read the statute in the same way.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recall again the delegation provision at issue.  Congress gave the Attorney General authority to \"specify the applicability\" of SORNA's requirements to pre-Act offenders.  \u00a720913(d).  And in the second half of the same sentence, Congress gave him authority to \"prescribe rules for the registration of any such sex offenders . . . who are unable to comply with\" subsection (b)'s initial registration requirement.  Ibid.  What does the delegation in \u00a720913(d) allow the Attorney General to do?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The different answers on offer here reflect competing views of statutory interpretation.  As noted above, Gundy urges us to read \u00a720913(d) to empower the Attorney General to do whatever he wants as to pre-Act offenders: He may make them all register immediately or he may exempt them from registration forever (or he may do anything in between).  See Brief for Petitioner 41-42; supra, at 6.  Gundy bases that argument on the first half of \u00a720913(d), isolated from everything else--from the second half of the same section, from surrounding provisions in SORNA, and from any conception of the statute's history and purpose.  Reynolds took a different approach (as does the Government here), understanding statutory interpretation as a \"holistic endeavor\" which determines meaning by looking not to isolated words, but to text in context, along with purpose and history.  United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U.\u00a0S. 365, 371 (1988).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has long refused to construe words \"in a vacuum,\" as Gundy attempts.  Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.\u00a0S. 803, 809 (1989).  \"It is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\"  National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U.\u00a0S. 644, 666 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U.\u00a0S. 302, 321 (2014) (\"[R]easonable statutory interpretation must account for both the specific context in which .\u00a0.\u00a0. language is used and the broader context of the statute as a whole\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  And beyond context and structure, the Court often looks to \"history [and] purpose\" to divine the meaning of language.  Maracich v. Spears, 570 U.\u00a0S. 48, 76 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).  That non-blinkered brand of interpretation holds good for delegations, just as for other statutory provisions.  To define the scope of delegated authority, we have looked to the text in \"context\" and in light of the statutory \"purpose.\"  National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.\u00a0S. 190, 214, 216 (1943) (internal quotation marks omitted); see American Power & Light, 329 U.\u00a0S., at 104 (stating that the delegation at issue \"derive[d] much meaningful content from the purpose of the Act, its factual background and the statutory context\").  In keeping with that method, we again do so today.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So begin at the beginning, with the \"[d]eclaration of purpose\" that is SORNA's first sentence.  \u00a720901.  There, Congress announced (as Reynolds noted, see supra, at 6-7) that \"to protect the public,\" it was \"establish[ing] a comprehensive national system for the registration\" of \"sex offenders and offenders against children.\"  \u00a720901. The term \"comprehensive\" has a clear meaning--something that is all-encompassing or sweeping.  See, e.g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 467 (2002) (\"covering a matter under consideration completely or nearly completely\"); New Oxford American Dictionary 350 (2d ed. 2005) (\"complete; including all or nearly all elements or aspects of something\").  That description could not fit the system SORNA created if the Attorney General could decline, for any reason or no reason at all, to apply SORNA to all pre-Act offenders.  After all, for many years after SORNA's enactment, the great majority of sex offenders in the country would be pre-Act offenders.  If Gundy were right, all of those offenders could be exempt from SORNA's registration requirements.  So the mismatch between SORNA's statement of purpose and Gundy's view of \u00a720913(d) is as stark as stark comes.  Responding to that patent disparity, Gundy urges us to ignore SORNA's statement of purpose because it is \"located in the Act's preface\" rather than \"tied\" specifically to \u00a720913(d).  Brief for Petitioner 46.  But the placement of such a statement within a statute makes no difference.  See A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 220 (2012).  Wherever it resides, it is \"an appropriate guide\" to the \"meaning of the [statute's] operative provisions.\"  Id., at 218.  And here it makes clear that SORNA was supposed to apply to all pre-Act offenders--which precludes Gundy's construction of \u00a720913(d).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Act's definition of \"sex offender\" (also noted in Reynolds, see supra, at 7) makes the same point.  Under that definition, a \"sex offender\" is \"an individual who was convicted of a sex offense.\"  \u00a720911(1).  Note the tense: \"was,\" not \"is.\"  This Court has often \"looked to Congress' choice of verb tense to ascertain a statute's temporal reach,\" including when interpreting other SORNA provisions.  Carr v. United States, 560 U.\u00a0S. 438, 447-448 (2010) (holding that because SORNA \"sets forth [its] travel requirement in the present tense,\" the statute's criminal penalties do not apply to a person whose interstate travel predated enactment); see, e.g., United States v. Wilson, 503 U.\u00a0S. 329, 333 (1992); Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U.\u00a0S. 49, 57 (1987).  Here, Congress's use of the past tense to define the term \"sex offender\" shows that SORNA was not merely forward-looking.  The word \"is\" would have taken care of all future offenders.  The word \"was\" served to bring in the hundreds of thousands of persons previously found guilty of a sex offense, and thought to pose a current threat to the public.  The tense of the \"sex offender\" definition thus confirms that the delegation allows only temporary exclusions, as necessary to address feasibility issues.  Contra Gundy, it does not sweep so wide as to make a laughingstock of the statute's core definition.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Act's legislative history backs up everything said above by showing that the need to register pre-Act offenders was front and center in Congress's thinking.  (Once again, the Reynolds majority noted this history, but Justice Scalia's dissent thought that was gilding the lily.  See supra, at 7, and n. 1.  He had a point, but we can't resist.)  Recall that Congress designed SORNA to address \"loopholes and deficiencies\" in existing registration laws.  See supra, at 2.  And no problem attracted greater attention than the large number of sex offenders who had slipped the system.  According to the House Report, \"[t]he most significant enforcement issue in the sex offender program is that over 100,000 sex offenders\" are \"\u00a0'missing,' meaning that they have not complied with\" then-current requirements.  H. R. Rep. No. 109-218, at 26.  There is a \"strong public interest,\" the Report continued, in \"having [those offenders] register with current information to mitigate the risks of additional crimes against children.\"  Id., at 24.  Senators struck a similar chord in the debates preceding SORNA's passage, repeatedly stressing that the new provisions would capture the missing offenders.  See, e.g., 152 Cong. Rec. 15338 (2006) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (\"The penalties in this bill should be adequate to ensure that [the 100,000 missing offenders] register\"); id., at 13050 (statement of Sen. Frist) (\"Every day that we don't have this national sex offender registry, these missing sex predators are out there somewhere\").  Imagine how surprising those Members would have found Gundy's view that they had authorized the Attorney General to exempt the missing \"predators\" from registering at all.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With that context and background established, we may return to \u00a720913(d).  As we have noted, Gundy makes his stand there (and there only), insisting that the lonesome phrase \"specify the applicability\" ends this case.  See supra, at 10.  But in so doing, Gundy ignores even the rest of the section that phrase is in.  Both the title and the remaining text of that section pinpoint one of the \"practical problems\" discussed above: At the moment of SORNA's enactment, many pre-Act offenders were \"unable to comply\" with the Act's initial registration requirements.  \u00a720913(d); Reynolds, 565 U.\u00a0S., at 440; see supra, at 8.  That was because, once again, the requirements assumed that offenders would be in prison, whereas many pre-Act offenders were on the streets.  In identifying that issue, \u00a720913(d) itself reveals the nature of the delegation to the Attorney General.  It was to give him the time needed (if any) to address the various implementation issues involved in getting pre-Act offenders into the registration system.  \"Specify the applicability\" thus does not mean \"specify whether to apply SORNA\" to pre-Act offenders at all, even though everything else in the Act commands their coverage.  The phrase instead means \"specify how to apply SORNA\" to pre-Act offenders if transitional difficulties require some delay.  In that way, the whole of \u00a720913(d) joins the rest of SORNA in giving the Attorney General only time-limited latitude to excuse pre-Act offenders from the statute's requirements.  Under the law, he had to order their registration as soon as feasible.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And no Attorney General has used (or, apparently, thought to use) \u00a720913(d) in any more expansive way.  To the contrary.  Within a year of SORNA's enactment (217 days, to be precise), the Attorney General determined that SORNA would apply immediately to pre-Act offenders.  See Interim Rule, 72 Fed. Reg. 8897; supra, at 4.  That rule has remained in force ever since (save for a technical change to one of the rule's illustrative examples).  See Final Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. 81850.3  And at oral argument here, the Solicitor General's office--rarely in a hurry to agree to limits on the Government's authority--acknowledged that \u00a720913(d) does not allow the Attorney General to excuse a pre-Act offender from registering, except for reasons of \"feasibility.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 41-42.  We thus end up, on close inspection of the statutory scheme, exactly where Reynolds left us.  The Attorney General's authority goes to transition-period implementation issues, and no further.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now that we have determined what \u00a720913(d) means, we can consider whether it violates the Constitution.  The question becomes: Did Congress make an impermissible delegation when it instructed the Attorney General to apply SORNA's registration requirements to pre-Act offenders as soon as feasible?  Under this Court's long-established law, that question is easy.  Its answer is no.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted earlier, this Court has held that a delegation is constitutional so long as Congress has set out an \"intelligible principle\" to guide the delegee's exercise of authority.  J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co., 276 U. S., at 409; see supra, at 5.  Or in a related formulation, the Court has stated that a delegation is permissible if Congress has made clear to the delegee \"the general policy\" he must pursue and the \"boundaries of [his] authority.\"  American Power & Light, 329 U. S., at 105.  Those standards, the Court has made clear, are not demanding.  \"[W]e have 'almost never felt qualified to second-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree of policy judgment that can be left to those executing or applying the law.'\u00a0\"  Whitman, 531 U. S., at 474-475 (quoting Mistretta, 488 U.\u00a0S., at 416 (Scalia, J., dissenting)).  Only twice in this country's history (and that in a single year) have we found a delegation excessive--in each case because \"Congress had failed to articulate any policy or standard\" to confine discretion.  Mistretta, 488 U.\u00a0S., at 373, n.\u00a07 (emphasis added); see A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.\u00a0S. 495 (1935); Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.\u00a0S. 388 (1935).  By contrast, we have over and over upheld even very broad delegations.  Here is a sample: We have approved delegations to various agencies to regulate in the \"public interest.\"  See, e.g., National Broadcasting Co., 319 U. S., at 216; New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States, 287 U.\u00a0S. 12, 24 (1932).  We have sustained authorizations for agencies to set \"fair and equitable\" prices and \"just and reasonable\" rates.  Yakus, 321 U. S., at 422, 427; FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U.\u00a0S. 591 (1944).  We more recently affirmed a delegation to an agency to issue whatever air quality standards are \"requisite to protect the public health.\"  Whitman, 531 U.\u00a0S., at 472 (quoting 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77409(b)(1)).  And so forth.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In that context, the delegation in SORNA easily passes muster (as all eleven circuit courts to have considered the question found, see supra, at 4).  The statute conveyed Congress's policy that the Attorney General require pre-Act offenders to register as soon as feasible.  Under the law, the feasibility issues he could address were administrative--and, more specifically, transitional--in nature.  Those issues arose, as Reynolds explained, from the need to \"newly register[\u00a0] or reregister[\u00a0] 'a large number' of pre-Act offenders\" not then in the system.  565 U.\u00a0S., at 440; see supra, at 8.  And they arose, more technically, from the gap between an initial registration requirement hinged on imprisonment and a set of pre-Act offenders long since released.  See 565 U.\u00a0S., at 441; see supra, at 8.  Even for those limited matters, the Act informed the Attorney General that he did not have forever to work things out.  By stating its demand for a \"comprehensive\" registration system and by defining the \"sex offenders\" required to register to include pre-Act offenders, Congress conveyed that the Attorney General had only temporary authority.  Or again, in the words of Reynolds, that he could prevent \"instantaneous registration\" and impose some \"implementation delay.\"  565 U.\u00a0S., at 443.  That statutory authority, as compared to the delegations we have upheld in the past, is distinctly small-bore.  It falls well within constitutional bounds.4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, if SORNA's delegation is unconstitutional, then most of Government is unconstitutional--dependent as Congress is on the need to give discretion to executive officials to implement its programs.  Consider again this Court's long-time recognition: \"Congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives.\"  Mistretta, 488 U.\u00a0S., at 372; see supra, at 5.  Or as the dissent in that case agreed: \"[S]ome judgments .\u00a0.\u00a0. must be left to the officers executing the law.\"  488 U.\u00a0S., at 415 (opinion of Scalia, J.); see Whitman, 531 U.\u00a0S., at 475 (\"[A] certain degree of discretion[\u00a0] inheres in most executive\" action (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Among the judgments often left to executive officials are ones involving feasibility.  In fact, standards of that kind are ubiquitous in the U.\u00a0S. Code.  See, e.g., 12 U. S. C. \u00a71701z-2(a) (providing that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \"shall require, to the greatest extent feasible, the employment of new and improved technologies, methods, and materials in housing construction[\u00a0] under [HUD] programs\"); 47 U. S. C. \u00a7903(d)(1) (providing that \"the Secretary of Commerce shall promote efficient and cost-effective use of the spectrum to the maximum extent feasible\" in \"assigning frequencies for mobile radio services\").  In those delegations, Congress gives its delegee the flexibility to deal with real-world constraints in carrying out his charge.  So too in SORNA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is wisdom and humility alike that this Court has always upheld such \"necessities of government.\"  Mistretta, 488 U.\u00a0S., at 416 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted); see ibid. (\"Since Congress is no less endowed with common sense than we are, and better equipped to inform itself of the 'necessities' of government; and since the factors bearing upon those necessities are both multifarious and (in the nonpartisan sense) highly political . . . it is small wonder that we have almost never felt qualified to second-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree of policy judgment that can be left to those executing or applying the law\").  We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kavanaugh took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nAlito, J., concurring\n\u2002588 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-6086\nHERMAN AVERY GUNDY, PETITIONER v.

Yet the statute before us scrambles that design.  It purports to endow the nation's chief prosecutor with the power to write his own criminal code governing the lives of a half-million citizens.  Yes, those affected are some of the least popular among us.  But if a single executive branch official can write laws restricting the liberty of this group of persons, what does that mean for the next?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, a plurality of an eight-member Court endorses this extraconstitutional arrangement but resolves nothing.  Working from an understanding of the Constitution at war with its text and history, the plurality reimagines the terms of the statute before us and insists there is nothing wrong with Congress handing off so much power to the Attorney General.  But Justice Alito supplies the fifth vote for today's judgment and he does not join either the plurality's constitutional or statutory analysis, indicating instead that he remains willing, in a future case with a full Court, to revisit these matters.  Respectfully, I would not wait.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For individuals convicted of sex offenses after Congress adopted the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) in 2006, the statute offers detailed instructions.  It requires them \"to provide state governments with (and to update) information, such as names and current addresses, for inclusion on state and federal sex offender registries.\"1  The law divides offenders into three tiers based on the seriousness of their crimes: Some must register for 15 years, others for 25 years, and still others for life.2  The statute proceeds to set registration deadlines: Offenders sentenced to prison must register before they're released, while others must register within three business days after sentencing.3  The statute explains when and how offenders must update their registrations.4  And the statute specifies particular penalties for failing to comply with its commands.5  On and on the statute goes for more than 20 pages of the U.\u00a0S. Code.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But what about those convicted of sex offenses before the Act's adoption?  At the time of SORNA's enactment, the nation's population of sex offenders exceeded 500,000, and Congress concluded that something had to be done about these \"pre-Act\" offenders too.  But it seems Congress couldn't agree what that should be.  The treatment of pre-Act offenders proved a \"controversial issue with major policy significance and practical ramifications for states.\"6  Among other things, applying SORNA immediately to this group threatened to impose unpopular and costly burdens \non States and localities by forcing them to adopt or overhaul their own sex offender registration schemes.7  So Congress simply passed the problem to the Attorney General.  For all half-million pre-Act offenders, the law says only this, in 34 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a720913(d):\n\"The Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter .\u00a0.\u00a0. and to prescribe rules for the registration of any such sex offender.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes, that's it.  The breadth of the authority Congress granted to the Attorney General in these few words can only be described as vast.  As the Department of Justice itself has acknowledged, SORNA \"does not require the Attorney General\" to impose registration requirements on pre-Act offenders \"within a certain time frame or by a date certain; it does not require him to act at all.\"8  If the Attorney General does choose to act, he can require all pre-Act offenders to register, or he can \"require some but not all to register.\"9  For those he requires to register, the Attorney General may impose \"some but not all of [SORNA's] registration requirements,\" as he pleases.10  And he is free to change his mind on any of these matters \"at any given time or over the course of different [political] administrations.\"11  Congress thus gave the Attorney General free rein to write the rules for virtually the entire existing sex offender population in this country--a situation that promised to persist for years or decades until \npre-Act offenders passed away or fulfilled the terms of their registration obligations and post-Act offenders came to predominate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unsurprisingly, different Attorneys General have exercised their discretion in different ways.12  For six months after SORNA's enactment, Attorney General Gonzales left past offenders alone.  Then the pendulum swung the other direction when the Department of Justice issued an interim rule requiring pre-Act offenders to follow all the same rules as post-Act offenders.13  A year later, Attorney General Mukasey issued more new guidelines, this time directing the States to register some but not all past offenders.14  Three years after that, Attorney General Holder required the States to register only those pre-Act offenders convicted of a new felony after SORNA's enactment.15  Various Attorneys General have also taken different positions on whether pre-Act offenders might be entitled to credit for time spent in the community before SORNA was enacted.16\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These unbounded policy choices have profound consequences for the people they affect.  Take our case.  Before SORNA's enactment, Herman Gundy pleaded guilty in 2005 to a sexual offense.  After his release from prison five years later, he was arrested again, this time for failing to register as a sex offender according to the rules the Attorney General had then prescribed for pre-Act offenders.  As a result, Mr. Gundy faced an additional 10-year prison term--10 years more than if the Attorney General had, in \nhis discretion, chosen to write the rules differently.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our founding document begins by declaring that \"We the People .\u00a0.\u00a0. ordain and establish this Constitution.\"  At the time, that was a radical claim, an assertion that sovereignty belongs not to a person or institution or class but to the whole of the people.  From that premise, the Constitution proceeded to vest the authority to exercise different aspects of the people's sovereign power in distinct entities.  In Article I, the Constitution entrusted all of the federal government's legislative power to Congress.  In Article II, it assigned the executive power to the President.  And in Article III, it gave independent judges the task of applying the laws to cases and controversies.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the framers, each of these vested powers had a distinct content.  When it came to the legislative power, the framers understood it to mean the power to adopt generally applicable rules of conduct governing future actions by private persons--the power to \"prescrib[e] the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated,\"17 or the power to \"prescribe general rules for the government of society.\"18\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The framers understood, too, that it would frustrate \"the system of government ordained by the Constitution\" if Congress could merely announce vague aspirations and then assign others the responsibility of adopting legislation to realize its goals.19  Through the Constitution, after \nall, the people had vested the power to prescribe rules limiting their liberties in Congress alone.  No one, not even Congress, had the right to alter that arrangement.  As Chief Justice Marshall explained, Congress may not \"delegate .\u00a0.\u00a0. powers which are strictly and exclusively legislative.\"20  Or as John Locke, one of the thinkers who most influenced the framers' understanding of the separation of powers, described it:\n\"The legislative cannot transfer the power of making laws to any other hands; for it being but a delegated power from the people, they who have it cannot pass it over to others.  The people alone can appoint the form of the commonwealth, which is by constituting the legislative, and appointing in whose hands that shall be.  And when the people have said we will submit to rules, and be governed by laws made by such men, and in such forms, nobody else can say other men shall make laws for them; nor can the people be bound by any laws but such as are enacted by those whom they have chosen and authorised to make laws for them.\"21\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why did the framers insist on this particular arrangement?  They believed the new federal government's most dangerous power was the power to enact laws restricting the people's liberty.22  An \"excess of law-making\" was, in their words, one of \"the diseases to which our governments are most liable.\"23  To address that tendency, the framers went to great lengths to make lawmaking difficult.  In Article I, by far the longest part of the Constitution, the \nframers insisted that any proposed law must win the approval of two Houses of Congress--elected at different times, by different constituencies, and for different terms in office--and either secure the President's approval or obtain enough support to override his veto.  Some occasionally complain about Article I's detailed and arduous processes for new legislation, but to the framers these were bulwarks of liberty.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor was the point only to limit the government's capacity to restrict the people's freedoms.  Article I's detailed processes for new laws were also designed to promote deliberation.  \"The oftener the measure is brought under examination,\" Hamilton explained, \"the greater the diversity in the situations of those who are to examine it,\" and \"the less must be the danger of those errors which flow from want of due deliberation, or of those missteps which proceed from the contagion of some common passion or interest.\"24\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other purposes animated the framers' design as well.  Because men are not angels25 and majorities can threaten minority rights, the framers insisted on a legislature composed of different bodies subject to different electorates as a means of ensuring that any new law would have to secure the approval of a supermajority of the people's representatives.  This, in turn, assured minorities that their votes would often decide the fate of proposed legislation.  Indeed, some even thought a Bill of Rights would prove unnecessary in light of the Constitution's design; in their view, sound structures forcing \"[a]mbition [to] .\u00a0.\u00a0. counteract ambition\" would do more than written promises to guard unpopular minorities from the tyranny of the majority.26  Restricting the task of legislating to one branch characterized by difficult and deliberative processes was also designed to promote fair notice and the rule of law, ensuring the people would be subject to a relatively stable and predictable set of rules.27  And by directing that legislating be done only by elected representatives in a public process, the Constitution sought to ensure that the lines of accountability would be clear: The sovereign people would know, without ambiguity, whom to hold accountable for the laws they would have to follow.28\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Congress could pass off its legislative power to the executive branch, the \"[v]esting [c]lauses, and indeed the entire structure of the Constitution,\" would \"make no sense.\"29  Without the involvement of representatives from across the country or the demands of bicameralism and presentment, legislation would risk becoming nothing more than the will of the current President.  And if laws could be simply declared by a single person, they would not be few in number, the product of widespread social consensus, likely to protect minority interests, or apt to provide stability and fair notice.30  Accountability would suffer too.  Legislators might seek to take credit for addressing a pressing social problem by sending it to the executive for resolution, while at the same time blaming the executive for the problems that attend whatever measures he chooses to pursue.  In turn, the executive might point to Congress as the source of the problem.  These opportunities for finger-pointing might prove tempt-\ningly advantageous for the politicians involved, but they would also threaten to \"\u00a0'disguise .\u00a0.\u00a0. responsibility for .\u00a0.\u00a0. the decisions.'\u00a0\"31\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The framers warned us against permitting consequences like these.  As Madison explained, \"\u00a0'[t]here can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or body of magistrates.'\u00a0\"32  The framers knew, too, that the job of keeping the legislative power confined to the legislative branch couldn't be trusted to self-policing by Congress; often enough, legislators  will face rational incentives to pass problems to the executive branch.  Besides, enforcing the separation of powers isn't about protecting institutional prerogatives or governmental turf.  It's about respecting the people's sovereign choice to vest the legislative power in Congress alone.  And it's about safeguarding a structure designed to protect their liberties, minority rights, fair notice, and the rule of law.  So when a case or controversy comes within the judicial competence, the Constitution does not permit judges to look the other way; we must call foul when the constitutional lines are crossed.  Indeed, the framers afforded us independence from the political branches  in large part to encourage exactly this kind of \"fortitude .\u00a0.\u00a0. to do [our] duty as faithful guardians of the  Constitution.\"33\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accepting, then, that we have an obligation to decide whether Congress has unconstitutionally divested itself of its legislative responsibilities, the question follows: What's the test?  Madison acknowledged that \"no skill in the science of government has yet been able to discriminate and define, with sufficient certainty, its three great provinces--the legislative, executive, and judiciary.\"34  Chief Justice Marshall agreed that policing the separation of powers \"is a subject of delicate and difficult inquiry.\"35  Still, the framers took this responsibility seriously and offered us important guiding principles.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, we know that as long as Congress makes the policy decisions when regulating private conduct, it may authorize another branch to \"fill up the details.\"  In Wayman v. Southard, this Court upheld a statute that instructed the federal courts to borrow state-court procedural rules but allowed them to make certain \"alterations and additions.\"  Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Marshall distinguished between those \"important subjects, which must be entirely regulated by the legislature itself,\" and \"those of less interest, in which a general provision may be made, and power given to those who are to act .\u00a0.\u00a0. to fill up the details.\"36  The Court upheld the statute before it because Congress had announced the controlling general policy when it ordered federal courts to follow state procedures, and the residual authority to make \"alterations and additions\" did no more than permit courts to fill up the details.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Later cases built on Chief Justice Marshall's understanding.  In In\u00a0re Kollock, for example, the Court upheld \na statute that assigned the Commissioner of Internal Revenue the responsibility to design tax stamps for margarine packages.37  Later still, and using the same logic, the Court sustained other and far more consequential statutes, like a law authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to adopt rules regulating the \"use and occupancy\" of public forests to protect them from \"destruction\" and \"depredations.\"38  Through all these cases, small or large, runs the theme that Congress must set forth standards \"sufficiently definite and precise to enable Congress, the courts, and the public to ascertain\" whether Congress's guidance has been followed.39\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, once Congress prescribes the rule governing private conduct, it may make the application of that rule depend on executive fact-finding.  Here, too, the power extended to the executive may prove highly consequential.  During the Napoleonic Wars, for example, Britain and France each tried to block the United States from trading with the other.  Congress responded with a statute instructing that, if the President found that either Great Britain or France stopped interfering with American trade, a trade embargo would be imposed against the other country.  In Cargo of Brig Aurora v. United States, this Court explained that it could \"see no sufficient reason, why the legislature should not exercise its discretion [to impose an embargo] either expressly or conditionally, as their judgment should direct.\"40  Half a century later, Congress likewise made the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge depend on a finding by the Secretary of War that \nthe bridge wouldn't interfere with navigation of the East River.  The Court held that Congress \"did not abdicate any of its authority\" but \"simply declared that, upon a certain fact being established, the bridge should be deemed a lawful structure, and employed the secretary of war as an agent to ascertain that fact.\"41\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, Congress may assign the executive and judicial branches certain non-legislative responsibilities.  While the Constitution vests all federal legislative power in Congress alone, Congress's legislative authority sometimes overlaps with authority the Constitution separately vests in another branch.42  So, for example, when a congressional statute confers wide discretion to the executive, no separation-of-powers problem may arise if \"the discretion is to be exercised over matters already within the scope of executive power.\"43  Though the case was decided on different grounds, the foreign-affairs-related statute in Cargo of the Brig Aurora may be an example of this kind of permissible lawmaking, given that many foreign affairs powers are constitutionally vested in the president under Article II.  Wayman itself might be explained by the same principle as applied to the judiciary: Even in the absence of any statute, courts have the power under Article III \"to regulate their practice.\"44\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before the 1930s, federal statutes granting authority to \nthe executive were comparatively modest and usually easily upheld.  But then the federal government began to grow explosively.  And with the proliferation of new executive programs came new questions about the scope of congressional delegations.  Twice the Court responded by striking down statutes for violating the separation of powers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, the Court considered a statute that transferred to the President the power \"to approve 'codes of fair competition'\u00a0\" for slaughterhouses and other industries.45  But Congress offered no meaningful guidance.  It did not, for example, reference any pre-existing common law of fair competition that might have supplied guidance on the policy questions, as it arguably had done earlier with the Sherman Act.46  And it did not announce rules contingent on executive fact-finding.  Nor was this assigned power one that anyone thought might inhere in the executive power.  Proceeding without the need to convince a majority of legislators, the President adopted a lengthy fair competition code written by a group of (possibly self-serving) New York poultry butchers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Included in the code was a rule that often made it a federal crime for butchers to allow customers to select which individual chickens they wished to buy.  Kosher butchers such as the Schechters had a hard time following these rules.  Yet the government apparently singled out the Schechters as a test case; inspectors repeatedly visited them and, at times, apparently behaved abusively toward their customers.  When the Schechters finally kicked the \ninspectors out, they were greeted with a criminal indictment running to dozens of counts.  After a trial in which the Schechters were found guilty of selling one allegedly \"unfit\" chicken and other miscellaneous counts,47 this Court agreed to hear the case and struck down the law as a violation of the separation of powers.  If Congress could permit the President to write a new code of fair competition all his own, Justice Cardozo explained, then \"anything that Congress may do within the limits of the commerce clause for the betterment of business [could] be done by the President .\u00a0.\u00a0. by calling it a code.  This is delegation running riot.\"48\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same year, in Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, the Court struck down a statute that authorized the President to decide whether and how to prohibit the interstate transportation of \"\u00a0'hot oil,'\u00a0\" petroleum produced or withdrawn from storage in excess of state-set quotas.  As in Schechter Poultry, the law provided no notice to regulated parties about what the President might wind up prohibiting, leading the Court to observe that Congress \"ha[d] declared no policy, ha[d] established no standard, ha[d] laid down no rule.\"49  The Court explained that the statute did not call for the executive to \"ascertai[n] the existence of facts to which legislation is directed.\"50  Nor did it ask the executive to \"\u00a0'fill up the details'\u00a0\" \"within the framework of the policy which the legislature has sufficiently defined.\"51  \"If [the statute] were held valid,\" the Court continued, \"it would be idle to pretend that anything would be left of limitations upon the power of the Congress to delegate its law-making function.\"52\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After Schechter Poultry and Panama Refining, Congress responded by writing a second wave of New Deal legislation more \"[c]arefully crafted\" to avoid the kind of problems that sank these early statutes.53  And since that time the Court hasn't held another statute to violate the separation of powers in the same way.  Of course, no one thinks that the Court's quiescence can be attributed to an unwavering new tradition of more scrupulously drawn statutes.  Some lament that the real cause may have to do with a mistaken \"case of death by association\" because Schechter Poultry and Panama Refining happened to be handed down during the same era as certain of the Court's now-discredited substantive due process decisions.54 But maybe the most likely explanation of all lies in the story of the evolving \"intelligible principle\" doctrine.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court first used that phrase in 1928 in J.\u00a0W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, where it remarked that a statute \"lay[ing] down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the [executive official] is directed to conform\" satisfies the separation of powers.55  No one at the time thought the phrase meant to effect some revolution in this Court's understanding of the Constitution.  While the exact line between policy and details, lawmaking and fact-finding, and legislative and non-legislative functions had sometimes invited reasonable debate, everyone agreed these were the relevant inquiries.  And when Chief Justice Taft wrote of an \"intelligible principle,\" it seems plain enough that he sought only to explain the \noperation of these traditional tests; he gave no hint of a wish to overrule or revise them.  Tellingly, too, he wrote the phrase seven years before Schechter Poultry and Panama Refining, and it did nothing to alter the analysis in those cases, let alone prevent those challenges from succeeding by lopsided votes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There's a good argument, as well, that the statute in J.\u00a0W. Hampton passed muster under the traditional tests.  To boost American competitiveness in international trade, the legislation directed the President to \"\u00a0'investigat[e]'\u00a0\" the relative costs of production for American companies and their foreign counterparts and impose tariffs or duties that would \"\u00a0'equalize'\u00a0\" those costs.56  It also offered guidance on how to determine costs of production, listing  several relevant factors and establishing a process for interested parties to submit evidence.57  The President's fact-finding responsibility may have required intricate calculations, but it could be argued that Congress had made all the relevant policy decisions, and the Court's reference to an \"intelligible principle\" was just another way to describe the traditional rule that Congress may leave the executive the responsibility to find facts and fill up details.58\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still, it's undeniable that the \"intelligible principle\" remark eventually began to take on a life of its own.  We sometimes chide people for treating judicial opinions as if they were statutes, divorcing a passing comment from its context, ignoring all that came before and after, and treating an isolated phrase as if it were controlling.59  But that seems to be exactly what happened here.  For two decades, no one thought to invoke the \"intelligible principle\" comment as a basis to uphold a statute that would have failed more traditional separation-of-powers tests.  In fact, the phrase sat more or less silently entombed until the late 1940s.  Only then did lawyers begin digging it up in earnest and arguing to this Court that it had somehow displaced (sub silentio of course) all prior teachings in this area.60\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This mutated version of the \"intelligible principle\" remark has no basis in the original meaning of the Constitution, in history, or even in the decision from which it was plucked.  Judges and scholars representing a wide and diverse range of views have condemned it as resting on \"misunderst[ood] historical foundations.\"61  They have explained, too, that it has been abused to permit delegations of legislative power that on any other conceivable account should be held unconstitutional.  Indeed, where some have claimed to see \"intelligible principles\" many \"less discerning readers [have been able only to] find gibberish.\"62  Even Justice Douglas, one of the fathers of the administrative state, came to criticize excessive congressional delegations in the period when the intelligible principle \"test\" began to take hold.63\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still, the scope of the problem can be overstated.  At least some of the results the Court has reached under the banner of the abused \"intelligible principle\" doctrine may be consistent with more traditional teachings.  Some delegations have, at least arguably, implicated the president's inherent Article II authority.  The Court has held, for example, that Congress may authorize the President to prescribe aggravating factors that permit a military court-martial to impose the death penalty on a member of the Armed Forces convicted of murder--a decision that may \nimplicate in part the President's independent commander-in-chief authority.64  Others of these cases may have involved laws that specified rules governing private conduct but conditioned the application of those rules on fact-finding--a practice that is, as we've seen, also long associated with the executive function.65\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More recently, too, we've sought to tame misunderstandings of the intelligible principle \"test.\"  In Touby v. United States, the Court considered a provision of the Controlled Substances Act that allowed the Attorney General to add a substance to a list of prohibited drugs temporarily if he determined that doing so was \"\u00a0'necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety.'\u00a0\"66  Notably, Congress required the Attorney General, before acting, to consider the drug's \"\u00a0'history and current pattern of abuse,'\u00a0\" the \"\u00a0'scope, duration, and significance of [that] abuse,'\u00a0\" and \"\u00a0'[w]hat, if any, risk there is to the public health.'\u00a0\"67  In approving the statute, the Court stressed all these constraints on the Attorney General's discretion and, in doing so, seemed to indicate that the statute supplied an \"intelligible principle\" because it assigned an essentially fact-finding responsibility to the executive.  Whether or not one agrees with its characterization of the statute, in proceeding as it did Touby may have at least begun to point us back in the direction of the right questions.  To determine whether a statute provides an intelli-\ngible principle, we must ask: Does the statute assign to the executive only the responsibility to make factual findings?  Does it set forth the facts that the executive must consider and the criteria against which to measure them?  And most importantly, did Congress, and not the Executive Branch, make the policy judgments?  Only then can we fairly say that a statute contains the kind of intelligible principle the Constitution demands.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While it's been some time since the Court last held that a statute improperly delegated the legislative power to another branch--thanks in no small measure to the intelligible principle misadventure--the Court has hardly abandoned the business of policing improper legislative delegations.  When one legal doctrine becomes unavailable to do its intended work, the hydraulic pressures of our constitutional system sometimes shift the responsibility to different doctrines.68  And that's exactly what's happened here.  We still regularly rein in Congress's efforts to delegate legislative power; we just call what we're doing by different names.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider, for example, the \"major questions\" doctrine.  Under our precedents, an agency can fill in statutory gaps where \"statutory circumstances\" indicate that Congress meant to grant it such powers.69  But we don't follow that rule when the \"statutory gap\" concerns \"a question of deep 'economic and political significance' that is central to the statutory scheme.\"70  So we've rejected agency demands that we defer to their attempts to rewrite rules for billions of dollars in healthcare tax credits,71 to assume control over millions of small greenhouse gas sources,72 and to ban cigarettes.73  Although it is nominally a canon of statutory construction, we apply the major questions doctrine in service of the constitutional rule that Congress may not divest itself of its legislative power by transferring that power to an executive agency.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider, too, this Court's cases addressing vagueness.  \"A vague law,\" this Court has observed, \"impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis.\"74  And we have explained that our doctrine prohibiting vague laws is an outgrowth and \"corollary of the separation of powers.\"75  It's easy to see, too, how most any challenge to a legislative delegation can be reframed as a vagueness complaint: A statute that does not contain \"sufficiently definite and precise\" standards \"to enable Congress, the courts, and the public to ascertain\" whether Congress's guidance has been followed at once presents a delegation problem and provides impermissibly vague guidance to affected citizens.76  And it seems little coincidence that our void-for-vagueness cases became much more common soon after the Court began relaxing its approach to legislative delegations.  Before 1940, the Court decided only a handful of vagueness challenges to federal statutes.  Since then, the phrase \"void for vagueness\" has appeared in our cases well over 100 times.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor have we abandoned enforcing other sides of the separation-of-powers triangle between the legislative, executive, and judiciary.  We have not hesitated to prevent Congress from \"confer[ring] the Government's 'judicial Power' on entities outside Article III.\"77  We've forbidden the executive from encroaching on legislative functions by wielding a line-item veto.78  We've prevented Congress from delegating its collective legislative power to a single House.79  And we've policed legislative efforts to control executive branch officials.80  These cases show that, when the separation of powers is at stake, we don't just throw up our hands.  In all these areas, we recognize that abdication is \"not part of the constitutional design.\"81  And abdication here would be no more appropriate.  To leave this aspect of the constitutional structure alone undefended would serve only to accelerate the flight of power from  the legislative to the executive branch, turning the latter into a vortex of authority that was constitutionally reserved for the people's representatives in order to protect their liberties.\nIII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Returning to SORNA with this understanding of our charge in hand, problems quickly emerge.  Start with this one: It's hard to see how SORNA leaves the Attorney General with only details to fill up.  Of course, what qualifies as a detail can sometimes be difficult to discern and, \nas we've seen, this Court has upheld statutes that allow federal agencies to resolve even highly consequential details so long as Congress prescribes the rule governing private conduct.  But it's hard to see how the statute before us could be described as leaving the Attorney General with only details to dispatch.  As the government itself admitted in Reynolds, SORNA leaves the Attorney General free to impose on 500,000 pre-Act offenders all of the statute's requirements, some of them, or none of them.  The Attorney General may choose which pre-Act offenders to subject to the Act.  And he is free to change his mind at any point or over the course of different political administrations.  In the end, there isn't a single policy decision concerning pre-Act offenders on which Congress even tried to speak, and not a single other case where we have upheld executive authority over matters like these on the ground they constitute mere \"details.\"  This much appears to have been deliberate, too.  Because members of Congress could not reach consensus on the treatment of pre-Act offenders, it seems this was one of those situations where they found it expedient to hand off the job to the executive and direct there the blame for any later problems that might emerge.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor can SORNA be described as an example of conditional legislation subject to executive fact-finding.  To be sure, Congress could have easily written this law in that way.  It might have required all pre-Act offenders to register, but then given the Attorney General the authority to make case-by-case exceptions for offenders who do not present an \"\u00a0'imminent hazard to the public safety'\u00a0\" comparable to that posed by newly released post-Act offenders.82  It could have set criteria to inform that determination, too, asking the executive to investigate, say, whether \nan offender's risk of recidivism correlates with the time since his last offense, or whether multiple lesser offenses indicate higher or lower risks than a single greater  offense.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But SORNA did none of this.  Instead, it gave the Attorney General unfettered discretion to decide which requirements to impose on which pre-Act offenders.  The Attorney General's own edicts acknowledge the considerable policy-making powers he enjoys, describing his rules governing pre-Act offenders as \"\u00a0'of fundamental importance to the initial operation of SORNA, and to its practical scope .\u00a0.\u00a0. since [they] determin[e] the applicability of SORNA's requirements to virtually the entire existing sex offender population.'\u00a0\"83  These edicts tout, too, the Attorney General's \"discretion to apply SORNA's requirements to sex offenders with pre-SORNA convictions if he determines (as he has) that the public benefits of doing so outweigh any adverse effects.\"84  Far from deciding the factual predicates to a rule set forth by statute, the Attorney General himself acknowledges that the law entitles him to make his own policy decisions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, SORNA does not involve an area of overlapping authority with the executive.  Congress may assign the President broad authority regarding the conduct of foreign affairs or other matters where he enjoys his own inherent Article II powers.  But SORNA stands far afield from any of that.  It gives the Attorney General the authority to \"prescrib[e] the rules by which the duties and rights\" of citizens are determined, a quintessentially legislative power.85\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our precedents confirm these conclusions.  If allowing \nthe President to draft a \"cod[e] of fair competition\" for slaughterhouses was \"delegation running riot,\" then it's hard to see how giving the nation's chief prosecutor the power to write a criminal code rife with his own policy choices might be permissible.86  And if Congress may not give the President the discretion to ban or allow the interstate transportation of petroleum, then it's hard to see how Congress may give the Attorney General the discretion to apply or not apply any or all of SORNA's requirements to pre-Act offenders, and then change his mind at any time.87  If the separation of powers means anything, it must mean that Congress cannot give the executive branch a blank check to write a code of conduct governing private conduct for a half-million people.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statute here also sounds all the alarms the founders left for us.  Because Congress could not achieve the consensus necessary to resolve the hard problems associated with SORNA's application to pre-Act offenders, it passed the potato to the Attorney General.  And freed from the need to assemble a broad supermajority for his views, the Attorney General did not hesitate to apply the statute retroactively to a politically unpopular minority.  Nor could the Attorney General afford the issue the kind of deliberative care the framers designed a representative legislature to ensure.  Perhaps that's part of the reason why the executive branch found itself rapidly adopting different positions across different administrations.  And because SORNA vested lawmaking power in one person rather than many, it should be no surprise that, rather than few and stable, the edicts have proved frequent and shifting, with fair notice sacrificed in the process.  Then, too, there is the question of accountability.  In passing this \nstatute, Congress was able to claim credit for \"comprehensively\" addressing the problem of the entire existing population of sex offenders (who can object to that?), while in fact leaving the Attorney General to sort it out.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It would be easy enough to let this case go.  After all, sex offenders are one of the most disfavored groups in our society.  But the rule that prevents Congress from giving the executive carte blanche to write laws for sex offenders is the same rule that protects everyone else.  Nor is it hard to imagine how the power at issue in this case--the power of a prosecutor to require a group to register with the government on pain of weighty criminal penalties--could be abused in other settings.  To allow the nation's chief law enforcement officer to write the criminal laws he is charged with enforcing--to \"\u00a0'unit[e]'\u00a0\" the \"\u00a0'legislative and executive powers .\u00a0.\u00a0. in the same person'\u00a0\"--would be to mark the end of any meaningful enforcement of our separation of powers and invite the tyranny of the majority that follows when lawmaking and law enforcement responsibilities are united in the same hands.88\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor would enforcing the Constitution's demands spell doom for what some call the \"administrative state.\"  The separation of powers does not prohibit any particular policy outcome, let alone dictate any conclusion about the proper size and scope of government.  Instead, it is a procedural guarantee that requires Congress to assemble a social consensus before choosing our nation's course on policy questions like those implicated by SORNA.  What is more, Congress is hardly bereft of options to accomplish all it might wish to achieve.  It may always authorize executive branch officials to fill in even a large number of details, to find facts that trigger the generally applicable rule of conduct specified in a statute, or to exercise non-\nlegislative powers.  Congress can also commission agencies or other experts to study and recommend legislative language.  Respecting the separation of powers forecloses no substantive outcomes.  It only requires us to respect along the way one of the most vital of the procedural protections of individual liberty found in our Constitution.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What do the government and the plurality have to say about the constitutional concerns SORNA poses?  Most everyone, the plurality included, concedes that if SORNA allows the Attorney General as much authority as we have outlined, it would present \"a nondelegation question.\"89  So the only remaining available tactic is to try to make this big case \"small-bore\"90 by recasting the statute in a way that might satisfy any plausible separation-of-powers test.  So, yes, just a few years ago in Reynolds the government represented to this Court that SORNA granted the Attorney General nearly boundless discretion with respect to pre-Act offenders.  But now, faced with a constitutional challenge, the government speaks out of the other side of its mouth and invites us to reimagine SORNA as compelling the Attorney General to register pre-Act offenders \"to the maximum extent feasible.\"  And, as thus reinvented, the government insists, the statute supplies a clear statement of legislative policy, with only details for the Attorney General to clean up.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But even this new dream of a statute wouldn't be free from doubt.  A statute directing an agency to regulate private conduct to the extent \"feasible\" can have many possible meanings: It might refer to \"technological\" feasibility, \"economic\" feasibility, \"administrative\" feasibility, \nor even \"political\" feasibility.  Such an \"evasive standard\" could threaten the separation of powers if it effectively allowed the agency to make the \"important policy choices\" that belong to Congress while frustrating \"meaningful judicial review.\"91  And that seems exactly the case here, where the Attorney General is left free to make all the important policy decisions and it is difficult to see what standard a court might later use to judge whether he exceeded the bounds of the authority given to him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But don't worry over that; return to the real world.  The bigger problem is that the feasibility standard is a figment of the government's (very recent) imagination.  The only provision addressing pre-Act offenders, \u00a720913(d), says nothing about feasibility.  And the omission can hardly be excused as some oversight: No one doubts that Congress knows exactly how to write a feasibility standard into law when it wishes.92  Unsurprisingly, too, the existence of some imaginary statutory feasibility standard seemed to have escaped notice at the Department of Justice during the Attorney General's many rulemakings; in those proceedings, as we have seen, the Attorney General has repeatedly admitted that the statute affords him the authority to \"balance\" the burdens on sex offenders with \"public safety interests\" as and how he sees fit.93\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unable to muster a feasibility standard from the only statutory provision addressing pre-Act offenders, the plurality invites us to hunt in other and more unlikely corners.  It points first to SORNA's \"[d]eclaration of purpose,\" which announces that Congress, \"[i]n order to pro-\ntect the public from sex offenders and offenders against children .\u00a0.\u00a0. establishes a comprehensive national system for the registration of those offenders.\"94  But nowhere is feasibility mentioned here either.  In fact, this provision doesn't purport to guide the Attorney General's discretion at all.  Instead, it simply declares what Congress believed the rest of the statute's enacted provisions had already \"establishe[d],\" without the need for any action by the Attorney General.  And by now surely we must all agree that broad and sweeping statements like these about \"a statute's 'basic purpose' are .\u00a0.\u00a0. inadequate to overcome the words of its text regarding the specific issue under consideration.\"95  While those adopting SORNA might have declared that they hoped and wished for a \"comprehensive national system,\" the fact remains that the law they actually adopted for pre-Act offenders leaves everything to the Attorney General.  Hopes and dreams are not laws.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Besides, even if we were to pretend that \u00a720901 amounted to a directive telling the Attorney General to establish a \"comprehensive national system\" for pre-Act offenders, the plurality reads too much into the word \"comprehensive.\"  Comprehensive coverage does not mean coverage to the maximum extent feasible.  \"Comprehensive\" means \"having the attribute of comprising or including much; of large content or scope,\" \"[i]nclusive of; embracing,\" or \"[c]ontaining much in small compass; compendious.\"96  So, for example, a criminal justice system may be called \"comprehensive\" even though many crimes go unpursued.  And SORNA itself contains all sorts of \ncoverage exceptions for post-Act offenders yet claims to comprehensively address them.97  In the same way, no reason exists why SORNA might not also claim to address pre-Act offenders \"comprehensively\" even though the Attorney General is free to exercise his discretion to forgo registration for some, many, or maybe all of them.  The statute still \"comprehensively\" addresses these persons by indicating they must abide whatever rules an Attorney General may choose.  In all these ways, SORNA might be said to address sex offenders past, present, and future in a way that \"compris[es] or includ[es] much,\" and that is \"of large content or scope,\" but in a way that nevertheless delegates important policy decisions to the executive branch.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finding it impossible to conscript the statute's declaration of purpose into doing the work it needs done, the government and plurality next ask us to turn to SORNA's definition of \"\u00a0'sex offender.'\u00a0\"98  They emphasize that SORNA defines a \"sex offender\" as \"\u00a0'an individual who was convicted of a sex offense'\u00a0\"--and, they note, pre-Act offenders meet this definition.99  Because pre-Act offenders fall within the definition of \"sex offender[s],\" the government and plurality continue, it follows that the Attorney General must ensure all of them are registered and subject to SORNA's demands.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That much, however, does not follow.  To say that pre-Act sex offenders fall within the definition of \"sex offenders\" is merely a truism: Yes, of course, these people have already been convicted of sex offenses under state law.  But whether these individuals are also subject to federal registration requirements is a different question entirely.  \nAnd as we have seen, the only part of the statute that speaks to pre-Act sex offenders--\u00a720913(d)--makes plain that they are not automatically subject to all the Act's terms but are left to their fate at the hands of the Attorney General.  Look at it this way: If the statute's definitional section were really enough to command the registration of all sex offenders, the Act would have had no need to proceed to explain, as it does at great length, when post-Act sex offenders must register and when they need not.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If that argument won't work, the plurality points us to \u00a720913(d)'s second clause, which grants the Attorney General the authority \"to prescribe rules for the registration of .\u00a0.\u00a0. sex offenders .\u00a0.\u00a0. who are unable to comply\" with the Act's initial registration requirements.100  According to the plurality, this language suggests that Congress expected the Attorney General to register pre-Act offenders to the maximum extent feasible.  But, of course, this clause, too, says nothing of the sort.  And the authority provided under \u00a720913(d)'s first clause--which gives the Attorney General the blanket authority \"to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter\"--is additional to the authority granted under the second clause.  So not only does the Attorney General have the authority to prescribe rules for the registration of pre-Act offenders under the second clause, he is free to specify which statutory requirements he does and does not wish to apply under the first clause.  Far from suggesting a maximalist approach then, the second clause read in light of the first only serves to underscore the breadth of the Attorney General's discretion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With so little in statutory text to work with, the government and the plurality \"can't resist\" highlighting cer-\ntain statements from the Act's legislative history.101  But \"legislative history is not the law.\"102  Still less can committee reports or statements by individual legislators be used \"to muddy clear statutory language\" like that before us.103  And even taken on their own terms, these statements do no more than confirm that some members of Congress hoped and wished that the Attorney General would exercise his discretion to register at least some pre-Act offenders.  None of these snippets mentions a \"feasibility\" standard, and none can obscure the absence of such a standard in the law itself.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That leaves the plurality and the government to try to fish its feasibility standard from our decision in Reynolds.  But Reynolds would make a difference only if it bound us as a matter of stare decisis to adopt an interpretation inconsistent with the statute's terms.  And, of course, it does no such thing.  The government and the plurality submit that Reynolds was premised on an understanding that Congress intended the statute to apply to pre-Act offenders to the maximum extent feasible.  To support their reading they point to Reynolds' surmise that Congress \"may well have thought [that there could be] practical problems\" with applying SORNA to pre-Act offenders and for that reason left their registration obligations to be sorted out by the Attorney General.104  But speculation about some of Congress's motives in adopting \u00a720913(d) aside, Reynolds plainly understood the statute itself as investing the Attorney General with sole power to decide whether and when to apply SORNA's requirements to pre-\nAct offenders.105\n*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing found here can come as a surprise.  In Reynolds, the government told this Court that SORNA supplies no standards regulating the Attorney General's treatment of pre-Act offenders.  This Court agreed, and everyone proceeded with eyes open about the potential constitutional consequences; in fact, the dissent expressly warned that adopting such a broad construction of the statute would yield the separation-of-powers challenge we face today.106  Now, when the statute faces the chopping block, the government asks us to ignore its earlier arguments and reimagine (really, rewrite) the statute in a new and narrower way to avoid its long-predicted fate.  No wonder some of us are not inclined to play along.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The only real surprise is that the Court fails to make good on the consequences the government invited, resolving nothing and deferring everything.  In a future case with a full panel, I remain hopeful that the Court may yet recognize that, while Congress can enlist considerable assistance from the executive branch in filling up details and finding facts, it may never hand off to the nation's chief prosecutor the power to write his own criminal code.  That \"is delegation running riot.\"107\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0As to that point, the dissent criticized the majority only for basing its view in part on legislative history.  565 U.\u00a0S., at 448, n. (opinion of Scalia, J.).  The dissent found the majority's excursion into history \"quite superfluous\" given that the \"text of the Act itself makes clear that Congress sought\" to ensure the registration of all pre-Act offenders.  Ibid.  In reaching that conclusion, the dissent relied on the Act's express statement of purpose and its \"sex offender\" definition.  See infra, at 11-13.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Once again, the dissent agreed with the Court that \u00a720913(d) could not sensibly be read to give the Attorney General any greater power.  \"[I]t is simply implausible,\" the dissent concluded, \"that the Attorney General was given discretion to determine whether coverage of pre-Act offenders (one of the purposes of the Act) should exist.\"  565 U.\u00a0S., at 450 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  The dissent parted ways with the Court only in interpreting \u00a720913(d) to provide the Attorney General with even less authority.\nFootnote 3\u00a0Gundy tries to dispute that simple fact, but fails.  He points to changes that Attorneys General have made in guidelines to States about how to satisfy SORNA's funding conditions.  See Brief for Petitioner 32-33.  But those state-directed rules are independent of the only thing at issue here: the application of registration requirements to pre-Act offenders.  Those requirements have been constant since the Attorney General's initial rule, as the guidelines themselves affirm.  See 73 Fed. Reg. 38046 (2008); 76 Fed. Reg. 1639 (2011).  Indeed, the guidelines to States are issued not under \u00a720913(d) at all, but under a separate delegation in \u00a720912(b).  See 73 Fed. Reg. 38030; 76 Fed. Reg. 1631.\nFootnote 4\u00a0Even Gundy conceded at oral argument that if the statute means what we have said, it \"likely would be constitutional.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 25.  That is why all of his argument is devoted to showing that it means something else.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Reynolds v.

A. v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC., ET AL.(2019)\nNo. 17-1229\nArgued: December 4, 2018Decided: January 22, 2019\n\n\nPetitioner Helsinn Healthcare S.\u00a0A. makes a treatment for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting using the chemical palonosetron.  While Helsinn was developing its palonosetron product, it entered  into two agreements with another company granting that company the right to distribute, promote, market, and sell a 0.25 mg dose of palonosetron in the United States.  The agreements required that the company keep confidential any proprietary information received  under the agreements.  Nearly two years later, in January 2003, Helsinn filed a provisional patent application covering a 0.25 mg dose of palonosetron.  Over the next 10 years, Helsinn filed four patent applications that claimed priority to the January 2003 date.  Relevant here, Helsinn filed its fourth patent application in 2013.  That patent (the '219 patent) covers a fixed dose of 0.25 mg of palonosetron in a 5 ml solution and is covered by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2011, respondents Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (collectively Teva), sought approval to market a generic 0.25 mg palonosetron product.  Helsinn sued Teva for infringing its patents, including the '219 patent.  Teva countered that the '219 patent was invalid under the \"on sale\" provision of the AIA--which precludes a person from obtaining a patent on an invention that was \"in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed invention,\" 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7102(a)(1)--because the 0.25 mg dose was \"on sale\" more than one year before Helsinn filed the provisional patent application in 2003.  The District Court held that the AIA's \"on sale\" provision did not apply because the public disclosure of the agreements did not disclose the 0.25 mg dose.  The Federal Circuit reversed, holding that the sale was publicly disclosed, regardless of whether the details of the invention were publicly disclosed in the terms of the sale agreements.\nHeld:\u00a0A commercial sale to a third party who is required to keep the invention confidential may place the invention \"on sale\" under \u00a7102(a).  The patent statute in force immediately before the AIA included an on-sale bar.  This Court's precedent interpreting that provision supports the view that a sale or offer of sale need not make an invention available to the public to constitute invalidating prior art.  See, e.g., Pfaff v. Wells Electronics, Inc., 525 U.\u00a0S. 55, 67.  The Federal Circuit had made explicit what was implicit in this Court's pre-AIA precedent, holding that \"secret sales\" could invalidate a patent.  Special Devices, Inc. v. OEA, Inc., 270 F.\u00a03d 1353, 1357.  Given this settled pre-AIA precedent, the Court applies the presumption that when Congress reenacted the same \"on sale\" language in the AIA, it adopted the earlier judicial construction of that phrase.  The addition of the catchall phrase \"or otherwise available to the public\" is not enough of a change for the Court to conclude that Congress intended to alter the meaning of \"on sale.\"  Paroline v. United States, 572 U.\u00a0S. 434, and Federal Maritime Comm'n v. Seatrain Lines, Inc., 411 U.\u00a0S. 726, distinguished.

This case requires us to decide whether the sale of an invention to a third party who is contractually obligated to keep the invention confidential places the invention \"on sale\" within the meaning of \u00a7102(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More than 20 years ago, this Court determined that an invention was \"on sale\" within the meaning of an earlier version of \u00a7102(a) when it was \"the subject of a commercial offer for sale\" and \"ready for patenting.\"  Pfaff v. Wells Electronics, Inc., 525 U.\u00a0S. 55, 67 (1998).  We did not further require that the sale make the details of the invention available to the public.  In light of this earlier construction, we determine that the reenactment of the phrase \"on sale\" in the AIA did not alter this meaning.  Accordingly, a commercial sale to a third party who is required to keep the invention confidential may place the invention \"on sale\" under the AIA.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Helsinn Healthcare S.\u00a0A. (Helsinn) is a Swiss pharmaceutical company that makes Aloxi, a drug that treats chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.  Helsinn acquired the right to develop palonosetron, the active ingredient in Aloxi, in 1998.  In early 2000, it submitted protocols for Phase III clinical trials to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), proposing to study a 0.25 mg and a 0.75 mg dose of palonosetron.  In September 2000, Helsinn announced that it was beginning Phase III clinical trials and was seeking marketing partners for its palonosetron product.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Helsinn found its marketing partner in MGI Pharma, Inc. (MGI), a Minnesota pharmaceutical company that markets and distributes drugs in the United States.  Helsinn and MGI entered into two agreements: a license agreement and a supply and purchase agreement.  The license agreement granted MGI the right to distribute, promote, market, and sell the 0.25 mg and 0.75 mg doses of palonosetron in the United States.  In return, MGI agreed to make upfront payments to Helsinn and to pay future royalties on distribution of those doses.  Under the supply and purchase agreement, MGI agreed to purchase exclusively from Helsinn any palonosetron product approved by the FDA.  Helsinn in turn agreed to supply MGI however much of the approved doses it required.  Both agreements included dosage information and required MGI to keep confidential any proprietary information received under the agreements.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Helsinn and MGI announced the agreements in a joint press release, and MGI also reported the agreements in its Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Although the 8-K filing included redacted copies of the agreements, neither the 8-K filing nor the press releases disclosed the specific dosage formulations covered by the agreements.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On January 30, 2003, nearly two years after Helsinn and MGI entered into the agreements, Helsinn filed a provisional patent application covering the 0.25 mg and 0.75 mg doses of palonosetron.  Over the next 10 years, Helsinn filed four patent applications that claimed priority to the January 30, 2003, date of the provisional application.  Helsinn filed its fourth patent application--the one relevant here--in May 2013, and it issued as U.\u00a0S. Patent No. 8,598,219 ('219 patent).  The '219 patent covers a fixed dose of 0.25 mg of palonosetron in a 5 ml solution.  By virtue of its effective date, the '219 patent is governed by the AIA.  See \u00a7101(i).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva), are, respectively, an Israeli company that manufactures generic drugs and its American affiliate.  In 2011, Teva sought approval from the FDA to market a generic 0.25 mg palonosetron product.  Helsinn then sued Teva for infringing its patents, including the '219 patent.  In defense, Teva asserted that the '219 patent was invalid because the 0.25 mg dose was \"on sale\" more than one year before Helsinn filed the provisional patent application covering that dose in January 2003.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The AIA precludes a person from obtaining a patent on an invention that was \"on sale\" before the effective filing date of the patent application:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A person shall be entitled to a patent unless .\u00a0.\u00a0. the claimed invention was patented, described in a printed publication, or in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.\"  35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7102(a)(1) (emphasis added).\nSee also \u00a7102(b)(1) (exception for certain disclosures made within a year before the effective filing date).  Disclosures described in \u00a7102(a)(1) are often referred to as \"prior art.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The patent statute in effect before the passage of the AIA included a similar proscription, known as the \"on-sale bar\":\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A person shall be entitled to a patent unless--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(a) the invention was known or used by others in this country, or patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent, or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(b) the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States.\"  35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7102(a)-(b) (2006 ed.) (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court determined that the \"on sale\" provision did not apply.  It concluded that, under the AIA, an invention is not \"on sale\" unless the sale or offer in question made the claimed invention available to the public.  Helsinn Healthcare S. A. v. Dr. Reddy's Labs. Ltd., 2016 WL 832089, *45, *51 (D NJ, Mar. 3, 2016).  Because the companies' public disclosure of the agreements between Helsinn and MGI did not disclose the 0.25 mg dose, the court determined that the invention was not \"on sale\" before the critical date.  Id., at *51-*52.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Circuit reversed.  855 F. 3d 1356, 1360 (2017).  It concluded that \"if the existence of the sale is public, the details of the invention need not be publicly disclosed in the terms of sale\" to fall within the AIA's on-sale bar.  Id., at 1371.  Because the sale between Helsinn and MGI was publicly disclosed, it held that the on-sale bar applied.  Id., at 1364, 1371.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to determine whether, under the AIA, an inventor's sale of an invention to a third party who is obligated to keep the invention confidential qualifies as prior art for purposes of determining the patentability of the invention.  585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).  We conclude that such a sale can qualify as prior art.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States Constitution authorizes Congress \"[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\"  Art. 1, \u00a78, cl. 8.  Under this grant of authority, Congress has crafted a federal patent system that encourages \"the creation and disclosure of new, useful, and nonobvious advances in technology and design\" by granting inventors \"the exclusive right to practice the invention for a period of years.\"  Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U.\u00a0S. 141, 151 (1989).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To further the goal of \"motivating innovation and enlightenment\" while also \"avoiding monopolies that unnecessarily stifle competition,\" Pfaff, 525 U.\u00a0S., at 63, Congress has imposed several conditions on the \"limited opportunity to obtain a property right in an idea,\" Bonito Boats, supra, at 149.  One such condition is the on-sale bar, which reflects Congress' \"reluctance to allow an inventor to remove existing knowledge from public use\" by obtaining a patent covering that knowledge.  Pfaff, supra, at 64; see also Pennock v. Dialogue, 2 Pet. 1, 19 (1829) (explaining that \"it would materially retard the progress of science and the useful arts\" to allow an inventor to \"sell his invention publicly\" and later \"take out a patent\" and \"exclude the public from any farther use than what should be derived under it\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every patent statute since 1836 has included an on-sale bar.  Pfaff, supra, at 65.  The patent statute in force immediately before the AIA prevented a person from receiving a patent if, \"more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States,\" \"the invention was .\u00a0.\u00a0. on sale\" in the United States.  35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7102(b) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).  The AIA, as relevant here, retained the on-sale bar and added the catchall phrase \"or otherwise available to the public.\"  \u00a7102(a)(1) (2012 ed.) (\"A person shall be entitled to a patent unless\" the \"claimed invention was .\u00a0.\u00a0. in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public .\u00a0.\u00a0. \").  We must decide whether these changes altered the meaning of the \"on sale\" bar.  We hold that they did not.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress enacted the AIA in 2011 against the backdrop of a substantial body of law interpreting \u00a7102's on-sale bar.  In 1998, we determined that the pre-AIA on-sale bar applies \"when two conditions are satisfied\" more than a year before an inventor files a patent application.  Pfaff, 525 U.\u00a0S., at 67.  \"First, the product must be the subject of a commercial offer for sale.\"  Ibid.  \"Second, the invention must be ready for patenting,\" which we explained could be shown by proof of \"reduction to practice\" or \"drawings or other descriptions of the invention that were sufficiently specific to enable a person skilled in the art to practice the invention.\"  Id., at 67-68.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although this Court has never addressed the precise question presented in this case, our precedents suggest that a sale or offer of sale need not make an invention available to the public.  For instance, we held in Pfaff that an offer for sale could cause an inventor to lose the right to patent, without regard to whether the offer discloses each detail of the invention.  E.g., id., at 67.  Other cases focus on whether the invention had been sold, not whether the details of the invention had been made available to the public or whether the sale itself had been publicly disclosed.  E.g., Consolidated Fruit-Jar Co. v. Wright, 94 U.\u00a0S. 92, 94 (1877) (\"[A] single instance of sale or of use by the patentee may, under the circumstances, be fatal to the patent .\u00a0.\u00a0. \"); cf. Smith & Griggs Mfg. Co. v. Sprague, 123 U.\u00a0S. 249, 257 (1887) (\"A single sale to another .\u00a0.\u00a0. would certainly have defeated his right to a patent .\u00a0.\u00a0. \"); Elizabeth v. Pavement Co., 97 U.\u00a0S. 126, 136 (1878) (\"It is not a public knowledge of his invention that precludes the inventor from obtaining a patent for it, but a public use or sale of it\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Circuit--which has \"exclusive jurisdiction\" over patent appeals, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71295(a)--has made explicit what was implicit in our precedents.  It has long held that \"secret sales\" can invalidate a patent.  E.g., Special Devices, Inc. v. OEA, Inc., 270 F.\u00a03d 1353, 1357 (2001) (invalidating patent claims based on \"sales for the purpose of the commercial stockpiling of an invention\" that \"took place in secret\"); Woodland Trust v. Flowertree Nursery, Inc., 148 F.\u00a03d 1368, 1370 (1998) (\"Thus an inventor's own prior commercial use, albeit kept secret, may constitute a public use or sale under \u00a7102(b), barring him from obtaining a patent\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of this settled pre-AIA precedent on the meaning of \"on sale,\" we presume that when Congress reenacted the same language in the AIA, it adopted the earlier judicial construction of that phrase.  See Shapiro v. United States, 335 U.\u00a0S. 1, 16 (1948) (\"In adopting the language used in the earlier act, Congress 'must be considered to have adopted also the construction given by this Court to such language, and made it a part of the enactment'\u00a0\").  The new \u00a7102 retained the exact language used in its predecessor statute (\"on sale\") and, as relevant here, added only a new catchall clause (\"or otherwise available to the public\").  As amicus United States noted at oral argument, if \"on sale\" had a settled meaning before the AIA was adopted, then adding the phrase \"or otherwise available to the public\" to the statute \"would be a fairly oblique way of attempting to overturn\" that \"settled body of law.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 28.  The addition of \"or otherwise available to the public\" is simply not enough of a change for us to conclude that Congress intended to alter the meaning of the reenacted term \"on sale.\"  Cf. Holder v. Martinez Gutierrez, 566 U.\u00a0S. 583, 593 (2012) (determining that a reenacted provision did not ratify an earlier judicial construction where the provision omitted the word on which the prior judicial constructions were based).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Helsinn disagrees, arguing that our construction reads \"otherwise\" out of the statute.  Citing Paroline v. United States, 572 U.\u00a0S. 434 (2014), and Federal Maritime Comm'n v. Seatrain Lines, Inc., 411 U.\u00a0S. 726 (1973), Helsinn contends that the associated-words canon requires us to read \"otherwise available to the public\" to limit the preceding terms in \u00a7102 to disclosures that make the claimed invention available to the public.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As an initial matter, neither of the cited decisions addresses the reenactment of terms that had acquired a well-settled judicial interpretation.  And Helsinn's argument places too much weight on \u00a7102's catchall phrase.  Like other such phrases, \"otherwise available to the public\" captures material that does not fit neatly into the statute's enumerated categories but is nevertheless meant to be covered.  Given that the phrase \"on sale\" had acquired a well-settled meaning when the AIA was enacted, we decline to read the addition of a broad catchall phrase to upset that body of precedent.  \nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Helsinn does not ask us to revisit our pre-AIA interpretation of the on-sale bar.  Nor does it dispute the Federal Circuit's determination that the invention claimed in the '219 patent was \"on sale\" within the meaning of the pre-AIA statute.  Because we determine that Congress did not alter the meaning of \"on sale\" when it enacted the AIA, we hold that an inventor's sale of an invention to a third party who is obligated to keep the invention confidential can qualify as prior art under \u00a7102(a).  We therefore affirm the judgment of the Federal Circuit.\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHERRERA v. WYOMING(2019)\nNo. 17-532\nArgued: January 8, 2019Decided: May 20, 2019\n\n\nAn 1868 treaty between the United States and the Crow Tribe promised that in exchange for most of the Tribe's territory in modern-day Montana and Wyoming, its members would \"have the right to hunt on the unoccupied lands of the United States so long as game may be found thereon .\u00a0.\u00a0. and peace subsists .\u00a0.\u00a0. on the borders of the hunting districts.\"  15 Stat. 650.  In 2014, Wyoming charged petitioner Clayvin Herrera with off-season hunting in Bighorn National Forest and being an accessory to the same.  The state trial court rejected Herrera's argument that he had a protected right to hunt in the forest pursuant to the 1868 Treaty, and a jury convicted him.  On appeal, the state appellate court relied on the reasoning of the Tenth Circuit's decision in Crow Tribe of Indians v. Repsis, 73 F.\u00a03d 982--which in turn relied upon this Court's decision in Ward v. Race Horse, 163 U.\u00a0S. 504--and held that the treaty right expired upon Wyoming's statehood.  The court rejected Herrera's argument that this Court's subsequent decision in Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U.\u00a0S. 172, repudiated Race Horse and therefore undercut the logic of Repsis.  In any event, the court concluded, Herrera was precluded from arguing that the treaty right survived Wyoming's statehood because the Crow Tribe had litigated Repsis on behalf of itself and its members.  Even if the 1868 Treaty right survived Wyoming's statehood, the court added, it did not permit Herrera to hunt in Bighorn National Forest because the treaty right applies only on unoccupied lands and the national forest became categorically occupied when it was created.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0The Crow Tribe's hunting rights under the 1868 Treaty did not expire upon Wyoming's statehood.  Pp.\u00a06-17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0This case is controlled by Mille Lacs, not Race Horse.  Race Horse concerned a hunting right guaranteed in an 1868 treaty with the Shoshone and Bannock Tribes containing language identical to that at issue here.  Relying on two lines of reasoning, the Race Horse Court held that Wyoming's admission to the United States in 1890 extinguished the Shoshone-Bannock Treaty right.  First, the doctrine that new States are admitted to the Union on an \"equal footing\" with existing States led the Court to conclude that affording the Tribes a protected hunting right lasting after statehood would conflict with the power vested in those States--and newly shared by Wyoming--\"to regulate the killing of game within their borders.\"  163 U. S., at 514.  Second, the Court found no evidence in the Shoshone-Bannock Treaty itself that Congress intended the treaty right to continue in \"perpetuity.\"  Id., at 514-515.  Mille Lacs undercut both pillars of Race Horse's reasoning.  Mille Lacs established that the crucial inquiry for treaty termination analysis is whether Congress has \"clearly express[ed]\" an intent to abrogate an Indian treaty right, 526 U.\u00a0S., at 202, or whether a termination point identified in the treaty itself has been satisfied, id., at 207.  Thus, while Race Horse \"was not expressly overruled\" in Mille Lacs, it \"retain[s] no vitality,\" Limbach v. Hooven & Allison Co., 466 U.\u00a0S. 353, 361, and is repudiated to the extent it held that treaty rights can be impliedly extinguished at statehood.  Pp. 6-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Repsis does not preclude Herrera from arguing that the 1868 Treaty right survived Wyoming's statehood.  Even when the elements of issue preclusion are met, an exception may be warranted if there has been an intervening \"\u00a0'change in [the] applicable legal context.'\u00a0\"  Bobby v. Bies, 556 U.\u00a0S. 825, 834.  Here, Mille Lacs' repudiation of Race Horse's reasoning--on which Repsis relied--justifies such an exception.  Pp. 11-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Applying Mille Lacs, Wyoming's admission into the Union did not abrogate the Crow Tribe's off-reservation treaty hunting right.  First, the Wyoming Statehood Act does not show that Congress \"clearly expressed\" an intent to end the 1868 Treaty hunting right.  See 526 U.\u00a0S., at 202.  There is also no evidence in the treaty itself that Congress intended the hunting right to expire at statehood, or that the Crow Tribe would have understood it to do so.  Nor does the historical record support such a reading of the treaty.  The State counters that statehood, as a practical matter, rendered all the lands in the State occupied.  Even assuming that Wyoming presents an accurate historical picture, the State, by using statehood as a proxy for occupation, subverts this Court's clear instruction that treaty-protected rights \"are not impliedly terminated upon statehood.\"  Id., at 207.  To the extent that the State seeks to rely on historical evidence to establish that all land in Wyoming was functionally \"occupied\" by 1890, its arguments fall outside the question presented and are unpersuasive in any event.  Pp.\u00a013-17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Bighorn National Forest did not become categorically \"occupied\" within the meaning of the 1868 Treaty when the national forest was created.  Construing the treaty's terms as \"\u00a0'they would naturally be understood by the Indians,'\u00a0\" Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U.\u00a0S. 658, 676, it is clear that the Tribe would have understood the word \"unoccupied\" to denote an area free of residence or settlement by non-Indians.  That interpretation follows from several cues in the treaty's text.  For example, the treaty made the hunting right contingent on peace \"among the whites and Indians on the borders of the hunting districts,\" 15 Stat. 650, thus contrasting the unoccupied hunting districts with areas of white settlement.  Historical evidence confirms this reading of \"unoccupied.\"  Wyoming's counterarguments are unavailing.  The Federal Government's exercise of control and withdrawing of the forest lands from settlement would not categorically transform the territory into an area resided on or settled by non-Indians; quite the opposite.  Nor would mining and logging of the forest lands prior to 1897 have caused the Tribe to view the Bighorn Mountains as occupied.  Pp.\u00a017-21.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.\u00a0This decision is limited in two ways.  First, the Court holds that Bighorn National Forest is not categorically occupied, not that all  areas within the forest are unoccupied.  Second, the state trial court decided that Wyoming could regulate the exercise of the 1868 Treaty right \"in the interest of conservation,\" an issue not reached by the appellate court.  The Court also does not address the viability of the State's arguments on this issue.

WYOMING\non writ of certiorari to the district court of wyoming, sheridan county\n[May 20, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1868, the Crow Tribe ceded most of its territory in modern-day Montana and Wyoming to the United States.  In exchange, the United States promised that the Crow Tribe \"shall have the right to hunt on the unoccupied lands of the United States so long as game may be found thereon\" and \"peace subsists .\u00a0.\u00a0. on the borders of the hunting districts.\"  Treaty Between the United States of America and the Crow Tribe of Indians (1868 Treaty), Art. IV, May 7, 1868, 15 Stat. 650.  Petitioner Clayvin Herrera, a member of the Tribe, invoked this treaty right as a defense against charges of off-season hunting in Bighorn National Forest in Wyoming.  The Wyoming courts held that the treaty-protected hunting right expired when Wyoming became a State and, in any event, does not permit hunting in Bighorn National Forest because that land is not \"unoccupied.\"  We disagree.  The Crow Tribe's hunting right survived Wyoming's statehood, and the lands within Bighorn National Forest did not become categorically \"occupied\" when set aside as a national reserve.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Crow Tribe first inhabited modern-day Montana more than three centuries ago.  Montana v. United States, 450 U.\u00a0S. 544, 547 (1981).  The Tribe was nomadic, and its members hunted game for subsistence.  J. Medicine Crow, From the Heart of the Crow Country 4-5, 8 (1992).  The Bighorn Mountains of southern Montana and northern Wyoming \"historically made up both the geographic and the spiritual heart\" of the Tribe's territory.  Brief for Crow Tribe of Indians as Amicus Curiae 5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The westward migration of non-Indians began a new chapter in the Tribe's history.  In 1825, the Tribe signed a treaty of friendship with the United States.  Treaty With the Crow Tribe, Aug. 4, 1825, 7 Stat. 266.  In 1851, the Federal Government and tribal representatives entered into the Treaty of Fort Laramie, in which the Crow Tribe and other area tribes demarcated their respective lands.  Montana, 450 U.\u00a0S., at 547-548.  The Treaty of Fort Laramie specified that \"the tribes did not 'surrender the privilege of hunting, fishing, or passing over' any of the lands in dispute\" by entering the treaty.  Id., at 548.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After prospectors struck gold in Idaho and western Montana, a new wave of settlement prompted Congress to initiate further negotiations.  See F. Hoxie, Parading Through History 88-90 (1995).  Federal negotiators, including Commissioner of Indian Affairs Nathaniel G. Taylor, met with Crow Tribe leaders for this purpose in 1867.  Taylor acknowledged that \"settlements ha[d] been made\" upon the Crow Tribe's lands and that their \"game [was] being driven away.\"  Institute for the Development of Indian Law, Proceedings of the Great Peace Commission of 1867-1868, p.\u00a086 (1975) (hereinafter Proceedings).  He told the assembled tribal leaders that the United States wished to \"set apart a tract of [Crow Tribe] country as a home\" for the Tribe \"forever\" and to buy the rest of the Tribe's land.  Ibid.  Taylor emphasized that the Tribe would have \"the right to hunt upon\" the land it ceded to the Federal Government \"as long as the game lasts.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the convening, Tribe leaders stressed the vital importance of preserving their hunting traditions.  See id., at 88 (Black Foot: \"You speak of putting us on a reservation and teaching us to farm.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. That talk does not please us.  We want horses to run after the game, and guns and ammunition to kill it.  I would like to live just as I have been raised\"); id., at 89 (Wolf Bow: \"You want me to go on a reservation and farm.  I do not want to do that.  I was not raised so\").  Although Taylor responded that \"[t]he game w[ould] soon entirely disappear,\" he also reassured tribal leaders that they would \"still be free to hunt\" as they did at the time even after the reservation was created.  Id., at 90.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following spring, the Crow Tribe and the United States entered into the treaty at issue in this case: the 1868 Treaty.  15 Stat. 649.  Pursuant to the 1868 Treaty, the Crow Tribe ceded over 30 million acres of territory to the United States.  See Montana, 450 U.\u00a0S., at 547-548; Art.\u00a0II, 15 Stat. 650. The Tribe promised to make its \"permanent home\" a reservation of about 8 million acres in what is now Montana and to make \"no permanent settlement elsewhere.\"  Art. IV, 15 Stat. 650.  In exchange, the United States made certain promises to the Tribe, such as agreeing to construct buildings on the reservation, to provide the Tribe members with seeds and implements for farming, and to furnish the Tribe with clothing and other goods.  1868 Treaty, Arts.\u00a0III-XII, id., at 650-652.  Article IV of the 1868 Treaty memorialized Commissioner Taylor's pledge to preserve the Tribe's right to hunt off-reservation, stating:\n\"The Indians .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall have the right to hunt on the unoccupied lands of the United States so long as game may be found thereon, and as long as peace subsists among the whites and Indians on the borders of the hunting districts.\"  Id., at 650.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few months after the 1868 Treaty signing, Congress established the Wyoming Territory.  Congress provided that the establishment of this new Territory would not \"impair the rights of person or property now pertaining to the Indians in said Territory, so long as such rights shall remain unextinguished by treaty.\"  An Act to Provide a Temporary Government for the Territory of Wyoming (Wyoming Territory Act), July 25, 1868, ch. 235, 15 Stat. 178.  Around two decades later, the people of the new Territory adopted a constitution and requested admission to the United States.  In 1890, Congress formally admitted Wyoming \"into the Union on an equal footing with the original States in all respects,\" in an Act that did not mention Indian treaty rights.  An Act to Provide for the Admission of the State of Wyoming into the Union (Wyoming Statehood Act), July 10, 1890, ch. 664, 26 Stat. 222.  Finally, in 1897, President Grover Cleveland set apart an area in Wyoming as a public land reservation and declared the land \"reserved from entry or settlement.\"  Presidential Proclamation No. 30, 29 Stat. 909.  This area, made up of lands ceded by the Crow Tribe in 1868, became known as the Bighorn National Forest.  See App. 234; Crow Tribe of Indians v. Repsis, 73 F.\u00a03d 982, 985 (CA10 1995).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Clayvin Herrera is a member of the Crow Tribe who resides on the Crow Reservation in Montana.  In 2014, Herrera and other Tribe members pursued a group of elk past the boundary of the reservation and into the neighboring Bighorn National Forest in Wyoming.  They shot several bull elk and returned to Montana with the meat.  The State of Wyoming charged Herrera for taking elk off-season or without a state hunting license and with being an accessory to the same.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In state trial court, Herrera asserted that he had a protected right to hunt where and when he did pursuant to the 1868 Treaty.  The court disagreed and denied Herrera's pretrial motion to dismiss.  See Nos. CT-2015-2687, CT-2015-2688 (4th Jud. Dist. C.\u00a0C., Sheridan Cty., Wyo., Oct. 16, 2015), App. to Pet. for Cert. 37, 41.  Herrera unsuccessfully sought a stay of the trial court's order from the Wyoming Supreme Court and this Court.  He then went to trial, where he was not permitted to advance a treaty-based defense, and a jury convicted him on both counts.  The trial court imposed a suspended jail sentence, as well as a fine and a 3-year suspension of Herrera's hunting privileges.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Herrera appealed.  The central question facing the state appellate court was whether the Crow Tribe's off-reservation hunting right was still valid.  The U.\u00a0S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, reviewing the same treaty right in 1995 in Crow Tribe of Indians v. Repsis, had ruled that the right had expired when Wyoming became a State.  73 F.\u00a03d, at 992-993.  The Tenth Circuit's decision in Repsis relied heavily on a 19th-century decision of this Court, Ward v. Race Horse, 163 U.\u00a0S. 504, 516 (1896).  Herrera argued in the state court that this Court's subsequent decision in Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U.\u00a0S. 172 (1999), repudiated Race Horse, and he urged the Wyoming court to follow Mille Lacs instead of the Repsis and Race Horse decisions that preceded it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The state appellate court saw things differently.  Reasoning that Mille Lacs had not overruled Race Horse, the court held that the Crow Tribe's 1868 Treaty right expired upon Wyoming's statehood.  No. 2016-242 (4th Jud. Dist., Sheridan Cty., Wyo., Apr. 25, 2017), App. to Pet. for Cert. 31-34.  Alternatively, the court concluded that the Repsis Court's judgment merited issue-preclusive effect against Herrera because he is a member of the Crow Tribe, and the Tribe had litigated the Repsis suit on behalf of itself and its members.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 15-17, 31; App. 258.  Herrera, in other words, was not allowed to relitigate the validity of the treaty right in his own case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The court also held that, even if the 1868 Treaty right survived Wyoming's entry into the Union, it did not permit Herrera to hunt in Bighorn National Forest.  Again following Repsis, the court concluded that the treaty right applies only on \"unoccupied\" lands and that the national forest became categorically \"occupied\" when it was created.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 33-34; Repsis, 73 F.\u00a03d, at 994.  The state appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment and sentence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Wyoming Supreme Court denied a petition for review, and this Court granted certiorari.  585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).  For the reasons that follow, we now vacate and remand.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We first consider whether the Crow Tribe's hunting rights under the 1868 Treaty remain valid.  Relying on this Court's decision in Mille Lacs, Herrera and the United States contend that those rights did not expire when Wyoming became a State in 1890.  We agree.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wyoming argues that this Court's decision in Race Horse establishes that the Crow Tribe's 1868 Treaty right expired at statehood.  But this case is controlled by Mille Lacs, not Race Horse.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Race Horse concerned a hunting right guaranteed in a treaty with the Shoshone and Bannock Tribes.  The  Shoshone-Bannock Treaty and the 1868 Treaty with the Crow Tribe were signed in the same year and contain identical language reserving an off-reservation hunting right.  See Treaty Between the United States of America and the Eastern Band of Shoshonees [sic] and the Bannack [sic] Tribe of Indians (Shoshone-Bannock Treaty), July 3, 1868, 15 Stat. 674-675 (\"[T]hey shall have the right to hunt on the unoccupied lands of the United States so long as game may be found thereon, and so long as peace subsists among the whites and Indians on the borders of the hunting districts\").  The Race Horse Court concluded that Wyoming's admission to the United States extinguished the Shoshone-Bannock Treaty right.  163 U.\u00a0S., at 505, 514-515.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Race Horse relied on two lines of reasoning.  The first turned on the doctrine that new States are admitted to the Union on an \"equal footing\" with existing States.  Id., at 511-514 (citing, e.g., Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212 (1845)).  This doctrine led the Court to conclude that the Wyoming Statehood Act repealed the Shoshone and Bannock Tribes' hunting rights, because affording the Tribes a protected hunting right lasting after statehood would be \"irreconcilably in conflict\" with the power--\"vested in all other States of the Union\" and newly shared by Wyoming--\"to regulate the killing of game within their borders.\"  163 U.\u00a0S., at 509, 514.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the Court found no evidence in the Shoshone-Bannock Treaty itself that Congress intended the treaty right to continue in \"perpetuity.\"  Id., at 514-515.  To the contrary, the Court emphasized that Congress \"clearly contemplated the disappearance of the conditions\" specified in the treaty.  Id., at 509.  The Court decided that the rights at issue in the Shoshone-Bannock Treaty were \"essentially perishable\" and afforded the Tribes only a \"temporary and precarious\" privilege.  Id., at 515.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More than a century after Race Horse and four years after Repsis relied on that decision, however, Mille Lacs undercut both pillars of Race Horse's reasoning.  Mille Lacs considered an 1837 Treaty that guaranteed to several bands of Chippewa Indians the privilege of hunting, fishing, and gathering in ceded lands \"\u00a0'during the pleasure of the President.'\u00a0\"  526 U.\u00a0S., at 177 (quoting 1837 Treaty With the Chippewa, 7 Stat. 537).  In an opinion extensively discussing and distinguishing Race Horse, the Court decided that the treaty rights of the Chippewa bands survived after Minnesota was admitted to the Union.  526 U.\u00a0S., at 202-208.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mille Lacs approached the question before it in two stages.  The Court first asked whether the Act admitting Minnesota to the Union abrogated the treaty right of the Chippewa bands.  Next, the Court examined the Chippewa Treaty itself for evidence that the parties intended the treaty right to expire at statehood.  These inquires roughly track the two lines of analysis in Race Horse.  Despite these parallel analyses, however, the Mille Lacs Court refused Minnesota's invitation to rely on Race Horse, explaining that the case had \"been qualified by later decisions.\"  526 U.\u00a0S., at 203.  Although Mille Lacs stopped short of explicitly overruling Race Horse, it methodically repudiated that decision's logic.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To begin with, in addressing the effect of the Minnesota Statehood Act on the Chippewa Treaty right, the Mille Lacs Court entirely rejected the \"equal footing\" reasoning applied in Race Horse.  The earlier case concluded that the Act admitting Wyoming to the Union on an equal footing \"repeal[ed]\" the Shoshone-Bannock Treaty right because the treaty right was \"irreconcilable\" with state sovereignty over natural resources.  Race Horse, 163 U.\u00a0S., at 514.  But Mille Lacs explained that this conclusion \"rested on a false premise.\"  526 U.\u00a0S., at 204.  Later decisions showed that States can impose reasonable and nondiscriminatory regulations on an Indian tribe's treaty-based hunting, fishing, and gathering rights on state land when necessary for conservation.  Id., at 204-205 (citing Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U.\u00a0S. 658, 682 (1979); Antoine v. Washington, 420 U.\u00a0S. 194, 207-208 (1975); Puyallup Tribe v. Department of Game of Wash., 391 U.\u00a0S. 392, 398 (1968)).  \"[B]ecause treaty rights are reconcilable with state sovereignty over natural resources,\" the Mille Lacs Court concluded, there is no reason to find statehood itself sufficient \"to extinguish Indian treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on land within state boundaries.\"  526 U.\u00a0S., at 205.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In lieu of adopting the equal-footing analysis, the Court instead drew on numerous decisions issued since Race Horse to explain that Congress \"must clearly express\" any intent to abrogate Indian treaty rights.  526 U.\u00a0S., at 202 (citing United States v. Dion, 476 U.\u00a0S. 734, 738-740 (1986); Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U.\u00a0S., at 690; Menominee Tribe v. United States, 391 U.\u00a0S. 404, 413 (1968)).  The Court found no such \"\u00a0'clear evidence'\u00a0\" in the Act admitting Minnesota to the Union, which was \"silent\" with regard to Indian treaty rights.  526 U.\u00a0S., at 203.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Mille Lacs Court then turned to what it referred to as Race Horse's \"alternative holding\" that the rights in the Shoshone-Bannock Treaty \"were not intended to survive Wyoming's statehood.\"  526 U.\u00a0S., at 206.  The Court observed that Race Horse could be read to suggest that treaty rights only survive statehood if the rights are \"\u00a0'\u00a0\"of such a nature as to imply their perpetuity,\"\u00a0'\u00a0\" rather than \"\u00a0'temporary and precarious.'\u00a0\"  526 U.\u00a0S., at 206.  The Court rejected such an approach.  The Court found the \"\u00a0'temporary and precarious'\u00a0\" language \"too broad to be useful,\" given that almost any treaty rights--which Congress may unilaterally repudiate, see Dion, 476 U.\u00a0S., at 738--could be described in those terms.  526 U.\u00a0S., at 206-207.  Instead, Mille Lacs framed Race Horse as inquiring into whether the Senate \"intended the rights secured by the .\u00a0.\u00a0. Treaty to survive statehood.\"  526 U.\u00a0S., at 207.  Applying this test, Mille Lacs concluded that statehood did not extinguish the Chippewa bands' treaty rights.  The Chippewa Treaty itself defined the specific \"circumstances under which the rights would terminate,\" and there was no suggestion that statehood would satisfy those circumstances.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maintaining its focus on the treaty's language, Mille Lacs distinguished the Chippewa Treaty before it from the Shoshone-Bannock Treaty at issue in Race Horse.  Specifically, the Court noted that the Shoshone-Bannock Treaty, unlike the Chippewa Treaty, \"tie[d] the duration of the rights to the occurrence of some clearly contemplated event[s]\"--i.e., to whenever the hunting grounds would cease to \"remai[n] unoccupied and owned by the United States.\"  526 U.\u00a0S., at 207. In drawing that distinction, however, the Court took care to emphasize that the treaty termination analysis turns on the events enumerated in the \"Treaty itself.\"  Ibid.  Insofar as the Race Horse Court determined that the Shoshone-Bannock Treaty was \"impliedly repealed,\" Mille Lacs disavowed that earlier holding.  526 U.\u00a0S., at 207.  \"Treaty rights,\" the Court clarified, \"are not impliedly terminated upon statehood.\"  Ibid.  The Court further explained that \"[t]he Race Horse Court's decision to the contrary\"--that Wyoming's statehood did imply repeal of Indian treaty rights--\"was informed by\" that Court's erroneous conclusion \"that the Indian treaty rights were inconsistent with state sovereignty over natural resources.\"  Id., at 207-208.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, Mille Lacs upended both lines of reasoning in Race Horse.  The case established that the crucial inquiry for treaty termination analysis is whether Congress has expressly abrogated an Indian treaty right or whether a termination point identified in the treaty itself has been satisfied.  Statehood is irrelevant to this analysis unless a statehood Act otherwise demonstrates Congress' clear intent to abrogate a treaty, or statehood appears as a termination point in the treaty.  See 526 U.\u00a0S., at 207.  \"[T]here is nothing inherent in the nature of reserved treaty rights to suggest that they can be extinguished by implication at statehood.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even Wyoming concedes that the Court has rejected the equal-footing reasoning in Race Horse, Brief for Respondent 26, but the State contends that Mille Lacs reaffirmed the alternative holding in Race Horse that the Shoshone-Bannock Treaty right (and thus the identically phrased right in the 1868 Treaty with the Crow Tribe) was intended to end at statehood.  We are unpersuaded.  As explained above, although the decision in Mille Lacs did not explicitly say that it was overruling the alternative ground in Race Horse, it is impossible to harmonize Mille Lacs' analysis with the Court's prior reasoning in Race Horse.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We thus formalize what is evident in Mille Lacs itself.  While Race Horse \"was not expressly overruled\" in Mille Lacs, \"it must be regarded as retaining no vitality\" after that decision.  Limbach v. Hooven & Allison Co., 466 U.\u00a0S. 353, 361 (1984).  To avoid any future confusion, we make clear today that Race Horse is repudiated to the extent it held that treaty rights can be impliedly extinguished at statehood.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because this Court's intervening decision in Mille Lacs repudiated the reasoning on which the Tenth Circuit relied in Repsis, Repsis does not preclude Herrera from arguing that the 1868 Treaty right survived Wyoming's statehood.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the doctrine of issue preclusion, \"a prior judgment .\u00a0.\u00a0. foreclos[es] successive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment.\"  New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.\u00a0S. 742, 748-749 (2001).  Even when the elements of issue preclusion are met, however, an exception may be warranted if there has been an intervening \"\u00a0'change in [the] applicable legal context.'\u00a0\"  Bobby v. Bies, 556 U.\u00a0S. 825, 834 (2009) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a728, Comment c (1980)); see Limbach, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 363 (refusing to find a party bound by \"an early decision based upon a now repudiated legal doctrine\"); see also Montana v. United States, 440 U.\u00a0S. 147, 155 (1979) (asking \"whether controlling facts or legal principles ha[d] changed significantly\" since a judgment before giving it preclusive effect); id., at 157-158 (explaining that a prior judgment was conclusive \"[a]bsent significant changes in controlling facts or legal principles\" since the judgment); Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U.\u00a0S. 591, 599 (1948) (issue preclusion \"is designed to prevent repetitious lawsuits over matters which have once been decided and which have remained substantially static, factually and legally\").  The change-in-law exception recognizes that applying issue preclusion in changed circumstances may not \"advance the equitable administration of the law.\"  Bobby, 556 U.\u00a0S., at 836-837.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We conclude that a change in law justifies an exception to preclusion in this case.  There is no question that the Tenth Circuit in Repsis relied on this Court's binding decision in Race Horse to conclude that the 1868 Treaty right terminated upon Wyoming's statehood.  See 73 F.\u00a03d, at 994.  When the Tenth Circuit reached its decision in Repsis, it had no authority to disregard this Court's holding in Race Horse and no ability to predict the analysis this Court would adopt in Mille Lacs.  Mille Lacs repudiated Race Horse's reasoning.  Although we recognize that it may be difficult at the margins to discern whether a particular legal shift warrants an exception to issue preclusion, this is not a marginal case.  At a minimum, a repudiated decision does not retain preclusive force.  See Limbach, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 363.3\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We now consider whether, applying Mille Lacs, Wyoming's admission to the Union abrogated the Crow Tribe's off-reservation treaty hunting right.  It did not.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Wyoming Statehood Act does not show that Congress intended to end the 1868 Treaty hunting right.  If Congress seeks to abrogate treaty rights, \"it must clearly express its intent to do so.\"  Mille Lacs, 526 U.\u00a0S., at 202.  \"There must be 'clear evidence that Congress actually considered the conflict between its intended action on the one hand and Indian treaty rights on the other, and chose to resolve that conflict by abrogating the treaty.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 202-203 (quoting Dion, 476 U.\u00a0S., at 740); see Menominee Tribe, 391 U.\u00a0S., at 412.  Like the Act discussed in Mille Lacs, the Wyoming Statehood Act \"makes no mention of Indian treaty rights\" and \"provides no clue that Congress considered the reserved rights of the [Crow Tribe] and decided to abrogate those rights when it passed the Act.\"  Cf. Mille Lacs, 526 U.\u00a0S., at 203; see Wyoming Statehood Act, 26 Stat. 222.  There simply is no evidence that Congress intended to abrogate the 1868 Treaty right through the Wyoming Statehood Act, much less the \"\u00a0'clear evidence'\u00a0\" this Court's precedent requires.  Mille Lacs, 526 U.\u00a0S., at 203.4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor is there any evidence in the treaty itself that Congress intended the hunting right to expire at statehood, or that the Crow Tribe would have understood it to do so.  A treaty is \"essentially a contract between two sovereign nations.\"  Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U.\u00a0S., at 675.  Indian treaties \"must be interpreted in light of the parties' intentions, with any ambiguities resolved in favor of the Indians,\" Mille Lacs, 526 U.\u00a0S., at 206, and the words of a treaty must be construed \"\u00a0'in the sense in which they would naturally be understood by the Indians,'\u00a0\" Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U.\u00a0S., at 676.  If a treaty \"itself defines the circumstances under which the rights would terminate,\" it is to those circumstances that the Court must look to determine if the right ends at statehood.  Mille Lacs, 526 U.\u00a0S., at 207.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as in Mille Lacs, there is no suggestion in the text of the 1868 Treaty with the Crow Tribe that the parties intended the hunting right to expire at statehood.  The treaty identifies four situations that would terminate the right: (1) the lands are no longer \"unoccupied\"; (2) the lands no longer belong to the United States; (3) game can no longer \"be found thereon\"; and (4) the Tribe and non-Indians are no longer at \"peace .\u00a0.\u00a0. on the borders of the hunting districts.\"  Art. IV, 15 Stat. 650.  Wyoming's statehood does not appear in this list.  Nor is there any hint in the treaty that any of these conditions would necessarily be satisfied at statehood.  See Mille Lacs, 526 U.\u00a0S., at 207.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The historical record likewise does not support the State's position.  See Choctaw Nation v. United States, 318 U.\u00a0S. 423, 431-432 (1943) (explaining that courts \"may look beyond the written words to the history of the treaty, the negotiations, and the practical construction adopted by the parties\" to determine a treaty's meaning).  Crow Tribe leaders emphasized the importance of the hunting right in the 1867 negotiations, see, e.g., Proceedings 88, and Commissioner Taylor assured them that the Tribe would have \"the right to hunt upon [the ceded land] as long as the game lasts,\" id., at 86.  Yet despite the apparent importance of the hunting right to the negotiations, Wyoming points to no evidence that federal negotiators ever proposed that the right would end at statehood.  This silence is especially telling because five States encompassing lands west of the Mississippi River--Nebraska, Nevada, Kansas, Oregon, and Minnesota--had been admitted to the Union in just the preceding decade.  See ch. 36, 14 Stat. 391 (Nebraska, Feb. 9, 1867); Presidential Proclamation No. 22, 13 Stat. 749 (Nevada, Oct. 31, 1864); ch. 20, 12 Stat. 126 (Kansas, Jan. 29, 1861); ch. 33, 11 Stat. 383 (Oregon, Feb. 14, 1859); ch. 31, 11 Stat. 285 (Minnesota, May 11, 1858).  Federal negotiators had every reason to bring up statehood if they intended it to extinguish the Tribe's hunting rights.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the face of this evidence, Wyoming nevertheless contends that the 1868 Treaty expired at statehood pursuant to the Mille Lacs analysis.  Wyoming does not argue that the legal act of Wyoming's statehood abrogated the treaty right, and it cannot contend that statehood is explicitly identified as a treaty expiration point.  Instead, Wyoming draws on historical sources to assert that statehood, as a practical matter, marked the arrival of \"civilization\" in the Wyoming Territory and thus rendered all the lands in the State occupied.  Brief for Respondent 48.  This claim cannot be squared with Mille Lacs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wyoming's arguments boil down to an attempt to read the treaty impliedly to terminate at statehood, precisely as Mille Lacs forbids.  The State sets out a potpourri of evidence that it claims shows statehood in 1890 effectively coincided with the disappearance of the wild frontier: for instance, that the buffalo were extinct by the mid-1870s; that by 1880, Indian Department regulations instructed Indian agents to confine tribal members \"\u00a0'wholly within the limits of their respective reservations'\u00a0\"; and that the Crow Tribe stopped hunting off-reservation altogether in 1886.  Brief for Respondent 47 (quoting \u00a7237 Instructions to Indian Agents (1880), as published in Regulations of the Indian Dept. \u00a7492 (1884)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Herrera contradicts this account, see Reply Brief for Petitioner 5, n.\u00a03, and the historical record is by no means clear.  For instance, game appears to have persisted for longer than Wyoming suggests.  See Dept. of Interior, Ann. Rep. of the Comm'r of Indian Affairs 495 (1873) (Black Foot: \"On the other side of the river below, there are plenty of buffalo; on the mountains are plenty of elk and black-tail deer; and white-tail deer are plenty at the foot of the mountain\").  As for the Indian Department Regulations, there are reports that a group of Crow Tribe members \"regularly hunted along the Little Bighorn River\" even after the regulation the State cites was in effect.  Hoxie, Parading Through History, at 26.  In 1889, the Office of Indian Affairs wrote to U. S. Indian Agents in the Northwest that \"[f]requent complaints have been made to this Department that Indians are in the habit of leaving their reservations for the purpose of hunting.\"  28 Cong. Rec. 6231 (1896).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even assuming that Wyoming presents an accurate historical picture, the State's mode of analysis is severely flawed.  By using statehood as a proxy for occupation, Wyoming subverts this Court's clear instruction that treaty-protected rights \"are not impliedly terminated upon statehood.\"  Mille Lacs, 526 U.\u00a0S., at 207.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, to the extent that Wyoming seeks to rely on this same evidence to establish that all land in Wyoming was functionally \"occupied\" by 1890, its arguments fall outside the question presented and are unpersuasive in any event.  As explained below, the Crow Tribe would have understood occupation to denote some form of residence or settlement.  See infra, at 19-20.  Furthermore, Wyoming cannot rely on Race Horse to equate occupation with statehood, because that case's reasoning rested on the flawed belief that statehood could not coexist with a continuing treaty right.  See Race Horse, 163 U.\u00a0S., at 514; Mille Lacs, 526 U.\u00a0S., at 207-208.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying Mille Lacs, this is not a hard case.  The Wyoming Statehood Act did not abrogate the Crow Tribe's hunting right, nor did the 1868 Treaty expire of its own accord at that time.  The treaty itself defines the circumstances in which the right will expire.  Statehood is not one of them.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We turn next to the question whether the 1868 Treaty right, even if still valid after Wyoming's statehood, does not protect hunting in Bighorn National Forest because the forest lands are \"occupied.\"  We agree with Herrera and the United States that Bighorn National Forest did not become categorically \"occupied\" within the meaning of the 1868 Treaty when the national forest was created.5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Treaty analysis begins with the text, and treaty terms are construed as \"\u00a0'they would naturally be understood by the Indians.'\u00a0\"  Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U.\u00a0S., at 676.  Here it is clear that the Crow Tribe would have understood the word \"unoccupied\" to denote an area free of residence or settlement by non-Indians.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That interpretation follows first and foremost from several cues in the treaty's text.  For example, Article IV of the 1868 Treaty made the hunting right contingent on peace \"among the whites and Indians on the borders of the hunting districts,\" thus contrasting the unoccupied hunting districts with areas of white settlement.  15 Stat. 650.  The treaty elsewhere used the word \"occupation\" to refer to the Tribe's residence inside the reservation boundaries, and referred to the Tribe members as \"settlers\" on the new reservation.  Arts. II, VI, id., at 650-651.  The treaty also juxtaposed occupation and settlement by stating that the Tribe was to make \"no permanent settlement\" other than on the new reservation, but could hunt on the \"unoccupied lands\" of the United States.  Art. IV, id., at 650.  Contemporaneous definitions further support a link between occupation and settlement.  See W. Anderson, A Dictionary of Law 725 (1889) (defining \"occupy\" as \"[t]o hold in possession; to hold or keep for use\" and noting that the word \"[i]mplies actual use, possession or cultivation by a particular person\"); id., at 944 (defining \"settle\" as \"[t]o establish one's self upon; to occupy, reside upon\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Historical evidence confirms this reading of the word \"unoccupied.\"  At the treaty negotiations, Commissioner Taylor commented that \"settlements ha[d] been made upon [Crow Tribe] lands\" and that \"white people [were] rapidly increasing and .\u00a0.\u00a0. occupying all the valuable lands.\"  Proceedings 86.  It was against this backdrop of white settlement that the United States proposed to buy \"the right to use and settle\" the ceded lands, retaining for the Tribe the right to hunt.  Ibid. A few years after the 1868 Treaty signing, a leader of the Board of Indian Commissioners confirmed the connection between occupation and settlement, explaining that the 1868 Treaty permitted the Crow Tribe to hunt in an area \"as long as there are any buffalo, and as long as the white men are not [in that area] with farms.\"  Dept. of Interior, Ann. Rep. of the Comm'r of Indian Affairs 500.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the tie between the term \"unoccupied\" and a lack of non-Indian settlement, it is clear that President Cleveland's proclamation creating Bighorn National Forest did not \"occupy\" that area within the treaty's meaning.  To the contrary, the President \"reserved\" the lands \"from entry or settlement.\"  Presidential Proclamation No. 30, 29 Stat. 909.  The proclamation gave \"[w]arning .\u00a0.\u00a0. to all persons not to enter or make settlement upon the tract of land reserved by th[e] proclamation.\"  Id., at 910.  If anything, this reservation made Bighorn National Forest more hospitable, not less, to the Crow Tribe's exercise of the 1868 Treaty right.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wyoming's counterarguments are unavailing.  The State first asserts that the forest became occupied through the Federal Government's \"exercise of dominion and control\" over the forest territory, including federal regulation of those lands.  Brief for Respondent 56-60.  But as explained, the treaty's text and the historical record suggest that the phrase \"unoccupied lands\" had a specific meaning to the Crow Tribe: lack of settlement.  The proclamation of a forest reserve withdrawing land from settlement would not categorically transform the territory into an area resided on or settled by non-Indians; quite the opposite.  Nor would the restrictions on hunting in national forests that Wyoming cites.  See Appropriations Act of 1899, ch. 424, 30 Stat. 1095; 36 CFR \u00a7\u00a7241.2, 241.3 (Supp. 1941); \u00a7261.10(d)(1) (2018).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wyoming also claims that exploitative mining and logging of the forest lands prior to 1897 would have caused the Crow Tribe to view the Bighorn Mountains as occupied.  But the presence of mining and logging operations did not amount to settlement of the sort that the Tribe would have understood as rendering the forest occupied.  In fact, the historical source on which Wyoming primarily relies indicates that there was \"very little\" settlement of Bighorn National Forest around the time the forest was created.  Dept. of Interior, Nineteenth Ann. Rep. of the U.\u00a0S. Geological Survey 167 (1898).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Considering the terms of the 1868 Treaty as they would have been understood by the Crow Tribe, we conclude that the creation of Bighorn National Forest did not remove the forest lands, in their entirety, from the scope of the treaty.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, we note two ways in which our decision is limited.  First, we hold that Bighorn National Forest is not categorically occupied, not that all areas within the forest are unoccupied.  On remand, the State may argue that the specific site where Herrera hunted elk was used in such a way that it was \"occupied\" within the meaning of the 1868 Treaty.  See State v. Cutler, 109 Idaho 448, 451, 708 P.\u00a02d 853, 856 (1985) (stating that the Federal Government may not be foreclosed from using land in such a way that the Indians would have considered it occupied).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the state trial court decided that Wyoming could regulate the exercise of the 1868 Treaty right \"in  the interest of conservation.\"  Nos. CT-2015-2687,  CT-2015-2688, App. to Pet. for Cert. 39-41; see Antoine, 420 U.\u00a0S., at 207.  The appellate court did not reach this issue.  No. 2016-242, App. to Pet. for Cert. 14, n.\u00a03.  On remand, the State may press its arguments as to why the application of state conservation regulations to Crow Tribe members exercising the 1868 Treaty right is necessary for conservation.  We do not pass on the viability of those arguments today.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Wyoming District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Sheridan County, is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nAlito, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-532\nCLAYVIN HERRERA, PETITIONER v. WYOMING\non writ of certiorari to the district court of wyoming, sheridan county\n[May 20, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Kavanaugh join, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's opinion in this case takes a puzzling course.  The Court holds that members of the Crow Tribe retain a virtually unqualified right under the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Crow Tribe of Indians (1868 Treaty) to hunt on land that is now part of the Bighorn National Forest.  This interpretation of the treaty is debatable and is plainly contrary to the decision in Ward v. Race Horse, 163 U.\u00a0S. 504 (1896), which construed identical language in a closely related treaty.  But even if the Court's interpretation of the treaty is correct, its decision will have no effect if the members of the Crow Tribe are bound under the doctrine of issue preclusion by the judgment in Crow Tribe of Indians v. Repsis, 73 F.\u00a03d 982, 992-993 (CA10 1995) (holding that the hunting right conferred by that treaty is no longer in force).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That judgment was based on two independent grounds, and the Court deals with only one of them.  The Court holds that the first ground no longer provides an adequate reason to give the judgment preclusive effect due to an intervening change in the legal context.  But the Court sidesteps the second ground and thus leaves it up to the state courts to decide whether the Repsis judgment continues to have binding effect.  If it is still binding--and I think it is--then no member of the Tribe will be able to assert the hunting right that the Court addresses.  Thus, the Court's decision to plow ahead on the treaty-interpretation issue is hard to understand, and its discourse on that issue is likely, in the end, to be so much wasted ink.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court notes, the Crow Indians eventually settled in what is now Montana, where they subsequently came into contact with early white explorers and trappers.  F. Hoxie, The Crow 26-28, 33 (1989).  In an effort to promote peace between Indians and white settlers and to mitigate conflicts between different tribes, the United States negotiated treaties that marked out a territory for each tribe to use as a hunting district.  See 2 C. Kappler, Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties 594 (2d ed. 1904) (Kappler).  The Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1851 (1851 Treaty), 11 Stat. 749,  created such a hunting district for the Crow.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As white settlement increased, the United States entered into a series of treaties establishing reservations for the Crow and neighboring tribes, and the 1868 Treaty was one such treaty.  15 Stat. 649; Kappler 1008.  It set out an 8-million-acre reservation for the Crow Tribe but required the Tribe to cede ownership of all land outside this reservation, including 30 million acres that lay within the hunting district defined by the 1851 Treaty.  Under this treaty, however, the Crow kept certain enumerated rights with respect to the use of those lands, and among these was \"the right to hunt on the unoccupied lands of the United States so long as game may be found thereon, and as long as peace subsists among the whites and Indians on the borders of the hunting districts.\"  1868 Treaty, Art. IV, 15 Stat. 650.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shortly after the signing of the 1868 Treaty, Congress created the Wyoming Territory, which was adjacent to and immediately south of the Crow Tribe's reservation.  The Act creating the Territory provided that \"nothing in this act shall be construed to impair the rights of person or property now pertaining to the Indians in said Territory, so long as such rights shall remain unextinguished by treaty between the United States and such Indians.\"  Act of July 25, 1868, ch. 235, 15 Stat. 178.  Twenty-two years later, Congress admitted Wyoming as a State \"on an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatever.\"  Act of July 10, 1890, ch. 664, 26 Stat. 222.  The following year, Congress passed an Act empowering the President to \"set apart and reserve\" tracts of public lands owned by the United States as forest reservations.  Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 561, \u00a724, 26 Stat. 1103.  Exercising that authority, President Cleveland designated some lands in Wyoming that remained under federal ownership as a forest reservation.  Presidential Proclamation No. 30, 29 Stat. 909.  Today, those lands make up the Bighorn National Forest.  Bighorn abuts the Crow Reservation along the border between Wyoming and Montana and includes land that was previously part of the Crow Tribe's hunting district.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These enactments did not end legal conflicts between the white settlers and Indians.  Almost immediately after Wyoming's admission to the Union, this Court had to determine the extent of the State's regulatory power in light of a tribe's reserved hunting rights.  A member of the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes named Race Horse had been arrested by Wyoming officials for taking elk in violation of state hunting laws.  Race Horse, supra, at 506.  The  Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, like the Crow, had accepted a reservation while retaining the right to hunt in the lands previously within their hunting district.  Their treaty reserves the same right, using the same language, as the Crow Tribe's treaty.1  Race Horse argued that he had the right to hunt at the spot of his alleged offense, as the nearest settlement lay more than 60-miles distant, making the land where he was hunting \"unoccupied lands of the United States.\"  In\u00a0re Race Horse, 70 F. 598, 599-600 (Wyo. 1895).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court rejected Race Horse's argument, holding that the admission of Wyoming to the Union terminated the hunting right.  163 U.\u00a0S., at 514.  Although the opinion of the Court is not a model of clarity, this conclusion appears to rest on two grounds.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Court held that Wyoming's admission necessarily ended the Tribe's hunting right because otherwise the State would lack the power, possessed by every other State, \"to regulate the killing of game within [its] borders.\"  Ibid.  Limiting Wyoming's power in this way, the Court reasoned, would contravene the equal-footing doctrine, which dictates that all States enter the Union with the full panoply of powers enjoyed by the original 13 States at the adoption of the Constitution.  Ibid.  Under this rationale, the Act of Congress admitting Wyoming could not have preserved the hunting right even if that had been Congress's wish.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After providing this basis for its holding, however, the Court quickly turned to a second ground, namely, that even if Congress could have limited Wyoming's authority in this way, it had not attempted to do so.  Id., at 515.  The Court thought that Congress's intention not to impose such a restriction on the State was \"conveyed by the express terms of the act of admission,\" but the Court did not identify the terms to which it was referring.  Ibid.  It did, however, see support for its decision in the nature of the hunting right reserved under the treaty.  This right, the Court observed, was not \"of such a nature as to imply [its] perpetuity\" but was instead \"temporary and precarious,\" since it depended on the continuation of several conditions, including at least one condition wholly within the control of the Government--continued federal ownership of the land.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Race Horse did not mark a final resolution of the conflict between Wyoming's regulatory power and tribal hunting rights.  Nearly a century later, Thomas Ten Bear, a member of the Crow Tribe, crossed into Wyoming to hunt elk in the Bighorn National Forest, just as Herrera did in this case.  Wyoming game officials cited Ten Bear, and he was ultimately convicted of hunting elk without the requisite license.2  Ten Bear, like Race Horse before him, filed a lawsuit in federal court disputing Wyoming's authority to regulate hunting by members of his Tribe.  Crow Tribe of Indians v. Repsis, 866 F.\u00a0Supp. 520, 521 (Wyo. 1994).  Joined by the Crow Tribe, he argued that the 1868 Treaty--the same treaty at issue here--gave him the right to  take elk in the national forest.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court found that challenge indistinguishable from the one addressed in Race Horse.  The District Court noted that Race Horse had pointed to \"identical treaty language\" and had \"advanced the identical contention now made by\" Ten Bear and the Tribe.  Repsis, 866 F.\u00a0Supp., at 522.  Because Race Horse \"remain[ed] controlling,\" the District Court granted summary judgment to the State.  866 F.\u00a0Supp., at 524.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tenth Circuit affirmed that judgment on two independent grounds.  First, the Tenth Circuit agreed with the District Court that, under Race Horse, \"[t]he Tribe's right to hunt reserved in the Treaty with the Crows, 1868, was repealed by the act admitting Wyoming into the Union.\"  Crow Tribe of Indians v. Repsis, 73 F.\u00a03d 982, 992 (1995).  Second, as an independent alternative ground for affirmance, the Tenth Circuit held that the Tribe's hunting right had expired because \"the treaty reserved an off-reservation hunting right on 'unoccupied' lands and the lands of the Big Horn National Forest are 'occupied.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 993.  The Tenth Circuit reasoned that \"unoccupied\" land within the meaning of the treaty meant land that was open for commercial or residential use, and since the creation of the national forest precluded those activities, it followed that the land was no longer \"unoccupied\" in the relevant sense.  Ibid.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The events giving rise to the present case are essentially the same as those in Race Horse and Repsis.  During the winter of 2013, Herrera, who was an officer in the Crow Tribe's fish and game department, contacted Wyoming game officials to offer assistance investigating a number of poaching incidents along the border between Bighorn and the Crow Reservation.3  After a lengthy discussion in which Herrera asked detailed questions about the State's investigative capabilities, the Wyoming officials became suspicious of Herrera's motives.  The officials conducted a web search for Herrera's name and found photographs posted on trophy-hunting and social media websites that showed him posing with bull elk.  The officers recognized from the scenery in the pictures that the elk had been killed in Bighorn and were able to locate the sites where the pictures had been taken.  At those sites, about a mile south of the fence running along the Bighorn National Forest boundary, state officials discovered elk carcasses.  The heads had been taken from the carcasses but much of the meat was abandoned in the field.  State officials confronted Herrera, who confessed to the shootings and turned over the heads that he and his companions had taken as trophies.  The Wyoming officials cited Herrera for hunting out of season.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Herrera moved to dismiss the citations, arguing that he had a treaty right to hunt in Bighorn.  The trial court rejected this argument, concluding that it was foreclosed by the Tenth Circuit's analysis in Repsis, and the jury found Herrera guilty.  On appeal, Herrera continued to argue that he had a treaty right to hunt in Bighorn.  The appellate court held that the judgment in Repsis precluded him from asserting a treaty hunting right, and it also  held, in the alternative, that Herrera's treaty rights did not allow him to hunt in Bighorn.  This Court granted certiorari.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In seeking review in this Court, Herrera framed this case as implicating only a question of treaty interpretation.  But unless the state court was wrong in holding that Herrera is bound by the judgment in Repsis, there is no reason to reach the treaty-interpretation question.  For this reason, I would begin with the question of issue preclusion, and because I believe that Herrera is bound by the adverse decision on that issue in Repsis, I would not reach the treaty-interpretation issue.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is \"a fundamental precept of common-law adjudication\" that \"an issue once determined by a competent court is conclusive.\"  Arizona v. California, 460 U.\u00a0S. 605, 619 (1983).  \"The idea is straightforward: Once a court has decided an issue, it is forever settled as between the parties, thereby protecting against the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits, conserving judicial resources, and fostering reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent verdicts.\"  B&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries, Inc., 575 U.\u00a0S. 138, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation marks, citation, and alterations omitted).  Succinctly put, \"a losing litigant deserves no rematch after a defeat fairly suffered.\"  Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U.\u00a0S. 104, 107 (1991).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under federal issue-preclusion principles,4 \"once an issue is actually and necessarily determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, that determination is conclusive in subsequent suits based on a different cause of action involving a party to the prior litigation.\"  Montana v. United States, 440 U.\u00a0S. 147, 153 (1979).  That standard for issue preclusion is met here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Repsis, the central issue--and the question on which the Crow Tribe sought a declaratory judgment--was whether members of the Tribe \"have an unrestricted right to hunt and fish on Big Horn National Forest lands.\"  866 F.\u00a0Supp., at 521.  The Tenth Circuit's judgment settled that question by holding that \"the Tribe and its members are subject to the game laws of Wyoming.\"  73 F.\u00a03d, at 994.  In this case, Herrera asserts the same hunting right that was actually litigated and decided against his Tribe in Repsis.  He does not suggest that either the Federal District Court or the Tenth Circuit lacked jurisdiction to decide Repsis.  And, because Herrera's asserted right is based on his membership in the Tribe, a judgment binding on the Tribe is also binding on him.  As a result, the Wyoming appellate court held that Repsis bound Herrera and precluded him from asserting a treaty-rights defense.  That holding was correct.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority concludes otherwise based on an exception to issue preclusion that applies when there has been an intervening \"change in the applicable legal context.\"  Ante, at 12 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).  Specifically, the majority reasons that the Repsis judgment was based on Race Horse and that our subsequent decision in Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U.\u00a0S. 172 (1999), represents a change in the applicable law that is sufficient to abrogate the Repsis judgment's preclusive effect.  There is support in the Restatement (Second) of Judgments for the general proposition that a change in law may alter a judgment's preclusive effect, \u00a728, Comment c, p. 276 (1980), and in a prior case, Bobby v. Bies, 556 U.\u00a0S. 825, 834 (2009), we invoked that provision.  But we have never actually held that a prior judgment lacked preclusive effect on this ground.  Nor have we ever defined how much the relevant \"legal context\" must change in order for the exception to apply.  If the exception is applied too aggressively, it could dangerously undermine the important interests served by issue preclusion.  So caution is in order in relying on that exception here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority thinks that the exception applies because Mille Lacs effectively overruled Race Horse, even though it did not say that in so many words.  But that is a questionable interpretation.  The fact of the matter is that the Mille Lacs majority held back from actually overruling Race Horse, even though the dissent claimed that it had effectively done so.  See Mille Lacs, 526 U.\u00a0S., at 207 (applying the \"Race Horse inquiry\" but factually distinguishing that case from the facts present in Mille Lacs); id., at 219 (Rehnquist, C.\u00a0J., dissenting) (noting the Court's \"apparent overruling sub silentio\" of Race Horse).  And while the opinion of the Court repudiated one of the two grounds that the Race Horse Court gave for its decision (the equal-footing doctrine), it is by no means clear that Mille Lacs also rejected the second ground (the conclusion that the terms of the Act admitting Wyoming to the Union manifested a congressional intent not to burden the State with the right created by the 1868 Treaty).  With respect to this latter ground, the Mille Lacs Court characterized the proper inquiry as follows: \"whether Congress (more precisely, because this is a treaty, the Senate) intended the rights secured by the 1837 Treaty to survive statehood.\"  526 U.\u00a0S., at 207.  And the Court then went on to analyze the terms of the particular treaty at issue in that case and to contrast those terms with those of the treaty in Race Horse.  Mille Lacs, supra, at 207.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On this reading, it appears that Mille Lacs did not reject the second ground for the decision in Race Horse but simply found it inapplicable to the facts of the case at hand.  I do not claim that this reading of Mille Lacs is indisputable, but it is certainly reasonable, and if it is correct, Mille Lacs did not change the legal context as much as the majority suggests.  It knocked out some of Race Horse's reasoning but did not effectively overrule the decision.  Is that enough to eliminate the preclusive effect of the first ground for the Repsis judgment?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority cites no authority holding that a decision like Mille Lacs is sufficient to deprive a prior judgment of its issue-preclusive effect.  Certainly, Bies, supra, upon which the majority relies, is not such authority.  In that case, Bies had been convicted of murder and sentenced to death at a time when what was then termed \"mental retardation\" did not render a defendant ineligible for a death sentence but was treated as simply a mitigating factor to be taken into account in weighing whether such a sentence should be imposed.  When Bies contested his death sentence on appeal, the state appellate court observed that he suffered from a mild form of intellectual disability, but it nevertheless affirmed his sentence.  Years later, in Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.\u00a0S. 304 (2002), this Court ruled that an intellectually disabled individual cannot be executed, and the Sixth Circuit then held that the state court's prior statements about Bies's condition barred his execution under issue-preclusion principles.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court reversed, and its primary reason for doing so has no relation to the question presented here.  We found that issue preclusion was not available to Bies because he had not prevailed in the first action; despite the state court's recognition of mild intellectual disability as a mitigating factor, it had affirmed his sentence.  As we put it, \"[i]ssue preclusion .\u00a0.\u00a0. does not transform final judgment losers .\u00a0.\u00a0. into partially prevailing parties.\" Bies, 556 U.\u00a0S., at 829; see also id., at 835.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only after providing this dispositive reason for rejecting the Sixth Circuit's invocation of issue preclusion did we go on to cite the Restatement's discussion of the change-in-law exception.  And we then quickly noted that the issue addressed by the state appellate courts prior to Atkins (\"[m]ental retardation as a mitigator\") was not even the same issue as the issue later addressed after Atkins.  Bies, supra, at 836 (the two \"are discrete legal issues\").  So Bies is very far afield.5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the majority in the present case believes that Mille Lacs unquestionably constitutes a sufficient change in the legal context, see ante, at 13, there is a respectable argument on the other side.  I would not decide that question because Herrera and other members of the Crow Tribe are bound by the judgment in Repsis even if the change-in-legal-context exception applies.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That is so because the Repsis judgment was based on a second, independently sufficient ground that has nothing to do with Race Horse, namely, that the Bighorn National Forest is not \"unoccupied.\"  Herrera and the United States, appearing as an amicus in his support, try to escape the effect of this alternative ground based on other exceptions to the general rule of issue preclusion.  But accepting any of those exceptions would work a substantial change in established principles, and it is fortunate that the majority has not taken that route.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, the track that the majority has chosen is no solution because today's decision will not prevent the Wyoming courts on remand in this case or in future cases presenting the same issue from holding that the Repsis judgment binds all members of the Crow Tribe who hunt within the Bighorn National Forest.  And for the reasons I will explain, such a holding would be correct.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Attempting to justify its approach, the majority claims that the decision below gave preclusive effect to only the first ground adopted by the Tenth Circuit in Repsis--that is, the ground that relied on Race Horse.  Ante, at 18, n.\u00a05.  But nowhere in the decision below can any such limitation be found.  The Wyoming appellate court discussed the second ground for the Repsis judgment, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 22 (\"[T]he creation of the Big Horn National Forest resulted in the 'occupation' of the land, extinguishing the off-reservation hunting right\"), and it concluded that the judgment in Repsis, not just one of the grounds for that judgment, \"preclude[s] Herrera from attempting to relitigate the validity of the off-reservation hunting right that was previously held to be invalid,\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 31.6\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Herrera takes a different approach in attempting to circumvent the effect of the alternative Repsis ground.  When a judgment rests on two independently sufficient grounds, he contends, neither ground should be regarded as having an issue-preclusive effect.  This argument raises an important question that this Court has never decided and one on which the First and Second Restatements of Judgments take differing views.  According to the First Restatement, a judgment based on alternative grounds \"is determinative on both grounds, although either alone would have been sufficient to support the judgment.\"  Restatement of Judgments \u00a768, Comment n (1942).  Other authorities agree.  See 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a74421, p. 613 (3d ed. 2016) (noting \"substantial support in federal decisions\" for this approach).7  But the Second Restatement reversed this view, recommending that a judgment based on the determination of two independent issues \"is not conclusive with respect to either issue standing alone.\"  \u00a727, Comment i, at 259.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is scant explanation for this change in position beyond a reference in the Reporter's Note to a single decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  Id., Reporter's Note, Comment i, at 270 (discussing Halpern v. Schwartz, 426 F.\u00a02d 102 (1970)).  But even that court has subsequently explained that Halpern was \"not intended to have\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. broad impact outside the [bankruptcy] context,\" and it continues to follow the rule of the First Restatement \"in circumstances divergent from those in Halpern.\"  Winters v. Lavine, 574 F.\u00a02d 46, 67 (1978).  It thus appears that in this portion of the Second Restatement, the Reporters adopted a prescriptive rather than a descriptive approach.  In such situations, the Restatement loses much of its value.  See Kansas v. Nebraska, 574 U.\u00a0S. 445, 475 (2015) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The First Restatement has the more compelling position.  There appear to be two principal objections to giving alternative grounds preclusive effect.  The first is that the court rendering the judgment may not have given each of the grounds \"the careful deliberation and analysis normally applied to essential issues.\" Halpern, supra, at 105.  This argument is based on an unjustified assessment of the way in which courts do their work.  Even when a court bases its decision on multiple grounds, \"it is reasonable to expect that such a finding is the product of careful judicial reasoning.\"  Jean Alexander Cosmetics, Inc.\u00a0v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 458 F.\u00a03d 244, 254 (CA3 2006).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The other argument cited for the Second Restatement's rule is that the losing party may decline to appeal if one of the two bases for a judgment is strong and the other is weak.  \u00a727, Comment i, at 259.  There are reasons to be skeptical of this argument as well.  While there may be cases in which the presence of multiple grounds causes the losing party to forgo an appeal, that is likely to be true in only a small subset of cases involving such judgments.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, other aspects of issue-preclusion doctrine protect against giving binding effect to decisions that result from unreliable litigation.  Issue preclusion applies only to questions \"actually and necessarily determined,\" Montana, 440 U.\u00a0S., at 153, and a party may be able to avoid preclusion by showing that it \"did not have an adequate opportunity or incentive to obtain a full and fair adjudication in the initial action.\"  Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a728(5)(c).  To be sure, this exception should not be applied \"without a compelling showing of unfairness, nor should it be based simply on a conclusion that the first determination was patently erroneous.\"  Id., \u00a728, Comment j, at 284.  This exception provides an important safety valve, but it is narrow and clearly does not apply here.  Not only did the Tribe have an opportunity in Repsis to litigate the subject of the alternative ground, it actually did so.8\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, regardless of whether alternative grounds always have preclusive effect, it is sufficient to say that, at least in a declaratory judgment action, each conclusion provides an independent basis for preclusion.  \"Since the very purpose of declaratory relief is to achieve a final and reliable determination of legal issues, there should be no quibbling about the necessity principle.  Every issue that the parties have litigated and that the court has undertaken to resolve is necessary to the judgment, and should be precluded.\"  18 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a74421, at 630; see Henglein v. Colt Industries Operating Corp., 260 F.\u00a03d 201, 212 (CA3 2001).  Because Repsis was a declaratory judgment action aimed at settling the Tribe's hunting rights, that principle suffices to bind Herrera to Repsis's resolution of the occupied-land issue.\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Herrera and the United States offer a variety of other arguments to avoid the preclusive effect of Repsis, but all are unavailing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Herrera contends that he is not bound by the Repsis judgment because he was not a party, but this argument is clearly wrong.  Indian hunting rights, like most Indian treaty rights, are reserved to the Tribe as a whole.  Herrera's entitlement derives solely from his membership in the Tribe; it is not personal to him.  As a result, a judgment determining the rights of the Tribe has preclusive effect in subsequent litigation involving an individual member of the Tribe.  Cf. Hinderlider v. La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 304 U.\u00a0S. 92, 106-108 (1938) (judgment as to water rights of a State is binding on individual residents of State).  That rule applies equally to binding judgments finding in favor of and against asserted tribal rights.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Herrera also argues that a judgment in a civil action should not have preclusive effect in a subsequent criminal prosecution, but this argument would unjustifiably prevent the use of the declaratory judgment device to determine potential criminal exposure.  The Declaratory Judgment Act provides an equitable remedy allowing a party to ask a federal court to \"declare [the party's] rights\" through an order with \"the force and effect of a final judgment.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72201(a).  The Act thus allows a person to obtain a definitive ex ante determination of his or her right to engage in conduct that might otherwise be criminally punishable.  It thereby avoids \"putting the challenger to the choice between abandoning his rights or risking prosecution.\"  MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.\u00a0S. 118, 129 (2007).  If the Tribe had prevailed in Repsis, surely Herrera would expect that Wyoming could not attempt to relitigate the question in this case and in prosecutions of other members of the Tribe.  A declaratory judgment \"is conclusive .\u00a0.\u00a0. as to the matters declared\" when the State prevails just as it would be when the party challenging the State is the winning party.  Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a733, at 332.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that we have been cautious about applying the doctrine of issue preclusion in criminal proceedings.  See e.g., Currier v. Virginia, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 9); Bravo-Fernandez v. United States, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 4).  But we have never adopted the blanket prohibition that Herrera advances.  Instead, we have said that preclusion doctrines should have \"guarded application.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We employ such caution because preclusion rests on \"an underlying confidence that the result achieved in the initial litigation was substantially correct,\" and that confidence, in turn, is bolstered by the availability of appellate review.  Standefer v. United States, 447 U.\u00a0S. 10, 23, n.\u00a018 (1980); see also Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a728, Comment a, at 274.  In Currier and Bravo-Fernandez, we were reluctant to apply issue preclusion, not because the subsequent trial was criminal, but because the initial trial was.  While a defense verdict in a criminal trial is generally not subject to testing on appeal, summary judgment in a civil declaratory judgment action can be appealed.  Indeed, the Crow Tribe did appeal the District Court's decision to the Tenth Circuit and petitioned for our review of the Tenth Circuit's decision.  The concerns that we articulated in Currier and Bravo-Fernandez have no bearing here.9\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, Herrera is precluded by the judgment in Repsis from relitigating the continuing validity of the hunting right conferred by the 1868 Treaty.  Because the majority has chosen to disregard this threshold problem and issue a potentially pointless disquisition on the proper interpretation of the 1868 Treaty, I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Notably, the four Justices who dissented in Mille Lacs protested that the Court \"effectively overrule[d] Race Horse sub silentio.\"  526 U.\u00a0S., at 219 (Rehnquist, C.\u00a0J., dissenting).  Others have agreed with this assessment.  See, e.g., State v. Buchanan, 138 Wash. 2d 186, 211-212, 978 P.\u00a02d 1070, 1083 (1999) (\"[T]he United States Supreme Court effectively overruled Race Horse in Minnesota v. Mille Lacs\").\nFootnote 2\u00a0The dissent does not disagree outright with this conclusion, noting only that \"there is a respectable argument on the other side,\" post, at 12.  The dissent argues that the cases cited above are distinguishable, but we do not read them as narrowly as does the dissent.  We note, too, that the lower federal courts have long applied the change-in-law exception in a variety of contexts.  See, e.g., Dow Chemical Co. v. Nova Chemicals Corp. (Canada), 803 F. 3d 620, 627-630 (CA Fed. 2015), cert. denied, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016); Coors Brewing Co. v. Mendez-Torres, 562 F. 3d 3, 11 (CA1 2009), abrogated on other grounds by Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560 U.\u00a0S. 413 (2010); Ginters v. Frazier, 614 F. 3d 822, 826-827 (CA8 2010); Faulkner v. National Geographic Enterprises Inc., 409 F. 3d 26, 37-38 (CA2 2005); Chippewa & Flambeau Improvement Co. v. FERC, 325 F. 3d 353, 356-357 (CADC 2003); Spradling v. Tulsa, 198 F. 3d 1219, 1222-1223 (CA10 2000); Mendelovitz v. Adolph Coors Co., 693 F. 2d 570, 579 (CA5 1982).\nFootnote 3\u00a0We do not address whether a different outcome would be justified if the State had identified \"compelling concerns of repose or reliance.\"  See 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a74425, p. 726 (3d ed. 2016).  Wyoming here has not done so.  The State suggests that public support for its conservation efforts may be jeopardized if it no longer has \"unquestioned\" authority over wildlife management in the Bighorn Mountains.  Brief for Respondent 54.  Wyoming does not explain why its authority to regulate Indians exercising their treaty rights when necessary for conservation is not sufficient to preserve that public support, see infra, at 22.  The State's passing reference to upsetting the settled expectations of private property owners is unconvincing because the 1868 Treaty right applies only to \"unoccupied lands of the United States.\"\nFootnote 4\u00a0Recall also that the Act establishing the Wyoming Territory declared that the creation of the Territory would not \"impair the rights of person or property now pertaining to the Indians in said Territory\" unless a treaty extinguished those rights.  Wyoming Territory Act, 15 Stat. 178.\nFootnote 5\u00a0Wyoming argues that the judgment below should be affirmed because the Tenth Circuit held in Repsis that the creation of the forest rendered the land \"occupied,\" see 73 F.\u00a03d, at 994, and thus Herrera is precluded from raising this issue.  We did not grant certiorari on the question of how preclusion principles would apply to the alternative judgment in Repsis, and--although our dissenting colleagues disagree, see post, at 13, and n. 6--the decision below did not address that issue.\nThe Wyoming appellate court agreed with the State that \"the primary issue in [Herrera's] case is identical to the primary issue in the Repsis case.\"  No. 2016-242 (4th Jud. Dist., Sheridan Cty., Wyo., Apr. 25, 2017), App. to Pet. for Cert. 13 (emphasis added).  That \"primary issue\" was the Race Horse ground of decision, not the \"occupation\" ground, which Repsis referred to as \"an alternative basis for affirmance,\" Repsis, 73 F.\u00a03d, at 993, and which the Wyoming court itself described as an \"alternativ[e]\" holding, No. 2016-242, App. to Pet. for Cert. 33.  Reading the state court's decision to give preclusive effect to the occupation ground as well would not fit with the Wyoming court's preclusion analysis, which, among other things, relied on a decision of the Federal District Court in Repsis that did not address the occupation issue.   See No. 2016-242, App. to Pet. for Cert. 14, 18; see also Repsis, 73 F.\u00a03d, at 993 (explaining that \"the district court did not reach [the occupation] issue\").  Context thus makes clear that the state court gave issue-preclusive effect only to Repsis' holding that the 1868 Treaty was no longer valid, not to Repsis' independent, narrower holding that Bighorn National Forest in particular was \"occupied\" land.  The court may not have addressed the issue-preclusive effect of the latter holding because of ambiguity in the State's briefing.  See Appellee's Supplemental Brief in No. 2016-242, pp.\u00a04, 11-12.\nWhile the dissent questions whether forfeiture could have played a part in the state court's analysis given that the court invited the parties to submit supplemental briefs on preclusion, post, at 13, n.\u00a06, the parties suggest that Wyoming failed adequately to raise the claim even in its supplemental brief.  See Brief for Petitioner 49 (\"the state made no such argument before\" the state court); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 31 (noting ambiguity in the State's supplemental brief).\nIt can be \"appropriate in special circumstances\" for a court to address a preclusion argument sua\u00a0sponte.  Arizona v. California, 530 U.\u00a0S. 392, 412 (2000).  But because the Wyoming District Court \"did not address\" this contention, \"we decline to address it here.\"  County of Los Angeles v. Mendez, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n. (2017) (slip op., at 8, n.); see Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.\u00a0S. 709, 718, n.\u00a07 (2005); Archer v. Warner, 538 U.\u00a0S. 314, 322-323 (2003).  Resolution of this question would require fact-intensive analyses of whether this issue was fully and fairly litigated in Repsis or was forfeited in this litigation, among other matters.  These gateway issues should be decided before this Court addresses them, especially given that even the dissent acknowledges that one of the preclusion issues raised by the parties is important and undecided, post, at 14, and some of the parties' other arguments are equally weighty.  Unlike the dissent, we do not address these issues in the first instance.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The Shoshone-Bannock Treaty reserved \"\u00a0'the right to hunt on the unoccupied lands of the United States, so long as game may be found thereon, and so long as peace subsists among the whites and Indians on the borders of the hunting districts.'\u00a0\"  Race Horse, 163 U.\u00a0S., at 507; Kappler 1020, 1021.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Wyoming officials enforce the State's hunting laws on national forest lands pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between the State and Federal Governments.  Crow Tribe of Indians v. Repsis, 866 F.\u00a0Supp. 520, 521, n.\u00a01 (Wyo. 1994).\nFootnote 3\u00a0Such cooperative law enforcement is valuable because the Crow Reservation and Bighorn National Forest face one another along the border between Montana, where the Crow Reservation is located, and Wyoming, where Bighorn is located.  Supra, at 3.  The border is delineated by a high fence intermittently posted with markers.\nFootnote 4\u00a0The preclusive effect of the judgment of a federal court is governed by federal law, regardless of whether that judgment's preclusive effect is later asserted in a state or federal forum.  Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.\u00a0S. 880, 892 (2008).  This means that the preclusive effect of Repsis, decided by a federal court, is governed by federal law, not Wyoming law, even though preclusion was asserted in a Wyoming court.\nFootnote 5\u00a0Nor are the other cases cited by the majority more helpful to the Court's position.  Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U.\u00a0S. 591 (1948), and Limbach v. Hooven & Allison Co., 466 U.\u00a0S. 353 (1984)--and, indeed, Montana v. United States, 440 U.\u00a0S. 147 (1979)--are tax cases that hold, consistent with the general policy against \"discriminatory distinctions in tax liability,\" Sunnen, 333 U.\u00a0S., at 599, that issue preclusion has limited application when the conduct in the second litigation occurred in a different tax year than the conduct that was the subject of the earlier judgment.  We have not, prior to today, applied Sunnen's tax-specific policy in cases that do not involve tax liability and do not create a possibility of \"inequalities in the administration of the revenue laws.\"  Ibid.\nFootnote 6\u00a0The decision below, in other words, held that the issue that was precluded was whether members of the Crow Tribe have a treaty right to hunt in Bighorn.  The majority rejects this definition of the issue, and instead asks only whether the first line of reasoning in Repsis retains preclusive effect.  Such hairsplitting conflicts with the fundamental purpose of issue preclusion--laying legal disputes at rest.   If courts allow a party to escape preclusion whenever a decision on one legal question can be divided into multiple or alternate parts, the doctrine of preclusion would lose its value.  The majority's \"[n]arrower definition of the issues resolved augments the risk of apparently inconsistent results\" and undermines the objectives of finality and economy served by preclusion.  18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a74417, p. 470 (3d ed. 2016).\nThe Court also hints that the state court might have thought that Wyoming forfeited reliance on issue preclusion, ante, at 18, n.\u00a05, but there is no basis for that suggestion.  The Wyoming appellate court invited the parties to submit supplemental briefs on issue preclusion and specifically held that \"it [was] proper for the Court to raise this issue sua sponte when no factual development is required, and the parties are given an opportunity to fully brief the issues.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 10, n. 2.\nFootnote 7\u00a0See, e.g., Jean Alexander Cosmetics, Inc. v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 458 F.\u00a03d 244, 251-257 (CA3 2006) (collecting cases); In\u00a0re Westgate-California Corp., 642 F.\u00a02d 1174, 1176-1177 (CA9 1981); Winters v. Lavine, 574 F.\u00a02d 46, 66-67 (CA2 1978); Irving Nat'l Bank v. Law, 10 F.\u00a02d 721, 724 (CA2 1926) (Hand, J.).\nFootnote 8\u00a0From the beginning of the Repsis litigation, Wyoming argued that Bighorn was occupied land, and the Tribe argued that it was not.  Wyoming pressed this argument in its answer to the Tribe's declaratory judgment complaint.  Record in No. 92-cv-1002, Doc. 29, p. 4.  Wyoming reiterated that argument in its motion for summary judgment and repeated it in its reply.  Id., Doc. 34, pp. 1, 6; id., Doc. 54, pp. 7-8.  The Tribe dedicated a full 10 pages of its summary judgment brief to the argument that \"[t]he Big Horn National Forest [l]ands [are] '[u]noccupied [l]ands'\u00a0\" of the United States.  Id., Doc. 52, pp. 6-15.  Both parties repeated these arguments in their briefs before the Tenth Circuit.  Brief for Appellees 20-29 and Reply Brief for Appellants 2-3, and n. 6, in No. 94-8097 (1995).  And the Tribe pressed this argument as an independent basis for this Court's review in its petition for certiorari, which this Court denied.  Pet. for Cert. in Crow Tribe of Indians v. Repsis, O.\u00a0T. 1995, No. 95-1560, pp. i, 22-24, cert. denied, 517 U.\u00a0S. 1221 (1996).\nFootnote 9\u00a0Nor is that the only distinction between those cases and this one.  In both Currier and Bravo-Fernandez a party sought preclusion as to an element of the charged offense.  The elements of the charged offense are not disputed here--Herrera's asserted treaty right is an affirmative defense.  And while the State bears the burden of proof as to elements of the offense, under Wyoming law, the defendant asserting an affirmative defense must state a prima facie case before any burden shifts to the State.  See Duckett v. State, 966 P.\u00a02d 941, 948 (Wyo. 1998).\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOME DEPOT U. S. A., INC. v. JACKSON(2019)\nNo. 17-1471\nArgued: January 15, 2019Decided: May 28, 2019\n\n\nCitibank, N.\u00a0A., filed a debt-collection action in state court, alleging that respondent Jackson was liable for charges incurred on a Home Depot credit card.  As relevant here, Jackson responded by filing third-party class-action claims against petitioner Home Deport U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A., Inc., and Carolina Water Systems, Inc., alleging that they had engaged in unlawful referral sales and deceptive and unfair trade practices under state law.  Home Depot filed a notice to remove the case from state to federal court, but Jackson moved to remand, arguing that controlling precedent barred removal by a third-party counterclaim defendant.  The District Court granted Jackson's motion, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that neither the general removal provision, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71441(a), nor the removal provision in the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, \u00a71453(b), allowed Home Depot to remove the class-action claims filed against it.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0Section 1441(a) does not permit removal by a third-party counterclaim defendant.  Home Depot emphasizes that it is a \"defendant\" to a \"claim,\" but \u00a71441(a) refers to \"civil action[s],\" not \"claims.\"  And because the action as defined by the plaintiff's complaint is the \"civil action .\u00a0.\u00a0. of which the district cour[t]\" must have \"original jurisdiction,\" \"the defendant\" to that action is the defendant to the complaint, not a party named in a counterclaim.  This conclusion is bolstered by the use of the term \"defendant\" in related contexts.  For one, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure differentiate between third-party defendants, counterclaim defendants, and defendants.  See, e.g., Rules 14, 12(a)(1)(A)-(B).  And in other removal provisions, Congress has clearly extended removal authority to parties other than the original defendant, see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71452(a), 1454(a), (b), but has not done so here.  Finally, if, as this Court has held, a counterclaim defendant who was the original plaintiff is not one of \"the defendants,\" see Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U.\u00a0S. 100, 106-109, there is no textual reason to reach a different conclusion for a counterclaim defendant who was not part of the initial lawsuit.  This reading, Home Depot asserts, runs counter to the history and purposes of removal by preventing a party involuntarily brought into state-court proceedings from removing the claim against it to federal court.  But the limits Congress has imposed on removal show that it did not intend to allow all defendants an unqualified right to remove, see, e.g., \u00a71441(b)(2), and Home Depot's interpretation makes little sense in the context of other removal provisions, see, e.g., \u00a71446(b)(2)(A).  Pp.\u00a05-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Section 1453(b) does not permit removal by a third-party counterclaim defendant.  Home Depot contends that even if \u00a71441(a) does not permit removal here, \u00a71453(b) does because it permits removal by \"any defendant\" to a \"class action.\"  But the two clauses in \u00a71453(b) that employ the term \"any defendant\" simply clarify that certain limitations on removal that might otherwise apply do not limit removal under that provision.  And neither clause--nor anything else in the statute--alters \u00a71441(a)'s limitation on who can remove, suggesting that Congress intended to leave that limit in place.  In addition, \u00a7\u00a71453(b) and 1441(a) both rely on the procedures for removal in \u00a71446, which also employs the term \"defendant.\"  Interpreting that term to have different meanings in different sections would render the removal provisions incoherent.

S. A., INC., PETITIONER v.GEORGE W. JACKSON\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit\n[May 28, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The general removal statute, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71441(a), provides that \"any civil action\" over which a federal court would have original jurisdiction may be removed to federal court by \"the defendant or the defendants.\"  The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA) provides that \"[a] class action\" may be removed to federal court by \"any defendant without the consent of all defendants.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71453(b).  In this case, we address whether either provision allows a third-party counterclaim defendant--that is, a party brought into a lawsuit through a counterclaim filed by the original defendant--to remove the counterclaim filed against it.  Because in the context of these removal provisions the term \"defendant\" refers only to the party sued by the original plaintiff, we conclude that neither provision allows such a third party to remove.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have often explained that \"[f]ederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.\"  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 511 U.\u00a0S. 375, 377 (1994).  Article III, \u00a72, of the Constitution delineates \"[t]he character of the controversies over which federal judicial authority may extend.\"  Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.\u00a0S. 694, 701 (1982).  And lower federal-court jurisdiction \"is further limited to those subjects encompassed within a statutory grant of jurisdiction.\"  Ibid.  Accordingly, \"the district courts may not exercise jurisdiction absent a statutory basis.\"  Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U.\u00a0S. 546, 552 (2005).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71331 and 1332(a), Congress granted federal courts jurisdiction over two general types of cases: cases that \"aris[e] under\" federal law, \u00a71331, and cases in which the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 and there is diversity of citizenship among the parties, \u00a71332(a).  These jurisdictional grants are known as  \"federal-question jurisdiction\" and \"diversity jurisdiction,\" respectively.  Each serves a distinct purpose: Federal-question jurisdiction affords parties a federal forum in which \"to vindicate federal rights,\" whereas diversity jurisdiction provides \"a neutral forum\" for parties from different States.  Exxon Mobil Corp., supra, at 552.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress has modified these general grants of jurisdiction to provide federal courts with jurisdiction in certain other types of cases.  As relevant here, CAFA provides district courts with jurisdiction over \"class action[s]\" in which the matter in controversy exceeds $5,000,000 and at least one class member is a citizen of a State different from the defendant.  \u00a71332(d)(2)(A).  A \"class action\" is \"any civil action filed under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or similar State statute or rule of judicial procedure.\"  \u00a71332(d)(1)(B).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to granting federal courts jurisdiction over certain types of cases, Congress has enacted provisions that permit parties to remove cases originally filed in state court to federal court.  Section 1441(a), the general removal statute, permits \"the defendant or the defendants\" in a state-court action over which the federal courts would have original jurisdiction to remove that action to federal court.  To remove under this provision, a party must meet the requirements for removal detailed in other provisions.  For one, a defendant cannot remove unilaterally.  Instead, \"all defendants who have been properly joined and served must join in or consent to the removal of the action.\"  \u00a71446(b)(2)(A).  Moreover, when federal jurisdiction is based on diversity jurisdiction, the case generally must be removed within \"1 year after commencement of the action,\" \u00a71446(c)(1), and the case may not be removed if any defendant is \"a citizen of the State in which such action is brought,\" \u00a71441(b)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CAFA also includes a removal provision specific to class actions.  That provision permits the removal of a \"class action\" from state court to federal court \"by any defendant without the consent of all defendants\" and \"without regard to whether any defendant is a citizen of the State in which the action is brought.\"  \u00a71453(b).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At issue here is whether the term \"defendant\" in either \u00a71441(a) or \u00a71453(b) encompasses a party brought into a lawsuit to defend against a counterclaim filed by the original defendant or whether the provisions limit removal authority to the original defendant.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In June 2016, Citibank, N.\u00a0A., filed a debt-collection action against respondent George Jackson in North Carolina state court.  Citibank alleged that Jackson was liable for charges he incurred on a Home Depot credit card.  In August 2016, Jackson answered and filed his own claims: an individual counterclaim against Citibank and third-party class-action claims against Home Depot U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A., Inc., and Carolina Water Systems, Inc.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jackson's claims arose out of an alleged scheme between Home Depot and Carolina Water Systems to induce homeowners to buy water treatment systems at inflated prices.  The crux of the claims was that Home Depot and Carolina Water Systems engaged in unlawful referral sales and deceptive and unfair trade practices in violation of North Carolina law, Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a725A-37, 75-1.1 (2013).  Jackson also asserted that Citibank was jointly and severally liable for the conduct of Home Depot and Carolina Water Systems and that his obligations under the sale were null and void.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In September 2016, Citibank dismissed its claims against Jackson.  One month later, Home Depot filed a notice of removal, citing 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71332, 1441, 1446, and 1453.  Jackson moved to remand, arguing that precedent barred removal by a \"third-party\/additional counter defendant like Home Depot.\"  App. 51-52.  Shortly thereafter, Jackson amended his third-party class-action claims to remove any reference to Citibank.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court granted Jackson's motion to remand, and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted Home Depot permission to appeal and affirmed.  880 F.\u00a03d 165, 167 (2018); see 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71453(c)(1).  Relying on Circuit precedent, it held that neither the general removal provision, \u00a71441(a), nor CAFA's removal provision, \u00a71453(b), allowed Home Depot to remove the class-action claims filed against it.  880 F.\u00a03d, at 167-171.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted Home Depot's petition for a writ of certiorari to determine whether a third party named in a class-action counterclaim brought by the original defendant can remove if the claim otherwise satisfies the jurisdictional requirements of CAFA.  585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).  We also directed the parties to address whether the holding in Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U.\u00a0S. 100 (1941)--that an original plaintiff may not remove a coun  terclaim against it--should extend to third-party counterclaim defendants.1  585 U.\u00a0S. ___.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We first consider whether 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71441(a) permits a third-party counterclaim defendant to remove a claim filed against it.2  Home Depot contends that because a third-party counterclaim defendant is a \"defendant\" to the claim against it, it may remove pursuant to \u00a71441(a).  The dissent agrees, emphasizing that \"a 'defendant' is a 'person sued in a civil proceeding.'\u00a0\"  Post, at 9 (opinion of Alito, J.).  This reading of the statute is plausible, but we do not think it is the best one.  Of course the term \"defendant,\" standing alone, is broad.  But the phrase \"the defendant or the defendants\" \"cannot be construed in a vacuum.\"  Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.\u00a0S. 803, 809 (1989).  \"It is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\"  Ibid.; see also A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 167 (2012) (\"The text must be construed as a whole\"); accord, Bailey v. United States, 516 U.\u00a0S. 137, 145-146 (1995).  Considering the phrase \"the defendant or the defendants\" in light of the structure of the statute and our precedent, we conclude that \u00a71441(a) does not permit removal by any counterclaim defendant, including parties brought into the   lawsuit for the first time by the counterclaim.3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Home Depot emphasizes that it is a \"defendant\" to a \"claim,\" but the statute refers to \"civil action[s],\" not \"claims.\"  This Court has long held that a district court, when determining whether it has original jurisdiction over a civil action, should evaluate whether that action could have been brought originally in federal court.  See Mexican Nat. R. Co. v. Davidson, 157 U.\u00a0S. 201, 208 (1895); Tennessee v. Union & Planters' Bank, 152 U.\u00a0S. 454, 461 (1894).  This requires a district court to evaluate whether the plaintiff could have filed its operative complaint in federal court, either because it raises claims arising under federal law or because it falls within the court's diversity jurisdiction.  E.g., Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U.\u00a0S. 1, 10 (1983); cf. Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc., 535 U.\u00a0S. 826, 831 (2002) (\"[A] counterclaim .\u00a0.\u00a0. cannot serve as the basis for 'arising under' jurisdiction\"); \u00a71446(c)(2) (deeming the \"sum demanded in good faith in the initial pleading .\u00a0.\u00a0. the amount in controversy\").  Section 1441(a) thus does not permit removal based on counterclaims at all, as a counterclaim is irrelevant to whether the district court had \"original jurisdiction\" over the civil action.  And because the \"civil action .\u00a0.\u00a0. of which the district cour[t]\" must have \"original jurisdiction\" is the action as defined by the plaintiff's complaint, \"the defendant\" to that action is the defendant to that complaint, not a party named in a counterclaim.  It is this statutory context, not \"the policy goals behind the [well-pleaded complaint] rule,\" post, at 23, that underlies   our interpretation of the phrase \"the defendant or the defendants.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The use of the term \"defendant\" in related contexts bolsters our determination that Congress did not intend for the phrase \"the defendant or the defendants\" in \u00a71441(a) to include third-party counterclaim defendants.  For one, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure differentiate between third-party defendants, counterclaim defendants, and defendants.  Rule 14, which governs \"Third-Party Practice,\" distinguishes between \"the plaintiff,\" a \"defendant\" who becomes the \"third-party plaintiff,\" and \"the third-party defendant\" sued by the original defendant.  Rule 12 likewise distinguishes between defendants and counterclaim defendants by separately specifying when \"[a] defendant must serve an answer\" and when \"[a] party must serve an answer to a counterclaim.\"  Fed. Rules Civ. Proc.\u00a012(a)(1)(A)-(B).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, in other removal provisions, Congress has clearly extended the reach of the statute to include parties other than the original defendant.  For instance, \u00a71452(a) permits \"[a] party\" in a civil action to \"remove any claim or cause of action\" over which a federal court would have bankruptcy jurisdiction.  And \u00a7\u00a71454(a) and (b) allow \"any party\" to remove \"[a] civil action in which any party asserts a claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, plant variety protection, or copyrights.\"  Section 1441(a), by contrast, limits removal to \"the defendant or the defendants\" in a \"civil action\" over which the district courts have original jurisdiction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, our decision in Shamrock Oil suggests that third-party counterclaim defendants are not \"the defendant or the defendants\" who can remove under \u00a71441(a).  Shamrock Oil held that a counterclaim defendant who was also the original plaintiff could not remove under \u00a71441(a)'s predecessor statute.  313 U.\u00a0S., at 106-109.  We agree with Home Depot that Shamrock Oil does not specifically address whether a party who was not the original plaintiff can remove a counterclaim filed against it.  And we acknowledge, as Home Depot points out, that a third-party counterclaim defendant, unlike the original plaintiff, has no role in selecting the forum for the suit.  But the text of \u00a71441(a) simply refers to \"the defendant or the defendants\" in the civil action.  If a counterclaim defendant who was the original plaintiff is not one of \"the defendants,\" we see no textual reason to reach a different conclusion for a counterclaim defendant who was not originally part of the lawsuit.  In that regard, Shamrock Oil did not view the counterclaim as a separate action with a new plaintiff and a new defendant.  Instead, the Court highlighted that the original plaintiff was still \"the plaintiff.\"  Id., at 108 (\"We can find no basis for saying that Congress, by omitting from the present statute all reference to 'plaintiffs,' intended to save a right of removal to some plaintiffs and not to others\").  Similarly here, the filing of counterclaims that included class-action allegations against a third party did not create a new \"civil action\" with a new \"plaintiff\" and a new \"defendant.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Home Depot asserts that reading \"the defendant\" in \u00a71441(a) to exclude third-party counterclaim defendants runs counter to the history and purposes of removal by preventing a party involuntarily brought into state-court proceedings from removing the claim against it.  But the limits Congress has imposed on removal show that it did not intend to allow all defendants an unqualified right to remove.  E.g., \u00a71441(b)(2) (preventing removal based on diversity jurisdiction where any defendant is a citizen of the State in which the action is brought).  Moreover, Home Depot's interpretation makes little sense in the context of other removal provisions.  For instance, when removal is based on \u00a71441(a), all defendants must consent to removal.  See \u00a71446(b)(2)(A).  Under Home Depot's interpretation, \"defendants\" in \u00a71446(b)(2)(A) could be read to require consent from the third-party counterclaim defendant, the original plaintiff (as a counterclaim defendant), and the original defendant asserting claims against them.  Further, Home Depot's interpretation would require courts to determine when the original defendant is also a \"plaintiff\" under other statutory provisions.  E.g., \u00a71446(c)(1).  Instead of venturing down this path, we hold that a third-party counterclaim defendant is not a \"defendant\" who can remove under \u00a71441(a).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We next consider whether CAFA's removal provision, \u00a71453(b), permits a third-party counterclaim defendant to remove.4  Home Depot contends that even if it could not remove under \u00a71441(a), it could remove under \u00a71453(b) because that statute is worded differently.  It argues that although \u00a71441(a) permits removal only by \"the defendant or the defendants\" in a \"civil action,\" \u00a71453(b) permits removal by \"any defendant\" to a \"class action.\"  (Emphasis added.)  Jackson responds that this argument ignores the context of \u00a71453(b), which he contends makes clear that Congress intended only to alter certain restrictions on removal, not expand the class of parties who can remove a class action.  Although this is a closer question, we agree with Jackson.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The two clauses in \u00a71453(b) that employ the term \"any defendant\" simply clarify that certain limitations on removal that might otherwise apply do not limit removal under \u00a71453(b).  Section 1453(b) first states that \"[a] class   action may be removed .\u00a0.\u00a0. without regard to whether any defendant is a citizen of the State in which the action is brought.\"  There is no indication that this language does anything more than alter the general rule that a civil action may not be removed on the basis of diversity jurisdiction \"if any of the .\u00a0.\u00a0. defendants is a citizen of the State in which such action is brought.\"  \u00a71441(b)(2).  Section 1453(b) then states that \"[a] class action .\u00a0.\u00a0. may be removed by any defendant without the consent of all defendants.\"  This language simply amends the rule that \"all defendants who have been properly joined and served must join in or consent to the removal of the action.\"  \u00a71446(b)(2)(A).  Rather than indicate that a counterclaim defendant can remove, \"here the word 'any' is being employed in connection with the word 'all' later in the sentence--'by any .\u00a0.\u00a0. without .\u00a0.\u00a0. the consent of all.'\u00a0\"  Westwood Apex v. Contreras, 644 F.\u00a03d 799, 804 (CA9 2011); see Palisades Collections LLC v. Shorts, 552 F.\u00a03d 327, 335-336 (CA4 2008).  Neither clause--nor anything else in the statute--alters \u00a71441(a)'s limitation on who can remove, which suggests that Congress intended to leave that limit in place.  See supra, at 5-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, although the term \"any\" ordinarily carries an \"\u00a0'expansive meaning,'\u00a0\" post, at 10, the context here demonstrates that Congress did not expand the types of parties eligible to remove a class action under \u00a71453(b) beyond \u00a71441(a)'s limits.  If anything, that the language of \u00a71453(b) mirrors the language in the statutory provisions it is amending suggests that the term \"defendant\" is being used consistently across all provisions.  Cf. Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU Optronics Corp., 571 U.\u00a0S. 161, 169-170 (2014) (interpreting CAFA consistently with Rule  20 where Congress used terms in a like manner in both provisions).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the extent Home Depot is arguing that the term \"defendant\" has a different meaning in \u00a71453(b) than it does in \u00a71441(a), we reject its interpretation.  Because \u00a7\u00a71453(b) and 1441(a) both rely on the procedures for removal in \u00a71446, which also employs the term \"defendant,\" interpreting \"defendant\" to have different meanings in different sections would render the removal provisions incoherent.  See First Bank v. DJL Properties, LLC, 598 F.\u00a03d 915, 917 (CA7 2010) (Easterbrook, C. J.).  Interpreting the removal provisions together, we determine that \u00a71453(b), like \u00a71441(a), does not permit a third-party counterclaim defendant to remove.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the dissent argues that our interpretation allows defendants to use the statute as a \"tactic\" to prevent removal, post, at 7, but that result is a consequence of the statute Congress wrote.  Of course, if Congress shares the dissent's disapproval of certain litigation \"tactics,\" it certainly has the authority to amend the statute.  But we do not.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because neither \u00a71441(a) nor \u00a71453(b) permits removal by a third-party counterclaim defendant, Home Depot could not remove the class-action claim filed against it.  Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Fourth Circuit.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nAlito, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1471\nHOME DEPOT U. S. A., INC., PETITIONER v. GEORGE W. JACKSON\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit\n[May 28, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Gorsuch, and Justice Kavanaugh join, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rule of law requires neutral forums for resolving disputes.  Courts are designed to provide just that.  But our legal system takes seriously the risk that for certain cases, some neutral forums might be more neutral than others.  Or it might appear that way, which is almost as deleterious.  For example, a party bringing suit in its own State's courts might (seem to) enjoy, so to speak, a home court advantage against outsiders.  Thus, from 1789 Congress has opened federal courts to certain disputes between citizens of different States.  Plaintiffs, of course, can avail themselves of the federal option in such cases by simply choosing to file a case in federal court.  But since their defendants cannot, the law has always given defendants the option to remove (transfer) cases to federal court.  Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U.\u00a0S. 100, 105 (1941).  The general removal statute, which authorizes removal by \"the defendant or the defendants,\" thus ensures that defendants get an equal chance to choose a federal forum.  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71441(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But defendants cannot remove a case unless it meets certain conditions.  Some of those conditions have long made important (and often costly) consumer class actions virtually impossible to remove.  Congress, concerned that state courts were biased against defendants to such actions, passed a law facilitating their removal.  The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA) allows removal of certain class actions \"by any defendant.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71453(b).  Our job is not to judge whether Congress's fears about state-court bias in class actions were warranted or indeed whether CAFA should allay them.  We are to determine the scope of the term \"defendant\" under CAFA as well as the general removal provision, \u00a71441.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All agree that if one party sues another, the latter--the original defendant--is a \"defendant\" under both removal laws.  But suppose the original defendant then countersues, bringing claims against both the plaintiff and a new party.  Is this new defendant--the \"third-party defendant\"--also a \"defendant\" under CAFA and \u00a71441?  There are, of course, some differences between original and third-party defendants.  One is brought into a case by the first major filing, the other by the second.  The one filing is called a complaint, the other a countercomplaint.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But both kinds of parties are defendants to legal claims.  Neither chose to be in state court.  Both might face bias there, and with it the potential for crippling unjust losses.  Yet today's Court holds that third-party defendants are not \"defendants.\"  It holds that Congress left them unprotected under CAFA and \u00a71441.  This reads an irrational distinction into both removal laws and flouts their plain meaning, a meaning that context confirms and today's majority simply ignores.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To appreciate what Congress sought to achieve with CAFA, consider what Congress failed to accomplish a decade earlier with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act), 109 Stat. 737 (codified at 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a777z-1 and 78u-4).  The Reform Act was \"targeted at perceived abuses of the class-action vehicle in litigation involving nationally traded securities,\" including spurious lawsuits, \"vexatious discovery requests, and 'manipulation by class action lawyers of the clients whom they purportedly represent.' \" Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U.\u00a0S. 71, 81 (2006) (quoting H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-369, p. 31 (1995)).  As a result of these abuses, Congress found, companies were often forced to enter \"extortionate settlements\" in frivolous cases, just to avoid the litigation costs--a burden with scant benefits to anyone.  547 U.\u00a0S., at 81.  To curb these inefficiencies, the Reform Act \"limit[ed] recoverable damages and attorney's fees, .\u00a0.\u00a0. impose[d] new restrictions on the selection of (and compensation awarded to) lead plaintiffs, mandate[d] imposition of sanctions for frivolous litigation, and authorize[d] a stay of discovery pending resolution of any motion to dismiss.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But \"at least some members of the plaintiffs' bar\" found a workaround: They avoided the Reform Act's limits on federal litigation by \"avoid[ing] the federal forum altogether\" and heading to state court.  Id., at 82.  Once there, they were able to keep defendants from taking them back to federal court (under the rules then in force) simply by naming an in-state defendant. See \u00a71441(b)(2).  And the change in plaintiffs' strategy was marked: While state-court litigation of such class actions had been \"rare\" before the Reform Act's passage, id., at 82, within a decade state courts were handling most such cases, see S. Rep. No. 109-14, p. 4 (2005).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some in Congress feared that plaintiffs' lawyers were able to \"\u00a0'game' the procedural rules and keep nationwide or multi-state class actions in state courts whose judges have reputations for readily certifying classes and approving settlements without regard to class member interests.\" Ibid.  The result, in Congress's judgment, was that \"State and local courts\" were keeping issues of \"national importance\" out of federal court, \"acting in ways that demonstrate[d] bias against out-of-State defendants\" and imposing burdens that hindered \"innovation\" and drove up \"consumer prices.\" \u00a7\u00a72(a)(4), (b),  119 Stat. 5.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So Congress again took action.  But rather than get at the problem by imposing limits on federal litigation that plaintiffs could sidestep by taking defendants to state court, Congress sought to make it easier for defendants to remove to federal court: thus CAFA.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To grasp how CAFA changed the procedural landscape for class actions, it helps to review the rules that govern removal in the mine run of cases, and that once limited removal of all class actions as well.  Those general rules appear in 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71441 and 1446.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under \u00a71441(a), \"any civil action brought in a State court .\u00a0.\u00a0. may be removed by the defendant or the defendants\" as long as federal district courts would have \"original jurisdiction\" over the case.  Such jurisdiction comes in two varieties.  Federal courts have \"federal question jurisdiction\" if the case \"aris[es] under\" federal law--for instance, if the plaintiff alleges violations of a federal statute.  \u00a71331.  But even when the plaintiff brings only state-law claims--alleging a breach of a contract, for example--federal courts have \"diversity jurisdiction\" if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 and there is complete diversity of parties, meaning that no plaintiff is a citizen of the same State as any defendant.  \u00a71332(a); Lincoln Property Co. v. Roche, 546 U.\u00a0S. 81, 89 (2005).  While \u00a71441 normally allows removal of either kind of case, it bars removal in diversity cases brought in the home State of any defendant.  \u00a71441(b)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another subsection of \u00a71441 addresses removal of a subset of claims (not an entire action) when a case involves some claims that would be removable because they arise under federal law and others that would not (because they involve state-law claims falling outside both the original and the supplemental jurisdiction of federal courts1).  In these hybrid cases, \u00a71441(c)(2) allows the federal claims to be removed while the state-law claims are severed and sent back to state court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The procedural rules for removing an action or claim from state to federal court under \u00a71441 are set forth in \u00a71446.  Section 1446(b)(2)(A) requires the consent of all the defendants before an entire case may be removed under \u00a71441(a).  (If a defendant instead invokes \u00a71441(c)(2), to remove a subset of claims, consent is required only from defendants to the claims that are removed.)  And if diversity jurisdiction arises later in litigation--which may occur if, for instance, dismissal of an original defendant creates complete diversity--\u00a71446(c)(1) allows removal only within one year of the start of the action in state court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To this general removal regime, CAFA made several changes specific to class actions.  Instead of allowing removal by \"the defendant or the defendants,\" see \u00a71441(a), \u00a75 of CAFA allowed removal by \"any defendant\" to certain class actions, \u00a71453(b), even when the other defendants do not consent, the case was filed in a defendant's home forum, or the case has been pending in state court for more than a year.  See 119 Stat. 12-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, these changes would be of no use to a class-action defendant hoping to remove if there were no federal jurisdiction over its case.  So CAFA also lowered the barriers to diversity jurisdiction.  While complete diversity of parties is normally required, CAFA eliminates that rule for class actions involving at least 100 members and more than $5 million in controversy.  In such cases, CAFA vests district courts with diversity jurisdiction anytime there is minimal diversity--which occurs when at least one plaintiff and defendant reside in different States.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71332(d)(2), (d)(5)(B).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were asked to decide whether these loosened requirements are best read to allow removal by third-party defendants like Home Depot.  The answer is clear when one considers Home Depot's situation against CAFA's language and history.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case began as a garden-variety debt-collection action: Citibank sued respondent George Jackson in state court seeking payment on his purchase from petitioner Home Depot of a product made by Carolina Water Systems (CWS).  Jackson came back with a counterclaim class action that roped in Home Depot and CWS as codefendants.  (Until then, neither Home Depot nor CWS had been a party.)  Citibank then dismissed its claim against Jackson, and Jackson amended his complaint to remove any mention of Citibank.  So now all that remains in this case is Jackson's class-action counterclaims against Home Depot and CWS.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Invoking CAFA, Home Depot filed a notice of removal; it also moved to realign the parties to make Jackson the plaintiff, and CWS, Home Depot, and Citibank the defendants (just before Citibank had dropped out entirely).  The District Court denied the motion and remanded the case to state court, holding that Home Depot cannot remove under CAFA because CAFA's \"any defendant\" excludes defendants to counterclaim class actions.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, citing Circuit precedent that hung on this Court's decision in Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U.\u00a0S. 100 (1941).  We granted certiorari to decide whether the lower court's reading of Shamrock Oil is correct and whether CAFA allows third-party defendants like Home Depot to remove an action to federal court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All agree that the one dispute that now constitutes this lawsuit--Jackson's class action against Home Depot and CWS--would have been removable under CAFA had it been present from the start of a case.  Is it ineligible for removal just because it was not contained in the filing that launched this lawsuit?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several lower courts think so.  In holding as much, they have created what Judge Niemeyer called a \"loophole\" that only this Court \"can now rectify.\"  Palisades Collections LLC v. Shorts, 552 F. 3d 327, 345 (CA4 2008) (dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  The potential for that \"loophole\" was first spotted by a civil procedure scholar writing shortly after CAFA took effect. See Tidmarsh, Finding Room for State Class Actions in a Post-CAFA World: The Case of the Counterclaim Class Action, 35 W. St. U. L. Rev. 193, 198 (2007).  The article outlined a \"tactic\" for plaintiffs to employ if they wanted to thwart a defendant's attempt to remove a class action to federal court under CAFA: They could raise their class-action claim as a counterclaim and \"hope that CAFA does not authorize removal.\" Ibid.  In a single stroke, the article observed, a defendant's routine attempt to collect a debt from a single consumer could be leveraged into an unremovable attack on the defendant's \"credit and lending policies\" brought on behalf of a whole class of plaintiffs--all in the very state courts that CAFA was designed to help class-action defendants avoid.  Id., at 199.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The article is right to call this approach a tactic; it subverts CAFA's evident aims.  I cannot imagine why a Congress eager to remedy alleged state-court abuses in class actions would have chosen to discriminate between two kinds of defendants, neither of whom had ever chosen the allegedly abusive state forum, all based on whether the claim against them had initiated the lawsuit or arisen just one filing later (in the countercomplaint).  Of course, what finally matters is the text, and in reading texts we must remember that \"no legislation pursues its purposes at all costs,\" Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U.\u00a0S. 522, 525-526 (1987) (per curiam); Congress must often strike a balance between competing purposes.  But a good interpreter also reads a text charitably, not lightly ascribing irrationality to its author; and I can think of no rational purpose for this limit on which defendants may remove.  Even respondent does not try to defend its rationality, suggesting instead that it simply reflects a legislative compromise.  Yet there is no evidence that anyone thought of this potential loophole before CAFA was enacted, and it is hard to believe that any of CAFA's would-be opponents agreed to vote for it in exchange for this way of keeping some cases in state court.  The question is whether the uncharitable reading here is inescapable--whether, unwittingly or despite itself, Congress adopted text that compels this bizarre result.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are different schools of thought about statutory interpretation, but I would have thought this much was common ground: If it is hard to imagine any purpose served by a proposed interpretation of CAFA, if that reading appears nowhere in the statutory or legislative history or our cases on CAFA, if it makes no sense as a policy matter, it had better purport to reflect the best reading of the text, or any decision embracing it is groundless.  Indeed, far from relegating the text to an afterthought, our shared approach to statutory interpretation, \"as we always say, begins with the text.\"  Ross v. Blake, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 4) (emphasis added).  After all, as we have unanimously declared, a \"plain and unambiguous\" text \"must\" be enforced \"according to its terms.\" Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 560 U.\u00a0S. 242, 251 (2010).  And yet, though the text and key term here is \"any defendant,\" 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71453(b), the majority has not one jot or tittle of analysis on the plain meaning of \"defendant.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any such analysis would have compelled a different result.  According to legal as well as standard dictionary definitions available in 2005, a \"defendant\" is a \"person sued in a civil proceeding,\" Black's Law Dictionary 450 (8th ed. 2004), and the term is \"opposed to\" (contrasted with) the word \"plaintiff,\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 591 (2002) (Webster).  See also 4 Oxford English Dictionary 377 (2d ed. 1989) (OED) (\"[a] person sued in a court of law; the party in a suit who defends; opposed to plaintiff\").  What we have before us is a civil proceeding in which Home Depot is not a plaintiff and is being sued.  So Home Depot is a defendant, as that term is ordinarily understood.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact that Home Depot is considered a \"third-party defendant\" changes nothing here.  See N. C. Rule Civ. Proc. 14(a) (2018).  Adjectives like \"third-party\" \"modify nouns--they pick out a subset of a category that possesses a certain quality.\"  Weyerhaeuser Co. v. United States Fish and Wildlife Serv., 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 8).  They do not \"alter the meaning of the word\" that they modify.  Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc., 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 6).  And so, just as a \"\u00a0'critical habitat'\u00a0\" is a habitat, Weyerhaeuser Co., supra, at ___ (slip op., at 9), and \"\u00a0'full costs'\u00a0\" are costs, Rimini Street, Inc., supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7), zebra finches are finches and third-party defendants are, well, defendants.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If further confirmation were needed, it could be found in CAFA's use of the word \"any\" to modify \"defendant.\"  Unlike the general removal provision, which allows removal by \"the defendant or the defendants,\" \u00a71441(a), CAFA's authorization extends to \"any defendant.\" \u00a71453(b) (emphasis added).  As we have emphasized repeatedly, \"\u00a0'the word \"any\" has an expansive meaning, that is, \"one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.\"\u00a0'\u00a0\"  Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.\u00a0S. 214, 219-220 (2008) (quoting United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.\u00a0S. 1, 5 (1997), in turn quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 97 (1976)).  In case after case, we have given effect to this expansive sense of \"any.\"  See Small v. United States, 544 U.\u00a0S. 385, 396 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (collecting cases).  So too here: Contrary to the Court's analysis, Congress's use of \"any\" covers defendants of \"whatever kind,\" Ali, supra, at 220, including third-party defendants like petitioner.  \"In concluding that 'any' means not what it says, but rather 'a subset of any,' the Court distorts the plain meaning of the statute and departs from established principles of statutory construction.\"  Small, supra, at 395 (Thomas, J., dissenting).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, unless third-party defendants like Home Depot differ in some way that is relevant to removal (as a matter of text, precedent, or common sense),2 they fall within CAFA's coverage of \"any defendant.\"  \u00a71453(b).\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent and the majority contend that Congress meant to incorporate into CAFA a specialized sense of \"defendant,\" derived from its use in the general removal statute, \u00a71441.  And in \u00a71441, they assert, \"defendant\" refers only to an original defendant--one named in the plaintiff's complaint.  As I will show, they are mistaken about \u00a71441.  See Part IV, infra.  But even if that general removal law were best read to leave out third-party defendants, there would be ample grounds to conclude that such defendants are covered by CAFA.  And the majority's and respondent's objections to this reading of CAFA, based on comparisons to other federal laws, are unconvincing.\nA\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first basis for reading CAFA to extend more broadly than \u00a71441 is that CAFA's text is broader.  As discussed, see supra, at 10, CAFA sweeps in \"any defendant,\" \u00a71453(b) (emphasis added), in contrast to \u00a71441's \"the defendant or the defendants.\"  So even if we read the latter phrase narrowly, we would have to acknowledge that \"Congress did not adopt that ready alternative.\" Advocate Health Care Network v. Stapleton, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 8).  \"Instead, it added language whose most natural reading is to enable\" any defendant to remove, and \"[t]hat drafting decision indicates that Congress did not in fact want\" to replicate in CAFA the (purportedly) narrower reach of \u00a71441.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent scoffs at the idea that the word \"any\" could make the difference.  In his view, \"any defendant\" in CAFA means \"any one of the defendants,\" not \"any kind of defendant.\"  Thus, he contends, if \u00a71441 covers only one kind of defendant--the original kind, the kind named in a complaint--CAFA must do the same.  On this account, CAFA refers to \"any defendant\" only because it was meant to eliminate (for class actions) \u00a71441's requirement that all \"the defendants\" agree to remove.  Respondent is right that the word \"any\" in CAFA eliminated the defendant-unanimity rule.  But the modifier's overall effect on the plain meaning of CAFA's removal provision is what counts in a case interpreting CAFA; and that effect is to guarantee a broad reach for the word \"defendant.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor is it baffling how \"any\" could be expansive in the way respondent finds so risible.  In ordinary language, replacing \"the Xs\" with \"any X\" will often make the term \"X\" go from covering only paradigm instances of X to covering all cases.  Compare:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Visitors to the prison may not use the phones except at designated times.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Visitors to the prison may not use any phone except at designated times.\"\nOn a natural reading, \"the phones\" refers to telephones provided by the prison, whereas \"any phone\" includes visitors' cellphones.  Likewise, even if the phrase \"the defendant\" reached only original defendants, the phrase \"any defendant\" would presumptively encompass all kinds.  Again, putting the word \"any\" into a \"phrase .\u00a0.\u00a0. suggests a broad meaning.\" Ali, 552 U.\u00a0S., at 218-219.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In fact, the text makes it indisputable that CAFA's \"any defendant\" is broader in some ways.  CAFA reaches at least two sets of defendants left out by \u00a71441: in-state (or \"forum\") defendants, and nondiverse defendants.  See \u00a7\u00a71332(d)(2), 1453(b).  So respondent and the majority are reduced to claiming that when CAFA says \"any defendant,\" it is stretching farther than \u00a71441's \"the defendant\" in some directions but not others--picking up forum defendants and nondiverse defendants while avoiding all contact with third-party defendants.  But the shape of \"any\" is not so contorted.  If context shows that \"any defendant\" covers some additional kinds, common sense tells us it presumptively covers the others.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent's answer from precedent backfires.  Against our many cases reading the word \"any\" capaciously (which is to say, naturally), see Small, 544 U.\u00a0S., at 396 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (collecting cases), he cites two cases that assigned the word a narrower scope.  But in both, context compelled that departure from plain meaning.  In United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 631-632 (1818), we read \"any person\" to refer exclusively to those over whom the United States had jurisdiction, but only because that was the undisputed scope of other instances of the same phrase in the same Act.  Here, by contrast, even the majority agrees that petitioner's reading of \"any defendant\" in CAFA is \"plausible.\" Ante, at 5.  And in Small, supra, at 388-389, the Court read \"any court\" to refer only to domestic courts because of the \"legal presumption that Congress ordinarily intends its statutes to have domestic, not extraterritorial, application.\"  No presumption helps respondent here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, our presumptions in this area cut against the majority and respondent's view.  That view insists on reading CAFA's \"any defendant\" narrowly, to match the allegedly narrower scope of \"the defendant\" in \u00a71441.  But our case law teaches precisely that CAFA should not be read as narrowly as \u00a71441.  While removal under \u00a71441 is presumed narrow in various ways out of respect for States' \"rightful independence,\" Shamrock Oil, 313 U.\u00a0S., at 109, we have expressly limited this \"antiremoval\" presumption to cases interpreting \u00a71441.  As Justice Ginsburg recently wrote for the Court:\n\"[N]o antiremoval presumption attends cases invoking CAFA, which Congress enacted to facilitate adjudication of certain class actions in federal court.  See Standard Fire Ins. Co., 568 U.\u00a0S., at 595 ('CAFA's primary objective' is to 'ensur[e] \"Federal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance.\"\u00a0' (quoting \u00a72(b)(2), 119 Stat. 5)); S. Rep. No. 109-14, p. 43 (2005) (CAFA's 'provisions should be read broadly, with a strong preference that interstate class actions should be heard in a federal court if properly removed by any defendant.').\" Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Co. v. Owens, 574 U.\u00a0S. 81, 89 (2014) (emphasis added).\nSo the strongest argument for reading \u00a71441 to exclude third-party defendants is an interpretive canon that we have pointedly refused to apply to CAFA.  Our precedent on this point is thus a second basis--apart from the plain meaning of \"any defendant\"--for holding that CAFA covers third-party defendants even if \u00a71441 does not.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent and the majority object that this reading ignores the backdrop against which CAFA was enacted and the significance of CAFA's contrast with the language of other (subject-matter-specific) removal statutes.  And to these objections, respondent adds a third and bolder claim: that CAFA does not empower petitioner to remove because it does not create removal authority at all, but only channels removals already authorized by \u00a71441 (on which petitioner cannot rely in this case).  All three objections fail.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In respondent's telling, it has been the uniform view of the lower courts that a third-party defendant is not among \"the defendants\" empowered to remove under \u00a71441.  Since those courts' decisions studded the legal \"backdrop\" when Congress enacted CAFA, respondent contends, we should presume CAFA used \"defendant\" in the same narrow sense.  But this story exaggerates both the degree of lower court harmony and the salience of the resulting \"backdrop\" to Congress's work on CAFA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, though respondent repeatedly declares that the lower courts have reached a \"consensus,\" see Brief for Respondent i, 1, 14, 19, 32, 35, they have not.  \"Several cases .\u00a0.\u00a0. have permitted removal on the basis of a third party claim where a separate and independent controversy is stated.\"  Carl Heck Engineers, Inc. v. Lafourche Parish Police Jury, 622 F. 2d 133, 135-136 (CA5 1980) (collecting cases).  Before CAFA, at least a half-dozen district courts took this view.3  And though courts of appeals rarely get to opine on this issue (because \u00a71447(d) blocks most appeals from district court orders sending a removed case back to state court), two Circuits have actually allowed third-party defendants to remove under \u00a71441.  See Texas ex rel. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Tex. System v. Walker, 142 F. 3d 813, 816 (CA5 1998); United Benefit Life Ins. Co. v. United States Life Ins. Co., 36 F. 3d 1063, 1064, n. 1 (CA11 1994).  Even a treatise cited by respondent destroys his \"consensus\" claim, as it admits that courts take \"myriad and diverging views on whether third-party defendants may remove an action.\"  16 J. Moore, D. Coquillette, G. Joseph, & G. Vario, Moore's Federal Practice \u00a7107.41[6] (3d ed. 2019).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, even if the lower courts all agreed, the \"legal backdrop\" created by their decisions would matter only insofar as it told us what we can \"safely assume\" about what Congress \"intend[ed].\"  McFarland v. Scott, 512 U.\u00a0S. 849, 856 (1994).  So the less salient that backdrop would have been to Congress, the less relevant it is to interpreting Congress's actions.  And I doubt the backdrop here would have been very salient.  For one thing, it consisted mostly of trial court decisions; and the lower the courts, the less visible the backdrop.  Indeed, I can find no case where we have read a special meaning into a federal statutory term based mainly on trial court interpretations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But even if several higher courts had spoken--and spoken with one voice--there would be a problem: We have no evidence Congress was listening.  In preparing and passing CAFA, Congress never adverted to third-party defendants' status.  By respondent's admission, Congress was \"silen[t]\" on them in the seven years of hearings, drafts, and debates leading up to CAFA's adoption.  Brief for Respondent 45. Yet if Congress was not thinking about a question, neither was it thinking about lower courts' answer to the question.  So we cannot presume it adopted that answer.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent also thinks we should read CAFA to exclude third-party defendants in light of the contrast between CAFA's \"any defendant\" and the language of two other removal laws that more clearly encompass third-party defendants.  The America Invents Act (AIA), for example, allows \"any party\" to remove a lawsuit involving patent or copyright claims.  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71454(a), (b)(1).  The Bankruptcy Code likewise allows \"[a] party\" to remove in cases related to bankruptcy.  \u00a71452(a).  Thus, respondent says, when Congress wanted to include more than original defendants, it knew how.  It used terms like \"any party\" and \"a party\"--as CAFA did not.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Note, however, that the cited terms would have covered even original plaintiffs, whom no one thinks CAFA meant to reach (and for good reason, see Part II, supra).  So CAFA's terms had to be narrower than (say) the AIA's \"any party,\" regardless of whether CAFA was going to cover third-party defendants.  Its failure to use the AIA's and Bankruptcy Code's broader terms, then, tells us nothing about third-party defendants' status under CAFA.  Only the meaning of CAFA's \"any defendant\" does that.  And it favors petitioner.  See Parts II, III-A, supra.\n3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent's final and most radical argument against petitioner's CAFA claim is that CAFA's removal language does not independently authorize removal at all.  On this view, all that \u00a71453(b) does is \"make a few surgical changes [in certain class-action cases] to the procedures that ordinarily govern removal,\" while the actual power to remove comes from the general removal provision, \u00a71441(a).  Brief for Respondent 49 (emphasis added).  And so, the argument goes, removals under CAFA are still subject to \u00a71441(a)'s restriction to \"civil action[s]\" over which federal courts have \"original jurisdiction.\"  Since this limitation is often read to mean that federal jurisdiction must have existed from the start of the civil action, see Part IV-C, infra, and that was not the case here, no removal is possible.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The premise of this objection is as weak as it is audacious.  If CAFA does not authorize removal, then neither does \u00a71441.  After all, they use the same operative language, with the one providing that a class action \"may be removed,\" \u00a71453(b), and the other providing that a civil action \"may be removed,\" \u00a71441(a).  So \u00a71453(b) must, after all, be its own font of removal power and not a conduit for removals sourced by \u00a71441(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent argues that this reading of CAFA's \u00a71453(b) would render it unconstitutional.  The argument is as follows: Section 1453(b) provides that a \"class action\" may be removed, but it does not specify that the class action must fall within federal courts' jurisdiction.  So if \u00a71453(b) were a separate source of removal authority, it would authorize removals of class actions over which federal courts lacked jurisdiction, contrary to Article III of the Constitution.  By contrast, \u00a71441(a) limits itself to authorizing removal of cases over which federal courts have \"original jurisdiction.\"  Thus, only if \u00a71441(a)--including its jurisdictional limit--governs the removals described in CAFA will CAFA's removal language be constitutional.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This argument fails.  Section 1453 implicitly limits removal to class actions where there is minimal diversity, thus satisfying Article III.  After all, \u00a71453(a) incorporates the definition of \"class action\" found in the first paragraph of \u00a71332(d).  See \u00a71332(d)(1).  But the very next paragraph, \u00a71332(d)(2), codifies the part of CAFA that created federal jurisdiction over class actions involving minimal diversity.  This proves that the class actions addressed by CAFA's removal language, in \u00a71453(b), are those involving minimal diversity, as described in \u00a71332(d).  In fact, respondent effectively concedes that \u00a71453(b) applies only to actions described in \u00a71332(d), since the latter is also what codifies those CAFA-removal rules that respondent does acknowledge, see Brief for Respondent 52--the requirements of more than $5 million in controversy but only minimal diversity, see \u00a71332(d)(2).  Because CAFA's removal language in \u00a71453(b) applies only to class actions described in \u00a71332(d), it raises no constitutional trouble to read \u00a71453(b) as its own source of removal authority and not a funnel for \u00a71441(a).\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So far I have accepted, arguendo, the majority and respondent's view that third-party defendants are not covered by the general removal provision, \u00a71441.  But I agree with petitioner that this is incorrect.  On a proper reading of \u00a71441, too, third-party defendants are \"defendants\" entitled to remove.  Though a majority of District Courts would disagree, their exclusion of third-party defendants has rested (in virtually every instance) on a misunderstanding of a previous case of ours, and the mere fact that this misreading has spread is no reason for us to go along with it.  Nor, contrary to the majority, does a refusal to recognize third-party defendants under \u00a71441 find support in our precedent embracing the so-called \"well-pleaded complaint\" rule, which is all about how a plaintiff can make its case unremovable, not about which defendants may seek removal in those cases that can be removed.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Look at lower court cases excluding third-party defendants from \u00a71441.  Trace their lines of authority--the cases and sources they cite, and those they cite--and the lines will invariably converge on one point: our decision in Shamrock Oil.  But nothing in that case justifies the common reading of \u00a71441 among the lower courts, a reading that treats some defendants who never chose the state forum differently from others.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary matter, Shamrock Oil is too sensible to produce such an arbitrary result.  That case involved a close ancestor of today's general removal provision, one that allowed removal of certain state-court actions at the motion of \"the defendant or defendants therein.\"  313 U.\u00a0S., at 104, n. 1.  And our holding was simple: If A sues B in state court, and B brings a counterclaim against A, this does not then allow A to remove the case to federal court.  As the original plaintiff who chose the forum, A does not get to change its mind now.  That is all that Shamrock Oil held.  The issue of third-party defendants never arose.  And none of the Court's three rationales would support a bar on removal by parties other than original plaintiffs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shamrock Oil looked to statutory history, text, and purpose.  As to history, it noted that removal laws had evolved to give the power to remove first to \"defendants,\" then to \"\u00a0'either party, or any one or more of the plaintiffs or defendants,'\u00a0\" and finally to \"defendants\" again.  The last revision must have been designed to withdraw removal power from someone, we inferred, and the only candidate was the plaintiff.  Id., at 105-108.  Second, we said there was no basis in the text for distinguishing mere plaintiffs from plaintiffs who had been countersued, so we would treat them the same; neither could remove. Id., at 108.  Third, we offered a policy rationale: \"[T]he plaintiff, having submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the state court, was not entitled to avail himself of a right of removal conferred only on a defendant who has not submitted himself to the jurisdiction.\"  Id., at 106.  In this vein, we quoted a House Report calling it \"\u00a0'just and proper to require the plaintiff to abide his selection of a forum.'\u00a0\"  Ibid., n. 2 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 1078, 49th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1886)).  So history, language, and logic demanded that original plaintiffs remain unable to remove even if countersued.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0None of these considerations applies to third-party defendants.  If anything, all three point the other way.  First, the statutory history cited by the Court shows that Congress (and the Shamrock Oil Court itself) took \"the plaintiffs or defendants\" to be jointly exhaustive categories.  By that logic, since third-party defendants are certainly not plaintiffs--in any sense--they must be \"defendants\" under \u00a71441.  Cf. Webster 591 (defining \"defendant\" as \"opposed to plaintiff\"); 4 OED 377 (same).  Second, and relatedly, the text of the general removal statute, then and now, does not distinguish original from third-party defendants when it comes to granting removal power--any more than it had distinguished plaintiffs who were and were not countersued when it came to withdrawing the right to remove, as Shamrock Oil emphasized.  And finally, Shamrock Oil's focus on fairness--reflected in its point that plaintiffs may fairly be stuck with the forum they chose--urges the opposite treatment for third-party defendants.  Like original defendants, they never chose to submit themselves to the state-court forum.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, all three grounds for excluding original plaintiffs in Shamrock Oil actually support allowing third-party defendants to remove under \u00a71441.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent leans on his claim that District Courts to address the issue have reached a \"consensus\" that Shamrock Oil bars third-party defendants from removing.  But as we saw above, rumors of a \"consensus\" have been greatly exaggerated. See Part III-B-1, supra.  And in any case, no interpretive principle requires leaving intact the lower courts' misreading of a case of ours.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certainly there is no reason to presume that Congress embraces the lower courts' majority view.  For one thing, the cases distorting \u00a71441 postdate the last revision of the relevant statutory language, so they could not have informed Congress's view of what it was signing onto.  And it would be naive to assume that Congress now agrees with those lower court cases just because it has not reacted to them.  Congress does not accept the common reading of every law it leaves alone.  Because life is short, the U.\u00a0S. Code is long, and court cases are legion, it normally takes more than a court's misreading of a law to rouse Congress to issue a correction.  That is why \"\u00a0'Congressional inaction lacks persuasive significance' in most circumstances.\"  Star Athletica, L. L. C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc., 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 17) (quoting Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U.\u00a0S. 633, 650 (1990); quotation altered).  In particular, \"it is inappropriate to give weight to 'Congress' unenacted opinion' when construing judge-made doctrines, because doing so allows the Court to create law and then 'effectively codif[y]' it 'based only on Congress' failure to address it.'\u00a0\" Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc., 573 U.\u00a0S. 258, 299 (2014) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  Because the decisions misreading Shamrock Oil are not a reliable indicator of Congress's intent regarding \u00a71441, we owe them no deference.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, according to the majority, reading \u00a71441 to include third-party defendants would run afoul of our precedent establishing the \"well-pleaded complaint\" rule (WPC rule).  Assuming that I have been able to reconstruct the majority's argument from this rule accurately, I think it rests on a non sequitur.  The WPC rule is all about a plaintiff's ability to choose the forum in which its case is heard, by controlling whether there is federal jurisdiction; the rule has nothing to do with the division of labor or authority among defendants.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the WPC rule, we consider only the plaintiff's claims to see if there is federal-question jurisdiction.  Whether the defendant raises federal counterclaims (or even federal defenses) is irrelevant.  See, e.g., Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc., 535 U.\u00a0S. 826, 831 (2002).  Likewise, in a case involving standard diversity jurisdiction (based on complete diversity under \u00a71332(a) rather than minimal diversity under CAFA), it is \"the sum demanded .\u00a0.\u00a0. in the initial pleading\" that determines whether the amount in controversy is large enough.  \u00a71446(c)(2).  In both kinds of cases, a federal court trying to figure out if it has \"original jurisdiction,\" as required for removal of cases under \u00a71441(a), must shut its eyes to the defendant's filings.  Only the plaintiff's complaint counts.  So says the WPC rule.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But that is all about jurisdiction.  The majority and respondent would take things a step further.  Even after assuring itself of jurisdiction, they urge, a court should consult only the plaintiff's complaint to see if a party is a \"defendant\" empowered to remove under \u00a71441.  Since third-party defendants (by definition) are not named until the countercomplaint, they are not \u00a71441 \"defendants.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I cannot fathom why this rule about who is a \"defendant\" should follow from the WPC rule about when there is federal jurisdiction.  And the majority makes no effort to fill the logical gap; it betrays almost no awareness of the gap, drawing the relevant inference in two conclusory sentences.  See ante, at 6.  But since this Court's reasons for the WPC rule have sounded in policy, the argument could only be that the same policy goals would support today's restriction on who is a \u00a71441 \"defendant.\"4  What are the policy goals behind the WPC rule?  We have described them as threefold.  See Holmes Group, Inc., 535 U.\u00a0S., at 831-832.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First,\n\"since the plaintiff is 'the master of the complaint,' the well-pleaded-complaint rule enables him, 'by eschewing claims based on federal law, .\u00a0.\u00a0. to have the cause heard in state court.'  Caterpillar Inc., [482 U.\u00a0S.,] at 398-399.  [Allowing a defendant's counterclaims or defenses to create federal-question jurisdiction], in contrast, would leave acceptance or rejection of a state forum to the master of the counterclaim.  It would allow a defendant to remove a case brought in state court under state law, thereby defeating a plaintiff's choice of forum, simply by raising a federal counterclaim.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this concern is not implicated here; adopting petitioner's reading of \"defendant\" would in no way reduce the extent of a plaintiff's control over the forum.  Plaintiffs would be able to keep state-law cases in state court no matter what we held about \u00a71441, and any cases removable by third-party defendants would have been removable by original defendants anyway.  In other words, the issue here is who can remove under that provision, not which cases can be removed.  However we resolved that \"who\" question, removability under \u00a71441(a) would still require cases to fall within federal courts' \"original jurisdiction,\" \u00a71441(a), and that would still turn just on the plaintiff's choices--on whether the plaintiff had raised federal claims (or sued diverse parties for enough money).  So a case that a plaintiff had brought \"in state court under state law,\" id., at 832, would remain beyond federal jurisdiction, and thus unremovable under \u00a71441(a), even if we held that third-party defendants are \"defendants\" under that provision.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the same token, such a holding would not undermine the second policy justification that Holmes gave for the WPC rule: namely, to avoid \"radically expand[ing] the class of removable cases, contrary to the '[d]ue regard for the rightful independence of state governments.'\u00a0\" Id., at 832.  As noted, our decision on the scope of \u00a71441's \"defendants\" would not expand the class of removable cases at all, because it would have no impact on whether a case fell within federal courts' jurisdiction.  It would only expand the set of people (\"the defendants\") who would have to consent to such removal: Now third-party and original defendants would have to agree.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority declares that treating third-party defendants as among \"the defendants\" under \u00a71441 \"makes little sense.\" Ante, at 8.  Perhaps its concern is that such a ruling would make no meaningful difference since third-party defendants would still be powerless to remove unless they secured the consent of the original defendants, who are their adversaries in litigation.  But for one thing, there may be cases in which original defendants do consent.  Though original and third-party defendants are rivals as to claims brought by the one against the other, they may well agree that a federal forum would be preferable.  After all, neither will have chosen the state forum in which both find themselves prior to removal.5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More to the point, even if third-party defendants could not secure the agreement needed to remove an entire civil action under \u00a71441(a), counting them as \"defendants\" under \u00a71441 would make a difference by allowing them to invoke \u00a71441(c)(2), which would permit them to remove certain claims (not whole actions) without original defendants' consent.  See Part I-B, supra.  Being able to remove claims under \u00a71441(c)(2) has, in fact, been the main benefit to third-party defendants in those jurisdictions that have ruled that they are \"defendants\" under \u00a71441.  See Carl Heck, 622 F.\u00a02d, at 136.  But this effect of such a ruling is immune to the objection that it would \"radically expand the class of removable cases\" since \u00a71441(c)(2) does not address the removal of a whole case (a \"civil action\") at all, but only of some claims within a case--and only those that could have been brought in federal court from the start, \"in a separate suit from that filed by the original plaintiff.\"  Id., at 136.  Notably, then, any claims that were raised by the original plaintiff would get to remain in state court.  Here too, the WPC rule's concern to avoid \"radically expand[ing] the class of removable cases\" is just not implicated.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This leaves Holmes's final rationale for the WPC rule: that it promotes \"clarity and ease of administration\" in the resolution of procedural disputes. 535 U.\u00a0S., at 832.  But petitioner's and respondent's views on who is a \"defendant\" are equally workable, so this last factor does not cut one way or the other.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, the actual WPC rule, which limits the filings courts may consult in determining if they have jurisdiction, is based on policy concerns that do not arise here.  There is, therefore, no justification for inventing an ersatz WPC rule to limit which filings may be consulted by courts deciding who is a \"defendant\" under \u00a71441.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All the resources of statutory interpretation confirm that under CAFA and \u00a71441, third-party defendants are defendants.  I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0In this opinion, we use the term \"third-party counterclaim defendant\" to refer to a party first brought into the case as an additional defendant to a counterclaim asserted against the original plaintiff.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Section 1441(a) provides that \"any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or the defendants, to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending.\"\nFootnote 3\u00a0Even the dissent declines to rely on the dictionary definition of \"defendant\" alone, as following that approach to its logical conclusion would require overruling Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U.\u00a0S. 100 (1941).  See post, at 10, n.\u00a02.  \nFootnote 4\u00a0Section 1453(b) provides that \"[a] class action may be removed to a district court of the United States in accordance with section 1446 (except that the 1-year limitation under section 1446(c)(1) shall not apply), without regard to whether any defendant is a citizen of the State in which the action is brought, except that such action may be removed by any defendant without the consent of all defendants.\"\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Supplemental jurisdiction covers those claims \"so related\" to federal claims that they are \"part of the same case or controversy under Article III,\" 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71367(a), in that they \"derive from a common nucleus of operative fact.\"  Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.\u00a0S. 715, 725 (1966).\nFootnote 2\u00a0That is true only of counterdefendants--original plaintiffs who are countersued by their original defendant.  For one thing, it is hard to say that these plaintiffs fall under the plain meaning of \"defendant,\" when the word \"defendant\" is defined in opposition to the word \"plaintiff.\" See Webster 591; 4 OED 377.  Moreover, as original plaintiffs, these parties chose the state forum (unlike original or third-party defendants), so it makes less sense to give them a chance to remove the case from that same forum.  Finally, our decision in Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U.\u00a0S. 100 (1941), confirms this reasoning and result.  See Part IV-A, infra.\nFootnote 3\u00a0See Carl Heck Engineers, Inc. v. Lafourche Parish Police Jury, 622 F. 2d 133, 135 (CA5 1980) (collecting four); Charter Medical Corp. v. Friese, 732 F. Supp. 1160 (ND Ga. 1989); Patient Care, Inc. v. Freeman, 755 F. Supp. 644 (NJ 1991).\nFootnote 4\u00a0The Court insists that its position is based on \"statutory context,\" not the logic behind the well-pleaded complaint rule.  Ante, at 6-7. But the only context to which the Court points is our precedent establishing the well-pleaded complaint rule.  Ante, at 6.  It is that rule--the rule that federal jurisdiction over an action turns entirely on the plaintiff's complaint--that leads the Court to think furthermore that \"\u00a0'the defendant' to [an] action is the defendant to that complaint.\"  Ibid.\nFootnote 5\u00a0Or perhaps the majority fears that petitioner's position would make it harder for original defendants under \u00a71441(a), by requiring them to get the consent of the third-party defendants against whom they have just brought suit.  But this is an illusory problem.  Original defendants hoping to remove under \u00a71441(a) without having to get their adversaries to agree could simply remove the case before roping in any third-party defendants.\n\n\n","24":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJAM ET AL. v. INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORP.(2019)\nNo. 17-1011\nArgued: October 31, 2018Decided: February 27, 2019\n\n\nIn 1945, Congress passed the International Organizations Immunities Act (IOIA), which, among other things, grants international organizations the \"same immunity from suit .\u00a0.\u00a0. as is enjoyed by foreign governments.\"  22 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7288a(b).  At that time, foreign governments were entitled to virtually absolute immunity as a matter of international grace and comity.  In 1952, the State Department adopted a more restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity, which Congress subsequently codified in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71602.  The FSIA gives foreign sovereign governments presumptive immunity from suit, \u00a71604, subject to several statutory exceptions, including, as relevant here, an exception for actions based on commercial activity with a sufficient nexus with the United States, \u00a71605(a)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent International Finance Corporation (IFC), an IOIA international organization, entered into a loan agreement with Coastal Gujarat Power Limited, a company based in India, to finance the construction of a coal-fired power plant in Gujarat.  Petitioners sued the IFC, claiming that pollution from the plant harmed the surrounding air, land, and water.  The District Court, however, held that the IFC was immune from suit because it enjoyed the virtually absolute immunity that foreign governments enjoyed when the IOIA was enacted.  The D. C. Circuit affirmed in light of its decision in Atkinson v. Inter-American Development Bank, 156 F.\u00a03d 1335.\nHeld:\u00a0The IOIA affords international organizations the same immunity from suit that foreign governments enjoy today under the FSIA.  Pp.\u00a06-15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The IOIA \"same as\" formulation is best understood as making international organization immunity and foreign sovereign immunity continuously equivalent.  The IOIA is thus like other statutes that use similar or identical language to place two groups on equal footing.  See, e.g., Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71981(a), 1982; Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72674.  Whatever the ultimate purpose of international organization immunity may be, the immediate purpose of the IOIA immunity provision is expressed in language that Congress typically uses to make one thing continuously equivalent to another.  Pp.\u00a06-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0That reading is confirmed by the \"reference canon\" of statutory interpretation.  When a statute refers to a general subject, the statute adopts the law on that subject as it exists whenever a question under the statute arises.  In contrast, when a statute refers to another statute by specific title, the referenced statute is adopted as it existed when the referring statute was enacted, without any subsequent amendments.  Federal courts have often relied on the reference canon to harmonize a statute with an external body of law that the statute refers to generally.  The IOIA's reference to the immunity enjoyed by foreign governments is to an external body of potentially evolving law, not to a specific provision of another statute.  Nor is it a specific reference to a common law concept with a fixed meaning.  The phrase \"immunity enjoyed by foreign governments\" is not a term of art with substantive content but rather a concept that can be given scope and content only by reference to the rules governing foreign sovereign immunity.  Pp.\u00a09-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0The D. C. Circuit relied upon Atkinson's conclusion that the reference canon's probative force was outweighed by an IOIA provision authorizing the President to alter the immunity of an international organization.  But the fact that the President has power to modify otherwise applicable immunity rules is perfectly compatible with the notion that those rules might themselves change over time in light of developments in the law governing foreign sovereign immunity.  The Atkinson court also did not consider the opinion of the State Department, whose views in this area ordinarily receive \"special attention,\" Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela v. Helmerich & Payne Int'l Drilling Co., 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, and which took the position that immunity rules of the IOIA and the FSIA were linked following the FSIA's enactment.  Pp.\u00a011-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0The IFC contends that interpreting the IOIA immunity provision to grant only restrictive immunity would defeat the purpose of granting immunity in the first place, by subjecting international organizations to suit under the commercial activity exception of the FSIA for most or all of their core activities.  This would be particularly true with respect to international development banks, which use the tools of commerce to achieve their objectives.  Those concerns are inflated.  The IOIA provides only default rules.  An international organization's charter can always specify a different level of immunity, and many do.  Nor is it clear that the lending activity of all development banks qualifies as commercial activity within the meaning of the FSIA.  But even if it does qualify as commercial, that does not mean the organization is automatically subject to suit, since other FSIA requirements must also be met, see, e.g., 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71603, 1605(a)(2).

At the time the IOIA was enacted, foreign governments enjoyed virtually absolute immunity from suit.  Today that immunity is more limited.  Most significantly, foreign governments are not immune from actions based upon certain kinds of commercial activity in which they engage.  This case requires us to determine whether the IOIA grants international organizations the virtually absolute immunity foreign governments enjoyed when the IOIA was enacted, or the more limited immunity they enjoy today.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent International Finance Corporation is an international organization headquartered in the United States.  The IFC finances private-sector development projects in poor and developing countries around the world.  About 10 years ago, the IFC financed the construction of a power plant in Gujarat, India.  Petitioners are local farmers and fishermen and a small village.  They allege that the power plant has polluted the air, land, and water in the surrounding area.  Petitioners sued the IFC for damages and injunctive relief in Federal District Court, but the IFC claimed absolute immunity from suit.  Petitioners argued that the IFC was entitled under the IOIA only to the limited or \"restrictive\" immunity that foreign governments currently enjoy.  We agree.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the wake of World War II, the United States and many of its allies joined together to establish a host of new international organizations.  Those organizations, which included the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank, were designed to allow member countries to collectively pursue goals such as stabilizing the international economy, rebuilding war-torn nations, and maintaining international peace and security.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anticipating that those and other international organizations would locate their headquarters in the United States, Congress passed the International Organizations Immunities Act of 1945, 59 Stat. 669.  The Act grants international organizations a set of privileges and immunities, such as immunity from search and exemption from property taxes.  22 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7288a(c), 288c.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The IOIA defines certain privileges and immunities by reference to comparable privileges and immunities enjoyed by foreign governments.  For example, with respect to customs duties and the treatment of official communications, the Act grants international organizations the privileges and immunities that are \"accorded under similar circumstances to foreign governments.\"  \u00a7288a(d).  The provision at issue in this case provides that international organizations \"shall enjoy the same immunity from suit and every form of judicial process as is enjoyed by foreign governments.\"  \u00a7288a(b).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The IOIA authorizes the President to withhold, withdraw, condition, or limit the privileges and immunities it grants in light of the functions performed by any given international organization.  \u00a7288.  Those privileges and immunities can also be expanded or restricted by a particular organization's founding charter.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the IOIA was enacted in 1945, courts looked to the views of the Department of State in deciding whether a given foreign government should be granted immunity from a particular suit.  If the Department submitted a recommendation on immunity, courts deferred to the recommendation.  If the Department did not make a recommendation, courts decided for themselves whether to grant immunity, although they did so by reference to State Department policy.  Samantar v. Yousuf, 560 U.\u00a0S. 305, 311-312 (2010).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Until 1952, the State Department adhered to the classical theory of foreign sovereign immunity.  According to that theory, foreign governments are entitled to \"virtually absolute\" immunity as a matter of international grace and comity.  At the time the IOIA was enacted, therefore, the Department ordinarily requested, and courts ordinarily granted, immunity in suits against foreign governments.  Ibid.; Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.\u00a0S. 480, 486 (1983).1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1952, however, the State Department announced that it would adopt the newer \"restrictive\" theory of foreign sovereign immunity.  Under that theory, foreign governments are entitled to immunity only with respect to their sovereign acts, not with respect to commercial acts.  The State Department explained that it was adopting the restrictive theory because the \"widespread and increasing practice on the part of governments of engaging in commercial activities\" made it \"necessary\" to \"enable persons doing business with them to have their rights determined in the courts.\"  Letter from Jack B. Tate, Acting Legal Adviser, Dept. of State, to Acting Attorney General Philip B. Perlman (May 19, 1952), reprinted in 26 Dept. State Bull. 984-985 (1952).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1976, Congress passed the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.  The FSIA codified the restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity but transferred \"primary responsibility for immunity determinations from the Executive to the Judicial Branch.\"  Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U.\u00a0S. 677, 691 (2004); see 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71602.  Under the FSIA, foreign governments are presumptively immune from suit.  \u00a71604.  But a foreign government may be subject to suit under one of several statutory exceptions.  Most pertinent here, a foreign government may be subject to suit in connection with its commercial activity that has a sufficient nexus with the United States.  \u00a71605(a)(2).\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The International Finance Corporation is an international development bank headquartered in Washington, D.\u00a0C.  The IFC is designated as an international organization under the IOIA.  Exec. Order No. 10680, 3 CFR 86 (1957); see 22 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7282, 288.  One hundred eighty-four countries, including the United States, are members of the IFC.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The IFC is charged with furthering economic development \"by encouraging the growth of productive private enterprise in member countries, particularly in the less developed areas, thus supplementing the activities of\" the World Bank.  Articles of Agreement of the International Finance Corporation, Art.\u00a0I, Dec. 5, 1955, 7 U. S. T. 2193, T. I. A. S. No. 3620.  Whereas the World Bank primarily provides loans and grants to developing countries for public-sector projects, the IFC finances private-sector development projects that cannot otherwise attract capital on reasonable terms.  See Art. I(i), ibid.  In 2018, the IFC provided some $23 billion in such financing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The IFC expects its loan recipients to adhere to a set of performance standards designed to \"avoid, mitigate, and manage risks and impacts\" associated with development projects.  IFC Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability, Jan. 1, 2012, p.\u00a02, \u00b61.  Those standards are usually more stringent than any established by local law.  The IFC includes the standards in its loan agreements and enforces them through an internal review process.  Brief for Respondent 10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2008, the IFC loaned $450 million to Coastal Gujarat Power Limited, a company located in India.  The loan helped finance the construction of a coal-fired power plant in the state of Gujarat.  Under the terms of the loan agreement, Coastal Gujarat was required to comply with an environmental and social action plan designed to protect areas around the plant from damage.  The agreement allowed the IFC to revoke financial support for the project if Coastal Gujarat failed to abide by the terms of the agreement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The project did not go smoothly.  According to the IFC's internal audit, Coastal Gujarat did not comply with the environmental and social action plan in constructing and operating the plant.  The audit report criticized the IFC for inadequately supervising the project.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2015, a group of farmers and fishermen who live near the plant, as well as a local village, sued the IFC in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  They claimed that pollution from the plant, such as coal dust, ash, and water from the plant's cooling system, had destroyed or contaminated much of the surrounding air, land, and water.  Relying on the audit report, they asserted several causes of action against the IFC, including negligence, nuisance, trespass, and breach of contract.  The IFC maintained that it was immune from suit under the IOIA and moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court, applying D.\u00a0C. Circuit precedent, concluded that the IFC was immune from suit because the IOIA grants international organizations the virtually absolute immunity that foreign governments enjoyed when the IOIA was enacted.  172 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 104, 108-109 (DC 2016) (citing Atkinson v. Inter-American Development Bank, 156 F.\u00a03d 1335 (CADC 1998)).  The D.\u00a0C. Circuit affirmed in light of its precedent.  860 F.\u00a03d 703 (2017).  Judge Pillard wrote separately to say that she would have decided the question differently were she writing on a clean slate.  Id., at 708 (concurring opinion).  Judge Pillard explained that she thought the D.\u00a0C. Circuit \"took a wrong turn\" when it \"read the IOIA to grant international organizations a static, absolute immunity that is, by now, not at all the same 'as is enjoyed by foreign governments,' but substantially broader.\"  Ibid.  Judge Pillard also noted that the Third Circuit had expressly declined to follow the D.\u00a0C. Circuit's approach.  See OSS Nokalva, Inc. v. European Space Agency, 617 F.\u00a03d 756 (CA3 2010).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari.  584 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The IFC contends that the IOIA grants international organizations the \"same immunity\" from suit that foreign governments enjoyed in 1945.  Petitioners argue that it instead grants international organizations the \"same immunity\" from suit that foreign governments enjoy today.  We think petitioners have the better reading of the statute.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The language of the IOIA more naturally lends itself to petitioners' reading.  In granting international organizations the \"same immunity\" from suit \"as is enjoyed by foreign governments,\" the Act seems to continuously link the immunity of international organizations to that of foreign governments, so as to ensure ongoing parity between the two.  The statute could otherwise have simply stated that international organizations \"shall enjoy absolute immunity from suit,\" or specified some other fixed level of immunity.  Other provisions of the IOIA, such as the one making the property and assets of international organizations \"immune from search,\" use such noncomparative language to define immunities in a static way.  22 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7288a(c).  Or the statute could have specified that it was incorporating the law of foreign sovereign immunity as it existed on a particular date.  See, e.g., Energy Policy Act of 1992, 30 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7242(c)(1) (certain land patents \"shall provide for surface use to the same extent as is provided under applicable law prior to October 24, 1992\").  Because the IOIA does neither of those things, we think the \"same as\" formulation is best understood to make international organization immunity and foreign sovereign immunity continuously equivalent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That reading finds support in other statutes that use similar or identical language to place two groups on equal footing.  In the Civil Rights Act of 1866, for instance, Congress established a rule of equal treatment for newly freed slaves by giving them the \"same right\" to make and enforce contracts and to buy and sell property \"as is enjoyed by white citizens.\"  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71981(a), 1982.  That provision is of course understood to guarantee continuous equality between white and nonwhite citizens with respect to the rights in question.  See Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.\u00a0S. 409, 427-430 (1968).  Similarly, the Federal Tort Claims Act states that the \"United States shall be liable\" in tort \"in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72674.  That provision is most naturally understood to make the United States liable in the same way as a private individual at any given time.  See Richards v. United States, 369 U.\u00a0S. 1, 6-7 (1962).  Such \"same as\" provisions dot the statute books, and federal and state courts commonly read them to mandate ongoing equal treatment of two groups or objects.  See, e.g., Adamson v. Bowen, 855 F.\u00a02d 668, 671-672 (CA10 1988) (statute making United States liable for fees and expenses \"to the same extent that any other party would be liable under the common law or under the terms of any statute\" interpreted to continuously tie liability of United States to that of any other party); Kugler's Appeal, 55 Pa. 123, 124-125 (1867) (statute making the procedure for dividing election districts \"the same as\" the procedure for dividing townships interpreted to continuously tie the former procedure to the latter).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The IFC objects that the IOIA is different because the purpose of international organization immunity is entirely distinct from the purpose of foreign sovereign immunity.  Foreign sovereign immunity, the IFC argues, is grounded in the mutual respect of sovereigns and serves the ends of international comity and reciprocity.  The purpose of international organization immunity, on the other hand, is to allow such organizations to freely pursue the collective goals of member countries without undue interference from the courts of any one member country.  The IFC therefore urges that the IOIA should not be read to tether international organization immunity to changing foreign sovereign immunity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But that gets the inquiry backward.  We ordinarily assume, \"absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary,\" that \"the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used.\"  American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson, 456 U.\u00a0S. 63, 68 (1982) (alterations omitted).  Whatever the ultimate purpose of international organization immunity may be--the IOIA does not address that question--the immediate purpose of the immunity provision is expressed in language that Congress typically uses to make one thing continuously equivalent to another.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The more natural reading of the IOIA is confirmed by a canon of statutory interpretation that was well established when the IOIA was drafted.  According to the \"reference\" canon, when a statute refers to a general subject, the statute adopts the law on that subject as it exists whenever a question under the statute arises.  2 J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction \u00a7\u00a75207-5208 (3d ed. 1943).  For example, a statute allowing a company to \"collect the same tolls and enjoy the same privileges\" as other companies incorporates the law governing tolls and privileges as it exists at any given moment.  Snell v. Chicago, 133 Ill. 413, 437-439, 24 N.\u00a0E. 532, 537 (1890).  In contrast, a statute that refers to another statute by specific title or section number in effect cuts and pastes the referenced statute as it existed when the referring statute was enacted, without any subsequent amendments.  See, e.g., Culver v. People ex\u00a0rel. Kochersperger, 161 Ill. 89, 95-99, 43 N.\u00a0E. 812, 814-815 (1896) (tax-assessment statute referring to specific article of another statute does not adopt subsequent amendments to that article).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Federal courts have often relied on the reference canon, explicitly or implicitly, to harmonize a statute with an external body of law that the statute refers to generally.  Thus, for instance, a statute that exempts from disclosure agency documents that \"would not be available by law to a party .\u00a0.\u00a0. in litigation with the agency\" incorporates the general law governing attorney work-product privilege as it exists when the statute is applied.  FTC v. Grolier Inc., 462 U.\u00a0S. 19, 20, 26-27 (1983) (emphasis added); id., at 34, n.\u00a06 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Likewise, a general reference to federal discovery rules incorporates those rules \"as they are found on any given day, today included,\" El Encanto, Inc. v. Hatch Chile Co., 825 F.\u00a03d 1161, 1164 (CA10 2016), and a general reference to \"the crime of piracy as defined by the law of nations\" incorporates a definition of piracy \"that changes with advancements in the law of nations,\" United States v. Dire, 680 F.\u00a03d 446, 451, 467-469 (CA4 2012).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same logic applies here.  The IOIA's reference to the immunity enjoyed by foreign governments is a general rather than specific reference.  The reference is to an external body of potentially evolving law--the law of foreign sovereign immunity--not to a specific provision of another statute.  The IOIA should therefore be understood to link the law of international organization immunity to the law of foreign sovereign immunity, so that the one develops in tandem with the other.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The IFC contends that the IOIA's reference to the immunity enjoyed by foreign governments is not a general reference to an external body of law, but is instead a specific reference to a common law concept that had a fixed meaning when the IOIA was enacted in 1945.  And because we ordinarily presume that \"Congress intends to incorporate the well-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses,\" Neder v. United States, 527 U.\u00a0S. 1, 23 (1999), the IFC argues that we should read the IOIA to incorporate what the IFC maintains was the then-settled meaning of the \"immunity enjoyed by foreign governments\": virtually absolute immunity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But in 1945, the \"immunity enjoyed by foreign governments\" did not mean \"virtually absolute immunity.\"  The phrase is not a term of art with substantive content, such as \"fraud\" or \"forgery.\"  See id., at 22; Gilbert v. United States, 370 U.\u00a0S. 650, 655 (1962).  It is rather a concept that can be given scope and content only by reference to the rules governing foreign sovereign immunity.  It is true that under the rules applicable in 1945, the extent of immunity from suit was virtually absolute, while under the rules applicable today, it is more limited.  But in 1945, as today, the IOIA's instruction to grant international organizations the immunity \"enjoyed by foreign governments\" is an instruction to look up the applicable rules of foreign sovereign immunity, wherever those rules may be found--the common law, the law of nations, or a statute.  In other words, it is a general reference to an external body of (potentially evolving) law.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In ruling for the IFC, the D.\u00a0C. Circuit relied upon its prior decision in Atkinson, 156 F.\u00a03d 1335.  Atkinson acknowledged the reference canon, but concluded that the canon's probative force was \"outweighed\" by a structural inference the court derived from the larger context of the IOIA.  Id., at 1341.  The Atkinson court focused on the provision of the IOIA that gives the President the authority to withhold, withdraw, condition, or limit the otherwise applicable privileges and immunities of an international organization, \"in the light of the functions performed by any such international organization.\"  22 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7288.  The court understood that provision to \"delegate to the President the responsibility for updating the immunities of international organizations in the face of changing circumstances.\"  Atkinson, 156 F.\u00a03d, at 1341.  That delegation, the court reasoned, \"undermine[d]\" the view that Congress intended the IOIA to in effect update itself by incorporating changes in the law governing foreign sovereign immunity.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We do not agree.  The delegation provision is most naturally read to allow the President to modify, on a  case-by-case basis, the immunity rules that would otherwise apply to a particular international organization.  The statute authorizes the President to take action with respect to a single organization--\"any such organization\"--in light of the functions performed by \"such organization.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7288.  The text suggests retail rather than wholesale action, and that is in fact how authority under \u00a7288 has been exercised in the past.  See, e.g., Exec. Order No. 12425, 3 CFR 193 (1984) (designating INTERPOL as an international organization under the IOIA but withholding certain privileges and immunities); Exec. Order No. 11718, 3 CFR 177 (1974) (same for INTELSAT).  In any event, the fact that the President has power to modify otherwise applicable immunity rules is perfectly compatible with the notion that those rules might themselves change over time in light of developments in the law governing foreign sovereign immunity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The D.\u00a0C. Circuit in Atkinson also gave no consideration to the opinion of the State Department, whose views in this area ordinarily receive \"special attention.\"  Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela v. Helmerich & Payne Int'l. Drilling Co., 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 9).  Shortly after the FSIA was enacted, the State Department took the position that the immunity rules of the IOIA and the FSIA were now \"link[ed].\"  Letter from Detlev F. Vagts, Office of the Legal Adviser, to Robert M. Carswell, Jr., Senior Legal Advisor, OAS, p.\u00a02 (Mar. 24, 1977).  The Department reaffirmed that view during subsequent administrations, and it has reaffirmed it again here.2  That longstanding view further bolsters our understanding of the IOIA's immunity provision.\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The IFC argues that interpreting the IOIA's immunity provision to grant anything less than absolute immunity would lead to a number of undesirable results.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The IFC first contends that affording international organizations only restrictive immunity would defeat the purpose of granting them immunity in the first place.  Allowing international organizations to be sued in one member country's courts would in effect allow that member to second-guess the collective decisions of the others.  It would also expose international organizations to money damages, which would in turn make it more difficult and expensive for them to fulfill their missions.  The IFC argues that this problem is especially acute for international development banks.  Because those banks use the tools of commerce to achieve their objectives, they may be subject to suit under the FSIA's commercial activity exception for most or all of their core activities, unlike foreign sovereigns.  According to the IFC, allowing such suits would bring a flood of foreign-plaintiff litigation into U.\u00a0S. courts, raising many of the same foreign-relations concerns that we identified when considering similar litigation under the Alien Tort Statute.  See Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2018); Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U.\u00a0S. 108, 116-117 (2013).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The IFC's concerns are inflated.  To begin, the privileges and immunities accorded by the IOIA are only default rules.  If the work of a given international organization would be impaired by restrictive immunity, the organization's charter can always specify a different level of immunity.  The charters of many international organizations do just that.  See, e.g., Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, Art. II, \u00a72, Feb. 13, 1946, 21 U. S. T. 1422, T. I. A. S. No. 6900 (\"The United Nations .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall enjoy immunity from every form of legal process except insofar as in any particular case it has expressly waived its immunity\"); Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, Art.\u00a0IX, \u00a73, Dec. 27, 1945, 60 Stat. 1413, T. I. A. S. No. 1501 (IMF enjoys \"immunity from every form of judicial process except to the extent that it expressly waives its immunity\").  Notably, the IFC's own charter does not state that the IFC is absolutely immune from suit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor is there good reason to think that restrictive immunity would expose international development banks to excessive liability.  As an initial matter, it is not clear that the lending activity of all development banks qualifies as commercial activity within the meaning of the FSIA.  To be considered \"commercial,\" an activity must be \"the type\" of activity \"by which a private party engages in\" trade or commerce.  Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.\u00a0S. 607, 614 (1992); see 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71603(d).  As the Government suggested at oral argument, the lending activity of at least some development banks, such as those that make conditional loans to governments, may not qualify as \"commercial\" under the FSIA.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27-30.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And even if an international development bank's lending activity does qualify as commercial, that does not mean the organization is automatically subject to suit.  The FSIA includes other requirements that must also be met.  For one thing, the commercial activity must have a sufficient nexus to the United States.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71603, 1605(a)(2).  For another, a lawsuit must be \"based upon\" either the commercial activity itself or acts performed in connection with the commercial activity.  See \u00a71605(a)(2).  Thus, if the \"gravamen\" of a lawsuit is tortious activity abroad, the suit is not \"based upon\" commercial activity within the meaning of the FSIA's commercial activity exception.  See OBB Personenverkehr AG v. Sachs, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2015); Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, 507 U.\u00a0S. 349, 356-359 (1993).  At oral argument in this case, the Government stated that it has \"serious doubts\" whether petitioners' suit, which largely concerns allegedly tortious conduct in India, would satisfy the \"based upon\" requirement.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 25-26.  In short, restrictive immunity hardly means unlimited exposure to suit for international organizations.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The International Organizations Immunities Act grants international organizations the \"same immunity\" from suit \"as is enjoyed by foreign governments\" at any given time.  Today, that means that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act governs the immunity of international organizations.  The International Finance Corporation is therefore not absolutely immune from suit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the D.\u00a0C. Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nJustice Kavanaugh took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nBreyer, J., dissenting\n\u2002586 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1011\nBUDHA ISMAIL JAM, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v.

The majority, resting primarily upon the statute's language and canons of interpretation, holds that the statute's reference to \"immunity\" moves with the times.  As a consequence, the statute no longer allows international organizations immunity from lawsuits arising from their commercial activities.  In my view, the statute grants international organizations that immunity--just as foreign governments possessed that immunity when Congress enacted the statute in 1945.  In reaching this conclusion, I rest more heavily than does the majority upon the statute's history, its context, its purposes, and its consequences.  And I write in part to show that, in difficult cases like this one, purpose-based methods of interpretation can often shine a useful light upon opaque statutory language, leading to a result that reflects greater legal coherence and is, as a practical matter, more sound.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The general question before us is familiar: Do the words of a statute refer to their subject matter \"statically,\" as it was when the statute was written?  Or is their reference to that subject matter \"dynamic,\" changing in scope as the subject matter changes over time?  It is hardly surprising, given the thousands of different statutes containing an untold number of different words, that there is no single, universally applicable answer to this question.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fairly recent cases from this Court make that clear.  Compare New Prime Inc. v. Oliveira, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 7) (adopting the interpretation of \"\u00a0'contracts of employment'\u00a0\" that prevailed at the time of the statute's adoption in 1925); Wisconsin Central Ltd. v. United States, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 2) (adopting the meaning of \"\u00a0'money'\u00a0\" that prevailed at the time of the statute's enactment in 1937); Carcieri v. Salazar, 555 U. S. 379, 388 (2009) (interpreting the statutory phrase \"\u00a0'now under Federal jurisdiction'\u00a0\" to cover only those tribes that were under federal jurisdiction at the time of the statute's adoption in 1934); and Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.\u00a0S. 607, 612-613 (1992) (adopting the meaning of \"\u00a0'commercial'\u00a0\" that was \"attached to that term under the restrictive theory\" when the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act was enacted in 1976), with Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 14) (noting that the words \"\u00a0'restraint of trade'\u00a0\" in the Sherman Act have been interpreted dynamically); West v. Gibson, 527 U.\u00a0S. 212, 218 (1999) (interpreting the term \"\u00a0'appropriate'\u00a0\" in Title VII's remedies provision dynamically); and Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U.\u00a0S. 265, 275-276 (1995) (interpreting the term \"\u00a0'involving commerce'\u00a0\" in the Federal Arbitration Act dynamically).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court, like petitioners, believes that the language of the statute itself helps significantly to answer the static\/dynamic question.  See ante, at 7-9.  I doubt that the language itself helps in this case.  Petitioners point to the words \"as is\" in the phrase that grants the international organizations the \"same immunity from suit .\u00a0.\u00a0. as is enjoyed by foreign governments.\"  Brief for Petitioners 23-24.  They invoke the Dictionary Act, which states that \"words used in the present tense include the future\" \"unless the context indicates otherwise.\"  1 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71.  But that provision creates only a presumption.  And it did not even appear in the statute until 1948, after Congress had passed the Immunities Act.  Compare \u00a71, 61 Stat. 633, with \u00a76, 62 Stat. 859.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More fundamentally, the words \"as is enjoyed\" do not conclusively tell us when enjoyed.  Do they mean \"as is enjoyed\" at the time of the statute's enactment?  Or \"as is enjoyed\" at the time a plaintiff brings a lawsuit?  If the former, international organizations enjoy immunity from lawsuits based upon their commercial activities, for that was the scope of immunity that foreign governments enjoyed in 1945 when the Immunities Act became law.  If the latter, international organizations do not enjoy that immunity, for foreign governments can no longer claim immunity from lawsuits based upon certain commercial activities.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71605(a)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Linguistics does not answer the temporal question.  Nor do our cases, which are not perfectly consistent on the matter.  Compare McNeill v. United States, 563 U.\u00a0S. 816, 821 (2011) (present-tense verb in the Armed Career Criminal Act requires applying the law at the time of previous conviction, not the later time when the Act is applied), with Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538 U.\u00a0S. 468, 478 (2003) (present-tense verb requires applying the law \"at the time suit is filed\").  The problem is simple:  \"Without knowing the point in time at which the law speaks, it is impossible to tell what is past and what is present or future.\"  Carr v. United States, 560 U.\u00a0S. 438, 463 (2010) (Alito, J., dissenting).  It is purpose, not linguistics, that can help us here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The words \"same .\u00a0.\u00a0. as,\" in the phrase \"same immunity .\u00a0.\u00a0. as,\" provide no greater help.  The majority finds support for its dynamic interpretation in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which gives all citizens the \"same right\" to make and enforce contracts and to buy and sell property \"as is enjoyed by white citizens.\"  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71981(a), 1982 (emphasis added).  But it is purpose, not words, that read-ily resolves any temporal linguistic ambiguity in that statute.  The Act's objective, like that of the Fourteenth Amendment itself, was a Nation that treated its citizens equally.  Its purpose--revealed by its title, historical context, and other language in the statute--was \"to guarantee the then newly freed slaves the same legal rights that other citizens enjoy.\"  CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, 553 U.\u00a0S. 442, 448 (2008).  Given this purpose, its dynamic nature is obvious.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, judges interpreting the words \"same .\u00a0.\u00a0. as\" have long resolved ambiguity not by looking at the words alone, but by examining the statute's purpose as well.  Compare, e.g., Kugler's Appeal, 55 Pa. 123, 123-125 (1867) (adopting a dynamic interpretation of \"same as\" statute in light of \"plain\" and \"manifest\" statutory purpose); and Gaston v. Lamkin, 115 Mo. 20, 34, 21 S.\u00a0W. 1100, 1104 (1893) (adopting a dynamic interpretation of \"same as\" election statute given the legislature's intent to achieve \"simplicity and uniformity in the conduct of elections\"), with O'Flynn v. East Rochester, 292 N.\u00a0Y. 156, 162, 54 N.\u00a0E. 2d 343, 346 (1944) (adopting a static interpretation of \"same as\" statute given that the legislature \"did not contemplate\" that subsequent changes to a referenced statute would apply (interpreting N.\u00a0Y. Gen. Mun. Law Ann. \u00a7360(5) (West 1934))).  There is no hard-and-fast rule that the statutory words \"as is\" or the statutory words \"same as\" require applying the law as it stands today.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority wrongly believes that it can solve the temporal problem by bringing statutory canons into play.  It relies on what it calls the \"reference canon.\"  That canon, as it appeared more than 75 years ago in Sutherland's book on statutory construction, says that \"when a statute refers to a general subject, the statute adopts the law on that subject as it exists whenever a question under the statute arises.\" Ante, at 9 (citing 2 J. Sutherland, Statu-tory Construction \u00a7\u00a75207-5208 (3d ed. 1943); emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But a canon is at most a rule of thumb.  Indeed, Sutherland himself says that \"[n]o single canon of interpretation can purport to give a certain and unerring answer.\"  2 Sutherland, supra, \u00a74501, p.\u00a0316.  And hornbooks, summarizing case law, have long explained that whether a reference statute adopts the law as it stands on the date of enactment or includes subsequent changes in the law to which it refers is \"fundamentally a question of legislative intent and purpose.\"  Fox, Effect of Modification or Repeal of Constitutional or Statutory Provision Adopted by Reference in Another Provision, 168 A.\u00a0L.\u00a0R. 627, 628 (1947); see also 82 C.\u00a0J.\u00a0S., Statutes \u00a7485, p.\u00a0637 (2009) (\"The question of whether a statute which has adopted another statute by reference will be affected by amendments made to the adopted statute is one of legislative intent and purpose\"); id., at 638 (statute that refers generally to another body of law will ordinarily include subsequent changes in the adopted law only \"as far as the changes are consistent with the purpose of the adopting statute\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, all interpretive roads here lead us to the same place, namely, to context, to history, to purpose, and to consequences.  Language alone cannot resolve the statute's linguistic ambiguity.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Statutory interpretation,\" however, \"is not a game of blind man's bluff.\"  Dole Food Co., 538 U.\u00a0S., at 484 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  We are \"free to consider statutory language in light of a statute's basic purposes,\" ibid., as well as \"\u00a0'the history of the times when it was passed,'\u00a0\" Leo Sheep Co. v. United States, 440 U.\u00a0S. 668, 669 (1979) (quoting United States v. Union Pacific R. Co., 91 U.\u00a0S. 72, 79 (1875)).  In this case, historical context, purpose, and related consequences tell us a great deal about the proper interpretation of the Immunities Act.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congressional reports explain that Congress, acting in the immediate aftermath of World War II, intended the Immunities Act to serve two related purposes.  First, it would \"enabl[e] this country to fulfill its commitments in connection with its membership in international organizations.\"  S.\u00a0Rep. No. 861, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1945); see also id., at 2-3 (explaining that the Immunities Act was \"basic legislation\" expected to \"satisfy in full the requirements of .\u00a0.\u00a0. international organizations conducting activities in the United States\"); H.\u00a0R.\u00a0Rep. No. 1203, 79th Cong., 1st Sess.,\u00a03 (1945) (similar).  And second, it would \"facilitate fully the functioning of international organizations in this country.\"  S. Rep. No. 861, at 3.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I first examine the international commitments that Congress sought to fulfill.  By 1945, the United States had entered into agreements creating several important multilateral organizations, including the United Nations (UN), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).  See id., at 2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The founding agreements for several of these organizations required member states to grant them broad immunity from suit.  The Bretton Woods Agreements, for example, provided that the IMF \"shall enjoy immunity from every form of judicial process except to the extent that it expressly waives its immunity.\"  Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, Art. IX, \u00a73, Dec. 27, 1945, 60 Stat. 1413, T.\u00a0I.\u00a0A.\u00a0S. No. 1501.  UNRRA required members, absent waiver, to accord the organization \"the facilities, privileges, immunities, and exemptions which they accord to each other, including .\u00a0.\u00a0. [i]mmunity from suit and legal process.\"  2 UNRRA, A Compilation of the Resolutions on Policy: First and Second Sessions of the UNRRA Council, Res. No. 32, p.\u00a051 (1944).  And the UN Charter required member states to accord the UN \"such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the fulfillment of its purposes.\"  Charter of the United Nations, Art. 105, 59 Stat. 1053, June 26, 1945, T. S. No. 993.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These international organizations expected the United States to provide them with essentially full immunity.  And at the time the treaties were written, Congress understood that foreign governments normally enjoyed immunity with respect to their commercial, as well as their noncommercial, activities.  Thus, by granting international organizations \"the same immunity from suit\" that foreign governments enjoyed, Congress expected that international organizations would similarly have immunity in both commercial and noncommercial suits.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More than that, Congress likely recognized that immu-nity in the commercial area was even more important for many international organizations than it was for most foreign governments.  Unlike foreign governments, international organizations are not sovereign entities engaged in a host of different activities.  See R. Higgins, Problems & Process: International Law and How We Use It 93 (1994) (organizations do not act with \"\u00a0'sovereign authority,'\u00a0\" and \"to assimilate them to states .\u00a0.\u00a0. is not correct\").  Rather, many organizations (including four of the five I mentioned above) have specific missions that often require them to engage in what U.\u00a0S. law may well consider to be commercial activities.  See infra, at 12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nonetheless, under the majority's view, the immunity of many organizations contracted in scope in 1952, when the State Department modified foreign government immunity to exclude commercial activities.  Most organizations could not rely on the treaty provisions quoted above to supply the necessary immunity.  That is because, unless the treaty provision granting immunity is \"self-executing,\" i.e., automatically applicable, the immunity will not be effective in U.\u00a0S. courts until Congress enacts additional legislation to implement it.  See Medellin v. Texas, 552 U.\u00a0S. 491, 504-505 (2008); but see id., at 546-547 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  And many treaties are not self-executing.  Thus, in the ordinary case, not even a treaty can guarantee immunity in cases arising from commercial activities.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The UN provides a good example.  As noted, the UN Charter required the United States to grant the UN all \"necessary\" immunities, but it was not self-executing.  In 1946, the UN made clear that it needed absolute immunity from suit, including in lawsuits based upon its commercial activities.  See Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, Art.\u00a0II, \u00a72, Feb. 13, 1946, 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0T. 1422, T.\u00a0I.\u00a0A.\u00a0S. No. 6900 (entered into force Apr. 29, 1970); see also App. to S.\u00a0Exec. Rep. No. 91-17, p.\u00a014 (1970) (\"The U.\u00a0N.'s immunity from legal process extends to matters arising out its commercial dealings .\u00a0.\u00a0. \").  But, until Congress ratified that comprehensive immunity provision in 1970, no U.\u00a0S. law provided that immunity but for the Immunities Act.  Id., at 1.  Both the UN and the United States found this circumstance satisfactory because they apparently assumed the Immunities Act extended immunity in cases involving both commercial and noncommercial activities: When Congress eventually (in 1970) ratified the UN's comprehensive immunity provision, the Senate reported that the long delay in ratification \"appears to have been the result of the executive branch being content to operate under the provisions of the\" Immunities Act.  Id., at 2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of this history, how likely is it that Congress, seeking to \"satisfy in full the requirements of .\u00a0.\u00a0. international organizations conducting activities in the United States,\" S. Rep. No. 861, at 2-3 (emphasis added), would have understood the statute to take from many international organizations with one hand the immunity it had given them with the other?  If Congress wished the Act to carry out one of its core purposes--fulfilling the country's international commitments--Congress would not have wanted the statute to change over time, taking on a meaning that would fail to grant not only full, but even partial, immunity to many of those organizations.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress also intended to facilitate international organizations' ability to pursue their missions in the United States.  To illustrate why that purpose is better served by a static interpretation, consider in greater detail the work of the organizations to which Congress wished to provide broad immunity.  Put the IMF to the side, for Congress enacted a separate statute providing it with immunity (absent waiver) in all cases.  See 22 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7286h.  But UNRRA, the World Bank, the FAO, and the UN itself all originally depended upon the Immunities Act for the immunity they sought.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider, for example, the mission of UNRRA.  The United States and other nations created that organization in 1943, as the end of World War II seemed in sight.  Its objective was, in the words of President Roosevelt, to \"\u00a0'assure a fair distribution of available supplies among'\u00a0\" those liberated in World War II, and \"\u00a0'to ward off death by starvation or exposure among these peoples.'\u00a0\"  1 G. Woodbridge, UNRRA: The History of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration 3 (1950).  By the time Congress passed the Immunities Act in 1945, UNRRA had obtained and shipped billions of pounds of food, clothing, and other relief supplies to children freed from Nazi concentration camps and to others in serious need.  3 id., at 429; see generally L. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web 442-513 (2005).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These activities involved contracts, often made in the United States, for transportation and for numerous commercial goods.  See B. Shephard, The Long Road Home: The Aftermath of the Second World War 54, 57-58 (2012).  Indeed, the United States conditioned its participation on UNRRA's spending what amounted to 67% of its budget on purchases of goods and services in the United States.  Id., at 57-58; see also Sawyer, Achievements of UNRRA as an International Health Organization, 37 Am. J. Pub. Health 41, 57 (1947) (describing UNRRA training programs for foreign doctors within the United States, which presumably required entering into contracts); International Refugee Org. v. Republic S. S. Corp., 189 F.\u00a02d 858, 860 (CA4 1951) (describing successor organization's transportation of displaced persons, presumably also under contract).  Would Congress, believing that it had provided the absolute immunity that UNRRA sought and expected, also have intended that the statute be interpreted \"dynamically,\" thereby removing most of the immunity that it had then provided--not only potentially from UNRRA itself but also from other future international organizations with UNRRA-like objectives and tasks?\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This history makes clear that Congress enacted the Immunities Act as part of an effort to encourage international organizations to locate their headquarters and carry on their missions in the United States.  It also makes clear that Congress intended to enact \"basic legislation\" that would fulfill its broad immunity-based commitments to the UN, UNRRA, and other nascent organizations.  S.\u00a0Rep. No. 861, at 2.  And those commitments, of necessity, included immunity from suit in commercial areas, since organizations were buying goods and making contracts in the United States.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To achieve these purposes, Congress enacted legislation that granted necessarily broad immunity.  And that fact strongly suggests that Congress would not have wanted the statute to reduce significantly the scope of immunity that international organizations enjoyed, particularly organizations engaged in development finance, refugee assistance, or other tasks that U.\u00a0S. law could well decide were \"commercial\" in nature.  See infra, at 12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To that extent, an examination of the statute's purpose supports a static, not a dynamic, interpretation of its cross-reference to the immunity of foreign governments.  Unlike the purpose of the Civil Rights Act, the purpose here was not to ensure parity of treatment for international organizations and foreign governments.  Instead, as the Court of Appeals for the D.\u00a0C. Circuit pointed out years ago, the statute's reference to the immunities of \"foreign governments\" was a \"shorthand\" for the immunities those foreign governments enjoyed at the time the Act was passed.  Atkinson v. Inter-American Development Bank, 156 F.\u00a03d 1335, 1340, 1341 (1998).\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now consider the consequences that the majority's reading of the statute will likely produce--consequences that run counter to the statute's basic purposes.  Although the UN itself is no longer dependent upon the Immunities Act, many other organizations, such as the FAO and several multilateral development banks, continue to rely upon that Act to secure immunity, for the United States has never ratified treaties nor enacted statutes that might extend the necessary immunity, commercial and noncommercial alike.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \"commercial activity\" exception to the sovereign immunity of foreign nations is broad.  We have said that a foreign state engages in \"commercial activity\" when it exercises \"\u00a0'powers that can also be exercised by private citizens.'\u00a0\"  Republic of Argentina, 504 U.\u00a0S., at 614.  Thus, \"a contract to buy army boots or even bullets is a 'commercial' activity,\" even if the government enters into the contract to \"fulfil[l] uniquely sovereign objectives.\"  Ibid.; see also H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 94-1487, p.\u00a016 (1976) (\"[A] transaction to obtain goods or services from private parties would not lose its otherwise commercial character because it was entered into in connection with an [Agency for International Development] program\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a result of the majority's interpretation, many of the international organizations to which the United States belongs will discover that they are now exposed to civil lawsuits based on their (U.\u00a0S.-law-defined) commercial activity.  And because \"commercial activity\" may well have a broad definition, today's holding will at the very least create uncertainty for organizations involved in finance, such as the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency.  The core functions of these organizations are at least arguably \"commercial\" in nature; the organizations exist to promote international development by investing in foreign companies and projects across the world.  See Brief for International Bank for Reconstruction and Development et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 1-4; Brief for Member Countries and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency as Amici Curiae 13-15.  The World Bank, for example, encourages development either by guaranteeing private loans or by providing financing from its own funds if private capital is not available.  See Articles of Agreement of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Art.\u00a0I, Dec. 27, 1945, 60 Stat. 1440, T.\u00a0I.\u00a0A.\u00a0S. No. 1502.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some of these organizations, including the International Finance Corporation (IFC), themselves believe they do not need broad immunity in commercial areas, and they have waived it.  See, e.g., Articles of Agreement of the International Finance Corporation, Art. 6, \u00a73, Dec. 5, 1955, 7 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0T. 2214, 264 U. N. T. S. 118 (implemented by 22 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7282g); see also 860 F.\u00a03d 703, 706 (CADC 2017).  But today's decision will affect them nonetheless.  That is because courts have long interpreted their waivers in a manner that protects their core objectives.  See, e.g., Mendaro v. World Bank, 717 F.\u00a02d 610, 614-615 (CADC 1983).  (This very case provides a good example.  The D.\u00a0C. Circuit held below that the IFC's waiver provision does not cover petitioners' claims because they \"threaten the [IFC's] policy discretion.\"  See 860 F.\u00a03d, at 708.)  But today's decision exposes these organizations to potential liability in all cases arising from their commercial activities, without regard to the scope of their waivers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the majority's interpretation, that broad exposure to liability is at least a reasonable possibility.  And that being so, the interpretation undercuts Congress' original objectives and the expectations that it had when it enacted the Immunities Act in 1945.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority's opinion will have a further important consequence--one that more clearly contradicts the statute's objectives and overall scheme.  It concerns the important goal of weeding out lawsuits that are likely bad or harmful--those likely to produce rules of law that interfere with an international organization's public interest tasks.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To understand its importance, consider again that international organizations, unlike foreign nations, are multilateral, with members from many different nations.  See H.\u00a0R.\u00a0Rep. No. 1203, at 1.  That multilateralism is threatened if one nation alone, through application of its own liability rules (by nonexpert judges), can shape the policy choices or actions that an international organization believes it must take or refrain from taking.  Yet that is the effect of the majority's interpretation.  By restricting the immunity that international organizations enjoy, it \"opens the door to divided decisions of the courts of different member states,\" including U.\u00a0S. courts, \"passing judgment on the rules, regulations, and decisions of the international bodies.\"  Broadbent v. Organization of Am. States, 628 F.\u00a02d 27, 35 (CADC 1980); cf. Singer, Jurisdictional Immunity of International Organizations: Human Rights and Functional Necessity Concerns, 36 Va. J. Int'l L. 53, 63-64 (1995) (recognizing that \"[i]t would be inappropriate for municipal courts to cut deep into the region of autonomous decision-making authority of institutions such as the World Bank\").  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many international organizations, fully aware of their moral (if not legal) obligations to prevent harm to others and to compensate individuals when they do cause harm, have sought to fulfill those obligations without compromising their ability to operate effectively.  Some, as I have said, waive their immunity in U.\u00a0S. courts at least in part.  And the D.\u00a0C. Circuit, for nearly 40 years, has interpreted those waivers in a way that protects the organization against interference by any single state.  See, e.g., Mendaro, 717 F.\u00a02d, at 615.  The D.\u00a0C. Circuit allows a lawsuit to proceed when \"insistence on immunity would actually prevent or hinder the organization from conducting its activities.\"  Id., at 617.  Thus, a direct beneficiary of a World Bank loan can generally sue the Bank, because \"the commercial reliability of the Bank's direct loans .\u00a0.\u00a0. would be significantly vitiated\" if \"beneficiaries were required to accept the Bank's obligations without recourse to judicial process.\"  Id., at 618.  Where, however, allowing a suit would lead to \"disruptive interference\" with the organization's functions, the waiver does not apply.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other organizations have attempted to solve the liability\/immunity problem by turning to multilateral, not single-nation, solutions. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The UN, for instance, has agreed to \"make provisions for appropriate modes of settlement of .\u00a0.\u00a0. [d]isputes arising out of contracts or other disputes of a private law character.\"  Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, Art.\u00a0VIII, \u00a729, 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0T. 1438, T.\u00a0I.\u00a0A.\u00a0S. No. 6900.  It generally does so by agreeing to submit commercial disputes to arbitration.  See Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7467, Reporters' Note 7 (1987).  Other organizations, including the IFC, have set up alternative accountability schemes to resolve disputes that might otherwise end up in court.  See World Bank, Inspection Panel: About Us (describing World Bank's three-member \"independent complaints mechanism\" for those \"who believe that they have been .\u00a0.\u00a0. adversely affected by a World Bank-funded project\"), https:\/\/inspectionpanel.org\/ about-us\/about-inspection-panel (as last visited Feb. 25, 2019); Compliance Advisor Ombudsman, How We Work: CAO Dispute Resolution (describing IFC and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency dispute-resolution process, the main objective of which is to help resolve issues raised about the \"social and environmental impacts of IFC\/MIGA projects\"), www.cao-ombudsman.org\/howwework\/ ombudsman.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These alternatives may sometimes prove inadequate.  And, if so, the Immunities Act itself offers a way for America's Executive Branch to set aside an organization's immunity and to allow a lawsuit to proceed in U.\u00a0S. courts.  The Act grants to the President the authority to \"withhold,\" to \"withdraw,\" to \"condition,\" or to \"limit\" any of the Act's \"immunities\" in \"light of the functions performed by any such international organization.\"  22 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7288.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Were we to interpret the statute statically, then, the default rule would be immunity in suits arising from an organization's commercial activities.  But the Executive Branch would have the power to withdraw immunity where immunity is not warranted, as the Act itself provides.  And in making that determination, it could consider whether allowing the lawsuit would jeopardize the organization's ability to carry out its public interest tasks.  In a word, the Executive Branch, under a static interpretation, would have the authority needed to separate lawsuit sheep from lawsuit goats.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the majority's interpretation, by contrast, there is no such flexibility.  The Executive does not have the power to tailor immunity by taking into account the risk of a lawsuit's unjustified interference with institutional objectives or other institutional needs.  Rather, the majority's holding takes away an international organization's immunity (in cases arising from \"commercial\" activities) across the board.  And without a new statute, there is no way to restore it, in whole or in part.  Nothing in the present statute gives the Executive, the courts, or the organization the power to restore immunity, or to tailor any resulting potential liability, where a lawsuit threatens seriously to interfere with an organization's legitimate needs and goals.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the static interpretation comes equipped with flexibility.  It comes equipped with a means to withdraw immunity where justified.  But the dynamic interpretation freezes potential liability into law.  It withdraws immunity automatically and irretrievably, irrespective of institutional harm.  It seems highly unlikely that Congress would have wanted this result.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the end of World War II, many in this Nation saw international cooperation through international organization as one way both to diminish the risk of conflict and to promote economic development and commercial prosperity.  Congress at that time and at the request of many of those organizations enacted the Immunities Act.  Given the differences between international organizations and nation states, along with the Act's purposes and the risk of untoward consequences, I would leave the Immunities Act where we found it--as providing for immunity in both commercial and noncommercial suits.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My decision rests primarily not upon linguistic analysis, but upon basic statutory purposes.  Linguistic methods alone, however artfully employed, too often can be used to justify opposite conclusions.  Purposes, derived from context, informed by history, and tested by recognition of related consequences, will more often lead us to legally sound, workable interpretations--as they have consistently done in the past.  These methods of interpretation can help voters hold officials accountable for their decisions and permit citizens of our diverse democracy to live together productively and in peace--basic objectives in America of the rule of law itself.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect, I dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The immunity was \"virtually\" absolute because it was subject to occasional exceptions for specific situations.  In Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman, 324 U.\u00a0S. 30 (1945), for example, the State Department declined to recommend, and the Court did not grant, immunity from suit with respect to a ship that Mexico owned but did not possess.\nFootnote 2\u00a0See Letter from Roberts B.

DUNN, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, ET AL.  v.  CHRISTOPHER LEE PRICE(2019)\nNo. 18a1053\nArgued: Decided: April 12, 2019\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The application to vacate the stay of execution, presented to Justice Thomas and by him referred to the Court, is granted, and the stays entered by the District Court for the Southern District of Alabama and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit on April 11, 2019, are vacated.  In June 2018, death-row inmates in Alabama whose convictions were final before June 1, 2018, had 30 days to elect to be executed via nitrogen hypoxia.  Ala. Code \u00a715-18-82.1(b)(2).  Price, whose conviction became final in 1999, did not do so, even though the record indicates that all death-row inmates were provided a written election form, and 48 other death-row inmates elected nitrogen hypoxia.  He then waited until February 2019 to file this action and submitted additional evidence today, a few hours before his scheduled execution time.  See Gomez v. United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. Of Cal., 503 U. S. 653, 654 (1992) (per curiam) (\"A court may consider the last-minute nature of an application to stay execution in deciding whether to grant equitable relief.\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting from grant of application to vacate stay.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Should anyone doubt that death sentences in the United States can be carried out in an arbitrary way, let that person review the following circumstances as they have been presented to our Court this evening.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case comes to us on the assumption that executing Christopher Lee Price using Alabama's current three-drug protocol is likely to cause him severe pain and needless suffering.  Price submitted an expert declaration explaining why that is so, and the State \"submitted nothing\" to rebut his expert's assertions.  Price v. Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections, No. 19-11268 (CA11, Apr. 10, 2019), p.\u00a023.  The Court of Appeals thus correctly held that Price satisfied his burden to show a severe risk of pain from lethal injection, \"since the only evidence of record supports that conclusion.\"  Id., at 24.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Price proposed nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative method of execution.  Alabama expressly authorized execution by nitrogen hypoxia in 2018, and state officials have actively worked to develop a hypoxia protocol since that time.  The State is mere months away from finalizing its protocol.  In light of those facts, the Court of Appeals correctly held that nitrogen hypoxia is \"available,\" \"feasible,\" and \"readily implemented\" by the State.  Id., at 15\u221222.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The only remaining question was whether Price could show that death by nitrogen hypoxia would be substantially less painful than death by the existing lethal injection protocol.  To make this showing, Price submitted an academic study on which the Oklahoma Legislature had relied in adopting nitrogen hypoxia as a method of execution.  That study noted that death by nitrogen hypoxia has been described as \"painless,\" \"peaceful,\" and unlikely to cause \"any substantial physical discomfort.\"  Record in No. 1:19-00057 (SD Ala.), pp. 6, 9 (Dkt. 45-2).  It concluded that nitrogen hypoxia is \"an effective and humane alternative to the current methods of capital punishment practiced in Oklahoma.\"  Id., at 2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Crucially, as the District Court noted, the State did not challenge Price's evidence on this question.  It did not question the reliability of the Oklahoma study.  And it did not otherwise dispute (either in the District Court or on appeal) that nitrogen hypoxia was likely to be less painful than the State's lethal injection protocol.  The District Court thus correctly held that \"Price is likely to prevail on the issue of whether execution by nitrogen .\u00a0.\u00a0. would provide a significant reduction in the substantial risk of severe pain Price would incur if he were executed\" by lethal injection.  Price v. Dunn, No. 1:19\u221200057 (SD Ala., Apr. 5, 2019), p. 23.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals found the District Court's determination on this question clearly erroneous.  It reached that conclusion primarily because the version of the Oklahoma study that Price's counsel submitted was \"a preliminary draft report that is stamped with the words 'Do Not Cite.' \"  Price v. Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections, No. 19-11268, at 24.  The Court of Appeals appeared to believe that a \"preliminary\" report could not constitute \"reliable evidence\" on the effects of nitrogen hypoxia.  Id., at\u00a024\u221225.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It turns out, however, that a final version of the same Oklahoma study was published and available.  That version is identical in every relevant respect to the preliminary version that Price submitted.  That is, the final report also describes nitrogen hypoxia as \"painless,\" \"humane,\" and unlikely to cause \"any substantial physical discomfort,\" based on exactly the same evidence discussed in the earlier draft.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Price's counsel, realizing the error, quickly sought to ensure the District Court would be able to consider the final version of the report.  Price filed a new motion for preliminary injunction in the District Court, along with the final report and additional expert declarations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court found this new evidence \"reliable,\" and noted that the State had \"not submit[ted] anything in contradiction.\"  Price v. Dunn (SD Ala., Apr. 11, 2019), p. 13 (Dkt. 49).  The District Court concluded \"based on the current record\" that \"Price has a substantial likelihood of succeeding on the merits.\"  Ibid.  The District Court then considered the remaining stay factors.  Notably, the District Court found that Price had not \"timed his motion in an effort to manipulate the execution.\"  Ibid.  \"Rather, Price, the State and the [District Court] have been proceeding as quickly as possible on this issue since before the execution date was set.\"  Ibid. (emphasis added).  The District Court ultimately concluded that a 60-day stay of the execution was warranted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a08. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State then asked the Court of Appeals to vacate the stay in part because, in its view, the District Court did not have jurisdiction to issue it.  The Court of Appeals had not yet issued its mandate, the appeal remained pending, and, in the State's view, the arguments Price raised in his new motion in the District Court were the same arguments at issue in his pending appeal.  The District Court had rejected the argument that the pending appeal deprived it of jurisdiction; Price, it explained, has \"presented a new motion for preliminary injunction accompanied by new evidence.\"  Id., at 3 (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals refused to vacate the District Court's stay.  It explained that the parties had raised \"substantial questions\" about jurisdiction.  Price v. Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections, No. 19-11268 (CA11, Apr. 11, 2019), p.\u00a02.  \"In light of the jurisdictional questions raised by the parties' motions,\" it stayed Price's execution until further order of the court.  Id., at 3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a010.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shortly before 9 p.m. this evening, the State filed an application to the Justice of this Court who is the Circuit Justice for the Eleventh Circuit.  It was later referred to the Conference.  I requested that the Court take no action until tomorrow, when the matter could be discussed at Conference.  I recognized that my request would delay resolution of the application and that the State would have to obtain a new execution warrant, thus delaying the execution by 30 days.  But in my judgment, that delay was warranted, at least on the facts as we have them now.  During the pendency of our consideration, the State called off this evening's scheduled execution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court nevertheless grants the State's application to vacate the stay, thus preventing full discussion among the Court's Members.  In doing so, it overrides the discretionary judgment of not one, but two lower courts.  Why?  The Court suggests that the reason is delay.  But that suggestion is untenable in light of the District Court's express finding that Price has been \"proceeding as quickly as possible on this issue since before the execution date was set.\"  Order, at 13 (Dkt. 49) (emphasis added).  Surely the District Court is in a better position than we are to gauge whether Price has engaged in undue delay.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court also points out that Price did not elect nitrogen hypoxia within 30 days of the legislature authorizing this method of execution on June 1, 2018.  State law appeared to provide death row inmates only until June 30, 2018, to make the election.  See 2018 Ala. Laws Act 2018-353.  Yet based on the limited information before us, it appears no inmate received a copy of the election form (prepared by a public defender) until June 26, and the State makes no representation about when Price received it other than that it was \"before the end of June.\"  Brief for Appellee in No. 19\u221211268 (CA11), p. 9.  Thus, it is possible that Price was given no more than 72 hours to decide how he wanted to die, notwithstanding the 30-day period prescribed by state law.  That is not a reason to override the lower courts' discretionary determination that the equitable factors warrant a stay.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State also argues that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain Price's new motion for a preliminary injunction.  But as the Court of Appeals appeared to recognize, that jurisdictional question is a substantial one, the answer to which is by no means clear.  See Order, No. 19-11268 (CA11, Apr. 11, 2019), pp. 2\u22123; cf. 16A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a73949.1 (4th ed.) (\"An interlocutory appeal ordinarily suspends the power of the district court to modify the order subject to appeal, but does not oust district-court jurisdiction to continue with proceedings that do not threaten the orderly disposition of the interlocutory appeal\").  To resolve it with minimal briefing on an extraordinarily compressed timeline would be deeply misguided.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is at stake in this case is the right of a condemned inmate not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  At a minimum, \"before acting irretrievably\" to vacate a stay and allow a potentially cruel execution to proceed, the Court should decide whether the District Court did in fact lack jurisdiction to issue the stay.  See Bowersox v. Williams, 517 U.\u00a0S. 345, 347 (1996) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting from grant of application to vacate stay of execution).  \"Appreciation of our own fallibility .\u00a0.\u00a0. demand[s] as much.\"  Ibid.\n*\u00a0*\u00a0*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alabama will soon subject Price to a death that he alleges will cause him severe pain and needless suffering.  It can do so not because Price failed to prove the likelihood of severe pain and not because he failed to identify a known and readily implemented alternative, as this Court has recently required inmates to do.  Instead, Alabama can subject him to that death due to a minor oversight (the submission of a \"preliminary\" version of a final report) and a significant mistake of law by the Court of Appeals (the suggestion that a report marked \"preliminary\" carries no evidentiary value).  These mistakes could be easily remedied by simply allowing the lower courts to consider the final version of the report.  Yet instead of allowing the lower courts to do just that, the Court steps in and vacates the stays that both courts have exercised their discretion to enter.  To proceed in this way calls into question the basic principles of fairness that should underlie our criminal justice system.  To proceed in this matter in the middle of the night without giving all Members of the Court the opportunity for discussion tomorrow morning is, I believe, unfortunate.\n\n\n\n","27":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJIM YOVINO, FRESNO COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS v. AILEEN RIZO(2019)\nNo. 18-272\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 2019\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Per Curiam.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition in this case presents the following question: May a federal court count the vote of a judge who dies before the decision is issued?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the Honorable Stephen Reinhardt, died on March 29, 2018, but the Ninth Circuit counted his vote in cases decided after that date.*  In the present case, Judge Reinhardt was listed as the author of an en banc decision issued on April 9, 2018, 11 days after he passed away.  By counting Judge Reinhardt's vote, the court deemed Judge Reinhardt's opinion to be a majority opinion, which means that it constitutes a precedent that all future Ninth Circuit panels must follow.  See United States v. Caperna, 251 F.\u00a03d 827, 831, n.\u00a02 (2001).  Without Judge Reinhardt's vote, the opinion attributed to him would have been approved by only 5 of the 10 members of the en banc panel who were still living when the decision was filed.  \nAlthough the other five living judges concurred in the judgment, they did so for different reasons.  The upshot is that Judge Reinhardt's vote made a difference.  Was that lawful?\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aileen Rizo, an employee of the Fresno County Office of Education, brought suit against the superintendent of schools, claiming, among other things, that the county was violating the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 77 Stat. 56-57, 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7206(d).  The District Court denied the county's motion for summary judgment, and the Ninth Circuit granted the county's petition for interlocutory review.  A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit vacated the decision of the District Court based on a prior Ninth Circuit decision,  Kouba v. Allstate Ins. Co., 691 F.\u00a02d 873 (1982), that the panel \"believed it was compelled to follow.\"  887 F.\u00a03d 453, 459 (2018) (en banc).  The court then granted en banc review \"to clarify the law, including the vitality and effect of Kouba.\"  Ibid.  Like other courts of appeals, the Ninth Circuit takes the position that a panel decision like that in Kouba can be overruled only by a decision of the en banc court or this Court, see Naruto v. Slater, 888 F.\u00a03d 418, 421 (2018), and therefore a clear purpose of the en banc decision issued on April 9 was to announce a new binding Ninth Circuit interpretation of the Equal Pay Act issue previously addressed by Kouba.  The opinion authored by Judge Reinhardt and issued 11 days after his death purports to do that, but its status as a majority opinion of the en banc court depends on counting Judge Reinhardt's vote.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The opinions issued by the en banc Ninth Circuit state that they were \"Filed April 9, 2018,\" and they were entered on the court's docket on that date.  A footnote at the beginning of the en banc opinion states:\n\"Prior to his death, Judge Reinhardt fully participated in this case and authored this opinion.  The majority opinion and all concurrences were final, and voting was completed by the en banc court prior to his death.\"  887 F.\u00a03d, at 455, n.\u00a0*.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit did not expressly explain why it concluded that it could count Judge Reinhardt's opinion as \"[t]he majority opinion\" even though it was not endorsed by a majority of the living judges at the time of issuance, but the justification suggested by the footnote noted above is that the votes and opinions in the en banc case were inalterably fixed at least 12 days prior to the date on which the decision was \"filed,\" entered on the docket, and released to the public.  This justification is inconsistent with well-established judicial practice, federal statutory law, and judicial precedent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for judicial practice, we are not aware of any rule or decision of the Ninth Circuit that renders judges' votes and opinions immutable at some point in time prior to their public release.  And it is generally understood that a judge may change his or her position up to the very moment when a decision is released.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We endorsed this rule in United States v. American-Foreign S.\u00a0S. Corp., 363 U.\u00a0S. 685 (1960), which interpreted an earlier version of 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a746(c), the statutory provision authorizing the courts of appeals to hear cases en banc.  The current version of this provision permits a circuit to adopt a rule allowing a senior circuit judge to sit on an en banc case under certain circumstances, but at the time of our decision in American-Foreign S.\u00a0S. Corp., this was not allowed.  Instead, only active judges could sit en banc.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a746(c) (1958 ed.).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In American-Foreign S.\u00a0S. Corp., Judge Harold Medina was one of the five active judges on the Second Circuit when the court granted a petition for rehearing en banc.  After briefing was complete but before an opinion issued, Judge Medina took senior status.  When the en banc court issued its decision, the majority opinion was joined by Judge Medina and two active Circuit Judges; the two other active Circuit Judges dissented.  We vacated the judgment and remanded the case, holding that \"[a]n 'active' judge is a judge who has not retired 'from regular active service,'\u00a0\" and \"[a] case or controversy is 'determined' when it is decided.\"  363 U.\u00a0S., at 688.  Because Judge Medina was not in regular active service when the opinion issued, he was \"without power to participate\" in the en banc decision.  Id., at 687, 691; cf., id., at 691-692 (Harlan, J., dissenting).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our holding in American-Foreign S.\u00a0S. Corp. applies with equal if not greater force here.  When the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion in this case, Judge Reinhardt was neither an active judge nor a senior judge.  For that reason, by statute he was without power to participate in the en banc court's decision at the time it was rendered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to \u00a746(c), \u00a746(d) also shows that what the Ninth Circuit did here was unlawful.  That provision states:\n\"A majority of the number of judges authorized to constitute a court or panel thereof, as provided in paragraph (c), shall constitute a quorum.\"\nUnder \u00a746(c), a court of appeals case may be decided by a panel of three judges, and therefore on such a panel two judges constitute a quorum and are able to decide an appeal--provided, of course, that they agree.  Invoking this rule, innumerable court of appeals decisions hold that when one of the judges on a three-judge panel dies, retires, or resigns after an appeal is argued or is submitted for decision without argument, the other two judges on the panel may issue a decision if they agree.  See, e.g., United States v. Allied Stevedoring Corp., 241 F.\u00a02d 925, 927 (CA2 1957); Murray v. National Broadcasting Co., 35 F.\u00a03d 45, 47 (CA2 1994); Singh v. Ashcroft, 121 Fed.

United States, 539 U.\u00a0S. 69, 82 (2003) (\"[S]ettled law permits a quorum to proceed to judgment when one member of the panel dies or is disqualified.\").  With the exception of one recent decision issued by the Ninth Circuit after Judge Reinhardt's death but subsequently withdrawn, see supra, at 1 n., we are aware of no cases in which a court of appeals panel has purported to issue a binding decision that was joined at the time of release by less than a quorum of the judges who were alive at that time.\n *\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because Judge Reinhardt was no longer a judge at the time when the en banc decision in this case was filed, the Ninth Circuit erred in counting him as a member of the majority.  That practice effectively allowed a deceased judge to exercise the judicial power of the United States after his death.  But federal judges are appointed for life, not for eternity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We therefore grant the petition for certiorari, vacate the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor concurs in the judgment.\n\n\nJIM YOVINO, FRESNO COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS v.

BREMERTON SCHOOL DISTRICT(2019)\nNo. 18-12\nArgued: Decided: January 22, 2019\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Statement of Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas, Justice Gorsuch, and Justice Kavanaugh join, respecting the denial of certiorari.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I concur in the denial of the petition for a writ of certiorari because denial of certiorari does not signify that the Court necessarily agrees with the decision (much less the opinion) below.  In this case, important unresolved factual questions would make it very difficult if not impossible at this stage to decide the free speech question that the petition asks us to review.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Joseph Kennedy claims that he lost his job as football coach at a public high school because he engaged in conduct that was protected by the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.  He sought a preliminary injunction awarding two forms of relief: (1) restoration to his job and (2) an order requiring the school to allow him to pray silently on the 50-yard line after each football game.  The latter request appears to depend on petitioner's entitlement to the first--to renewed employment--since it seems that the school would not permit members of the general public to access the 50-yard line at the relevant time.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The key question, therefore, is whether petitioner showed that he was likely to prevail on his claim that the termination of his employment violated his free speech rights, and in order to answer that question it is necessary to ascertain what he was likely to be able to prove regarding the basis for the school's action.  Unfortunately, the answer to this second question is far from clear.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On October 23, 2015, the superintendent wrote to petitioner to explain why the district found petitioner's conduct at the then-most recent football game to be unacceptable.  And in that letter, the superintendent gave two quite different reasons: first, that petitioner, in praying on the field after the game, neglected his responsibility to supervise what his players were doing at that time and, second, that petitioner's conduct would lead a reasonable observer to think that the district was endorsing religion because he had prayed while \"on the field, under the game lights, in BHS-logoed attire, in front of an audience of event attendees.\"  869 F.\u00a03d 813, 819 (CA9 2017).  After two subsequent games, petitioner again kneeled on the field and prayed, and the superintendent then wrote to petitioner, informing him that he was being placed on leave and was forbidden to participate in any capacity in the school football program.  The superintendent's letter reiterated the two reasons given in his letter of October 23.  And the district elaborated on both reasons in an official public statement explaining the reasons for its actions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the case was before the District Court, the court should have made a specific finding as to what petitioner was likely to be able to show regarding the reason or reasons for his loss of employment.  If the likely reason was simply petitioner's neglect of his duties--if, for example, he was supposed to have been actively supervising the players after they had left the field but instead left them unsupervised while he prayed on his own--his free speech claim would likely fail.  Under those circumstances, it would not make any difference that he was praying as opposed to engaging in some other private activity at that time.  On the other hand, his free speech claim would have far greater weight if petitioner was likely to be able to establish either that he was not really on duty at the time in question or that he was on duty only in the sense that his workday had not ended and that his prayer took place at a time when it would have been permissible for him to engage briefly in other private conduct, say, calling home or making a reservation for dinner at a local restaurant.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, the District Court's brief, informal oral decision did not make any clear finding about what petitioner was likely to be able to prove.  Instead, the judge's comments melded the two distinct justifications:\n\"He was still in charge. He was still on the job.  He was still responsible for the conduct of his students, his team.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.  And a reasonable observer, in my judgment, would have seen him as a coach, participating, in fact leading an orchestrated session of faith .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 89.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decision of the Ninth Circuit was even more imprecise on this critical point.  Instead of attempting to pinpoint what petitioner was likely to be able to prove regarding the reason or reasons for his loss of employment, the Ninth Circuit recounted all of petitioner's prayer-related activities over the course of several years, including conduct in which he engaged as a private citizen, such as praying in the stands as a fan after he was suspended from his duties.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If this case were before us as an appeal within our mandatory jurisdiction, our clear obligation would be to vacate the decision below with instructions that the case be remanded to the District Court for proper application of the test for a preliminary injunction, including a finding on the question of the reason or reasons for petitioner's loss of employment.  But the question before us is different.  It is whether we should grant discretionary review, and we generally do not grant such review to decide highly fact-specific questions.  Here, although petitioner's free speech claim may ultimately implicate important constitutional issues, we cannot reach those issues until the factual question of the likely reason for the school district's conduct is resolved.  For that reason, review of petitioner's free speech claim is not warranted at this time.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I thus concur in the denial of the present petition, the Ninth Circuit's understanding of the free speech rights of public school teachers is troubling and may justify review in the future.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit's opinion applies our decision in Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.\u00a0S. 410 (2006), to public school teachers and coaches in a highly tendentious way.  According to the Ninth Circuit, public school teachers and coaches may be fired if they engage in any expression that the school does not like while they are on duty, and the Ninth Circuit appears to regard teachers and coaches as being on duty at all times from the moment they report for work to the moment they depart, provided that they are within the eyesight of students.  Under this interpretation of Garcetti, if teachers are visible to a student while eating lunch, they can be ordered not to engage in any \"demonstrative\" conduct of a religious nature, such as folding their hands or bowing their heads in prayer.  And a school could also regulate what teachers do during a period when they are not teaching by preventing them from reading things that might be spotted by students or saying things that might be overheard.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court certainly has never read Garcetti to go that far.  While Garcetti permits a public employer to regulate employee speech that is part of the employee's job duties, we warned that a public employer cannot convert private speech into public speech \"by creating excessively broad job descriptions.\"  Id., at 424.  If the Ninth Circuit continues to apply its interpretation of Garcetti in future cases involving public school teachers or coaches, review by this Court may be appropriate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is perhaps most troubling about the Ninth Circuit's opinion is language that can be understood to mean that a coach's duty to serve as a good role model requires the coach to refrain from any manifestation of religious faith--even when the coach is plainly not on duty.  I hope that this is not the message that the Ninth Circuit meant to convey, but its opinion can certainly be read that way.  After emphasizing that petitioner was hired to \"communicate a positive message through the example set by his own conduct,\" the court criticized him for \"his media appearances and prayer in the BHS bleachers (while wearing BHS apparel and surrounded by others).\"  869 F.\u00a03d, at 826.  This conduct, in the opinion of the Ninth Circuit, \"signal[ed] his intent to send a message to students and parents about appropriate behavior and what he values as a coach.\"  Ibid.  But when petitioner prayed in the bleachers, he had been suspended.  He was attending a game like any other fan.  The suggestion that even while off duty, a teacher or coach cannot engage in any outward manifestation of religious faith is remarkable.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the petition now before us is based solely on the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment, petitioner still has live claims under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  See Brief in Opposition 11, n. 1.  Petitioner's decision to rely primarily on his free speech claims as opposed to these alternative claims may be due to certain decisions of this Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U.\u00a0S. 872 (1990), the Court drastically cut back on the protection provided by the Free Exercise Clause, and in Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.\u00a0S. 63 (1977), the Court opined that Title VII's prohibition of discrimination on the basis of religion does not require an employer to make any accommodation that imposes more than a de minimis burden.  In this case, however, we have not been asked to revisit those decisions.\n\n\nJOSEPH A. KENNEDY v. BREMERTON SCHOOL DISTRICT\non petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\nNo. 18-12.\u2003Decided January 22, 2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Statement of Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas, Justice Gorsuch, and Justice Kavanaugh join, respecting the denial of certiorari.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I concur in the denial of the petition for a writ of certiorari because denial of certiorari does not signify that the Court necessarily agrees with the decision (much less the opinion) below.  In this case, important unresolved factual questions would make it very difficult if not impossible at this stage to decide the free speech question that the petition asks us to review.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Joseph Kennedy claims that he lost his job as football coach at a public high school because he engaged in conduct that was protected by the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.  He sought a preliminary injunction awarding two forms of relief: (1) restoration to his job and (2) an order requiring the school to allow him to pray silently on the 50-yard line after each football game.  The latter request appears to depend on petitioner's entitlement to the first--to renewed employment--since it seems that the school would not permit members of the general public to access the 50-yard line at the relevant time.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The key question, therefore, is whether petitioner showed that he was likely to prevail on his claim that the termination of his employment violated his free speech rights, and in order to answer that question it is necessary to ascertain what he was likely to be able to prove regarding the basis for the school's action.  Unfortunately, the answer to this second question is far from clear.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On October 23, 2015, the superintendent wrote to petitioner to explain why the district found petitioner's conduct at the then-most recent football game to be unacceptable.  And in that letter, the superintendent gave two quite different reasons: first, that petitioner, in praying on the field after the game, neglected his responsibility to supervise what his players were doing at that time and, second, that petitioner's conduct would lead a reasonable observer to think that the district was endorsing religion because he had prayed while \"on the field, under the game lights, in BHS-logoed attire, in front of an audience of event attendees.\"  869 F.\u00a03d 813, 819 (CA9 2017).  After two subsequent games, petitioner again kneeled on the field and prayed, and the superintendent then wrote to petitioner, informing him that he was being placed on leave and was forbidden to participate in any capacity in the school football program.  The superintendent's letter reiterated the two reasons given in his letter of October 23.  And the district elaborated on both reasons in an official public statement explaining the reasons for its actions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the case was before the District Court, the court should have made a specific finding as to what petitioner was likely to be able to show regarding the reason or reasons for his loss of employment.  If the likely reason was simply petitioner's neglect of his duties--if, for example, he was supposed to have been actively supervising the players after they had left the field but instead left them unsupervised while he prayed on his own--his free speech claim would likely fail.  Under those circumstances, it would not make any difference that he was praying as opposed to engaging in some other private activity at that time.  On the other hand, his free speech claim would have far greater weight if petitioner was likely to be able to establish either that he was not really on duty at the time in question or that he was on duty only in the sense that his workday had not ended and that his prayer took place at a time when it would have been permissible for him to engage briefly in other private conduct, say, calling home or making a reservation for dinner at a local restaurant.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, the District Court's brief, informal oral decision did not make any clear finding about what petitioner was likely to be able to prove.  Instead, the judge's comments melded the two distinct justifications:\n\"He was still in charge. He was still on the job.  He was still responsible for the conduct of his students, his team.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.  And a reasonable observer, in my judgment, would have seen him as a coach, participating, in fact leading an orchestrated session of faith .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 89.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decision of the Ninth Circuit was even more imprecise on this critical point.  Instead of attempting to pinpoint what petitioner was likely to be able to prove regarding the reason or reasons for his loss of employment, the Ninth Circuit recounted all of petitioner's prayer-related activities over the course of several years, including conduct in which he engaged as a private citizen, such as praying in the stands as a fan after he was suspended from his duties.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If this case were before us as an appeal within our mandatory jurisdiction, our clear obligation would be to vacate the decision below with instructions that the case be remanded to the District Court for proper application of the test for a preliminary injunction, including a finding on the question of the reason or reasons for petitioner's loss of employment.  But the question before us is different.  It is whether we should grant discretionary review, and we generally do not grant such review to decide highly fact-specific questions.  Here, although petitioner's free speech claim may ultimately implicate important constitutional issues, we cannot reach those issues until the factual question of the likely reason for the school district's conduct is resolved.  For that reason, review of petitioner's free speech claim is not warranted at this time.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I thus concur in the denial of the present petition, the Ninth Circuit's understanding of the free speech rights of public school teachers is troubling and may justify review in the future.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit's opinion applies our decision in Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.\u00a0S. 410 (2006), to public school teachers and coaches in a highly tendentious way.

COSBY, JR.(2019)\nNo. 17-1542\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 2019\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, concurring in the denial of certiorari.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In December 2014, petitioner Kathrine McKee publicly accused actor and comedian Bill Cosby of forcibly raping her some 40 years earlier.  McKee contends that Cosby's attorney responded on his behalf by writing and leaking a defamatory letter.  According to McKee, the letter deliberately distorts her personal background to \"damage her reputation for truthfulness and honesty, and further to embarrass, harass, humiliate, intimidate, and shame\" her.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 93a.  She alleges that excerpts of the letter were disseminated via the Internet and published by news outlets around the world.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0McKee filed suit in federal court for defamation under state law, but her case was dismissed.  Applying New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.\u00a0S. 254 (1964), and its progeny, the Court of Appeals concluded that, by disclosing her accusation to a reporter, McKee had \"\u00a0'thrust' herself to the 'forefront'\u00a0\" of the public controversy over \"sexual assault allegations implicating Cosby\" and was therefore a \"limitedpurpose public figure.\"  874 F. 3d 54, 61-62 (CA1 2017) (citing Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.\u00a0S. 323, 345 (1974)).  Under this Court's First Amendment precedents, public figures are barred from recovering damages for defamation unless they can show that the statement at issue was made with \"\u00a0'actual malice'--that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\"  New York Times, supra, at 280.  Like many plaintiffs subject to this \"almost impossible\" standard, McKee was unable to make that showing.  See Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U.\u00a0S. 749, 771 (1985) (White, J., concurring in judgment).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0McKee asks us to review her classification as a limited-purpose public figure.  I agree with the Court's decision not to take up that factbound question.  I write to explain why, in an appropriate case, we should reconsider the precedents that require courts to ask it in the first place.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0New York Times and the Court's decisions extending it were policy-driven decisions masquerading as constitutional law.  Instead of simply applying the First Amendment as it was understood by the people who ratified it, the Court fashioned its own \"\u00a0'federal rule[s]'\u00a0\" by balancing the \"competing values at stake in defamation suits.\"  Gertz, supra, at 334, 348 (quoting New York Times, supra, at 279).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We should not continue to reflexively apply this policy-driven approach to the Constitution.  Instead, we should carefully examine the original meaning of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  If the Constitution does not require public figures to satisfy an actual-malice standard in state-law defamation suits, then neither should we.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the founding of the Nation until 1964, the law of defamation was \"almost exclusively the business of state courts and legislatures.\"  Gertz, supra, at 369-370 (White, J., dissenting).  But beginning with New York Times, the Court \"federalized major aspects of libel law by declaring unconstitutional in important respects the prevailing defamation law in all or most of the 50 States.\"  Gertz, supra, at 370.  These decisions made little effort to ground their holdings in the original meaning of the Constitution.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0New York Times involved a full-page advertisement soliciting support for the civil-rights movement and the legal defense of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  376 U.\u00a0S., at 256-257.  The advertisement asserted that the movement was facing an \"\u00a0'unprecedented wave of terror by those who would deny and negate'\u00a0\" the protections of the Constitution.  Id., at 256.  As an example, the advertisement claimed that \"\u00a0'truckloads of police'\u00a0\" in Montgomery, Alabama, \"\u00a0'armed with shotguns and tear-gas,'\u00a0\" had surrounded a college campus following a student demonstration.  Id., at 257.  It further claimed that \"\u00a0'[w]hen the entire student body protested to state authorities by refusing to re-register, their dining hall was padlocked in an attempt to starve them into submission.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  The advertisement also stated that \"\u00a0'the Southern violators'\u00a0\" had \"\u00a0'answered Dr. King's peaceful protests with intimidation and violence,'\u00a0\" \"\u00a0'bombed his home almost killing his wife and child,'\u00a0\" \"\u00a0'assaulted his person,'\u00a0\" \"\u00a0'arrested him seven times,'\u00a0\" and \"\u00a0'charged him with \"perjury.\"\u00a0'\u00a0\"  Id., at 257-258.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Times made no independent effort to confirm the truth of these claims, and they contained numerous inaccuracies.  Id., at 261.1  The Times eventually retracted the advertisement.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0L. B. Sullivan served as Montgomery's commissioner of public affairs when the advertisement was published.  Id., at 256.  Although none of the \"Southern violators\" was identified in the advertisement, Sullivan filed a libel suit alleging that the statements implicating Montgomery police officers were made \"\u00a0'of and concerning'\u00a0\" him because his responsibilities included supervising the police department.  Id., at 256, 262.  A jury awarded Sullivan $500,000, and the Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed.  Id., at 256.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court reversed.  Id., at 264.  It held that the evidence in the record was \"incapable of supporting the jury's finding\" that the false statements were made about Sullivan, who was not mentioned \"by name or official position\" in the advertisement.  Id., at 288.  The advertisement was an \"impersonal attack on governmental operations\" and could not by \"legal alchemy\" be transformed into \"a libel of an official responsible for those operations.\"  Id., at 292.  This holding was sufficient to resolve the case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the Court also addressed \"the extent to which the constitutional protections for speech and press limit a State's power to award damages in a libel action brought by a public official against critics of his official conduct.\"  Id., at 256.  The Court took it upon itself \"to define the proper accommodation between\" two competing interests--\"the law of defamation and the freedoms of speech and press protected by the First Amendment.\"  Gertz, 418 U.\u00a0S., at 325 (majority opinion).  It consulted a variety of materials to assist it in its analysis: \"general proposition[s]\" about the value of free speech and the inevitability of false statements, New York Times, 376 U.\u00a0S., at 269-272, and n.\u00a013; judicial decisions involving criminal contempt and official immunity, id., at 272-273, 282-283; public responses to the Sedition Act of 1798, id., at 273-277; comparisons of civil libel damages to criminal fines, id., at 277-278; policy arguments against \"self-censorship,\" id., at 278-279; the \"consensus of scholarly opinion,\" id., at 280, n.\u00a020; and state defamation laws, id., at 280-282.  These materials led the Court to promulgate a \"federal rule\" that \"prohibits a public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with 'actual malice'--that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\"  Id., at 279-280.  Although the Court held that its newly minted actual-malice rule was \"required by the First and Fourteenth Amendments,\" id., at 283, it made no attempt to base that rule on the original understanding of those provisions.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0New York Times was \"the first major step in what proved to be a seemingly irreversible process of constitutionalizing the entire law of libel and slander.\"  Dun & Bradstreet, 472 U.\u00a0S., at 766 (White, J., concurring in judgment).  The Court promptly expanded the actual-malice rule to all defamed \"\u00a0'public figures,'\u00a0\" Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.\u00a0S. 130, 134 (1967), which it defined to include private persons who \"thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved,\" Gertz, supra, at 345.  The Court also extended the actual-malice rule to criminal libel prosecutions, Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.\u00a0S. 64 (1964), and even restricted the situations in which private figures could recover for defamation against media defendants, Gertz, supra, at 347, 349; Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U.\u00a0S. 767 (1986).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0None of these decisions made a sustained effort to ground their holdings in the Constitution's original meaning.  As the Court itself acknowledged, \"the rule enunciated in the New York Times case\" is \"largely a judge-made rule of law,\" the \"content\" of which is \"given meaning through the evolutionary process of common-law adjudication.\"  Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.\u00a0S. 485, 501-502 (1984).  Only Justice White grappled with the historical record, and he concluded that \"there are wholly insufficient grounds for scuttling the libel laws of the States in such wholesale fashion, to say nothing of deprecating the reputation interest of ordinary citizens and rendering them powerless to protect themselves.\"  Gertz, supra, at 370 (dissenting opinion).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The constitutional libel rules adopted by this Court in New York Times and its progeny broke sharply from the common law of libel, and there are sound reasons to question whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments displaced this body of common law.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The common law of libel at the time the First and Fourteenth Amendments were ratified did not require public figures to satisfy any kind of heightened liability standard as a condition of recovering damages.  Typically, a defamed individual needed only to prove \"a false written publication that subjected him to hatred, contempt, or ridicule.\"  Dun & Bradstreet, supra, at 765 (White, J., concurring in judgment); see 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *150 (Blackstone); H. Folkard, Starkie on Slander and Libel *156 (H. Wood ed., 4th Eng. ed. 1877) (Starkie).  Malice was presumed in the absence of an applicable privilege, right, or duty.  Id., at *293-*294.  General injury to reputation was also presumed, special damages could be recovered, and punitive damages were available if actual malice was established.  Dun & Bradstreet, supra, at 765 (White, J., concurring in judgment); see Starkie *151, *322-*323; M. Newell, Defamation, Libel and Slander 842-843 (1890) (Newell).  Truth was a defense to a civil libel claim.  See Starkie *170, *528-*530; 4 Blackstone *150-*151.  But where the publication was false, even if the defendant could show that no reputational injury occurred, the prevailing rule was that at least nominal damages were to be awarded.  Dun & Bradstreet, supra, at 765 (White, J., concurring in judgment) (citing Restatement of Torts \u00a7569, Comment b, p.\u00a0166 (1938)); see Starkie *492; Newell 839.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Libel was also a \"common-law crime, and thus criminal in the colonies.\"  Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U.\u00a0S. 250, 254 (1952); see 4 Blackstone *150-*153.  The same principles generally applied, except that truth traditionally was not a defense to libel prosecutions--the crime was intended to punish provocations to a breach of the peace, not the falsity of the statement.  See id., at *150-*151; Starkie *712-*713.  Laws authorizing the criminal prosecution of libel were both widespread and well established at the time of the founding.  See Roth v. United States, 354 U.\u00a0S. 476, 482, and n.\u00a011 (1957); Newell 28-29 (describing colonial statutes dating back to 1645 and 1701).  And they remained so when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, although many States by then allowed truth or good motives to serve as a defense to a libel prosecution.  Beauharnais, supra, at 254-255, and n.\u00a04.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Far from increasing a public figure's burden in a defamation action, the common law deemed libels against public figures to be, if anything, more serious and injurious than ordinary libels.  See 3 Blackstone *124 (\"Words also tending to scandalize a magistrate, or person in a public trust, are reputed more highly injurious than when spoken of a private man\"); 4 id., at *150 (defining libels as \"malicious defamations of any person, and especially a magistrate, made public by either printing, writing, signs, or pictures, in order to provoke him to wrath, or expose him to public hatred, contempt, and ridicule\" (emphasis added)).  Libel of a public official was deemed an offense \"\u00a0'most dangerous to the people, and deserv[ing of] punishment, because the people may be deceived and reject the best citizens to their great injury, and it may be to the loss of their liberties.'\u00a0\"  Newell 533 (quoting Commonwealth v. Clap, 4 Mass. 163, 169-170 (1808)); accord, White v. Nicholls, 3 How. 266, 290 (1845).2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The common law did afford defendants a privilege to comment on public questions and matters of public interest.  Starkie *237-*238.  This privilege extended to the \"public conduct of a public man,\" which was a \"matter of public interest\" that could \"be discussed with the fullest freedom\" and \"made the subject of hostile criticism.\"  Id., at *242.  Under this privilege, \"criticism may reasonably be applied to a public man in a public capacity which might not be applied to a private individual.\"  Ibid.  And the privilege extended to the man's character \"\u00a0'so far as it may respect his fitness and qualifications for the office,'\u00a0\" which was in the interest of the people to know.  White, supra, at 290 (quoting Clap, supra, at 169).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the purposes underlying this privilege also defined its limits.  Thus, the privilege applied only when the facts stated were true.  Starkie *238, n.\u00a04; White, supra, at 290.  And the privilege did not afford the publisher an opportunity to defame the officer's private character.  Starkie *238; see id., at *242 (\"The question for the jury is, whether the writer has transgressed the bounds within which comments upon the character of a public man ought to be confined .\u00a0.\u00a0. \"); ibid. (distinguishing between criticism of public conduct and the \"imputation of motives by which that conduct may be supposed to be actuated\").  \"One may in good faith publish the truth concerning a public officer, but if he states that which is false and aspersive, he is liable therefor however good his motives may be; and the same is true whether the party defamed be an officer or a candidate for an office, elective or appointive.\"  Newell 533 (footnote omitted).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These common-law protections for the \"core private righ[t]\" of a person's \"\u00a0'uninterrupted enjoyment of . . . his reputation'\u00a0\" formed the backdrop against which the First and Fourteenth Amendments were ratified.  Nelson, Adjudication in the Political Branches, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 567 (2007) (quoting 1 Blackstone *129).  Before our decision in New York Times, we consistently recognized that the First Amendment did not displace the common law of libel.  As Justice Story explained,\n\"The liberty of speech, or of the press, has nothing to do with this subject.  They are not endangered by the punishment of libellous publications.  The liberty of speech and the liberty of the press do not authorize malicious and injurious defamation.\"  Dexter v. Spear, 7 F.\u00a0Cas. 624 (No. 3,867) (CC RI 1825).\nThe Court consistently listed libel among the \"well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem.\"  Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.\u00a0S. 568, 571-572 (1942); see, e.g., Beauharnais, supra, at 254-256, and nn.\u00a04-5, 266 (libelous utterances are \"not .\u00a0.\u00a0. within the area of constitutionally protected speech\"); Near v. Minnesota ex\u00a0rel. Olson, 283 U.\u00a0S. 697, 715 (1931) (\"[T]he common law rules that subject the libeler to responsibility for the public offense, as well as for the private injury, are not abolished by the protection extended in our constitutions\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0New York Times marked a fundamental change in the relationship between the First Amendment and state libel law.  Although the Court did not repudiate its earlier statements that libel is constitutionally unprotected, it nevertheless was unable to \"accept the generality of this historic view.\"  Gertz, 418 U.\u00a0S., at 386 (White, J., dissenting). The Court instead observed that it had never upheld the use of libel law \"to impose sanctions upon expression critical of the official conduct of public officials.\"  New York Times, 376 U.\u00a0S., at 268.  In the Court's view, it was \"writing upon a clean slate,\" id., at 299 (Goldberg, J., concurring in result), and thus free to work a \"substantial abridgement\" of the common law of libel based on its balancing of competing interests, Gertz, supra, at 343 (majority opinion).\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are sound reasons to question whether either the First or Fourteenth Amendment, as originally understood, encompasses an actual-malice standard for public figures or otherwise displaces vast swaths of state defamation law.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The First Amendment provides that \"Congress shall make no law .\u00a0.\u00a0. abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\"  See Schneider v. State (Town of Irvington), 308 U.\u00a0S. 147, 160 (1939) (applying these protections against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment).3  Justice White's dissenting opinion in Gertz provides a helpful starting point in interpreting these terms.  Justice White had joined the majority opinion in New York Times.  But after canvassing historical practice under similar state constitutions, treatises, scholarly commentary, the ratification debates, and our precedent, he concluded that \"[s]cant, if any, evidence exists that the First Amendment was intended to abolish the common law of libel, at least to the extent of depriving ordinary citizens of meaningful redress against their defamers.\"  Gertz, 418 U.\u00a0S., at 381; see id., at 380-388.  Justice White later expressed \"doubts about the soundness of the Court's approach\" in New York Times \"and about some of the assumptions underlying it.\"  Dun & Bradstreet, 472 U.\u00a0S., at 767 (concluding that the Court \"struck an improvident balance in the New York Times case\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Historical practice further suggests that protections for free speech and a free press--whether embodied in state constitutions, the First Amendment, or the Fourteenth Amendment--did not abrogate the common law of libel.  See generally Chase, Criticism of Public Officers and Candidates for Office, 23 Am. L. Rev. 346 (1889) (survey-ing American defamation decisions).  Public officers and public figures continued to be able to bring civil libel suits for unprivileged statements without showing proof of actual malice as a condition for liability.  See, e.g., Root v. King, 7 Cow. 613, 628 (N.\u00a0Y. 1827) (lieutenant governor); White, 3 How., at 291 (customs collector); Hamilton v. Eno, 81 N.\u00a0Y. 116, 126 (1880) (assistant health inspector) (citing Lewis v. Few, 5 Johns. 1 (N.\u00a0Y. 1809) (Governor)); Royce v. Maloney, 58 Vt. 437, 447-448, 5 A. 395, 400 (1886) (chief judge and chancellor); Wheaton v. Beecher, 66 Mich. 307, 309-310, 33 N.\u00a0W. 503, 505-506 (1887) (candidate for city comptroller); Prosser v. Callis, 117 Ind. 105, 108-109, 19 N.\u00a0E. 735, 737 (1889) (county auditor).  The States continued to criminalize libel, including of public figures.  E.g., People v. Croswell, 3 Johns. Cas. 337, 377-378, 393-394 (N.\u00a0Y. 1804) (opinion of Kent, J.), and id., at 403-404, 410 (opinion of Lewis, J.) (President Jefferson); Clap, 4 Mass., at 169-170 (auctioneer); see also Commonwealth v. Blanding, 20 Mass. 304, 311-314 (1825) (elaborating on legal standard); Beauharnais, 343 U.\u00a0S., at 254-255 (noting that many States in the first decades after the founding began to allow truth or good motives to serve as a defense, but \"nowhere was there any suggestion that the crime of libel be abolished\").  As of 1952, \"every American jurisdiction .\u00a0.\u00a0. punish[ed] libels directed at individuals.\"  Id., at 255, and n.\u00a05.  And \"Congresses, during the period while [the Fourteenth] Amendment was being considered or was but freshly adopted, approved Constitutions of 'Reconstructed' States that expressly mentioned state libel laws, and also approved similar Constitutions for States erected out of the federal domain.\"  Id., at 293-294, and nn.\u00a07-8 (Jackson, J., dissenting).  Criticism of the public actions of public figures remained privileged, allowing latitude for public discourse and disagreement on matters of public concern.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As against this body of historical evidence, New York Times pointed only to opposition surrounding the Sedition Act of 1798, which prohibited \"any false, scandalous and malicious writing\" against \"the government of the United States, or either house of the Congress .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0, or the President.\"  \u00a72, 1 Stat. 596; see New York Times, 376 U.\u00a0S., at 273-277.  Most prominently, the opinion discusses a report written by James Madison in support of the Virginia Resolutions of 1798, which protested the Act.  Id., at 274-275.  The opinion highlights Madison's view that the press in every State had \"\u00a0'exerted a freedom in canvassing the merits and measures of public men, of every description, which has not been confined to the strict limits of the common law.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 275 (quoting 4 Debates on the Federal Constitution 570 (J. Elliot ed. 1876) (Elliot's Debates)).  It also emphasizes Madison's point that \"\u00a0'[s]ome degree of abuse is inseparable from the proper use of every thing; and in no instance is this more true than in that of the press.'\u00a0\"  376 U.\u00a0S., at 271 (quoting 4 Elliot's Debates 571).  After discussing other opposition to the Act, the Court concluded that \"the attack upon its validity has carried the day in the court of history.\"  376 U.\u00a0S., at 276; see id., at 273-277.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court gleaned from this evidence a \"broad consensus\" that the First Amendment protects \"criticism of government and public officials.\"  Id., at 276.  And the Court further inferred that because the Act allowed truth to be offered as a defense and applied to defamatory statements, a libel law prohibiting only false defamation could still fail First Amendment scrutiny.  Id., at 273-274.  But constitutional opposition to the Sedition Act--a federal law directly criminalizing criticism of the Government--does not necessarily support a constitutional actual-malice rule in all civil libel actions brought by public figures.  Madison did not contend that the Constitution abrogated the common law applicable to these private actions.  Instead, he seemed to contemplate that \"those who administer [the Federal Government]\" retain \"a remedy, for their injured reputations, under the same laws, and in the same tribunals, which protect their lives, their liberties, and their properties.\"  4 Elliot's Debates 573.  Moreover, a central assumption of Madison's view was the historical absence of a national common law \"pervading and operating through\" each colony \"as one society.\"  Id., at 561.  Yet the Court elevated just such a rule to constitutional status in New York Times.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is certainly true that defamation law did not remain static after the founding.  For example, many States acted \"by judicial decision, statute or constitution\" during the early 19th century to allow truth or good motives to serve as a defense to a libel prosecution.  Beauharnais, supra, at 254-255, and n.\u00a04.  Eventually, changing views led to the \"virtual disappearance\" of criminal libel prosecutions involving individuals.  Garrison, 379 U.\u00a0S., at 69.  But these changes appear to have reflected changing policy judgments, not a sense that existing law violated the original meaning of the First or Fourteenth Amendment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, there appears to be little historical evidence suggesting that the New York Times actual-malice rule flows from the original understanding of the First or Fourteenth Amendment.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like Justice White, I assume that New York Times and our other constitutional decisions displacing state defamation law have been popular in some circles, \"but this is not the road to salvation for a court of law.\"  Gertz, 418 U.\u00a0S., at 370 (dissenting opinion).  We did not begin meddling in this area until 1964, nearly 175 years after the First Amendment was ratified.  The States are perfectly capable of striking an acceptable balance between encouraging robust public discourse and providing a meaningful remedy for reputational harm.  We should reconsider our jurisprudence in this area.\n\n\nKATHRINE MAE McKEE v. WILLIAM H. COSBY, jr.\non petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit\nNo. 17-1542\u2003Decided February 19, 2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, concurring in the denial of certiorari.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In December 2014, petitioner Kathrine McKee publicly accused actor and comedian Bill Cosby of forcibly raping her some 40 years earlier.  McKee contends that Cosby's attorney responded on his behalf by writing and leaking a defamatory letter.  According to McKee, the letter deliberately distorts her personal background to \"damage her reputation for truthfulness and honesty, and further to embarrass, harass, humiliate, intimidate, and shame\" her.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 93a.  She alleges that excerpts of the letter were disseminated via the Internet and published by news outlets around the world.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0McKee filed suit in federal court for defamation under state law, but her case was dismissed.  Applying New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.\u00a0S. 254 (1964), and its progeny, the Court of Appeals concluded that, by disclosing her accusation to a reporter, McKee had \"\u00a0'thrust' herself to the 'forefront'\u00a0\" of the public controversy over \"sexual assault allegations implicating Cosby\" and was therefore a \"limitedpurpose public figure.\"  874 F. 3d 54, 61-62 (CA1 2017) (citing Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.\u00a0S. 323, 345 (1974)).  Under this Court's First Amendment precedents, public figures are barred from recovering damages for defamation unless they can show that the statement at issue was made with \"\u00a0'actual malice'--that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\"  New York Times, supra, at 280.  Like many plaintiffs subject to this \"almost impossible\" standard, McKee was unable to make that showing.  See Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U.\u00a0S. 749, 771 (1985) (White, J., concurring in judgment).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0McKee asks us to review her classification as a limited-purpose public figure.  I agree with the Court's decision not to take up that factbound question.  I write to explain why, in an appropriate case, we should reconsider the precedents that require courts to ask it in the first place.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0New York Times and the Court's decisions extending it were policy-driven decisions masquerading as constitutional law.  Instead of simply applying the First Amendment as it was understood by the people who ratified it, the Court fashioned its own \"\u00a0'federal rule[s]'\u00a0\" by balancing the \"competing values at stake in defamation suits.\"  Gertz, supra, at 334, 348 (quoting New York Times, supra, at 279).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We should not continue to reflexively apply this policy-driven approach to the Constitution.  Instead, we should carefully examine the original meaning of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  If the Constitution does not require public figures to satisfy an actual-malice standard in state-law defamation suits, then neither should we.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the founding of the Nation until 1964, the law of defamation was \"almost exclusively the business of state courts and legislatures.\"  Gertz, supra, at 369-370 (White, J., dissenting).  But beginning with New York Times, the Court \"federalized major aspects of libel law by declaring unconstitutional in important respects the prevailing defamation law in all or most of the 50 States.\"  Gertz, supra, at 370.  These decisions made little effort to ground their holdings in the original meaning of the Constitution.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0New York Times involved a full-page advertisement soliciting support for the civil-rights movement and the legal defense of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  376 U.\u00a0S., at 256-257.  The advertisement asserted that the movement was facing an \"\u00a0'unprecedented wave of terror by those who would deny and negate'\u00a0\" the protections of the Constitution.  Id., at 256.  As an example, the advertisement claimed that \"\u00a0'truckloads of police'\u00a0\" in Montgomery, Alabama, \"\u00a0'armed with shotguns and tear-gas,'\u00a0\" had surrounded a college campus following a student demonstration.  Id., at 257.  It further claimed that \"\u00a0'[w]hen the entire student body protested to state authorities by refusing to re-register, their dining hall was padlocked in an attempt to starve them into submission.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  The advertisement also stated that \"\u00a0'the Southern violators'\u00a0\" had \"\u00a0'answered Dr. King's peaceful protests with intimidation and violence,'\u00a0\" \"\u00a0'bombed his home almost killing his wife and child,'\u00a0\" \"\u00a0'assaulted his person,'\u00a0\" \"\u00a0'arrested him seven times,'\u00a0\" and \"\u00a0'charged him with \"perjury.\"\u00a0'\u00a0\"  Id., at 257-258.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Times made no independent effort to confirm the truth of these claims, and they contained numerous inaccuracies.  Id., at 261.1  The Times eventually retracted the advertisement.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0L. B. Sullivan served as Montgomery's commissioner of public affairs when the advertisement was published.  Id., at 256.  Although none of the \"Southern violators\" was identified in the advertisement, Sullivan filed a libel suit alleging that the statements implicating Montgomery police officers were made \"\u00a0'of and concerning'\u00a0\" him because his responsibilities included supervising the police department.  Id., at 256, 262.  A jury awarded Sullivan $500,000, and the Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed.  Id., at 256.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court reversed.  Id., at 264.  It held that the evidence in the record was \"incapable of supporting the jury's finding\" that the false statements were made about Sullivan, who was not mentioned \"by name or official position\" in the advertisement.  Id., at 288.  The advertisement was an \"impersonal attack on governmental operations\" and could not by \"legal alchemy\" be transformed into \"a libel of an official responsible for those operations.\"  Id., at 292.  This holding was sufficient to resolve the case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the Court also addressed \"the extent to which the constitutional protections for speech and press limit a State's power to award damages in a libel action brought by a public official against critics of his official conduct.\"  Id., at 256.  The Court took it upon itself \"to define the proper accommodation between\" two competing interests--\"the law of defamation and the freedoms of speech and press protected by the First Amendment.\"  Gertz, 418 U.\u00a0S., at 325 (majority opinion).  It consulted a variety of materials to assist it in its analysis: \"general proposition[s]\" about the value of free speech and the inevitability of false statements, New York Times, 376 U.\u00a0S., at 269-272, and n.\u00a013; judicial decisions involving criminal contempt and official immunity, id., at 272-273, 282-283; public responses to the Sedition Act of 1798, id., at 273-277; comparisons of civil libel damages to criminal fines, id., at 277-278; policy arguments against \"self-censorship,\" id., at 278-279; the \"consensus of scholarly opinion,\" id., at 280, n.\u00a020; and state defamation laws, id., at 280-282.  These materials led the Court to promulgate a \"federal rule\" that \"prohibits a public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with 'actual malice'--that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\"  Id., at 279-280.  Although the Court held that its newly minted actual-malice rule was \"required by the First and Fourteenth Amendments,\" id., at 283, it made no attempt to base that rule on the original understanding of those provisions.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0New York Times was \"the first major step in what proved to be a seemingly irreversible process of constitutionalizing the entire law of libel and slander.\"  Dun & Bradstreet, 472 U.\u00a0S., at 766 (White, J., concurring in judgment).  The Court promptly expanded the actual-malice rule to all defamed \"\u00a0'public figures,'\u00a0\" Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.\u00a0S. 130, 134 (1967), which it defined to include private persons who \"thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved,\" Gertz, supra, at 345.  The Court also extended the actual-malice rule to criminal libel prosecutions, Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.\u00a0S. 64 (1964), and even restricted the situations in which private figures could recover for defamation against media defendants, Gertz, supra, at 347, 349; Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U.\u00a0S. 767 (1986).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0None of these decisions made a sustained effort to ground their holdings in the Constitution's original meaning.  As the Court itself acknowledged, \"the rule enunciated in the New York Times case\" is \"largely a judge-made rule of law,\" the \"content\" of which is \"given meaning through the evolutionary process of common-law adjudication.\"  Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.\u00a0S. 485, 501-502 (1984).  Only Justice White grappled with the historical record, and he concluded that \"there are wholly insufficient grounds for scuttling the libel laws of the States in such wholesale fashion, to say nothing of deprecating the reputation interest of ordinary citizens and rendering them powerless to protect themselves.\"  Gertz, supra, at 370 (dissenting opinion).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The constitutional libel rules adopted by this Court in New York Times and its progeny broke sharply from the common law of libel, and there are sound reasons to question whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments displaced this body of common law.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The common law of libel at the time the First and Fourteenth Amendments were ratified did not require public figures to satisfy any kind of heightened liability standard as a condition of recovering damages.  Typically, a defamed individual needed only to prove \"a false written publication that subjected him to hatred, contempt, or ridicule.\"  Dun & Bradstreet, supra, at 765 (White, J., concurring in judgment); see 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *150 (Blackstone); H. Folkard, Starkie on Slander and Libel *156 (H. Wood ed., 4th Eng. ed. 1877) (Starkie).  Malice was presumed in the absence of an applicable privilege, right, or duty.  Id., at *293-*294.  General injury to reputation was also presumed, special damages could be recovered, and punitive damages were available if actual malice was established.  Dun & Bradstreet, supra, at 765 (White, J., concurring in judgment); see Starkie *151, *322-*323; M. Newell, Defamation, Libel and Slander 842-843 (1890) (Newell).  Truth was a defense to a civil libel claim.  See Starkie *170, *528-*530; 4 Blackstone *150-*151.  But where the publication was false, even if the defendant could show that no reputational injury occurred, the prevailing rule was that at least nominal damages were to be awarded.  Dun & Bradstreet, supra, at 765 (White, J., concurring in judgment) (citing Restatement of Torts \u00a7569, Comment b, p.\u00a0166 (1938)); see Starkie *492; Newell 839.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Libel was also a \"common-law crime, and thus criminal in the colonies.\"  Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U.\u00a0S. 250, 254 (1952); see 4 Blackstone *150-*153.  The same principles generally applied, except that truth traditionally was not a defense to libel prosecutions--the crime was intended to punish provocations to a breach of the peace, not the falsity of the statement.  See id., at *150-*151; Starkie *712-*713.  Laws authorizing the criminal prosecution of libel were both widespread and well established at the time of the founding.  See Roth v. United States, 354 U.\u00a0S. 476, 482, and n.\u00a011 (1957); Newell 28-29 (describing colonial statutes dating back to 1645 and 1701).  And they remained so when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, although many States by then allowed truth or good motives to serve as a defense to a libel prosecution.  Beauharnais, supra, at 254-255, and n.\u00a04.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Far from increasing a public figure's burden in a defamation action, the common law deemed libels against public figures to be, if anything, more serious and injurious than ordinary libels.  See 3 Blackstone *124 (\"Words also tending to scandalize a magistrate, or person in a public trust, are reputed more highly injurious than when spoken of a private man\"); 4 id., at *150 (defining libels as \"malicious defamations of any person, and especially a magistrate, made public by either printing, writing, signs, or pictures, in order to provoke him to wrath, or expose him to public hatred, contempt, and ridicule\" (emphasis added)).  Libel of a public official was deemed an offense \"\u00a0'most dangerous to the people, and deserv[ing of] punishment, because the people may be deceived and reject the best citizens to their great injury, and it may be to the loss of their liberties.'\u00a0\"  Newell 533 (quoting Commonwealth v. Clap, 4 Mass. 163, 169-170 (1808)); accord, White v. Nicholls, 3 How. 266, 290 (1845).2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The common law did afford defendants a privilege to comment on public questions and matters of public interest.  Starkie *237-*238.  This privilege extended to the \"public conduct of a public man,\" which was a \"matter of public interest\" that could \"be discussed with the fullest freedom\" and \"made the subject of hostile criticism.\"  Id., at *242.  Under this privilege, \"criticism may reasonably be applied to a public man in a public capacity which might not be applied to a private individual.\"  Ibid.  And the privilege extended to the man's character \"\u00a0'so far as it may respect his fitness and qualifications for the office,'\u00a0\" which was in the interest of the people to know.  White, supra, at 290 (quoting Clap, supra, at 169).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the purposes underlying this privilege also defined its limits.  Thus, the privilege applied only when the facts stated were true.  Starkie *238, n.\u00a04; White, supra, at 290.  And the privilege did not afford the publisher an opportunity to defame the officer's private character.  Starkie *238; see id., at *242 (\"The question for the jury is, whether the writer has transgressed the bounds within which comments upon the character of a public man ought to be confined .\u00a0.\u00a0. \"); ibid. (distinguishing between criticism of public conduct and the \"imputation of motives by which that conduct may be supposed to be actuated\").  \"One may in good faith publish the truth concerning a public officer, but if he states that which is false and aspersive, he is liable therefor however good his motives may be; and the same is true whether the party defamed be an officer or a candidate for an office, elective or appointive.\"  Newell 533 (footnote omitted).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These common-law protections for the \"core private righ[t]\" of a person's \"\u00a0'uninterrupted enjoyment of . . . his reputation'\u00a0\" formed the backdrop against which the First and Fourteenth Amendments were ratified.  Nelson, Adjudication in the Political Branches, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 567 (2007) (quoting 1 Blackstone *129).  Before our decision in New York Times, we consistently recognized that the First Amendment did not displace the common law of libel.  As Justice Story explained,\n\"The liberty of speech, or of the press, has nothing to do with this subject.  They are not endangered by the punishment of libellous publications.  The liberty of speech and the liberty of the press do not authorize malicious and injurious defamation.\"  Dexter v. Spear, 7 F.\u00a0Cas. 624 (No. 3,867) (CC RI 1825).\nThe Court consistently listed libel among the \"well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem.\"  Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.\u00a0S. 568, 571-572 (1942); see, e.g., Beauharnais, supra, at 254-256, and nn.\u00a04-5, 266 (libelous utterances are \"not .\u00a0.\u00a0. within the area of constitutionally protected speech\"); Near v. Minnesota ex\u00a0rel. Olson, 283 U.\u00a0S. 697, 715 (1931) (\"[T]he common law rules that subject the libeler to responsibility for the public offense, as well as for the private injury, are not abolished by the protection extended in our constitutions\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0New York Times marked a fundamental change in the relationship between the First Amendment and state libel law.  Although the Court did not repudiate its earlier statements that libel is constitutionally unprotected, it nevertheless was unable to \"accept the generality of this historic view.\"  Gertz, 418 U.\u00a0S., at 386 (White, J., dissenting). The Court instead observed that it had never upheld the use of libel law \"to impose sanctions upon expression critical of the official conduct of public officials.\"  New York Times, 376 U.\u00a0S., at 268.  In the Court's view, it was \"writing upon a clean slate,\" id., at 299 (Goldberg, J., concurring in result), and thus free to work a \"substantial abridgement\" of the common law of libel based on its balancing of competing interests, Gertz, supra, at 343 (majority opinion).\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are sound reasons to question whether either the First or Fourteenth Amendment, as originally understood, encompasses an actual-malice standard for public figures or otherwise displaces vast swaths of state defamation law.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The First Amendment provides that \"Congress shall make no law .\u00a0.\u00a0. abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\"  See Schneider v. State (Town of Irvington), 308 U.\u00a0S. 147, 160 (1939) (applying these protections against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment).3  Justice White's dissenting opinion in Gertz provides a helpful starting point in interpreting these terms.  Justice White had joined the majority opinion in New York Times.  But after canvassing historical practice under similar state constitutions, treatises, scholarly commentary, the ratification debates, and our precedent, he concluded that \"[s]cant, if any, evidence exists that the First Amendment was intended to abolish the common law of libel, at least to the extent of depriving ordinary citizens of meaningful redress against their defamers.\"  Gertz, 418 U.\u00a0S., at 381; see id., at 380-388.  Justice White later expressed \"doubts about the soundness of the Court's approach\" in New York Times \"and about some of the assumptions underlying it.\"  Dun & Bradstreet, 472 U.\u00a0S., at 767 (concluding that the Court \"struck an improvident balance in the New York Times case\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Historical practice further suggests that protections for free speech and a free press--whether embodied in state constitutions, the First Amendment, or the Fourteenth Amendment--did not abrogate the common law of libel.  See generally Chase, Criticism of Public Officers and Candidates for Office, 23 Am. L. Rev. 346 (1889) (survey-ing American defamation decisions).  Public officers and public figures continued to be able to bring civil libel suits for unprivileged statements without showing proof of actual malice as a condition for liability.  See, e.g., Root v. King, 7 Cow. 613, 628 (N.\u00a0Y. 1827) (lieutenant governor); White, 3 How., at 291 (customs collector); Hamilton v. Eno, 81 N.\u00a0Y. 116, 126 (1880) (assistant health inspector) (citing Lewis v. Few, 5 Johns. 1 (N.\u00a0Y. 1809) (Governor)); Royce v. Maloney, 58 Vt. 437, 447-448, 5 A. 395, 400 (1886) (chief judge and chancellor); Wheaton v. Beecher, 66 Mich. 307, 309-310, 33 N.\u00a0W. 503, 505-506 (1887) (candidate for city comptroller); Prosser v. Callis, 117 Ind. 105, 108-109, 19 N.\u00a0E. 735, 737 (1889) (county auditor).  The States continued to criminalize libel, including of public figures.  E.g., People v. Croswell, 3 Johns. Cas. 337, 377-378, 393-394 (N.\u00a0Y. 1804) (opinion of Kent, J.), and id., at 403-404, 410 (opinion of Lewis, J.) (President Jefferson); Clap, 4 Mass., at 169-170 (auctioneer); see also Commonwealth v. Blanding, 20 Mass. 304, 311-314 (1825) (elaborating on legal standard); Beauharnais, 343 U.\u00a0S., at 254-255 (noting that many States in the first decades after the founding began to allow truth or good motives to serve as a defense, but \"nowhere was there any suggestion that the crime of libel be abolished\").  As of 1952, \"every American jurisdiction .\u00a0.\u00a0. punish[ed] libels directed at individuals.\"  Id., at 255, and n.\u00a05.  And \"Congresses, during the period while [the Fourteenth] Amendment was being considered or was but freshly adopted, approved Constitutions of 'Reconstructed' States that expressly mentioned state libel laws, and also approved similar Constitutions for States erected out of the federal domain.\"  Id., at 293-294, and nn.\u00a07-8 (Jackson, J., dissenting).  Criticism of the public actions of public figures remained privileged, allowing latitude for public discourse and disagreement on matters of public concern.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As against this body of historical evidence, New York Times pointed only to opposition surrounding the Sedition Act of 1798, which prohibited \"any false, scandalous and malicious writing\" against \"the government of the United States, or either house of the Congress .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0, or the President.\"  \u00a72, 1 Stat. 596; see New York Times, 376 U.\u00a0S., at 273-277.  Most prominently, the opinion discusses a report written by James Madison in support of the Virginia Resolutions of 1798, which protested the Act.  Id., at 274-275.  The opinion highlights Madison's view that the press in every State had \"\u00a0'exerted a freedom in canvassing the merits and measures of public men, of every description, which has not been confined to the strict limits of the common law.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 275 (quoting 4 Debates on the Federal Constitution 570 (J. Elliot ed. 1876) (Elliot's Debates)).  It also emphasizes Madison's point that \"\u00a0'[s]ome degree of abuse is inseparable from the proper use of every thing; and in no instance is this more true than in that of the press.'\u00a0\"  376 U.\u00a0S., at 271 (quoting 4 Elliot's Debates 571).  After discussing other opposition to the Act, the Court concluded that \"the attack upon its validity has carried the day in the court of history.\"  376 U.\u00a0S., at 276; see id., at 273-277.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court gleaned from this evidence a \"broad consensus\" that the First Amendment protects \"criticism of government and public officials.\"  Id., at 276.  And the Court further inferred that because the Act allowed truth to be offered as a defense and applied to defamatory statements, a libel law prohibiting only false defamation could still fail First Amendment scrutiny.  Id., at 273-274.  But constitutional opposition to the Sedition Act--a federal law directly criminalizing criticism of the Government--does not necessarily support a constitutional actual-malice rule in all civil libel actions brought by public figures.  Madison did not contend that the Constitution abrogated the common law applicable to these private actions.  Instead, he seemed to contemplate that \"those who administer [the Federal Government]\" retain \"a remedy, for their injured reputations, under the same laws, and in the same tribunals, which protect their lives, their liberties, and their properties.\"  4 Elliot's Debates 573.  Moreover, a central assumption of Madison's view was the historical absence of a national common law \"pervading and operating through\" each colony \"as one society.\"  Id., at 561.  Yet the Court elevated just such a rule to constitutional status in New York Times.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is certainly true that defamation law did not remain static after the founding.  For example, many States acted \"by judicial decision, statute or constitution\" during the early 19th century to allow truth or good motives to serve as a defense to a libel prosecution.  Beauharnais, supra, at 254-255, and n.\u00a04.  Eventually, changing views led to the \"virtual disappearance\" of criminal libel prosecutions involving individuals.  Garrison, 379 U.\u00a0S., at 69.  But these changes appear to have reflected changing policy judgments, not a sense that existing law violated the original meaning of the First or Fourteenth Amendment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, there appears to be little historical evidence suggesting that the New York Times actual-malice rule flows from the original understanding of the First or Fourteenth Amendment.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like Justice White, I assume that New York Times and our other constitutional decisions displacing state defamation law have been popular in some circles, \"but this is not the road to salvation for a court of law.\"  Gertz, 418 U.\u00a0S., at 370 (dissenting opinion).  We did not begin meddling in this area until 1964, nearly 175 years after the First Amendment was ratified.  The States are perfectly capable of striking an acceptable balance between encouraging robust public discourse and providing a meaningful remedy for reputational harm.  We should reconsider our jurisprudence in this area.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0For example, the police did not \"at any time\" surround the campus when deployed near it; the dining hall \"was not padlocked on any occasion\"; the student protesters had not \"refus[ed] to register\" but rather \"boycott[ed] classes on a single day\"; \"Dr. King had not been arrested seven times, but only four\"; and the police \"were not only not implicated in the bombings, but had made every effort to apprehend those who were.\"  New York Times, 376 U.\u00a0S., at 259.\nFootnote 2\u00a0In England, \"[w]ords spoken in derogation of a peer, a judge, or other great officer of the realm\" were called scandalum magnatum and were \"held to be still more heinous\"; such words could support a claim that \"would not be actionable in the case of a common person.\"  3 Blackstone *123 (emphasis added); Starkie *142-*143.

For years, Tharpe, who is black, has asked state and federal courts to consider his claim that a white member of the jury that sentenced him to death was biased against him because of his race.  Tharpe has presented a signed affidavit from the juror in question, who stated, among other things, that \"\u00a0'there are two types of black people: 1. Black folks and 2. Niggers,'\u00a0\" and that Tharpe, \"\u00a0'who wasn't in the \"good\" black folks category in [his] book, should get the electric chair for what he did.'\u00a0\"  Tharpe v. Sellers, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (per curiam) (slip op., at 2).  Nevertheless, Tharpe has never received a hearing on the merits of his racial-bias claim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition that the Court denies today does not turn on the merits of that claim, and I concur in the denial of Tharpe's petition.  I write because I am profoundly troubled by the underlying facts of this case.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More than seven years after he was sentenced to death, Tharpe's attorneys uncovered evidence that a white member of his jury, Barney Gattie, harbored racist views at the time of the trial.  In a sworn statement, Gattie made \"repugnant comments .\u00a0.\u00a0. rife with racial slurs .\u00a0.\u00a0. and even an explicit statement that [his] decision to sentence Tharpe to death was[,] at leas[t] in part, based on race.\"  Tharpe v. Warden, 898 F.\u00a03d 1342, 1348 (CA11 2018) (Wilson, J., concurring).  Tharpe sought postconviction relief in state court, arguing that racial bias tainted the jury's deliberations in his case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To this day, Tharpe's racial-bias claim has never been adjudicated on its merits.  The Georgia state court and the Federal District Court denied Tharpe's requests for postconviction relief on procedural grounds.  Tharpe moved to reopen the federal proceedings in light of \"\u00a0'extraordinary circumstances,'\u00a0\" Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.\u00a0S. 524, 536 (2005), but the District Court denied that motion.  Tharpe requested a certificate of appealability (COA) from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, but the court denied his request after concluding that he had not made an adequate showing that Gattie's racial bias affected the jury's verdict.  Tharpe, 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).  This Court disagreed, explaining that Tharpe had \"present[ed] a strong factual basis for the argument that Tharpe's race affected Gattie's vote for a death verdict.\"  Ibid.  We remanded for further consideration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On remand, the Court of Appeals again denied Tharpe's request for a COA.  It held that the District Court did not arguably abuse its discretion in denying Tharpe's motion to reopen because two different threshold obstacles barred Tharpe's claim.  First, the court held that Tharpe's juror-bias claim could not go forward because the claim relied on a later decided case, Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017), which the court concluded does not apply retroactively.  898 F.\u00a03d, at 1345-1346.  Second, the court decided that Tharpe had not established cause for his procedural default in state court--i.e., he had not given a sufficient justification for failing to raise the juror-bias claim in a motion for a new trial or in his direct appeal.  Specifically, the court rejected as unsubstantiated Tharpe's allegation that counsel's ineffectiveness was to blame for his not having raised the racial-bias claim sooner.  Id., at 1347.  Tharpe seeks this Court's review.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tharpe's petition for a writ of certiorari asks us to decide only whether the Court of Appeals' procedural rulings were correct, not whether his juror-bias claim has merit.  Tharpe \"faces a high bar in showing that jurists of reason could disagree whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying his motion\" to reopen.  Tharpe, 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 2-3).  And for Tharpe's claim to proceed, he must overcome both of the Court of Appeals' independent reasons for denying him a COA.  In other words, even setting aside whether Pena-Rodriguez is retroactive, he would have to establish that he arguably showed sufficient cause to excuse his procedural default.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I see little likelihood that we would reverse the Court of Appeals' factbound conclusion that Tharpe did not make that showing.  Before this Court, Tharpe argues that he could not have raised his racial-bias claim in a motion for new trial or on direct appeal because he did not know--indeed, could not have known--of the predicate facts of the claim at that time.  Pet. for Cert. 35.  If preserved, that argument would have force.  But Tharpe did not make this argument before the District Court until a footnote in his reply brief in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) proceedings, see Reply to Brief in Opposition 12-13 (listing the reply brief as the earliest point at which this argument was made), and the District Court did not address it, see App. D. to Pet. for Cert.  Given this preservation issue and the deference due to the District Court, the Court of Appeals reasonably focused on the ineffective-assistance argument that Tharpe did previously present to the District Court in deciding that Tharpe had not made the requisite showing of cause.  See 898 F.\u00a03d, at 1347.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I therefore concur in the Court's decision to deny Tharpe's petition for certiorari.  As this may be the end of the road for Tharpe's juror-bias claim, however, we should not look away from the magnitude of the potential injustice that procedural barriers are shielding from judicial review.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tharpe has uncovered truly striking evidence of juror bias.  Gattie, the juror at issue, signed an affidavit reflecting his \"view that 'there are two types of black people: 1. Black folks and 2. Niggers'; that Tharpe, 'who wasn't in the \"good\" black folks category in [his] book, should get the electric chair for what he did'; that '[s]ome of the jurors voted for death because they felt Tharpe should be an example to other blacks who kill blacks, but that wasn't [his] reason'; and that, '[a]fter studying the Bible, [he] ha[d] wondered if black people even have souls.'\u00a0\"  Tharpe, 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (quoting App. B to Pet. for Cert. 15-16).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These racist sentiments, expressed by a juror entrusted with a vote over Tharpe's fate, suggest an appalling risk that racial bias swayed Tharpe's sentencing.  The danger of race determining any criminal punishment is intolerable and endangers public confidence in the law.  See Buck v. Davis, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 22).  That risk is especially grave here, where it may have yielded a punishment that is unique in its \"complete finality.\"  Turner v. Murray, 476 U.\u00a0S. 28, 35 (1986).  When Tharpe went on trial for his crimes, the Constitution promised him the \"fundamental 'protection of life and liberty against race or color prejudice.'\u00a0\"  McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.\u00a0S. 279, 310 (1987) (quoting Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.\u00a0S. 303, 309 (1880)).  There is strong evidence that this promise went unfulfilled.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It may be tempting to dismiss Tharpe's case as an outlier, but racial bias is \"a familiar and recurring evil.\"  Pena-Rodriguez, 580 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  That evil often presents itself far more subtly than it has here.  Yet Gattie's sentiments--and the fact that they went unexposed for so long, evading review on the merits--amount to an arresting demonstration that racism can and does seep into the jury system.  The work of \"purg[ing] racial prejudice from the administration of justice,\" id., at ___ (slip. op., at 13), is far from done.\n\n\nKEITH THARPE v.

Crosby, 545 U.\u00a0S. 524, 536 (2005), but the District Court denied that motion.  Tharpe requested a certificate of appealability (COA) from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, but the court denied his request after concluding that he had not made an adequate showing that Gattie's racial bias affected the jury's verdict.  Tharpe, 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).  This Court disagreed, explaining that Tharpe had \"present[ed] a strong factual basis for the argument that Tharpe's race affected Gattie's vote for a death verdict.\"  Ibid.  We remanded for further consideration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On remand, the Court of Appeals again denied Tharpe's request for a COA.  It held that the District Court did not arguably abuse its discretion in denying Tharpe's motion to reopen because two different threshold obstacles barred Tharpe's claim.  First, the court held that Tharpe's juror-bias claim could not go forward because the claim relied on a later decided case, Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017), which the court concluded does not apply retroactively.  898 F.\u00a03d, at 1345-1346.  Second, the court decided that Tharpe had not established cause for his procedural default in state court--i.e., he had not given a sufficient justification for failing to raise the juror-bias claim in a motion for a new trial or in his direct appeal.  Specifically, the court rejected as unsubstantiated Tharpe's allegation that counsel's ineffectiveness was to blame for his not having raised the racial-bias claim sooner.  Id., at 1347.  Tharpe seeks this Court's review.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tharpe's petition for a writ of certiorari asks us to decide only whether the Court of Appeals' procedural rulings were correct, not whether his juror-bias claim has merit.  Tharpe \"faces a high bar in showing that jurists of reason could disagree whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying his motion\" to reopen.  Tharpe, 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 2-3).  And for Tharpe's claim to proceed, he must overcome both of the Court of Appeals' independent reasons for denying him a COA.  In other words, even setting aside whether Pena-Rodriguez is retroactive, he would have to establish that he arguably showed sufficient cause to excuse his procedural default.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I see little likelihood that we would reverse the Court of Appeals' factbound conclusion that Tharpe did not make that showing.  Before this Court, Tharpe argues that he could not have raised his racial-bias claim in a motion for new trial or on direct appeal because he did not know--indeed, could not have known--of the predicate facts of the claim at that time.  Pet. for Cert. 35.  If preserved, that argument would have force.  But Tharpe did not make this argument before the District Court until a footnote in his reply brief in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) proceedings, see Reply to Brief in Opposition 12-13 (listing the reply brief as the earliest point at which this argument was made), and the District Court did not address it, see App. D. to Pet. for Cert.  Given this preservation issue and the deference due to the District Court, the Court of Appeals reasonably focused on the ineffective-assistance argument that Tharpe did previously present to the District Court in deciding that Tharpe had not made the requisite showing of cause.  See 898 F.\u00a03d, at 1347.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I therefore concur in the Court's decision to deny Tharpe's petition for certiorari.  As this may be the end of the road for Tharpe's juror-bias claim, however, we should not look away from the magnitude of the potential injustice that procedural barriers are shielding from judicial review.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tharpe has uncovered truly striking evidence of juror bias.  Gattie, the juror at issue, signed an affidavit reflecting his \"view that 'there are two types of black people: 1. Black folks and 2. Niggers'; that Tharpe, 'who wasn't in the \"good\" black folks category in [his] book, should get the electric chair for what he did'; that '[s]ome of the jurors voted for death because they felt Tharpe should be an example to other blacks who kill blacks, but that wasn't [his] reason'; and that, '[a]fter studying the Bible, [he] ha[d] wondered if black people even have souls.'\u00a0\"  Tharpe, 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (quoting App. B to Pet. for Cert. 15-16).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These racist sentiments, expressed by a juror entrusted with a vote over Tharpe's fate, suggest an appalling risk that racial bias swayed Tharpe's sentencing.  The danger of race determining any criminal punishment is intolerable and endangers public confidence in the law.  See Buck v. Davis, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 22).  That risk is especially grave here, where it may have yielded a punishment that is unique in its \"complete finality.\"  Turner v. Murray, 476 U.\u00a0S. 28, 35 (1986).  When Tharpe went on trial for his crimes, the Constitution promised him the \"fundamental 'protection of life and liberty against race or color prejudice.'\u00a0\"  McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.\u00a0S. 279, 310 (1987) (quoting Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.\u00a0S. 303, 309 (1880)).  There is strong evidence that this promise went unfulfilled.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It may be tempting to dismiss Tharpe's case as an outlier, but racial bias is \"a familiar and recurring evil.\"  Pena-Rodriguez, 580 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  That evil often presents itself far more subtly than it has here.  Yet Gattie's sentiments--and the fact that they went unexposed for so long, evading review on the merits--amount to an arresting demonstration that racism can and does seep into the jury system.  The work of \"purg[ing] racial prejudice from the administration of justice,\" id., at ___ (slip. op., at 13), is far from done.\n\n\n\n","31":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKRISTINA BOX, COMMISSIONER, INDIANA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, ET AL.  v.

See Ind. Code \u00a7\u00a716\u221234\u22122\u22121.1(a)(1)(K), 16\u221234\u22123\u22124(a), 16\u221234\u2212 4\u22124, 16\u221234\u22124\u22125, 16\u221234\u22124\u22126, 16\u221234\u22124\u22127, 16\u221234\u2212 4\u22128, 16\u221241\u221216\u22124(d), 16\u221241\u221216\u22125 (2018).  We reverse  the judgment of the Seventh Circuit with respect to the first question presented, and we deny the petition with respect to the second question presented.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first challenged provision altered the manner in which abortion providers may dispose of fetal remains.  Among other changes, it excluded fetal remains from the definition of infectious and pathological waste, \u00a7\u00a716\u221241\u221216\u22124(d), 16\u221241\u221216\u22125, thereby preventing incineration of fetal remains along with surgical byproducts.  It also authorized simultaneous cremation of fetal remains, \u00a716\u221234\u22123\u22124(a), which Indiana does not generally allow for human remains, \u00a723\u221214\u221231\u221239(a).  The law did not affect a woman's right under existing law \"to determine the final disposition of the aborted fetus.\"  \u00a716\u221234\u22123\u22122(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents have never argued that Indiana's law creates an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion.  Cf. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.\u00a0S. 833, 874 (1992) (plurality opinion).  Respondents have instead litigated this case on the assumption that the law does not implicate a fundamental right and is therefore subject only to ordinary rational basis review.  See Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. v. Commissioner of Indiana State Dept. of Health, 888 F.\u00a03d 300, 307 (2018).  To survive under that standard, a state law need only be \"rationally related to legitimate government interests.\"  Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.\u00a0S. 702, 728 (1997).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Seventh Circuit found Indiana's disposition law invalid even under this deferential test.  It first held that Indiana's stated interest in \"the 'humane and dignified disposal of human remains'\u00a0\" was \"not .\u00a0.\u00a0. legitimate.\"  888 F.\u00a03d, at 309.  It went on to hold that even if Indiana's stated interest were legitimate, \"it [could not] identify a rational relationship\" between that interest and \"the law as written,\" because the law preserves a woman's right to dispose of fetal remains however she wishes and allows for simultaneous cremation.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We now reverse that determination.  This Court has already acknowledged that a State has a \"legitimate interest in proper disposal of fetal remains.\"  Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.\u00a0S. 416, 452, n.\u00a045 (1983).  The Seventh Circuit clearly erred in failing to recognize that interest as a permissible basis for Indiana's disposition law.  See Armour v. Indianapolis, 566 U.\u00a0S. 673, 685 (2012) (on rational basis review, \"the burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it\").  The only remaining question, then, is whether Indiana's law is rationally related to the State's interest in proper disposal of fetal remains.  We conclude that it is, even if it is not perfectly tailored to that end.  See ibid. (the State need not have drawn \"the perfect line,\" as long as \"the line actually drawn [is] a rational\" one).  We therefore uphold Indiana's law under rational basis review.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We reiterate that, in challenging this provision, respondents have never argued that Indiana's law imposes an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion.  This case, as litigated, therefore does not implicate our cases applying the undue burden test to abortion regulations.  Other courts have analyzed challenges to similar disposition laws under the undue burden standard.  See Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. v. Commissioner of Indiana State Dept. of Health, 2018 WL 3655854, *2\u2212*3 (CA7, June 25, 2018) (Wood, C.\u00a0J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc).  Our opinion expresses no view on the merits of those challenges.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our opinion likewise expresses no view on the merits of the second question presented, i.e., whether Indiana may prohibit the knowing provision of sex-, race-, and disabilityselective abortions by abortion providers.  Only the Seventh Circuit has thus far addressed this kind of law.  We follow our ordinary practice of denying petitions insofar as they raise legal issues that have not been considered by additional Courts of Appeals.  See this Court's Rule 10.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, we grant certiorari with respect to the first question presented in the petition and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to that question.  We deny certiorari with respect to the second question presented.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor would deny the petition for a writ of certiorari as to both questions presented.\n\nThomas, J., concurring\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nKRISTINA BOX, COMMISSIONER, INDIANA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, et\u00a0al. v. PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF INDIANA AND  KENTUCKY, INC., et\u00a0al.\non petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit\nNo. 18-483.\u2003Decided May 28, 2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, concurring.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indiana law prohibits abortion providers from treating the bodies of aborted children as \"infectious waste\" and incinerating them alongside used needles, laboratory-animal carcasses, and surgical byproducts.  Ind. Code \u00a716-41-16-4(d) (2019); see \u00a7\u00a716-41-16-2, 16-41-16-4, 16-41-16-5; Ind. Admin. Code, tit. 410, \u00a7\u00a735-1-3, 35-2-1(a)(2) (2019).  A panel of the Seventh Circuit held that this fetal-remains law was irrational, and thus unconstitutional, under the doctrine of \"substantive due process.\"  That decision was manifestly inconsistent with our precedent, as the Court holds.1  I would have thought it could go without saying that nothing in the Constitution or any decision of this Court prevents a State from requiring abortion facilities to provide for the respectful treatment of human remains. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I write separately to address the other aspect of Indiana law at issue here--the \"Sex Selective and Disability Abortion Ban.\"  Ind. Code \u00a716-34-4-1 et\u00a0seq.  This statute makes it illegal for an abortion provider to perform an abortion in Indiana when the provider knows that the mother is seeking the abortion solely because of the child's race, sex, diagnosis of Down syndrome, disability, or related characteristics.  \u00a7\u00a716-34-4-1 to 16-34-4-8; see \u00a716-34-4-1(b) (excluding \"lethal fetal anomal[ies]\" from the definition of disability).  The law requires that the mother be advised of this restriction and given information about financial assistance and adoption alternatives, but it imposes liability only on the provider.  See \u00a7\u00a716-34-2-1.1(a)(1)(K), (2)(A)-(C), 16-34-4-9.  Each of the immutable characteristics protected by this law can be known relatively early in a pregnancy, and the law prevents them from becoming the sole criterion for deciding whether the child will live or die.  Put differently, this law and other laws like it promote a State's compelling interest in preventing abortion from becoming a tool of modern-day eugenics.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The use of abortion to achieve eugenic goals is not merely hypothetical.  The foundations for legalizing abortion in America were laid during the early 20th-century birth-control movement.  That movement developed alongside the American eugenics movement.  And significantly, Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger recognized the eugenic potential of her cause.  She emphasized and embraced the notion that birth control \"opens the way to the eugenist.\"  Sanger, Birth Control and Racial Betterment, Birth Control Rev., Feb. 1919, p.\u00a012 (Racial Betterment).  As a means of reducing the \"ever increasing, unceasingly spawning class of human beings who never should have been born at all,\" Sanger argued that \"Birth Control .\u00a0.\u00a0. is really the greatest and most truly eugenic method\" of \"human generation.\"  M. Sanger, Pivot of Civilization 187, 189 (1922) (Pivot of Civilization).  In her view, birth control had been \"accepted by the most clear thinking and far seeing of the Eugenists themselves as the most constructive and necessary of the means to racial health.\"  Id., at 189.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that Sanger was not referring to abortion when she made these statements, at least not directly.  She recognized a moral difference between \"contraceptives\" and other, more \"extreme\" ways for \"women to limit their families,\" such as \"the horrors of abortion and infanticide.\"  M. Sanger, Woman and the New Race 25, 5 (1920) (Woman and the New Race).  But Sanger's arguments about the eugenic value of birth control in securing \"the elimination of the unfit,\" Racial Betterment 11, apply with even greater force to abortion, making it significantly more effective as a tool of eugenics.  Whereas Sanger believed that birth control could prevent \"unfit\" people from reproducing, abortion can prevent them from being born in the first place.  Many eugenicists therefore supported legalizing abortion, and abortion advocates--including future Planned Parenthood President Alan Guttmacher--endorsed the use of abortion for eugenic reasons.  Technological advances have only heightened the eugenic potential for abortion, as abortion can now be used to eliminate children with unwanted characteristics, such as a particular sex or disability.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the potential for abortion to become a tool of eugenic manipulation, the Court will soon need to confront the constitutionality of laws like Indiana's.  But because further percolation may assist our review of this issue of first impression, I join the Court in declining to take up the issue now.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The term \"eugenics\" was coined in 1883 by Francis Galton, a British statistician and half-cousin of Charles Darwin.  See S. Caron, Who Chooses?: American Reproductive History Since 1830, p.\u00a049 (2008); A. Cohen, Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck 46 (2016) (Imbeciles).  Galton described eugenics as \"the science of improving stock\" through \"all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give to the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have.\"  F. Galton, Inquiries Into Human Faculty and Its Development 25, n.\u00a01 (1883).  Eugenics thus rests on the assumption that \"man's natural abilities are derived by inheritance, under exactly the same limitations as are the form and physical features of the whole organic world.\"  F. Galton, Hereditary Genius: An Inquiry Into Its Laws and Consequences 1 (1869) (Hereditary Genius); see Imbeciles 46-47.  As a social theory, eugenics is rooted in social Darwinism--i.e., the application of the \"survival of the fittest\" principle to human society.  Caron, supra, at 49; Imbeciles 45.  Galton argued that by promoting reproduction between people with desirable qualities and inhibiting reproduction of the unfit, man could improve society by \"do[ing] providently, quickly, and kindly\" \"[w]hat Nature does blindly, slowly, and ruthlessly.\"  F. Galton, Eugenics: Its Definition, Scope and Aims, in Essays in Eugenics 42 (1909).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the 1920s, eugenics had become a \"full-fledged intellectual craze\" in the United States, particularly among progressives, professionals, and intellectual elites.  Imbeciles 2; see id., at 2-4, 55-57; Cohen, Harvard's Eugenics Era, Harvard Magazine, pp.\u00a048-52 (Mar.-Apr. 2016) (Harvard's Eugenics Era).  Leaders in the eugenics movement held prominent positions at Harvard, Stanford, and Yale, among other schools, and eugenics was taught at 376 universities and colleges.  Imbeciles 4; see also Harvard's Eugenics Era 48.  Although eugenics was widely embraced, Harvard was \"more central to American eugenics than any other university,\" with administrators, faculty members, and alumni \"founding eugenics organizations, writing academic and popular eugenics articles, and lobbying government to enact eugenics laws.\"  Ibid.; see id., at 49-52.  One Harvard faculty member even published a leading textbook on the subject through the Harvard University Press, Genetics and Eugenics.  Id., at 49.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many eugenicists believed that the distinction between the fit and the unfit could be drawn along racial lines, a distinction they justified by pointing to anecdotal and statistical evidence of disparities between the races.  Galton, for example, purported to show as a scientific matter that \"the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below\" that of the Anglo-Saxon, and that \"the number among the negroes of those whom we should call half-witted men, is very large.\"  Hereditary Genius 338-339.  Other eugenicists similarly concluded that \"the Negro .\u00a0.\u00a0. is in the large eugenically inferior to the white\" based on \"the relative achievements of the race\" and statistical disparities in educational outcomes and life expectancy in North America, among other factors.  P. Popenoe & R. Johnson, Applied Eugenics 285 (1920) (Applied Eugenics); see id., at 280-297 (elaborating on this view); see also, e.g., R. Gates, Heredity and Eugenics 234 (1923) (citing disparities between white and black people and concluding that \"the negro's mental status is thus undoubtedly more primitive than that of the white man\"); Hunt, Hand, Pettis, & Russell, Abstract, Family Stock Values in White-Negro Crosses: A Note on Miscegenation, 8 Eugenical News 67 (1923) (\"Experiments, as well as general experience, indicate that the average inborn intelligence of the white man is considerably higher than that of the negro\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Building on similar assumptions, eugenicist Lothrop Stoddard argued that the \"prodigious birth-rate\" of the nonwhite races was bringing the world to a racial tipping point.  L. Stoddard, The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy 8-9 (1920).  Stoddard feared that without \"artificial barriers,\" the races \"will increasingly mingle, and the inevitable result will be the supplanting or absorption of the higher by the lower types.\"  Id., at 302.  Allowing the white race to be overtaken by inferior races, according to Stoddard, would be a tragedy of historic proportions:\n\"[T]hat would mean that the race obviously endowed with the greatest creative ability, the race which had achieved most in the past and which gave the richer promise for the future, had passed away, carrying with it to the grave those potencies upon which the realization of man's highest hopes depends.  A million years of human evolution might go uncrowned, and earth's supreme life-product, man, might never fulfil his potential destiny.  This is why we today face 'The Crisis of the Ages.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 304.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eugenic arguments like these helped precipitate the Immigration Act of 1924, which significantly reduced immigration from outside of Western and Northern Europe.  \u00a7\u00a711(a)-(b), 43 Stat. 159; Imbeciles 126-135; see also id., at 135 (discussing the difficulties the Act created for many Jews seeking to flee Nazism).  The perceived superiority of the white race also led to calls for race consciousness in marital and reproductive decisions, including through antimiscegenation laws.  Applied Eugenics 296 (\"We hold that it is to the interests of the United States .\u00a0.\u00a0. to prevent further Negro-white amalgamation\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although race was relevant, eugenicists did not define a person's \"fitness\" exclusively by race.  A typical list of dysgenic individuals would also include some combination of the \"feeble-minded,\" \"insane,\" \"criminalistic,\" \"deformed,\" \"crippled,\" \"epileptic,\" \"inebriate,\" \"diseased,\" \"blind,\" \"deaf,\" and \"dependent (including orphans and paupers).\"  Imbeciles 139; see Applied Eugenics 176-183; cf. G. Chesterton, Eugenics and Other Evils 61 (1922) (\"[F]eeble-mindedness is a new phrase under which you might segregate anybody\" because \"this phrase conveys nothing fixed and outside opinion\").  Immigration policy was insufficient to address these \"danger[s] from within,\" Imbeciles 4, so eugenicists turned to other solutions.  Many States adopted laws prohibiting marriages between certain feebleminded, epileptic, or other \"unfit\" individuals, but forced sterilization emerged as the preferred solution for many classes of dysgenic individuals.  Id., at 63, 66.  Indiana enacted the first eugenic sterilization law in 1907, and a number of other States followed suit.  Id., at 70.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court threw its prestige behind the eugenics movement in its 1927 decision upholding the constitutionality of Virginia's forced-sterilization law, Buck v. Bell, 274 U.\u00a0S. 200.  The plaintiff, Carrie Buck, had been found to be \"a feeble minded white woman\" who was \"the daughter of a feeble minded mother .\u00a0.\u00a0. and the mother of an illegitimate feeble minded child.\"  Id., at 205.3  In an opinion written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., and joined by seven other Justices, the Court offered a full-throated defense of forced sterilization:\n\"We have seen more than once that the public welfare may call upon the best citizens for their lives.  It would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap the strength of the State for these lesser sacrifices, often not felt to be such by those concerned, in order to prevent our being swamped with incompetence.  It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.  The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes.  Three generations of imbeciles are enough.\"  Id., at 207 (citation omitted).\nThe Court's decision gave the eugenics movement added legitimacy and considerable momentum; by 1931, 28 of the Nation's 48 States had adopted eugenic sterilization laws.  Imbeciles 299-300.  Buck was one of more than 60,000 people who were involuntarily sterilized between 1907 and 1983.  Id., at 319.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Support for eugenics waned considerably by the 1940s as Americans became familiar with the eugenics of the Nazis and scientific literature undermined the assumptions on which the eugenics movement was built.  But even today, the Court continues to attribute legal significance to the same types of racial-disparity evidence that were used to justify race-based eugenics.  See T. Sowell, Discrimination and Disparities 5-6 (rev. ed. 2019) (Sowell).4  And support for the goal of reducing undesirable populations through selective reproduction has by no means vanished.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case highlights the fact that abortion is an act rife with the potential for eugenic manipulation.  From the beginning, birth control and abortion were promoted as means of effectuating eugenics.  Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger was particularly open about the fact that birth control could be used for eugenic purposes.  These arguments about the eugenic potential for birth control apply with even greater force to abortion, which can be used to target specific children with unwanted characteristics.  Even after World War II, future Planned Parenthood President Alan Guttmacher and other abortion advocates endorsed abortion for eugenic reasons and promoted it as a means of controlling the population and improving its quality.  As explained below, a growing body of evidence suggests that eugenic goals are already being realized through abortion.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like many elites of her day, Sanger accepted that eugenics was \"the most adequate and thorough avenue to the solution of racial, political and social problems.\"  Sanger, The Eugenic Value of Birth Control Propaganda, Birth Control Rev., Oct. 1921, p.\u00a05 (Propaganda).  She agreed with eugenicists that \"the unbalance between the birth rate of the 'unfit' and the 'fit'\u00a0\" was \"the greatest present menace to civilization.\"  Ibid.  Particularly \"in a democracy like that of the United States,\" where \"[e]quality of political power has .\u00a0.\u00a0. been bestowed upon the lowest elements of our population,\" Sanger worried that \"reckless spawning carries with it the seeds of destruction.\"  Pivot of Civilization 177-178.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although Sanger believed that society was \"indebted\" to \"the Eugenists\" for diagnosing these problems, she did not believe that they had \"show[n] much power in suggesting practical and feasible remedies.\"  Id., at 178.  \"As an advocate of Birth Control,\" Sanger attempted to fill the gap by showing that birth control had \"eugenic and civilizational value.\"  Propaganda 5.  In her view, birth-control advocates and eugenicists were \"seeking a single end\"--\"to assist the race toward the elimination of the unfit.\"  Racial Betterment 11.  But Sanger believed that the focus should be \"upon stopping not only the reproduction of the unfit but upon stopping all reproduction when there is not economic means of providing proper care for those who are born in health.\"  Ibid. (emphasis added).  Thus, for Sanger, forced sterilization did \"not go to the bottom of the matter\" because it did not \"touc[h] the great problem of unlimited reproduction\" of \"those great masses, who through economic pressure populate the slums and there produce in their helplessness other helpless, diseased and incompetent masses, who overwhelm all that eugenics can do among those whose economic condition is better.\"  Id., at 12.  In Sanger's view, frequent reproduction among \"the majority of wage workers\" would lead to \"the contributing of morons, feeble-minded, insane and various criminal types to the already tremendous social burden constituted by these unfit.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sanger believed that birth control was an important part of the solution to these societal ills.  She explained, \"Birth Control .\u00a0.\u00a0. is really the greatest and most truly eugenic method\" of \"human generation,\" \"and its adoption as part of the program of Eugenics would immediately give a concrete and realistic power to that science.\"  Pivot of Civilization 189.  Sanger even argued that \"eugenists and others who are laboring for racial betterment\" could not \"succeed\" unless they \"first clear[ed] the way for Birth Control.\"  Racial Betterment 11.  If \"the masses\" were given \"practical education in Birth Control\"--for which there was \"almost universal demand\"--then the \"Eugenic educator\" could use \"Birth Control propaganda\" to \"direct a thorough education in Eugenics\" and influence the reproductive decisions of the unfit.  Propaganda 5.  In this way, \"the campaign for Birth Control [was] not merely of eugenic value, but [was] practically identical in ideal with the final aims of Eugenics.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sanger herself campaigned for birth control in black communities.  In 1930, she opened a birth-control clinic in Harlem.  See Birth Control or Race Control? Sanger and the Negro Project, Margaret Sanger Papers Project Newsletter #28 (2001), http:\/\/www.nyu.edu\/projects\/sanger\/ articles\/bc_or_race_control.php (all Internet materials as last visited May 24, 2019).  Then, in 1939, Sanger initiated the \"Negro Project,\" an effort to promote birth control in poor, Southern black communities.  Ibid.  Noting that blacks were \"\u00a0'notoriously underprivileged and handicapped to a large measure by a \"caste\" system,'\u00a0\" she argued in a fundraising letter that \"\u00a0'birth control knowledge brought to this group, is the most direct, constructive aid that can be given them to improve their immediate situation.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  In a report titled \"Birth Control and the Negro,\" Sanger and her coauthors identified blacks as \"\u00a0'the great problem of the South'\u00a0\"--\"the group with 'the greatest economic, health, and social problems'\u00a0\"--and developed a birth-control program geared toward this population.  Ibid.  She later emphasized that black ministers should be involved in the program, noting, \"\u00a0'We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defenders of Sanger point out that W. E. B. DuBois  and other black leaders supported the Negro Project and argue that her writings should not be read to imply a racial bias.  Ibid.; see Planned Parenthood, Opposition Claims About Margaret Sanger (2016), https:\/\/www. plannedparenthood.org\/uploads\/filer_public\/37\/\u00a0fd\u00a0\/\u00a037fdc7b6de5f-4d22\u00a0-\u00a08c05\u00a0-\u00a09568268e92d8\u00a0\/\u00a0sanger_opposition_claims_ fact_sheet_2016.pdf.  But Sanger's motives are immaterial to the point relevant here: that \"Birth Control\" has long been understood to \"ope[n] the way to the eugenist.\"  Racial Betterment 12.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, Sanger distinguished between birth control and abortion.  Woman and the New Race 128-129; see, e.g., Sanger, Birth Control or Abortion? Birth Control Rev., Dec. 1918, pp.\u00a03-4.  For Sanger, \"[t]he one means health and happiness--a stronger, better race,\" while \"[t]he other means disease, suffering, [and] death.\"  Woman and the New Race 129.  Sanger argued that \"nothing short of contraceptives can put an end to the horrors of abortion and infanticide,\" id., at 25, and she questioned whether \"we want the precious, tender qualities of womanhood, so much needed for our racial development, to perish in [the] sordid, abnormal experiences\" of abortions, id., at 29.  In short, unlike contraceptives, Sanger regarded \"the hundreds of thousands of abortions performed in America each year [as] a disgrace to civilization.\"  Id., at 126.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although Sanger was undoubtedly correct in recognizing a moral difference between birth control and abortion, the eugenic arguments that she made in support of birth control apply with even greater force to abortion.  Others were well aware that abortion could be used as a \"metho[d] of eugenics,\" 6 H. Ellis, Studies in the Psychology of Sex 617 (1910), and they were enthusiastic about that possibility.  Indeed, some eugenicists believed that abortion should be legal for the very purpose of promoting eugenics.  See Harris, Abortion in Soviet Russia: Has the Time Come To Legalize It Elsewhere? 25 Eugenics Rev. 22 (1933) (\"[W]e are being increasingly compelled to consider legalized abortion as well as birth control and sterilization as possible means of influencing the fitness and happiness and quality of the race\"); Aims and Objects of the Eugenics Society, 26 Eugenics Rev. 135 (1934) (\"The Society advocates the provision of legalized facilities for voluntarily terminating pregnancy in cases of persons for whom sterilization is regarded as appropriate\").  Support for abortion can therefore be found throughout the literature on eugenics.  E.g., Population Control: Dr. Binnie Dunlop's Address to the Eugenics Society, 25 Eugenics Rev. 251 (1934) (lamenting \"the relatively high birth-rate of the poorest third of the population\" and \"the serious rate of racial deterioration which it implied,\" and arguing that \"this birth-rate .\u00a0.\u00a0. would fall rapidly if artificial abortion were made legal\"); Williams, The Legalization of Medical Abortion, 56 Eugenics Rev. 24-25 (1964) (\"I need hardly stress the eugenic argument for extending family planning\"--including \"voluntary sterilization\" and \"abortion\"--to \"all groups, not merely to those who are the most intelligent and socially responsible\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Abortion advocates were sometimes candid about abortion's eugenic possibilities.  In 1959, for example, Guttmacher explicitly endorsed eugenic reasons for abortion.  A. Guttmacher, Babies by Choice or by Chance 186-188 (1959).  He explained that \"the quality of the parents must be taken into account,\" including \"[f\u00a0]eeble-mindedness,\" and believed that \"it should be permissible to abort any pregnancy .\u00a0.\u00a0. in which there is a strong probability of an abnormal or malformed infant.\"  Id., at 198.  He added that the question whether to allow abortion must be \"separated from emotional, moral and religious concepts\" and \"must have as its focus normal, healthy infants born into homes peopled with parents who have healthy bodies and minds.\"  Id., at 221.  Similarly, legal scholar Glanville Williams wrote that he was open to the possibility of eugenic infanticide, at least in some situations, explaining that \"an eugenic killing by a mother, exactly paralleled by the bitch that kills her misshapen puppies, cannot confidently be pronounced immoral.\"  G. Williams, Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law 20 (1957).  The Court cited Williams' book for a different proposition in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.\u00a0S. 113, 130, n.\u00a09 (1973).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But public aversion to eugenics after World War II also led many to avoid explicit references to that term.  The American Eugenics Society, for example, changed the name of its scholarly publication from \"Eugenics Quarterly\" to \"Social Biology.\"  See D. Paul, Controlling Human Heredity: 1865 to the Present, p.\u00a0125 (1995).  In explaining the name change, the journal's editor stated that it had become evident that eugenic goals could be achieved \"for reasons other than eugenics.\"  Ibid.  For example, \"[b]irth control and abortion are turning out to be great eugenic advances of our time.  If they had been advanced for eugenic reasons it would have retarded or stopped their acceptance.\"  Ibid.  But whether they used the term \"eugenics\" or not, abortion advocates echoed the arguments of early 20th-century eugenicists by describing abortion as a way to achieve \"population control\" and to improve the \"quality\" of the population.  One journal declared that \"abortion is the one mode of population limitation which has demonstrated the speedy impact which it can make upon a national problem.\"  Notes of the Quarter: The Personal and the Universal, 53 Eugenics Rev. 186 (1962).  Planned Parenthood's leaders echoed these themes.  When exulting over \"\u00a0'fantastic .\u00a0.\u00a0. progress'\u00a0\" in expanding abortion, for example, Guttmacher stated that \"\u00a0'the realization of the population problem has been responsible' for the change in attitudes.  'We're now concerned more with the quality of population than the quantity.'\u00a0\"  Abortion Reforms Termed \"Fantastic,\" Hartford Courant, Mar. 21, 1970, p.\u00a016.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Avoiding the word \"eugenics\" did not assuage everyone's fears.  Some black groups saw \"\u00a0'family planning' as a euphemism for race genocide\" and believed that \"black people [were] taking the brunt of the 'planning'\u00a0\" under Planned Parenthood's \"ghetto approach\" to distributing its services.  Dempsey, Dr. Guttmacher Is the Evangelist of Birth Control, N.\u00a0Y. Times Magazine, Feb. 9, 1969, p.\u00a082.  \"The Pittsburgh branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,\" for example, \"criticized family planners as bent on trying to keep the Negro birth rate as low as possible.\"  Kaplan, Abortion and Sterilization Win Support of Planned Parenthood, N.\u00a0Y. Times, Nov. 14, 1968, p.\u00a0L50, col. 1.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, notwithstanding Sanger's views on abortion, respondent Planned Parenthood promotes both birth control and abortion as \"reproductive health services\" that can be used for family planning.  Brief in Opposition 1.  And with today's prenatal screening tests and other technologies, abortion can easily be used to eliminate children with unwanted characteristics.  Indeed, the individualized nature of abortion gives it even more eugenic potential than birth control, which simply reduces the chance of conceiving any child.  As petitioners and several amicus curiae briefs point out, moreover, abortion has proved to be a disturbingly effective tool for implementing the discriminatory preferences that undergird eugenics.  E.g., Pet. for Cert. 22-26; Brief for State of Wisconsin et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 19-25; Brief for Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 9-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Iceland, the abortion rate for children diagnosed with Down syndrome in utero approaches 100%.  See Will, The Down Syndrome Genocide, Washington Post, Mar. 15, 2018, p.\u00a0A23, col. 1.  Other European countries have similarly high rates, and the rate in the United States is approximately two-thirds.  See ibid. (98% in Denmark, 90% in the United Kingdom, 77% in France, and 67% in the United States); see also Natoli, Ackerman, McDermott, & Edwards, Prenatal Diagnosis of Down Syndrome: A Systematic Review of Termination Rates (1995-2011), 32 Prenatal Diagnosis 142 (2012) (reviewing U.\u00a0S. studies).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Asia, widespread sex-selective abortions have led to as many as 160 million \"missing\" women--more than the entire female population of the United States.  See M. Hvistendahl, Unnatural Selection: Choosing Boys Over Girls, and the Consequences of a World Full of Men 5-6 (2011); see also Kalantry, How To Fix India's Sex-Selection Problem, N.\u00a0Y. Times, Int'l ed., July 28, 2017, p.\u00a09 (\"Over the course of several decades, 300,000 to 700,000 female fetuses were selectively aborted in India each year.  Today there are about 50 million more men than women in the country\").  And recent evidence suggests that sex-selective abortions of girls are common among certain populations in the United States as well.  See Almond & Sun, Son-Biased Sex Ratios in 2010 U.\u00a0S. Census and 2011-2013 U.\u00a0S. Natality Data, 176 Soc. Sci. & Med. 21 (2017) (concluding that Chinese and Asian-Indian families in the United States \"show a tendency to sex-select boys\"); Almond & Edlund, Son-Biased Sex Ratios in the 2000 United States Census, 105 Proc. Nat. Acad. of Sci. 5681 (2008) (similar).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eight decades after Sanger's \"Negro Project,\" abortion in the United States is also marked by a considerable racial disparity.  The reported nationwide abortion ratio-the number of abortions per 1,000 live births--among black women is nearly 3.5 times the ratio for white women.  Dept. of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, T. Jatlaoui et\u00a0al., Abortion Surveillance--United States, 2015, 67 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, Surveillance Summaries, No. SS-13, p.\u00a035 (Nov. 23, 2018) (Table 13); see also Brief for Restoration Project et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 5-6.  And there are areas of New York City in which black children are more likely to be aborted than they are to be born alive--and are up to eight times more likely to be aborted than white children in the same area.  See N.\u00a0Y. Dept. of Health, Table 23: Induced Abortion and Abortion Ratios by Race\/Ethnicity and Resident County New York State-2016, https:\/\/www.health.ny.gov\/statistics\/vital_statistics\/ 2016\/table23.htm.  Whatever the reasons for these disparities, they suggest that, insofar as abortion is viewed as a method of \"family planning,\" black people do indeed \"tak[e] the brunt of the 'planning.'\u00a0\"  Dempsey, supra, at\u00a082.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some believe that the United States is already experiencing the eugenic effects of abortion.  According to one economist, \"Roe v. Wade help[ed] trigger, a generation later, the greatest crime drop in recorded history.\"  S. Levitt & S. Dubner, Freakonomics 6 (2005); see id., at 136-144 (elaborating on this theory).  On this view, \"it turns out that not all children are born equal\" in terms of criminal propensity.  Id., at 6.  And legalized abortion meant that the children of \"poor, unmarried, and teenage mothers\" who were \"much more likely than average to become criminals\" \"weren't being born.\"  Ibid. (emphasis deleted).  Whether accurate or not, these observations echo the views articulated by the eugenicists and by Sanger decades earlier: \"Birth Control of itself .\u00a0.\u00a0. will make a better race\" and tend \"toward the elimination of the unfit.\"  Racial Betterment 11-12.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was against this background that Indiana's Legislature, on the 100th anniversary of its 1907 sterilization law, adopted a concurrent resolution formally \"express[ing] its regret over Indiana's role in the eugenics movement in this country and the injustices done under eugenic laws.\"  Ind. S. Res. 91, 115th Gen. Assemb., 1st Sess., \u00a71 (2007); see Brief for Pro-Life Legal Defense Fund et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 6-8.  Recognizing that laws implementing eugenic goals \"targeted the most vulnerable among us, including the poor and racial minorities, .\u00a0.\u00a0. for the claimed purpose of public health and the good of the people,\" Ind. S. Res. 91, at 2, the General Assembly \"urge[d] the citizens of Indiana to become familiar with the history of the eugenics movement\" and \"repudiate the many laws passed in the name of eugenics and reject any such laws in the future,\" id., \u00a72.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In March 2016, the Indiana Legislature passed by wide margins the Sex-Selective and Disability Abortion Ban at issue here.  Respondent Planned Parenthood promptly filed a lawsuit to block the law from going into effect, arguing that the Constitution categorically protects a woman's right to abort her child based solely on the child's race, sex, or disability.  The District Court agreed, granting a preliminary injunction on the eve of the law's effective date, followed by a permanent injunction.  A panel of the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  Pointing to Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.\u00a0S. 833 (1992), both the District Court and the Seventh Circuit held that this Court had already decided the matter: \"Casey's holding that a woman has the right to terminate her pregnancy prior to viability is categorical.\"  Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. v. Commissioner of Indiana State Dept. of Health, 888 F.\u00a03d 300, 305 (CA7 2018); see Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. v. Commissioner, Indiana State Dept. of Health, 265 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 859, 866 (SD Ind. 2017).  In an opinion dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge Easterbrook expressed skepticism as to this holding, explaining that \"Casey did not consider the validity of an anti-eugenics law\" and that judicial opinions, unlike statutes, \"resolve only the situations presented for decision.\"  Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. v. Commissioner of Indiana State Dept. of Health, 917 F.\u00a03d 532, 536 (CA7 2018).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge Easterbrook was correct.  Whatever else might be said about Casey, it did not decide whether the Constitution requires States to allow eugenic abortions.  It addressed the constitutionality of only \"five provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982\" that were said to burden the supposed constitutional right to an abortion.  Casey, supra, at 844.  None of those provisions prohibited abortions based solely on race, sex, or disability.  In fact, the very first paragraph of the respondents' brief in Casey made it clear to the Court that Pennsylvania's prohibition on sex-selective abortions was \"not [being] challenged,\" Brief for Respondents in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, O. T. 1991, Nos. 91-744, 91-902, p.\u00a04.  In light of the Court's denial of certiorari today, the constitutionality of other laws like Indiana's thus remains an open question.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's decision to allow further percolation should not be interpreted as agreement with the decisions below.  Enshrining a constitutional right to an abortion based solely on the race, sex, or disability of an unborn child, as Planned Parenthood advocates, would constitutionalize the views of the 20th-century eugenics movement.  In other contexts, the Court has been zealous in vindicating the rights of people even potentially subjected to race, sex, and disability discrimination.  Cf. Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 15) (condemning \"discrimination on the basis of race\" as \"\u00a0'odious in all aspects'\u00a0\"); United States v. Virginia, 518 U.\u00a0S. 515, 532 (1996) (denouncing any \"law or official policy [that] denies to women, simply because they are women, .\u00a0.\u00a0. equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society based on their individual talents and capacities\"); Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.\u00a0S. 509, 522 (2004) (condemning \"irrational disability discrimination\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the Court declines to wade into these issues today, we cannot avoid them forever.  Having created the constitutional right to an abortion, this Court is dutybound to address its scope.  In that regard, it is easy to understand why the District Court and the Seventh Circuit looked to Casey to resolve a question it did not address.  Where else could they turn?  The Constitution itself is silent on abortion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With these observations, I join the opinion of the Court.\n\nOpinion of Ginsburg, J.\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nKRISTINA BOX, COMMISSIONER, INDIANA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, et\u00a0al. v.

As to the first question, I would not summarily reverse a judgment when application of the proper standard would likely yield restoration of the judgment.  In the District Court and on appeal to the Seventh Circuit, Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky urged that Indiana's law on the disposition of fetal remains should not pass even rational-basis review.1  But as Chief Judge Wood observed, \"rational basis\" is not the proper review standard.  Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. v. Commissioner of Indiana State Dept. of Health, 917 F.\u00a03d 532, 534 (CA7 2018) (opinion concurring in denial of rehearing en banc).  This case implicates \"the right of [a] woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State,\" Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.\u00a0S. 833, 846 (1992), so heightened review is in order, Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 20).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is \"a waste of th[e] [C]ourt's resources\" to take up a case simply to say we are bound by a party's \"strategic litigation choice\" to invoke rational-basis review alone, but \"everything might be different\" under the close review instructed by the Court's precedent.  917 F.\u00a03d, at 534, 535 (opinion of Wood, C. J.).  I would therefore deny Indiana's petition in its entirety.2\n\n\nKRISTINA BOX, COMMISSIONER, INDIANA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, et\u00a0al. v.

See Ind. Code \u00a7\u00a716\u221234\u22122\u22121.1(a)(1)(K), 16\u221234\u22123\u22124(a), 16\u221234\u2212 4\u22124, 16\u221234\u22124\u22125, 16\u221234\u22124\u22126, 16\u221234\u22124\u22127, 16\u221234\u2212 4\u22128, 16\u221241\u221216\u22124(d), 16\u221241\u221216\u22125 (2018).  We reverse  the judgment of the Seventh Circuit with respect to the first question presented, and we deny the petition with respect to the second question presented.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first challenged provision altered the manner in which abortion providers may dispose of fetal remains.  Among other changes, it excluded fetal remains from the definition of infectious and pathological waste, \u00a7\u00a716\u221241\u221216\u22124(d), 16\u221241\u221216\u22125, thereby preventing incineration of fetal remains along with surgical byproducts.  It also authorized simultaneous cremation of fetal remains, \u00a716\u221234\u22123\u22124(a), which Indiana does not generally allow for human remains, \u00a723\u221214\u221231\u221239(a).  The law did not affect a woman's right under existing law \"to determine the final disposition of the aborted fetus.\"  \u00a716\u221234\u22123\u22122(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents have never argued that Indiana's law creates an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion.  Cf. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.\u00a0S. 833, 874 (1992) (plurality opinion).  Respondents have instead litigated this case on the assumption that the law does not implicate a fundamental right and is therefore subject only to ordinary rational basis review.  See Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. v. Commissioner of Indiana State Dept. of Health, 888 F.\u00a03d 300, 307 (2018).  To survive under that standard, a state law need only be \"rationally related to legitimate government interests.\"  Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.\u00a0S. 702, 728 (1997).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Seventh Circuit found Indiana's disposition law invalid even under this deferential test.  It first held that Indiana's stated interest in \"the 'humane and dignified disposal of human remains'\u00a0\" was \"not .\u00a0.\u00a0. legitimate.\"  888 F.\u00a03d, at 309.  It went on to hold that even if Indiana's stated interest were legitimate, \"it [could not] identify a rational relationship\" between that interest and \"the law as written,\" because the law preserves a woman's right to dispose of fetal remains however she wishes and allows for simultaneous cremation.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We now reverse that determination.  This Court has already acknowledged that a State has a \"legitimate interest in proper disposal of fetal remains.\"  Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.\u00a0S. 416, 452, n.\u00a045 (1983).  The Seventh Circuit clearly erred in failing to recognize that interest as a permissible basis for Indiana's disposition law.  See Armour v. Indianapolis, 566 U.\u00a0S. 673, 685 (2012) (on rational basis review, \"the burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it\").  The only remaining question, then, is whether Indiana's law is rationally related to the State's interest in proper disposal of fetal remains.  We conclude that it is, even if it is not perfectly tailored to that end.  See ibid. (the State need not have drawn \"the perfect line,\" as long as \"the line actually drawn [is] a rational\" one).  We therefore uphold Indiana's law under rational basis review.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We reiterate that, in challenging this provision, respondents have never argued that Indiana's law imposes an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion.  This case, as litigated, therefore does not implicate our cases applying the undue burden test to abortion regulations.  Other courts have analyzed challenges to similar disposition laws under the undue burden standard.  See Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. v. Commissioner of Indiana State Dept. of Health, 2018 WL 3655854, *2\u2212*3 (CA7, June 25, 2018) (Wood, C.\u00a0J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc).  Our opinion expresses no view on the merits of those challenges.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our opinion likewise expresses no view on the merits of the second question presented, i.e., whether Indiana may prohibit the knowing provision of sex-, race-, and disabilityselective abortions by abortion providers.  Only the Seventh Circuit has thus far addressed this kind of law.  We follow our ordinary practice of denying petitions insofar as they raise legal issues that have not been considered by additional Courts of Appeals.  See this Court's Rule 10.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, we grant certiorari with respect to the first question presented in the petition and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to that question.  We deny certiorari with respect to the second question presented.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor would deny the petition for a writ of certiorari as to both questions presented.\n\nThomas, J., concurring\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nKRISTINA BOX, COMMISSIONER, INDIANA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, et\u00a0al. v. PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF INDIANA AND  KENTUCKY, INC., et\u00a0al.\non petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit\nNo. 18-483.\u2003Decided May 28, 2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, concurring.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indiana law prohibits abortion providers from treating the bodies of aborted children as \"infectious waste\" and incinerating them alongside used needles, laboratory-animal carcasses, and surgical byproducts.  Ind. Code \u00a716-41-16-4(d) (2019); see \u00a7\u00a716-41-16-2, 16-41-16-4, 16-41-16-5; Ind. Admin. Code, tit. 410, \u00a7\u00a735-1-3, 35-2-1(a)(2) (2019).  A panel of the Seventh Circuit held that this fetal-remains law was irrational, and thus unconstitutional, under the doctrine of \"substantive due process.\"  That decision was manifestly inconsistent with our precedent, as the Court holds.1  I would have thought it could go without saying that nothing in the Constitution or any decision of this Court prevents a State from requiring abortion facilities to provide for the respectful treatment of human remains. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I write separately to address the other aspect of Indiana law at issue here--the \"Sex Selective and Disability Abortion Ban.\"  Ind. Code \u00a716-34-4-1 et\u00a0seq.  This statute makes it illegal for an abortion provider to perform an abortion in Indiana when the provider knows that the mother is seeking the abortion solely because of the child's race, sex, diagnosis of Down syndrome, disability, or related characteristics.  \u00a7\u00a716-34-4-1 to 16-34-4-8; see \u00a716-34-4-1(b) (excluding \"lethal fetal anomal[ies]\" from the definition of disability).  The law requires that the mother be advised of this restriction and given information about financial assistance and adoption alternatives, but it imposes liability only on the provider.  See \u00a7\u00a716-34-2-1.1(a)(1)(K), (2)(A)-(C), 16-34-4-9.  Each of the immutable characteristics protected by this law can be known relatively early in a pregnancy, and the law prevents them from becoming the sole criterion for deciding whether the child will live or die.  Put differently, this law and other laws like it promote a State's compelling interest in preventing abortion from becoming a tool of modern-day eugenics.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The use of abortion to achieve eugenic goals is not merely hypothetical.  The foundations for legalizing abortion in America were laid during the early 20th-century birth-control movement.  That movement developed alongside the American eugenics movement.  And significantly, Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger recognized the eugenic potential of her cause.  She emphasized and embraced the notion that birth control \"opens the way to the eugenist.\"  Sanger, Birth Control and Racial Betterment, Birth Control Rev., Feb. 1919, p.\u00a012 (Racial Betterment).  As a means of reducing the \"ever increasing, unceasingly spawning class of human beings who never should have been born at all,\" Sanger argued that \"Birth Control .\u00a0.\u00a0. is really the greatest and most truly eugenic method\" of \"human generation.\"  M. Sanger, Pivot of Civilization 187, 189 (1922) (Pivot of Civilization).  In her view, birth control had been \"accepted by the most clear thinking and far seeing of the Eugenists themselves as the most constructive and necessary of the means to racial health.\"  Id., at 189.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that Sanger was not referring to abortion when she made these statements, at least not directly.  She recognized a moral difference between \"contraceptives\" and other, more \"extreme\" ways for \"women to limit their families,\" such as \"the horrors of abortion and infanticide.\"  M. Sanger, Woman and the New Race 25, 5 (1920) (Woman and the New Race).  But Sanger's arguments about the eugenic value of birth control in securing \"the elimination of the unfit,\" Racial Betterment 11, apply with even greater force to abortion, making it significantly more effective as a tool of eugenics.  Whereas Sanger believed that birth control could prevent \"unfit\" people from reproducing, abortion can prevent them from being born in the first place.  Many eugenicists therefore supported legalizing abortion, and abortion advocates--including future Planned Parenthood President Alan Guttmacher--endorsed the use of abortion for eugenic reasons.  Technological advances have only heightened the eugenic potential for abortion, as abortion can now be used to eliminate children with unwanted characteristics, such as a particular sex or disability.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the potential for abortion to become a tool of eugenic manipulation, the Court will soon need to confront the constitutionality of laws like Indiana's.  But because further percolation may assist our review of this issue of first impression, I join the Court in declining to take up the issue now.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The term \"eugenics\" was coined in 1883 by Francis Galton, a British statistician and half-cousin of Charles Darwin.  See S. Caron, Who Chooses?: American Reproductive History Since 1830, p.\u00a049 (2008); A. Cohen, Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck 46 (2016) (Imbeciles).  Galton described eugenics as \"the science of improving stock\" through \"all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give to the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have.\"  F. Galton, Inquiries Into Human Faculty and Its Development 25, n.\u00a01 (1883).  Eugenics thus rests on the assumption that \"man's natural abilities are derived by inheritance, under exactly the same limitations as are the form and physical features of the whole organic world.\"  F. Galton, Hereditary Genius: An Inquiry Into Its Laws and Consequences 1 (1869) (Hereditary Genius); see Imbeciles 46-47.  As a social theory, eugenics is rooted in social Darwinism--i.e., the application of the \"survival of the fittest\" principle to human society.  Caron, supra, at 49; Imbeciles 45.  Galton argued that by promoting reproduction between people with desirable qualities and inhibiting reproduction of the unfit, man could improve society by \"do[ing] providently, quickly, and kindly\" \"[w]hat Nature does blindly, slowly, and ruthlessly.\"  F. Galton, Eugenics: Its Definition, Scope and Aims, in Essays in Eugenics 42 (1909).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the 1920s, eugenics had become a \"full-fledged intellectual craze\" in the United States, particularly among progressives, professionals, and intellectual elites.  Imbeciles 2; see id., at 2-4, 55-57; Cohen, Harvard's Eugenics Era, Harvard Magazine, pp.\u00a048-52 (Mar.-Apr. 2016) (Harvard's Eugenics Era).  Leaders in the eugenics movement held prominent positions at Harvard, Stanford, and Yale, among other schools, and eugenics was taught at 376 universities and colleges.  Imbeciles 4; see also Harvard's Eugenics Era 48.  Although eugenics was widely embraced, Harvard was \"more central to American eugenics than any other university,\" with administrators, faculty members, and alumni \"founding eugenics organizations, writing academic and popular eugenics articles, and lobbying government to enact eugenics laws.\"  Ibid.; see id., at 49-52.  One Harvard faculty member even published a leading textbook on the subject through the Harvard University Press, Genetics and Eugenics.  Id., at 49.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many eugenicists believed that the distinction between the fit and the unfit could be drawn along racial lines, a distinction they justified by pointing to anecdotal and statistical evidence of disparities between the races.  Galton, for example, purported to show as a scientific matter that \"the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below\" that of the Anglo-Saxon, and that \"the number among the negroes of those whom we should call half-witted men, is very large.\"  Hereditary Genius 338-339.  Other eugenicists similarly concluded that \"the Negro .\u00a0.\u00a0. is in the large eugenically inferior to the white\" based on \"the relative achievements of the race\" and statistical disparities in educational outcomes and life expectancy in North America, among other factors.  P. Popenoe & R. Johnson, Applied Eugenics 285 (1920) (Applied Eugenics); see id., at 280-297 (elaborating on this view); see also, e.g., R. Gates, Heredity and Eugenics 234 (1923) (citing disparities between white and black people and concluding that \"the negro's mental status is thus undoubtedly more primitive than that of the white man\"); Hunt, Hand, Pettis, & Russell, Abstract, Family Stock Values in White-Negro Crosses: A Note on Miscegenation, 8 Eugenical News 67 (1923) (\"Experiments, as well as general experience, indicate that the average inborn intelligence of the white man is considerably higher than that of the negro\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Building on similar assumptions, eugenicist Lothrop Stoddard argued that the \"prodigious birth-rate\" of the nonwhite races was bringing the world to a racial tipping point.  L. Stoddard, The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy 8-9 (1920).  Stoddard feared that without \"artificial barriers,\" the races \"will increasingly mingle, and the inevitable result will be the supplanting or absorption of the higher by the lower types.\"  Id., at 302.  Allowing the white race to be overtaken by inferior races, according to Stoddard, would be a tragedy of historic proportions:\n\"[T]hat would mean that the race obviously endowed with the greatest creative ability, the race which had achieved most in the past and which gave the richer promise for the future, had passed away, carrying with it to the grave those potencies upon which the realization of man's highest hopes depends.  A million years of human evolution might go uncrowned, and earth's supreme life-product, man, might never fulfil his potential destiny.  This is why we today face 'The Crisis of the Ages.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 304.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eugenic arguments like these helped precipitate the Immigration Act of 1924, which significantly reduced immigration from outside of Western and Northern Europe.  \u00a7\u00a711(a)-(b), 43 Stat. 159; Imbeciles 126-135; see also id., at 135 (discussing the difficulties the Act created for many Jews seeking to flee Nazism).  The perceived superiority of the white race also led to calls for race consciousness in marital and reproductive decisions, including through antimiscegenation laws.  Applied Eugenics 296 (\"We hold that it is to the interests of the United States .\u00a0.\u00a0. to prevent further Negro-white amalgamation\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although race was relevant, eugenicists did not define a person's \"fitness\" exclusively by race.  A typical list of dysgenic individuals would also include some combination of the \"feeble-minded,\" \"insane,\" \"criminalistic,\" \"deformed,\" \"crippled,\" \"epileptic,\" \"inebriate,\" \"diseased,\" \"blind,\" \"deaf,\" and \"dependent (including orphans and paupers).\"  Imbeciles 139; see Applied Eugenics 176-183; cf. G. Chesterton, Eugenics and Other Evils 61 (1922) (\"[F]eeble-mindedness is a new phrase under which you might segregate anybody\" because \"this phrase conveys nothing fixed and outside opinion\").  Immigration policy was insufficient to address these \"danger[s] from within,\" Imbeciles 4, so eugenicists turned to other solutions.  Many States adopted laws prohibiting marriages between certain feebleminded, epileptic, or other \"unfit\" individuals, but forced sterilization emerged as the preferred solution for many classes of dysgenic individuals.  Id., at 63, 66.  Indiana enacted the first eugenic sterilization law in 1907, and a number of other States followed suit.  Id., at 70.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court threw its prestige behind the eugenics movement in its 1927 decision upholding the constitutionality of Virginia's forced-sterilization law, Buck v. Bell, 274 U.\u00a0S. 200.  The plaintiff, Carrie Buck, had been found to be \"a feeble minded white woman\" who was \"the daughter of a feeble minded mother .\u00a0.\u00a0. and the mother of an illegitimate feeble minded child.\"  Id., at 205.3  In an opinion written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., and joined by seven other Justices, the Court offered a full-throated defense of forced sterilization:\n\"We have seen more than once that the public welfare may call upon the best citizens for their lives.  It would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap the strength of the State for these lesser sacrifices, often not felt to be such by those concerned, in order to prevent our being swamped with incompetence.  It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.  The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes.  Three generations of imbeciles are enough.\"  Id., at 207 (citation omitted).\nThe Court's decision gave the eugenics movement added legitimacy and considerable momentum; by 1931, 28 of the Nation's 48 States had adopted eugenic sterilization laws.  Imbeciles 299-300.  Buck was one of more than 60,000 people who were involuntarily sterilized between 1907 and 1983.  Id., at 319.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Support for eugenics waned considerably by the 1940s as Americans became familiar with the eugenics of the Nazis and scientific literature undermined the assumptions on which the eugenics movement was built.  But even today, the Court continues to attribute legal significance to the same types of racial-disparity evidence that were used to justify race-based eugenics.  See T. Sowell, Discrimination and Disparities 5-6 (rev. ed. 2019) (Sowell).4  And support for the goal of reducing undesirable populations through selective reproduction has by no means vanished.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case highlights the fact that abortion is an act rife with the potential for eugenic manipulation.  From the beginning, birth control and abortion were promoted as means of effectuating eugenics.  Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger was particularly open about the fact that birth control could be used for eugenic purposes.  These arguments about the eugenic potential for birth control apply with even greater force to abortion, which can be used to target specific children with unwanted characteristics.  Even after World War II, future Planned Parenthood President Alan Guttmacher and other abortion advocates endorsed abortion for eugenic reasons and promoted it as a means of controlling the population and improving its quality.  As explained below, a growing body of evidence suggests that eugenic goals are already being realized through abortion.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like many elites of her day, Sanger accepted that eugenics was \"the most adequate and thorough avenue to the solution of racial, political and social problems.\"  Sanger, The Eugenic Value of Birth Control Propaganda, Birth Control Rev., Oct. 1921, p.\u00a05 (Propaganda).  She agreed with eugenicists that \"the unbalance between the birth rate of the 'unfit' and the 'fit'\u00a0\" was \"the greatest present menace to civilization.\"  Ibid.  Particularly \"in a democracy like that of the United States,\" where \"[e]quality of political power has .\u00a0.\u00a0. been bestowed upon the lowest elements of our population,\" Sanger worried that \"reckless spawning carries with it the seeds of destruction.\"  Pivot of Civilization 177-178.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although Sanger believed that society was \"indebted\" to \"the Eugenists\" for diagnosing these problems, she did not believe that they had \"show[n] much power in suggesting practical and feasible remedies.\"  Id., at 178.  \"As an advocate of Birth Control,\" Sanger attempted to fill the gap by showing that birth control had \"eugenic and civilizational value.\"  Propaganda 5.  In her view, birth-control advocates and eugenicists were \"seeking a single end\"--\"to assist the race toward the elimination of the unfit.\"  Racial Betterment 11.  But Sanger believed that the focus should be \"upon stopping not only the reproduction of the unfit but upon stopping all reproduction when there is not economic means of providing proper care for those who are born in health.\"  Ibid. (emphasis added).  Thus, for Sanger, forced sterilization did \"not go to the bottom of the matter\" because it did not \"touc[h] the great problem of unlimited reproduction\" of \"those great masses, who through economic pressure populate the slums and there produce in their helplessness other helpless, diseased and incompetent masses, who overwhelm all that eugenics can do among those whose economic condition is better.\"  Id., at 12.  In Sanger's view, frequent reproduction among \"the majority of wage workers\" would lead to \"the contributing of morons, feeble-minded, insane and various criminal types to the already tremendous social burden constituted by these unfit.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sanger believed that birth control was an important part of the solution to these societal ills.  She explained, \"Birth Control .\u00a0.\u00a0. is really the greatest and most truly eugenic method\" of \"human generation,\" \"and its adoption as part of the program of Eugenics would immediately give a concrete and realistic power to that science.\"  Pivot of Civilization 189.  Sanger even argued that \"eugenists and others who are laboring for racial betterment\" could not \"succeed\" unless they \"first clear[ed] the way for Birth Control.\"  Racial Betterment 11.  If \"the masses\" were given \"practical education in Birth Control\"--for which there was \"almost universal demand\"--then the \"Eugenic educator\" could use \"Birth Control propaganda\" to \"direct a thorough education in Eugenics\" and influence the reproductive decisions of the unfit.  Propaganda 5.  In this way, \"the campaign for Birth Control [was] not merely of eugenic value, but [was] practically identical in ideal with the final aims of Eugenics.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sanger herself campaigned for birth control in black communities.  In 1930, she opened a birth-control clinic in Harlem.  See Birth Control or Race Control? Sanger and the Negro Project, Margaret Sanger Papers Project Newsletter #28 (2001), http:\/\/www.nyu.edu\/projects\/sanger\/ articles\/bc_or_race_control.php (all Internet materials as last visited May 24, 2019).  Then, in 1939, Sanger initiated the \"Negro Project,\" an effort to promote birth control in poor, Southern black communities.  Ibid.  Noting that blacks were \"\u00a0'notoriously underprivileged and handicapped to a large measure by a \"caste\" system,'\u00a0\" she argued in a fundraising letter that \"\u00a0'birth control knowledge brought to this group, is the most direct, constructive aid that can be given them to improve their immediate situation.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  In a report titled \"Birth Control and the Negro,\" Sanger and her coauthors identified blacks as \"\u00a0'the great problem of the South'\u00a0\"--\"the group with 'the greatest economic, health, and social problems'\u00a0\"--and developed a birth-control program geared toward this population.  Ibid.  She later emphasized that black ministers should be involved in the program, noting, \"\u00a0'We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defenders of Sanger point out that W. E. B. DuBois  and other black leaders supported the Negro Project and argue that her writings should not be read to imply a racial bias.  Ibid.; see Planned Parenthood, Opposition Claims About Margaret Sanger (2016), https:\/\/www. plannedparenthood.org\/uploads\/filer_public\/37\/\u00a0fd\u00a0\/\u00a037fdc7b6de5f-4d22\u00a0-\u00a08c05\u00a0-\u00a09568268e92d8\u00a0\/\u00a0sanger_opposition_claims_ fact_sheet_2016.pdf.  But Sanger's motives are immaterial to the point relevant here: that \"Birth Control\" has long been understood to \"ope[n] the way to the eugenist.\"  Racial Betterment 12.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, Sanger distinguished between birth control and abortion.  Woman and the New Race 128-129; see, e.g., Sanger, Birth Control or Abortion? Birth Control Rev., Dec. 1918, pp.\u00a03-4.  For Sanger, \"[t]he one means health and happiness--a stronger, better race,\" while \"[t]he other means disease, suffering, [and] death.\"  Woman and the New Race 129.  Sanger argued that \"nothing short of contraceptives can put an end to the horrors of abortion and infanticide,\" id., at 25, and she questioned whether \"we want the precious, tender qualities of womanhood, so much needed for our racial development, to perish in [the] sordid, abnormal experiences\" of abortions, id., at 29.  In short, unlike contraceptives, Sanger regarded \"the hundreds of thousands of abortions performed in America each year [as] a disgrace to civilization.\"  Id., at 126.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although Sanger was undoubtedly correct in recognizing a moral difference between birth control and abortion, the eugenic arguments that she made in support of birth control apply with even greater force to abortion.  Others were well aware that abortion could be used as a \"metho[d] of eugenics,\" 6 H. Ellis, Studies in the Psychology of Sex 617 (1910), and they were enthusiastic about that possibility.  Indeed, some eugenicists believed that abortion should be legal for the very purpose of promoting eugenics.  See Harris, Abortion in Soviet Russia: Has the Time Come To Legalize It Elsewhere? 25 Eugenics Rev. 22 (1933) (\"[W]e are being increasingly compelled to consider legalized abortion as well as birth control and sterilization as possible means of influencing the fitness and happiness and quality of the race\"); Aims and Objects of the Eugenics Society, 26 Eugenics Rev. 135 (1934) (\"The Society advocates the provision of legalized facilities for voluntarily terminating pregnancy in cases of persons for whom sterilization is regarded as appropriate\").  Support for abortion can therefore be found throughout the literature on eugenics.  E.g., Population Control: Dr. Binnie Dunlop's Address to the Eugenics Society, 25 Eugenics Rev. 251 (1934) (lamenting \"the relatively high birth-rate of the poorest third of the population\" and \"the serious rate of racial deterioration which it implied,\" and arguing that \"this birth-rate .\u00a0.\u00a0. would fall rapidly if artificial abortion were made legal\"); Williams, The Legalization of Medical Abortion, 56 Eugenics Rev. 24-25 (1964) (\"I need hardly stress the eugenic argument for extending family planning\"--including \"voluntary sterilization\" and \"abortion\"--to \"all groups, not merely to those who are the most intelligent and socially responsible\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Abortion advocates were sometimes candid about abortion's eugenic possibilities.  In 1959, for example, Guttmacher explicitly endorsed eugenic reasons for abortion.  A. Guttmacher, Babies by Choice or by Chance 186-188 (1959).  He explained that \"the quality of the parents must be taken into account,\" including \"[f\u00a0]eeble-mindedness,\" and believed that \"it should be permissible to abort any pregnancy .\u00a0.\u00a0. in which there is a strong probability of an abnormal or malformed infant.\"  Id., at 198.  He added that the question whether to allow abortion must be \"separated from emotional, moral and religious concepts\" and \"must have as its focus normal, healthy infants born into homes peopled with parents who have healthy bodies and minds.\"  Id., at 221.  Similarly, legal scholar Glanville Williams wrote that he was open to the possibility of eugenic infanticide, at least in some situations, explaining that \"an eugenic killing by a mother, exactly paralleled by the bitch that kills her misshapen puppies, cannot confidently be pronounced immoral.\"  G. Williams, Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law 20 (1957).  The Court cited Williams' book for a different proposition in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.\u00a0S. 113, 130, n.\u00a09 (1973).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But public aversion to eugenics after World War II also led many to avoid explicit references to that term.  The American Eugenics Society, for example, changed the name of its scholarly publication from \"Eugenics Quarterly\" to \"Social Biology.\"  See D. Paul, Controlling Human Heredity: 1865 to the Present, p.\u00a0125 (1995).  In explaining the name change, the journal's editor stated that it had become evident that eugenic goals could be achieved \"for reasons other than eugenics.\"  Ibid.  For example, \"[b]irth control and abortion are turning out to be great eugenic advances of our time.  If they had been advanced for eugenic reasons it would have retarded or stopped their acceptance.\"  Ibid.  But whether they used the term \"eugenics\" or not, abortion advocates echoed the arguments of early 20th-century eugenicists by describing abortion as a way to achieve \"population control\" and to improve the \"quality\" of the population.  One journal declared that \"abortion is the one mode of population limitation which has demonstrated the speedy impact which it can make upon a national problem.\"  Notes of the Quarter: The Personal and the Universal, 53 Eugenics Rev. 186 (1962).  Planned Parenthood's leaders echoed these themes.  When exulting over \"\u00a0'fantastic .\u00a0.\u00a0. progress'\u00a0\" in expanding abortion, for example, Guttmacher stated that \"\u00a0'the realization of the population problem has been responsible' for the change in attitudes.  'We're now concerned more with the quality of population than the quantity.'\u00a0\"  Abortion Reforms Termed \"Fantastic,\" Hartford Courant, Mar. 21, 1970, p.\u00a016.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Avoiding the word \"eugenics\" did not assuage everyone's fears.  Some black groups saw \"\u00a0'family planning' as a euphemism for race genocide\" and believed that \"black people [were] taking the brunt of the 'planning'\u00a0\" under Planned Parenthood's \"ghetto approach\" to distributing its services.  Dempsey, Dr. Guttmacher Is the Evangelist of Birth Control, N.\u00a0Y. Times Magazine, Feb. 9, 1969, p.\u00a082.  \"The Pittsburgh branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,\" for example, \"criticized family planners as bent on trying to keep the Negro birth rate as low as possible.\"  Kaplan, Abortion and Sterilization Win Support of Planned Parenthood, N.\u00a0Y. Times, Nov. 14, 1968, p.\u00a0L50, col. 1.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, notwithstanding Sanger's views on abortion, respondent Planned Parenthood promotes both birth control and abortion as \"reproductive health services\" that can be used for family planning.  Brief in Opposition 1.  And with today's prenatal screening tests and other technologies, abortion can easily be used to eliminate children with unwanted characteristics.  Indeed, the individualized nature of abortion gives it even more eugenic potential than birth control, which simply reduces the chance of conceiving any child.  As petitioners and several amicus curiae briefs point out, moreover, abortion has proved to be a disturbingly effective tool for implementing the discriminatory preferences that undergird eugenics.  E.g., Pet. for Cert. 22-26; Brief for State of Wisconsin et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 19-25; Brief for Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 9-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Iceland, the abortion rate for children diagnosed with Down syndrome in utero approaches 100%.  See Will, The Down Syndrome Genocide, Washington Post, Mar. 15, 2018, p.\u00a0A23, col. 1.  Other European countries have similarly high rates, and the rate in the United States is approximately two-thirds.  See ibid. (98% in Denmark, 90% in the United Kingdom, 77% in France, and 67% in the United States); see also Natoli, Ackerman, McDermott, & Edwards, Prenatal Diagnosis of Down Syndrome: A Systematic Review of Termination Rates (1995-2011), 32 Prenatal Diagnosis 142 (2012) (reviewing U.\u00a0S. studies).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Asia, widespread sex-selective abortions have led to as many as 160 million \"missing\" women--more than the entire female population of the United States.  See M. Hvistendahl, Unnatural Selection: Choosing Boys Over Girls, and the Consequences of a World Full of Men 5-6 (2011); see also Kalantry, How To Fix India's Sex-Selection Problem, N.\u00a0Y. Times, Int'l ed., July 28, 2017, p.\u00a09 (\"Over the course of several decades, 300,000 to 700,000 female fetuses were selectively aborted in India each year.  Today there are about 50 million more men than women in the country\").  And recent evidence suggests that sex-selective abortions of girls are common among certain populations in the United States as well.  See Almond & Sun, Son-Biased Sex Ratios in 2010 U.\u00a0S. Census and 2011-2013 U.\u00a0S. Natality Data, 176 Soc. Sci. & Med. 21 (2017) (concluding that Chinese and Asian-Indian families in the United States \"show a tendency to sex-select boys\"); Almond & Edlund, Son-Biased Sex Ratios in the 2000 United States Census, 105 Proc. Nat. Acad. of Sci. 5681 (2008) (similar).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eight decades after Sanger's \"Negro Project,\" abortion in the United States is also marked by a considerable racial disparity.  The reported nationwide abortion ratio-the number of abortions per 1,000 live births--among black women is nearly 3.5 times the ratio for white women.  Dept. of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, T. Jatlaoui et\u00a0al., Abortion Surveillance--United States, 2015, 67 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, Surveillance Summaries, No. SS-13, p.\u00a035 (Nov. 23, 2018) (Table 13); see also Brief for Restoration Project et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 5-6.  And there are areas of New York City in which black children are more likely to be aborted than they are to be born alive--and are up to eight times more likely to be aborted than white children in the same area.  See N.\u00a0Y. Dept. of Health, Table 23: Induced Abortion and Abortion Ratios by Race\/Ethnicity and Resident County New York State-2016, https:\/\/www.health.ny.gov\/statistics\/vital_statistics\/ 2016\/table23.htm.  Whatever the reasons for these disparities, they suggest that, insofar as abortion is viewed as a method of \"family planning,\" black people do indeed \"tak[e] the brunt of the 'planning.'\u00a0\"  Dempsey, supra, at\u00a082.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some believe that the United States is already experiencing the eugenic effects of abortion.  According to one economist, \"Roe v. Wade help[ed] trigger, a generation later, the greatest crime drop in recorded history.\"  S. Levitt & S. Dubner, Freakonomics 6 (2005); see id., at 136-144 (elaborating on this theory).  On this view, \"it turns out that not all children are born equal\" in terms of criminal propensity.  Id., at 6.  And legalized abortion meant that the children of \"poor, unmarried, and teenage mothers\" who were \"much more likely than average to become criminals\" \"weren't being born.\"  Ibid. (emphasis deleted).  Whether accurate or not, these observations echo the views articulated by the eugenicists and by Sanger decades earlier: \"Birth Control of itself .\u00a0.\u00a0. will make a better race\" and tend \"toward the elimination of the unfit.\"  Racial Betterment 11-12.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was against this background that Indiana's Legislature, on the 100th anniversary of its 1907 sterilization law, adopted a concurrent resolution formally \"express[ing] its regret over Indiana's role in the eugenics movement in this country and the injustices done under eugenic laws.\"  Ind. S. Res. 91, 115th Gen. Assemb., 1st Sess., \u00a71 (2007); see Brief for Pro-Life Legal Defense Fund et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 6-8.  Recognizing that laws implementing eugenic goals \"targeted the most vulnerable among us, including the poor and racial minorities, .\u00a0.\u00a0. for the claimed purpose of public health and the good of the people,\" Ind. S. Res. 91, at 2, the General Assembly \"urge[d] the citizens of Indiana to become familiar with the history of the eugenics movement\" and \"repudiate the many laws passed in the name of eugenics and reject any such laws in the future,\" id., \u00a72.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In March 2016, the Indiana Legislature passed by wide margins the Sex-Selective and Disability Abortion Ban at issue here.  Respondent Planned Parenthood promptly filed a lawsuit to block the law from going into effect, arguing that the Constitution categorically protects a woman's right to abort her child based solely on the child's race, sex, or disability.  The District Court agreed, granting a preliminary injunction on the eve of the law's effective date, followed by a permanent injunction.  A panel of the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  Pointing to Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.\u00a0S. 833 (1992), both the District Court and the Seventh Circuit held that this Court had already decided the matter: \"Casey's holding that a woman has the right to terminate her pregnancy prior to viability is categorical.\"  Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. v. Commissioner of Indiana State Dept. of Health, 888 F.\u00a03d 300, 305 (CA7 2018); see Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. v. Commissioner, Indiana State Dept. of Health, 265 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 859, 866 (SD Ind. 2017).  In an opinion dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge Easterbrook expressed skepticism as to this holding, explaining that \"Casey did not consider the validity of an anti-eugenics law\" and that judicial opinions, unlike statutes, \"resolve only the situations presented for decision.\"  Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. v. Commissioner of Indiana State Dept. of Health, 917 F.\u00a03d 532, 536 (CA7 2018).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge Easterbrook was correct.  Whatever else might be said about Casey, it did not decide whether the Constitution requires States to allow eugenic abortions.  It addressed the constitutionality of only \"five provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982\" that were said to burden the supposed constitutional right to an abortion.  Casey, supra, at 844.  None of those provisions prohibited abortions based solely on race, sex, or disability.  In fact, the very first paragraph of the respondents' brief in Casey made it clear to the Court that Pennsylvania's prohibition on sex-selective abortions was \"not [being] challenged,\" Brief for Respondents in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, O. T. 1991, Nos. 91-744, 91-902, p.\u00a04.  In light of the Court's denial of certiorari today, the constitutionality of other laws like Indiana's thus remains an open question.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's decision to allow further percolation should not be interpreted as agreement with the decisions below.  Enshrining a constitutional right to an abortion based solely on the race, sex, or disability of an unborn child, as Planned Parenthood advocates, would constitutionalize the views of the 20th-century eugenics movement.  In other contexts, the Court has been zealous in vindicating the rights of people even potentially subjected to race, sex, and disability discrimination.  Cf. Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 15) (condemning \"discrimination on the basis of race\" as \"\u00a0'odious in all aspects'\u00a0\"); United States v. Virginia, 518 U.\u00a0S. 515, 532 (1996) (denouncing any \"law or official policy [that] denies to women, simply because they are women, .\u00a0.\u00a0. equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society based on their individual talents and capacities\"); Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.\u00a0S. 509, 522 (2004) (condemning \"irrational disability discrimination\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the Court declines to wade into these issues today, we cannot avoid them forever.  Having created the constitutional right to an abortion, this Court is dutybound to address its scope.  In that regard, it is easy to understand why the District Court and the Seventh Circuit looked to Casey to resolve a question it did not address.  Where else could they turn?  The Constitution itself is silent on abortion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With these observations, I join the opinion of the Court.\n\nOpinion of Ginsburg, J.\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nKRISTINA BOX, COMMISSIONER, INDIANA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, et\u00a0al. v.

As to the first question, I would not summarily reverse a judgment when application of the proper standard would likely yield restoration of the judgment.  In the District Court and on appeal to the Seventh Circuit, Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky urged that Indiana's law on the disposition of fetal remains should not pass even rational-basis review.1  But as Chief Judge Wood observed, \"rational basis\" is not the proper review standard.  Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. v. Commissioner of Indiana State Dept. of Health, 917 F.\u00a03d 532, 534 (CA7 2018) (opinion concurring in denial of rehearing en banc).  This case implicates \"the right of [a] woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State,\" Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.\u00a0S. 833, 846 (1992), so heightened review is in order, Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 20).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is \"a waste of th[e] [C]ourt's resources\" to take up a case simply to say we are bound by a party's \"strategic litigation choice\" to invoke rational-basis review alone, but \"everything might be different\" under the close review instructed by the Court's precedent.  917 F.\u00a03d, at 534, 535 (opinion of Wood, C. J.).  I would therefore deny Indiana's petition in its entirety.2\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Justice Ginsburg's dissent from this holding makes little sense.

And Justice Ginsburg does not even attempt to argue that the decision below was correct.  Instead, she adopts Chief Judge Wood's alternative suggestion that regulating the disposition of an aborted child's body might impose an \"undue burden\" on the mother's right to abort that (already aborted) child.  See post, at 1.  This argument is difficult to understand, to say the least--which may explain why even respondent Planned Parenthood did not make it.  The argument also lacks evidentiary support.

After a fraudulent federal income tax return was filed in the name of respondent Frank Varela, a Lamps Plus employee, Varela filed a putative class action against Lamps Plus in Federal District Court on behalf of employees whose information had been compromised.  Relying on the arbitration agreement in Varela's employment contract, Lamps Plus sought to compel arbitration--on an individual rather than a classwide basis--and to dismiss the suit.  The District Court rejected the individual arbitration request, but authorized class arbitration and dismissed Varela's claims.  Lamps Plus appealed, arguing that the District Court erred by compelling class arbitration, but the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  This Court had held in Stolt-Nielsen S.\u00a0A. v. AnimalFeeds Int'l Corp., 559 U.\u00a0S. 662, that a court may not compel classwide arbitration when an agreement is silent on the availability of such arbitration.

An order that both compels arbitration and dismisses the underlying claims qualifies as \"a final decision with respect to an arbitration\" within the meaning of 9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716(a)(3), the jurisdictional provision on which Lamps Plus relies.  See Green Tree Financial Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, 531 U.\u00a0S. 79, 89.  Varela attempts to distinguish Randolph on the ground that the appeal here was taken by the party who had already secured the relief it requested, i.e., Lamps Plus had already obtained an order dismissing the claim and compelling arbitration.  But Lamps Plus did not secure the relief it requested, since it sought individual rather than class arbitration.  The shift from individual to class arbitration is a \"fundamental\" change, Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 686, that \"sacrifices the principal advantage of arbitration\" and \"greatly increases risks to defendants,\" AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S. 333, 348, 350.  Avoiding these consequences gives Lamps Plus the \"necessary personal stake\" to appeal.  Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.\u00a0S. 692, 702.  Pp.\u00a03-5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Under the Federal Arbitration Act, an ambiguous agreement cannot provide the necessary contractual basis for concluding that the parties agreed to submit to class arbitration.

Teamsters, 561 U.\u00a0S. 287, 299 (internal quotation marks omitted), and the task for courts and arbitrators is \"to give effect to the intent of the parties,\" Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., 684.  In carrying out that responsibility, it is important to recognize the \"fundamental\" difference between class arbitration and the individualized form of arbitration envisioned by the FAA.  Class arbitration \"sacrifices the principal advantage of arbitration--its informality--and makes the process slower, more costly, and more likely to generate procedural morass than final judgment.\"  Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 348.  Because of such \"crucial differences,\" Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 687, this Court has held that courts may not infer consent to participate in class arbitration absent an affirmative \"contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so,\" id., at 684.  Silence is not enough.  Id., at 687.  That reasoning controls here.  Like silence, ambiguity does not provide a sufficient basis to conclude that parties to an arbitration agreement agreed to \"sacrifice[\u00a0] the principal advantage of arbitration.\"  Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 348.  This conclusion aligns with the Court's refusal to infer consent when it comes to other fundamental arbitration questions.  See, e.g., First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.\u00a0S. 938, 945.  Pp. 6-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The Ninth Circuit's contrary conclusion was based on the state law contra proferentem doctrine, which counsels that contractual ambiguities should be construed against the drafter.  That default rule is based on public policy considerations and seeks ends other than the intent of the parties.  Such an approach is flatly inconsistent with \"the foundational FAA principle that arbitration is a matter of consent.\"  Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 684.  Varela claims that the rule is nondiscriminatory and gives equal treatment to arbitration agreements and other contracts alike, but an equal treatment principle cannot save from preemption general rules \"that target arbitration either by name or by more subtle methods, such as by 'interfer[ing] with fundamental attributes of arbitration,'\u00a0\" Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___.  This conclusion is consistent with the Court's precedents holding that the FAA provides the default rule for resolving certain ambiguities in arbitration agreements.

See 9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72.  In Stolt-Nielsen S.\u00a0A. v. AnimalFeeds Int'l Corp., 559 U.\u00a0S. 662 (2010), we held that a court may not compel arbitration on a classwide basis when an agreement is \"silent\" on the availability of such arbitration.  Because class arbitration fundamentally changes the nature of the \"traditional individualized arbitration\" envisioned by the FAA, Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 8), \"a party may not be compelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so,\" Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 684 (emphasis in original).  We now consider whether the FAA similarly bars an order requiring class arbitration when an agreement is not silent, but rather \"ambiguous\" about the availability of such arbitration.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Lamps Plus is a company that sells light fixtures and related products.  In 2016, a hacker impersonating a company official tricked a Lamps Plus employee into disclosing the tax information of approximately 1,300 other employees.  Soon after, a fraudulent federal income tax return was filed in the name of Frank Varela, a Lamps Plus employee and respondent here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like most Lamps Plus employees, Varela had signed an arbitration agreement when he started work at the company.  But after the data breach, he sued Lamps Plus in Federal District Court in California, bringing state and federal claims on behalf of a putative class of employees whose tax information had been compromised.  Lamps Plus moved to compel arbitration on an individual rather than classwide basis, and to dismiss the lawsuit.  In a single order, the District Court granted the motion to compel arbitration and dismissed Varela's claims without prejudice.  But the court rejected Lamps Plus's request for individual arbitration, instead authorizing arbitration on a classwide basis.  Lamps Plus appealed the order, arguing that the court erred by compelling class arbitration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  701 Fed. Appx. 670 (2017).  The court acknowledged that Stolt-Nielsen prohibits forcing a party \"to submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so\" and that Varela's agreement \"include[d] no express mention of class proceedings.\"  701 Fed. Appx., at 672.  But that did not end the inquiry, the court reasoned, because the fact that the agreement \"does not expressly refer to class arbitration is not the 'silence' contemplated in Stolt-Nielsen.\"  Ibid.  In Stolt-Nielsen, the parties had stipulated that their agreement was silent about class arbitration.  Because there was no such stipulation here, the court concluded that Stolt-Nielsen was not controlling.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit then determined that the agreement was ambiguous on the issue of class arbitration.  On the one hand, as Lamps Plus argued, certain phrases in the agreement seemed to contemplate \"purely binary claims.\"  Ibid.  At the same time, as Varela asserted, other phrases were capacious enough to include class arbitration, such as one stating that \"arbitration shall be in lieu of any and all lawsuits or other civil legal proceedings relating to my employment.\"  Ibid.  The Ninth Circuit followed California law to construe the ambiguity against the drafter, a rule that \"applies with peculiar force in the case of a contract of adhesion\" such as this.  Ibid. (quoting Sandquist v. Lebo Auto., Inc., 1 Cal. 5th 233, 248, 376 P.\u00a03d 506, 514 (2016)).  Because Lamps Plus had drafted the agreement, the court adopted Varela's interpretation authorizing class arbitration.  Judge Fernandez dissented.  In his view, the agreement was not ambiguous, and the majority's holding was a \"palpable evasion of Stolt-Nielsen.\"  701 Fed. Appx., at 673.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lamps Plus petitioned for a writ of certiorari, arguing that the Ninth Circuit's decision contravened Stolt-Nielsen and created a conflict among the Courts of Appeals.  In opposition, Varela not only disputed those contentions but also argued for the first time that the Ninth Circuit lacked jurisdiction over the appeal, and that this Court therefore lacked jurisdiction in turn.  We granted certiorari.  584 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We begin with jurisdiction.  Section 16 of the FAA governs appellate review of arbitration orders.  9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716.  Varela contends that the Ninth Circuit lacked statutory jurisdiction because section 16 permits appeal from orders denying motions to compel arbitration, \u00a716(a)(1)(B), but not orders granting such motions, \u00a716(b)(2).  Brief for Respondent 9-12; see also post, at 3 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  This argument is beside the point, however, because Lamps Plus relies for jurisdiction on a different provision of section 16, section 16(a)(3).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 16(a)(3) provides that an appeal may be taken from \"a final decision with respect to an arbitration that is subject to this title.\"  We construed that provision in Green Tree Financial Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, 531 U.\u00a0S. 79 (2000), a case where, as here, the District Court had issued an order both compelling arbitration and dismissing the underlying claims.  We held that such an order directing \"the parties to proceed to arbitration, and dismiss[ing] all the claims before [the court], .\u00a0.\u00a0. is 'final' within the meaning of \u00a716(a)(3), and therefore appealable.\"  Id., at 89.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Varela attempts to distinguish Randolph on the ground that the appeal here was taken by the party who sought an order to dismiss the claim and compel arbitration, Lamps Plus.  He claims the company \"lacked standing to appeal the dismissal,\" because the District Court's order \"provided precisely the relief Lamps Plus sought.\"  Brief for Respondent 13, 15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Lamps Plus did not secure the relief it requested.  It sought an order compelling individual arbitration.  What it got was an order rejecting that relief and instead compelling arbitration on a classwide basis.  We have explained--and will elaborate further below--that shifting from individual to class arbitration is a \"fundamental\" change, Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 686, that \"sacrifices the principal advantage of arbitration\" and \"greatly increases risks to defendants,\" AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S. 333, 348, 350 (2011).  Lamps Plus's interest in avoiding those consequences gives it the \"necessary personal stake in the appeal\" required by our precedent.  Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.\u00a0S. 692, 702 (2011).2\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit applied California contract law to conclude that the parties' agreement was ambiguous on the availability of class arbitration.  In California, an agreement is ambiguous \"when it is capable of two or more constructions, both of which are reasonable.\"  701 Fed. Appx., at 672 (quoting Powerine Oil Co. v. Superior Ct., 37 Cal. 4th 377, 390, 118 P.\u00a03d 589, 598 (2005)).  Following our normal practice, we defer to the Ninth Circuit's interpretation and application of state law and thus accept that the agreement should be regarded as ambiguous.  See, e.g., Expressions Hair Design v. Schneiderman, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 7).3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We therefore face the question whether, consistent with the FAA, an ambiguous agreement can provide the necessary \"contractual basis\" for compelling class arbitration.  Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 684.  We hold that it cannot--a conclusion that follows directly from our decision in Stolt-Nielsen.  Class arbitration is not only markedly different from the \"traditional individualized arbitration\" contemplated by the FAA, it also undermines the most important benefits of that familiar form of arbitration.  Epic Systems, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8); see Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 686-687.  The statute therefore requires more than ambiguity to ensure that the parties actually agreed to arbitrate on a classwide basis.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The FAA requires courts to \"enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms.\"  Epic Systems, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (quoting American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant, 570 U.\u00a0S. 228, 233 (2013)).  Although courts may ordinarily accomplish that end by relying on state contract principles, First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.\u00a0S. 938, 944 (1995), state law is preempted to the extent it \"stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\" of the FAA, Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 352 (internal quotation marks omitted).  At issue in this case is the interaction between a state contract principle for addressing ambiguity and a \"rule[\u00a0] of fundamental importance\" under the FAA, namely, that arbitration \"is a matter of consent, not coercion.\"  Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 681 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"[T]he first principle that underscores all of our arbitration decisions\" is that \"[a]rbitration is strictly a matter of consent.\"  Granite Rock Co. v. Teamsters, 561 U.\u00a0S. 287, 299 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We have emphasized that \"foundational FAA principle\" many times.  Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 684; see also, e.g., Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U.\u00a0S. 79, 83 (2002); First Options, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 943; Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U.\u00a0S. 52, 57 (1995); Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U.\u00a0S. 468, 479 (1989); Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.\u00a0S. 614, 626 (1985).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consent is essential under the FAA because arbitrators wield only the authority they are given.  That is, they derive their \"powers from the parties' agreement to forgo the legal process and submit their disputes to private dispute resolution.\"  Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 682.  Parties may generally shape such agreements to their liking by specifying with whom they will arbitrate, the issues subject to arbitration, the rules by which they will arbitrate, and the arbitrators who will resolve their disputes.  Id., at 683-684.  Whatever they settle on, the task for courts and arbitrators at bottom remains the same: \"to give effect to the intent of the parties.\"  Id., at 684.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In carrying out that responsibility, it is important to recognize the \"fundamental\" difference between class arbitration and the individualized form of arbitration envisioned by the FAA.  Epic Systems, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8); see also Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 349, 351; Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 686-687.  In individual arbitration, \"parties forgo the procedural rigor and appellate review of the courts in order to realize the benefits of private dispute resolution: lower costs, greater efficiency and speed, and the ability to choose expert adjudicators to resolve specialized disputes.\"  Id., at 685.  Class arbitration lacks those benefits.  It \"sacrifices the principal advantage of arbitration--its informality--and makes the process slower, more costly, and more likely to generate procedural morass than final judgment.\"  Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 348.  Indeed, we recognized just last Term that with class arbitration \"the virtues Congress originally saw in arbitration, its speed and simplicity and inexpensiveness, would be shorn away and arbitration would wind up looking like the litigation it was meant to displace.\"  Epic Systems, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  Class arbitration not only \"introduce[s] new risks and costs for both sides,\" ibid., it also raises serious due process concerns by adjudicating the rights of absent members of the plaintiff class--again, with only limited judicial review.  See Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S., 349; see also Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 686 (citing Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.\u00a0S. 815, 846 (1999)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because of these \"crucial differences\" between individual and class arbitration, Stolt-Nielsen explained that there is \"reason to doubt the parties' mutual consent to resolve disputes through classwide arbitration.\"  559 U.\u00a0S., at 687, 685-686.  And for that reason, we held that courts may not infer consent to participate in class arbitration absent an affirmative \"contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so.\"  Id., at 684.  Silence is not enough; the \"FAA requires more.\"  Id., at 687.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our reasoning in Stolt-Nielsen controls the question we face today.  Like silence, ambiguity does not provide a sufficient basis to conclude that parties to an arbitration agreement agreed to \"sacrifice[\u00a0] the principal advantage of arbitration.\"  Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 348.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This conclusion aligns with our refusal to infer consent when it comes to other fundamental arbitration questions.  For example, we presume that parties have not authorized arbitrators to resolve certain \"gateway\" questions, such as \"whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement at all or whether a concededly binding arbitration clause applies to a certain type of controversy.\"  Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U.\u00a0S. 444, 452 (2003) (plurality opinion).  Although parties are free to authorize arbitrators to resolve such questions, we will not conclude that they have done so based on \"silence or ambiguity\" in their agreement, because \"doing so might too often force unwilling parties to arbitrate a matter they reasonably would have thought a judge, not an arbitrator, would decide.\"  First Options, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 945 (emphasis added); see also Howsam, 537 U.\u00a0S., at 83-84.  We relied on that same reasoning in Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 686-687, and it applies with equal force here.  Neither silence nor ambiguity provides a sufficient basis for concluding that parties to an arbitration agreement agreed to undermine the central benefits of arbitration itself.4\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit reached a contrary conclusion based on California's rule that ambiguity in a contract should be construed against the drafter, a doctrine known as contra proferentem.  The rule applies \"only as a last resort\" when the meaning of a provision remains ambiguous after exhausting the ordinary methods of interpretation.  3 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7559, pp. 268-270 (1960).  At that point, contra proferentem resolves the ambiguity against the drafter based on public policy factors, primarily equitable considerations about the parties' relative bargaining strength.  See 2 E. Farnsworth, Contracts \u00a77.11, pp. 300-304 (3d ed. 2004); see also 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts \u00a732:12, pp. 788-792 (4th ed. 2012) (stating that application of the rule may vary based on \"the degree of sophistication of the contracting parties or the degree to which the contract was negotiated\"); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7206, pp. 80-81, 105-107 (1979) (classifying contra proferentem under \"Considerations of Fairness and the Public Interest\" rather than with rules for interpreting \"The Meaning of Agreements\"); 3 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7559, at 270 (noting that contra proferentem is \"chiefly a rule of public policy\").  Although the rule enjoys a place in every hornbook and treatise on contracts, we noted in a recent FAA case that \"the reach of the canon construing contract language against the drafter must have limits, no matter who the drafter was.\"  DIRECTV, Inc. v. Imburgia, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 10).  This case brings those limits into focus.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike contract rules that help to interpret the meaning of a term, and thereby uncover the intent of the parties, contra proferentem is by definition triggered only after a court determines that it cannot discern the intent of the parties.  When a contract is ambiguous, contra proferentem provides a default rule based on public policy considerations; \"it can scarcely be said to be designed to ascertain the meanings attached by the parties.\"  2 Farnsworth, Contracts \u00a77.11, at 303.  Like the contract rule preferring interpretations that favor the public interest, see id., at 304, contra proferentem seeks ends other than the intent of the parties.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"[C]lass arbitration, to the extent it is manufactured by [state law] rather than consen[t], is inconsistent with the FAA.\"  Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 348.  We recently reiterated that courts may not rely on state contract principles to \"reshape traditional individualized arbitration by mandating classwide arbitration procedures without the parties' consent.\"  Epic Systems, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  But that is precisely what the court below did, requiring class arbitration on the basis of a doctrine that \"does not help to determine the meaning that the two parties gave to the words, or even the meaning that a reasonable person would have given to the language used.\"  3 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7559, at 269-270.  Such an approach is flatly inconsistent with \"the foundational FAA principle that arbitration is a matter of consent.\"  Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 684.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Varela and Justice Kagan defend application of the rule on the basis that it is nondiscriminatory.  It does not conflict with the FAA, they argue, because it is a neutral rule that gives equal treatment to arbitration agreements and other contracts alike.  See Brief for Respondent 18, 25-26; post, at 6-9 (Kagan, J., dissenting).  We have explained, however, that such an equal treatment principle cannot save from preemption general rules \"that target arbitration either by name or by more subtle methods, such as by 'interfer[ing] with fundamental attributes of arbitration.'\u00a0\" Epic Systems, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (quoting Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 344).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That was the case in Concepcion.  There, the Court considered the general contract defense of unconscionability, which had been interpreted by the state court to bar class action waivers in consumer contracts, whether in the litigation or arbitration context.  See id., at 341-344.  The general applicability of the rule did not save it from preemption under the FAA with respect to arbitration agreements, because it had the consequence of allowing any party to a consumer arbitration agreement to demand class proceedings \"without the parties' consent.\"  Epic Systems, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (describing the \"essential insight\" of Concepcion).  That, for the reasons we have explained, \"interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration and thus creates a scheme inconsistent with the FAA.\"  Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 344; see Epic Systems, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 8-9).  The same reasoning applies here: The general contra proferentem rule cannot be applied to impose class arbitration in the absence of the parties' consent.5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our opinion today is far from the watershed Justice Kagan claims it to be.  Rather, it is consistent with a long line of cases holding that the FAA provides the default rule for resolving certain ambiguities in arbitration agreements.  For example, we have repeatedly held that ambiguities about the scope of an arbitration agreement must be resolved in favor of arbitration.  See, e.g., Mitsubishi Motors Corp., 473 U.\u00a0S., at 626; Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.\u00a0S. 1, 24-25 (1983).  In those cases, we did not seek to resolve the ambiguity by asking who drafted the agreement.  Instead, we held that the FAA itself provided the rule.

Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U.\u00a0S. 79, 87 (2002) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  Federal courts must therefore apply \"background principles of state contract law\" when evaluating arbitration agreements.  Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, 556 U.\u00a0S. 624, 630 (2009); Perry v.

Some companies have ceased requiring employees to arbitrate sexual harassment claims, see McGregor, Firms May Follow Tech Giants on Forced Arbitration, Washington Post, Nov. 13, 2018, p.\u00a0A15, col. 1, or have extended their no-forced-arbitration policy to a broader range of claims, see Wakabayashi, Google Scraps Forced Arbitration Policy, N.\u00a0Y. Times, Feb. 22, 2019, p.\u00a0B5, col. 4.  And some States have endeavored to safeguard employees' opportunities to bring sexual harassment suits in court.  See, e.g., N.\u00a0Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a77515 (West 2019) (rendering unenforceable certain mandatory arbitration clauses covering sexual harassment claims).

In my view, the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to hear this case.  Consequently, we lack jurisdiction as well.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71254.  My reason for reaching this conclusion is the following.  The Federal Arbitration Act, at \u00a74, says that a \"court,\" upon being satisfied that the parties have agreed to arbitrate a claim, \"shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement.\"  9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a74.  Section 16 of the Act then says that \"an appeal may not be taken from an interlocutory order .\u00a0.\u00a0. directing arbitration to proceed under section 4 of this title.\"  \u00a716(b)(2) (emphasis added).  And directing arbitration to proceed is just what the District Court did here.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These statutory provisions reflect a congressional effort (in respect to a specific subject matter) to help resolve a more general problem.  Too few interlocutory appeals will too often impose upon parties delay and expense that an interlocutory appeal, by quickly correcting a lower court error, might have spared them.  But too many interlocutory appeals will too often unnecessarily delay proceedings while a party appeals and loses.  And delays can clog the appellate system, thereby slowing down the workings, and adding to the costs, of the judicial system seen as a whole. Congress' jurisdictional statutes consequently compromise, providing, for example, for interlocutory appeals in some instances, such as cases involving injunctive orders, see, e.g., 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71292(a)(1), or where important separable legal questions are at issue, see, e.g., Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.\u00a0S. 662, 671 (2009), or where a district court certifies an open legal question to a court of appeals for determination, see, e.g., 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71292(b).  But often statutes and rules require the parties to proceed to the end of a trial before obtaining appellate review.  See, e.g., \u00a71291.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statutory provisions before us are a local species of this jurisdictional genus.  In them, Congress limited interlocutory review of orders concerning arbitration in a way that favors arbitration.  Consequently, \u00a716(a) of the FAA will normally allow an immediate appeal where arbitration is denied, but \u00a716(b) will normally require parties to wait until the end of the arbitration in order to bring legal questions about that proceeding to a court of appeals.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A couple of examples illustrate the point.  Take first \u00a74 of the FAA.  Section 4 provides that a \"court,\" upon being satisfied that the parties have agreed to arbitrate a claim, \"shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement.\"  9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a74.  Section 16(a) of the FAA provides that a party may immediately appeal a district court order refusing to compel arbitration under \u00a74, while \u00a716(b) provides that a party generally may not immediately appeal a district court order compelling arbitration under \u00a74.  Compare \u00a716(a)(1)(B) (\"An appeal may be taken from\" an order \"denying a petition under section 4 of this title\") with \u00a716(b)(2) (\"[A]n appeal may not be taken from an interlocutory order .\u00a0.\u00a0. directing arbitration to proceed under section 4 of this title\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 3 of the FAA provides another good example.  Where a suit contains several claims, and the district court has determined that the parties agreed to arbitrate only a subset of those claims, \u00a73 of the FAA provides that the district court must stay the litigation at the request of either party.  See \u00a73 (providing that a court, when referring claims for arbitration, \"shall on application of one of the parties stay\" the case \"until such arbitration has been had\").  The stay relieves the parties of the burden and distraction of continuing to litigate any remaining claims while the arbitration is ongoing.  And true to the FAA's proarbitration appellate scheme, \u00a716(a) permits immediate appeals of district court orders refusing to enter a stay, while \u00a716(b) generally prohibits immediate appeals of district court orders granting a stay.  Compare \u00a716(a)(1)(A) (\"An appeal may be taken from\" an order \"refusing a stay of any action under section 3 of this title\") with \u00a716(b)(1) (\"[A]n appeal may not be taken from an interlocutory order .\u00a0.\u00a0. granting a stay of any action under section 3 of this title\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could go on.  Section 16(a) of the FAA permits immediate appeal of an interlocutory order granting an injunction against arbitration, while \u00a716(b) generally prohibits immediate appeal of an order refusing to enjoin an arbitration.  Compare \u00a716(a)(2) with \u00a716(b)(4).  Section 16(a) of the FAA permits immediate appeal of an order denying an application to compel arbitration pursuant to \u00a7206, while \u00a716(b) generally prohibits immediate appeal of an order compelling arbitration pursuant to \u00a7206.  Compare \u00a716(a)(1)(C) with \u00a716(b)(3).  Et cetera.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The point, however, is that the appellate scheme of the FAA reflects Congress' policy decision that, if a district court determines that arbitration of a claim is called for, there should be no appellate interference with the arbitral process unless and until that process has run its course.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With \u00a716's structure, and Congress' policy in mind, we can turn to the facts of this case.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent Frank Varela is an employee of petitioner Lamps Plus, Inc.  At the outset of their employment relationship, Varela and Lamps Plus agreed to arbitrate employment-related claims.  Varela later filed suit against Lamps Plus on behalf of himself and a class of Lamps Plus' employees.  Lamps Plus asked the District Court to compel arbitration.  And the District Court granted Lamps Plus' request.  Despite having won the relief that it requested, Lamps Plus appealed the District Court's order because Lamps Plus objected to the District Court's conclusion that the parties' agreement permitted arbitration on a classwide basis.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's judgment.  And we granted Lamps Plus' petition for certiorari to consider whether the Court of Appeals erred in so ruling.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But on those facts, I think that the Court lacks jurisdiction over Lamps Plus' petition.  When Lamps Plus responded to Varela's lawsuit by seeking a motion to compel arbitration, and the District Court granted that motion, this case fell neatly into \u00a716(b)'s description of unappealable district court orders under the FAA.  The parties were obligated by the FAA to arbitrate their dispute without the expense and delay of further litigation.  If, after arbitration, the parties were dissatisfied with the award or with the District Court's arbitration related decisions, \u00a716(a) of the FAA provides for an appeal at that later date.  See \u00a7\u00a716(a)(1)(D)-(E) (permitting appeals of orders confirming, modifying, or vacating an award); see also \u00a716(a)(3) (permitting appeal of \"a final decision with respect to an arbitration\").  But, in the interim, \u00a716(b) deprived the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction to hear any such complaint.  See \u00a7\u00a716(b)(1)-(4).  I recognize that Lamps Plus is dissatisfied with the arbitration that the District Court ordered here.  But the District Court's order nonetheless granted the motion compelling arbitration, leaving Lamps Plus to bring its claim to an appellate court only after the arbitration is completed.  See \u00a716(b)(2).  I believe we should enforce the statutory provisions that lead to this conclusion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lamps Plus offers three arguments in response.  First, Lamps Plus suggests the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction over Lamps Plus' appeal because the District Court order at issue here not only granted Lamps Plus's motion to compel arbitration, but also granted Lamps Plus' motion to dismiss the case.  See Brief for Petitioners 29.  Lamps Plus points out that \u00a716(a) permits the appeal of \"a final decision with respect to an arbitration.\"  9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716(a)(3).  Lamps Plus reasons that, so long as a decision is final, it is appealable under the FAA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I disagree because I do not believe that the District Court had the discretion to dismiss the case immediately after granting Lamps Plus' motion to compel arbitration.  Section 4 of the FAA permits a district court to compel the parties to arbitrate their claim, and \u00a716(b)(2) explains that \"an appeal may not be taken from an interlocutory order .\u00a0.\u00a0. directing arbitration to proceed under section 4 of this title.\"  Thus, the District Court order compelling arbitration was interlocutory and generally unappealable.  As I have just explained, to read the statute any other way would contravene \u00a716's proarbitration appeal scheme by turning an interlocutory order that would have been unappealable under \u00a716(b) of the Act into a dismissal order that is appealable under \u00a716(a).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And because the order granting Lamps Plus' motion to compel was interlocutory, the District Court's dismissal of the case--in the very same order, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a--did not give the Court of Appeals jurisdiction over Lamps Plus' appeal.  An improper dismissal cannot create appellate jurisdiction to review an interlocutory order.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our decision in Microsoft Corp. v. Baker, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017), holds as much.  The plaintiffs in Microsoft sought to appeal a district court order denying certification of a class.  Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 23(f), plaintiffs can ordinarily bring such an appeal only with the court of appeals' permission.  But the plaintiffs in Baker, who had been denied permission to appeal, tried to circumvent that denial by stipulating to a voluntary dismissal of their claims.  The voluntary dismissal, they claimed, was an appealable \"final decisio[n]\" under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71291.  And in their appeal of the dismissal, they would be free to also seek review of the order denying class certification.  We disagreed.  As we explained there, to permit plaintiffs to \"transform a tentative interlocutory order into a final judgment .\u00a0.\u00a0. simply by dismissing their claims with prejudice\" would be to \"undermine \u00a71291's firm finality principle, designed to guard against piecemeal appeals, and subvert the balanced solution Rule 23(f) put in place for immediate review of class-action orders.\"  Microsoft, supra, at ___, ___ (slip op., at 2, 16) (citation omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same reasoning applies here.  Section 16(a)(3) of the FAA, like 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71291, creates appellate jurisdiction only over \"final decisions.\"  Despite that jurisdictional limit, Lamps Plus, like the plaintiffs in Microsoft, seeks review of an interlocutory order.  Like the plaintiffs in Microsoft, Lamps Plus attempts to obtain appellate review by \"transform[ing]\" an interlocutory order into a final decision.  582 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 16).  Like the plaintiffs in Microsoft, Lamps Plus has done so based on an order \"purporting to end the litigation\"--an order that Lamps Plus itself \"persuade[d] a district court to issue.\"  Ibid.  And like the plaintiffs in Microsoft, Lamps Plus does not \"complain of the 'final' order that dismissed [the] case,\" but instead seeks \"review of only the inherently interlocutory order\" compelling arbitration.  Ibid. (alterations omitted). Therefore, like the Court in Microsoft, I would hold that Lamps Plus cannot, by securing an unlawful dismissal, find a way around the appellate jurisdiction scheme that Congress wrote into the FAA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, Lamps Plus suggests that this Court has already decided that a district court order compelling arbitration and dismissing a plaintiff's complaint creates no jurisdictional problem.  Brief for Petitioners 29-30.  Lamps Plus cites Green Tree Financial Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, 531 U.\u00a0S. 79 (2000), in support of that argument.  And according to Lamps Plus, \"this Court held in Randolph\" that \"when a district court orders arbitration and dismisses the plaintiff's claims,\" the order is \"final\" and therefore appealable under \u00a716 of the FAA.  Brief for Petitioners 29-30.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Randolph does not control the jurisdictional aspect of this case.  The Randolph Court explicitly reserved the question that we face now, stating: \"Had the District Court entered a stay instead of a dismissal in this case, that order would not be appealable.  9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716(b)(1).  The question whether the District Court should have taken that course is not before us, and we do not address it.\"  Randolph, supra, at 87, n. 2 (emphasis added).  Thus, although the Randolph Court stated that \u00a716(a)(3) of the FAA permits appeals of final orders entered under the FAA, the Court did not decide whether a district court could convert an interlocutory, unappealable order under \u00a716(b) into an appealable order under \u00a716(a) by entering a dismissal instead of a stay.  For that reason, Randolph does not answer the jurisdictional question here.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, and finally, Lamps Plus suggests that the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction because the District Court \"effectively denied Lamps Plus's motion to compel arbitration\" when the District Court interpreted the arbitration agreement to permit class arbitration.  Brief for Petitioners 31 (emphasis deleted).  Leaning heavily on dicta from Stolt-Nielsen S.\u00a0A. v. AnimalFeeds Int'l Corp., 559 U.\u00a0S. 662 (2010), Lamps Plus argues that class arbitration is so \"fundamental[ly]\" different from individual arbitration that the fact that \"the district court purported to grant Lamps Plus's motion is not controlling.\"  Brief for Petitioners 31.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Stolt-Nielsen cannot bear the weight Lamps Plus would place on it.  We held in Stolt-Nielsen that a party may not be compelled to \"submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so.\"  559 U.\u00a0S., at 684.  We did not hold that class arbitration is not arbitration at all.  And because class arbitration is arbitration, the District Court's interpretation of Lamps Plus and Varela's arbitration agreement to permit class arbitration could not create appellate jurisdiction over the District Court order compelling the parties to arbitrate their dispute.  See 9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716(b)(2) (prohibiting interlocutory appeals of district court orders \"directing arbitration to proceed\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor did we hold in Stolt-Nielsen (or anywhere else) that \u00a716 of the FAA permits appeals of interlocutory orders directing arbitration to proceed, so long as the order incorporates some ruling that one party dislikes.  If that were the rule, then \u00a716's limitations on appellate jurisdiction would be near meaningless.  Consequently, the courts of appeals have--rightly, I believe--long recognized that they lack jurisdiction over appeals from orders that compel arbitration, \"albeit not in the 'first-choice'\u00a0\" manner of the party that moved to compel.  Al Rushaid v. National Oilwell Varco, Inc., 814 F. 3d 300, 304 (CA5 2016).  See also, e.g., Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mass., Inc. v. BCS Ins. Co., 671 F. 3d 635, 638 (CA7 2011) (concluding that the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction over an order compelling arbitration but denying a motion to direct arbitrators to \"hold separate rather than consolidated proceedings\"); Bushley v. Credit Suisse First Boston, 360 F. 3d 1149, 1154 (CA9 2004) (similar holding with respect to a request that arbitration take place before a different forum); Augustea Impb Et Salvataggi v. Mitsubishi Corp., 126 F.\u00a03d 95, 98 (CA2 1997) (similar holding with respect to a request that the parties arbitrate in a different location).  As one of those courts explained, \"[p]ursuant to the plain meaning of th[e] statute .\u00a0.\u00a0. a party cannot appeal a district court's order unless, at the end of the day, the parties are forced to settle their dispute other than by arbitration.\" Id., at 99.  And Lamps Plus' characterization of the District Court's order compelling arbitration as an \"effectiv[e] den[ial]\" of Lamps Plus' motion \"does not make it so.\"  Blue Cross Blue Shield, supra, at 637.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, I would hold that we lack jurisdiction over this case.  But because the Court accepts jurisdiction and decides the substantive legal question before us, I shall do the same.  And in respect to that question I agree with Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan, and I join their dissents.\n\nSotomayor, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-988\nLAMPS PLUS, INC., et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v.

AnimalFeeds Int'l Corp., 559 U.\u00a0S. 662, 686 (2010), that class-action arbitration \"is not arbitration as envisioned by the\" Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S. 333, 351 (2011).  See, e.g., id., at 362-365 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  A class action is simply \"a procedural device\" that allows multiple plaintiffs to aggregate their claims, 1 W. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions \u00a7 1:1 (5th ed. 2011), \"[f]or convenience .\u00a0.\u00a0. and to prevent a failure of justice,\" Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble, 255 U.\u00a0S. 356, 363 (1921).  Where, as here, an employment agreement provides for arbitration as a forum for all disputes relating to a person's employment and the rules of that forum allow for class actions, an employee who signs an arbitration agreement should not be expected to realize that she is giving up access to that procedural device.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, as Justice Kagan explains, the employment contract that Frank Varela signed went further.  It states that \"\u00a0'any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to[\u00a0] the employment relationship between the parties[\u00a0] shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration.'\u00a0\"  Post, at 2 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a).  It adds that Varela and Lamps Plus \"consent to the resolution by arbitration of all claims that may hereafter arise in connection with [Varela's] employment.\"  Id., at 24a-25a.  And it provides for arbitration \"\u00a0'in accordance with'\u00a0\" the rules of the arbitral forum, which in turn allow for class arbitration.  Post, at 3 (opinion of Kagan, J.) (citing App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a-26a).  That is enough to persuade me that the contract was at least ambiguous as to whether Varela in fact agreed that no class-action procedures would be available in arbitration if he and his co-workers all suffered the same harm \"relating to\" and \"in connection with\" their \"employment.\"  See id., at 24a-25a.  And the court below was correct to turn to state law to resolve the ambiguity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court today reads the FAA to pre-empt the neutral principle of state contract law on which the court below relied.  I cannot agree.  I also note that the majority reaches its holding without actually agreeing that the contract is ambiguous.  See ante, at 5 (\"[W]e defer to the Ninth Circuit's interpretation and application of state law\").  The concurrence, meanwhile, offers reasons to conclude that the contract unambiguously precludes class arbitration, see ante, at 1-2, and n. (opinion of Thomas, J.), which would avoid the need to displace state law at all.2  This Court normally acts with great solicitude when it comes to the possible pre-emption of state law, see, e.g., Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.\u00a0S. 470, 485 (1996), but the majority today invades California contract law without pausing to address whether its incursion is necessary.  Such haste is as ill advised as the new federal common law of arbitration contracts it has begotten.\n\nKagan, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-988\nLAMPS PLUS, INC., et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v. FRANK VARELA\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\n[April 24, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer join, and with whom Justice Sotomayor joins as to Part II, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act) requires courts to enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms.  See ante, at 6.  But the Act does not federalize basic contract law.  Under the FAA, state law governs the interpretation of arbitration agreements, so long as that law treats other types of contracts in the same way.  See DIRECTV, Inc. v. Imburgia, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 6).  That well-established principle ought to resolve this case against Lamps Plus's request for individual arbitration.  In my view, the arbitration agreement Lamps Plus wrote is best understood to authorize arbitration on a classwide basis.  But even if the Court is right to view the agreement as ambiguous, a plain-vanilla rule of contract interpretation, applied in California as in every other State, requires reading it against the drafter--and so likewise permits a class proceeding here.  See Sandquist v. Lebo Auto., Inc., 1 Cal. 5th 233, 247, 376 P.\u00a03d 506, 514 (2016).  The majority can reach the opposite conclusion only by insisting that the FAA trumps that neutral state rule whenever its application would result in class arbitration.  That holding has no basis in the Act--or in any of our decisions relating to it (including the heavily relied-on Stolt-Nielsen S.\u00a0A. v. AnimalFeeds Int'l Corp., 559 U.\u00a0S. 662, 686 (2010)).  Today's opinion is rooted instead in the majority's belief that class arbitration \"undermine[s] the central benefits of arbitration itself.\"  Ante, at 9.  But that policy view--of a piece with the majority's ideas about class litigation--cannot justify displacing generally applicable state law about how to interpret ambiguous contracts.  I respectfully dissent.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From its very beginning, the arbitration agreement between Lamps Plus and Frank Varela announces its comprehensive scope.  The first sentence states: \"[T]he parties agree that any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to[\u00a0] the employment relationship between the parties[\u00a0] shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a.  The phrase \"any and all disputes, claims, or controversies\" encompasses both their individual and their class variants--just as any other general category (e.g., any and all chairs) includes all particular types (e.g., desk and reclining).  So Varela's class action (which arose out of or related to his employment) was a \"dispute, claim or controversy\" that belonged in arbitration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next paragraph continues in the same vein, by describing what Varela gave up by signing the agreement.  \"[A]rbitration,\" the agreement says, \"shall be in lieu of any and all lawsuits or other civil legal proceedings relating to my employment.\"  Ibid.; see ibid. (similarly waiving the right \"to file a lawsuit or other civil action or proceeding\").  That is the language of forum selection: Any and all actions (both individual and class) that I could once have brought in court, I am agreeing now to bring in arbitration.  The provision carries no hint of consent to surrender altogether--in arbitration as well as court--the ability to bring a class proceeding.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further on, the remedial and procedural terms of the agreement support reading it to authorize class arbitration.  The arbitrator, according to the contract, may \"award any remedy allowed by applicable law.\"  Id., at 26a.  That sweeping provision easily encompasses classwide relief when the \"any and all disputes\" that the contract's first sentence places in arbitration call for such remedies.1  And under the agreement, the arbitration shall be conducted \"in accordance with\" the rules of either of two designated arbitration providers--both of which furnish rules for arbitrators to conduct class proceedings.  Id., at 25a-26a; see, e.g., American Arbitration Assn., Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations (2011).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even the section Lamps Plus cites in arguing that the agreement bars class arbitration instead points to the opposite conclusion.  In describing what the agreement covers, one provision states: \"The Company and I mutually consent to the resolution by arbitration of all claims or controversies ('claims'), past, present or future that I may have against the Company.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a; see id., at 24a-25a (\"Specifically, the Company and I mutually consent to the resolution by arbitration of all claims that may hereafter arise in connection with my employment\").  Lamps Plus (along with the concurrence, see ante, at 1-2 (opinion of Thomas, J.)) highlights \"th[e] repeated use of singular personal pronouns\" there, contending that it is incompatible with a form of arbitration that also involves other parties' claims.  Brief for Petitioners 17.  But the use of the first person singular merely reflects that the agreement is bilateral in nature--between Varela and Lamps Plus.  Those pronouns do not resolve whether one of those parties (\"I\") can bring to arbitration class disputes, as well as individual disputes, relating to his employment.  The part of the quoted section addressing that question is instead the phrase \"all claims or controversies.\"  And that phrase supplies the same answer as the agreement's other provisions.  For it too is broad enough to cover both individual and class actions--the ones Varela brings alone and the ones he shares with co-workers.2\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suppose, though, you think that my view of the agreement goes too far.  Maybe you aren't sure whether the phrase \"any and all disputes, claims or controversies\" must be read to include class \"disputes, claims or controversies.\"  Or maybe you wonder whether the surrounding \"I\" and \"my\" references limit that phrase's scope, rather than merely referring to one of the contract's signatories.  In short, you can see reasonable arguments on both sides of the interpretive dispute--for allowing, but also for barring, class arbitration.  You are then in the majority's position, \"accept[ing]\" the arbitration agreement as \"ambiguous.\"  Ante, at 5.  What should follow?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under California law (which applies unless preempted) the answer is clear: The agreement must be read to authorize class arbitration.  That is because California--like every other State in the country--applies a default rule construing \"ambiguities\" in contracts \"against their drafters.\"  Sandquist, 1 Cal. 5th, at 247, 376 P.\u00a03d, at 514; see Cal. Civ. Code Ann. \u00a71654 (West 2011); see also Brief for Contract Law Scholars as Amici Curiae 10-12, and n.\u00a04 (listing decisions from all 50 States applying that rule).  This anti-drafter canon--which \"applies with peculiar force\" to form contracts like Lamps Plus's--promotes clarity in contracting by resolving ambiguities against the party who held the pen.  Sandquist, 1 Cal. 5th, at 248, 376 P.\u00a03d, at 514 (quoting Graham v. Scissor-Tail, Inc., 28 Cal. 3d 807, 819, n.\u00a016, 623 P.\u00a02d 165, 172, n. 16 (1981)); see Ayres & Gertner, Filling Gaps in Incomplete Contracts, 99 Yale L.\u00a0J. 87, 91, 105, n. 80 (1989).  And the rule makes quick work of interpreting the arbitration agreement here.  Lamps Plus drafted the agreement.  It therefore had the opportunity to insert language expressly barring class arbitration if that was what it wanted.  It did not do so.  It instead (at best) left an ambiguity about the availability of class arbitration.  So California law holds that Lamps Plus cannot now claim the benefit of the doubt as to the agreement's meaning.  Even the majority does not dispute that point.  See ante, at 5, 9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And contrary to the rest of the majority's opinion,3 the FAA contemplates that such a state contract rule will control the interpretation of arbitration agreements.  Under the FAA, courts must \"enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms.\"  Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (internal quotation marks omitted) (slip op., at 5); see 9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a74 (requiring that \"arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement\").  But the construction of those contractual terms (save for in limited circumstances, addressed below) is \"a question of state law, which this Court does not sit to review.\"  Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U.\u00a0S. 468, 474 (1989).  The Court has made that crucial point many times.  Nothing in the FAA (as contrasted to today's majority opinion) \"purports to alter background principles of state contract law regarding\" the scope or content of agreements.  Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, 556 U.\u00a0S. 624, 630 (2009).  Or again: When ruling on an arbitration agreement's meaning, courts \"should apply ordinary state-law principles.\"  First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.\u00a0S. 938, 944 (1995).  Or yet again: The interpretation of such an agreement is \"a matter of state law to which we defer.\"  DIRECTV, Inc., 577 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).  In short, the FAA does not federalize contract law.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Except when state contract law discriminates against arbitration agreements.  As this Court has explained, the FAA came about because courts had shown themselves \"unduly hostile to arbitration.\"  Epic Systems, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  To remedy that problem, Congress built an \"equal-treatment principle\" into the Act, requiring courts to \"place arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts.\"  Kindred Nursing Centers L. P. v. Clark, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 4); AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S. 333, 339 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted); see 9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72 (making arbitration agreements \"valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract\").  So any state rule treating arbitration agreements worse than other contracts \"stand[s] as an obstacle\" to achieving the Act's purposes--and is preempted.  Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 343.  That means the FAA displaces any state rule discriminating on its face against arbitration.  See id., at 341.  And the Act likewise preempts any more subtle law \"disfavoring contracts that (oh so coincidentally) have the defining features of arbitration agreements.\"  Kindred Nursing, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  What matters, as this Court reiterated last Term, is whether the state law in question \"target[s]\" arbitration agreements, blatantly or covertly, for substandard treatment.  Epic Systems, 584 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).4  When the law does so, it cannot operate; when, conversely, it treats arbitration agreements the same as all other contracts, the FAA leaves it alone.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, California's anti-drafter rule is as even-handed as contract rules come.  It does not apply only to arbitration contracts.  Nor does it apply (as the rule we rejected in Concepcion did) only a tad more broadly to \"dispute-resolution contracts,\" pertaining to both arbitration and litigation.  563 U.\u00a0S., at 341 (holding that a ban on  collective-action waivers in those contracts worked to \"disfavor[\u00a0] arbitration\").  Instead, the anti-drafter rule, as even the majority admits, applies to every conceivable type of contract--and treats each identically to all others.  See Sandquist, 1 Cal. 5th, at 248, 376 P.\u00a03d, at 514 (\"This general principle of contract interpretation applies equally to the construction of arbitration provisions\"); ante, at 9-10.  And contrary to what the majority is left to insist, the rule does not \"target arbitration\" by \"interfer[ing] with [one of its] fundamental attributes\"--i.e., its supposed individualized nature.  Ante, at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted); see ante, at 7-9.  The anti-drafter rule (again, quite unlike Concepcion's ban on class-action waivers) takes no side--favors no outcome--as between class and individualized dispute resolution.  All the anti-drafter rule asks about is who wrote the contract.  So if, for example, Varela had drafted the agreement here, the rule would have prevented, rather than permitted, class arbitration.5  Small wonder, then, that this Court has itself used the anti-drafter canon to interpret an arbitration agreement.  See Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U.\u00a0S. 52, 62 (1995) (construing an  ambiguous arbitration agreement against the drafter's interest).  In that case (as properly in any other), the  rule's through-and-through neutrality made preemption unthinkable.6\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So this case should come out Varela's way even if the agreement is ambiguous.  To repeat the simple logic applicable here: Under the FAA, state law controls the interpretation of arbitration agreements unless that law discriminates against arbitration; the anti-drafter default rule is subject to no such objection; the rule therefore compels this Court to hold that the agreement here authorizes class arbitration.  That the majority thinks the contract, as so read, seriously disadvantages Lamps Plus, see ante, at 7-8, is of no moment (any more than if state law had instead construed the contract to produce adverse consequences for Varela).  The FAA was enacted to protect against judicial hostility toward arbitration agreements.  See supra, at 6.  But the Act provides no warrant for courts to disregard neutral state law in service of ensuring that those agreements give defendants the best terms possible.  Or said otherwise: Nothing in the FAA shields a contracting party, operating against the backdrop of impartial state law, from the consequences of its own drafting decisions.  How, then, could the majority go so wrong?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stolt-Nielsen offers the majority no excuse: Far from \"control[ling]\" this case, ante, at 8, that decision addressed a different situation--and explicitly reserved decision of the question here.  In Stolt-Nielsen, the contracting parties entered into a formal stipulation that \"they had not reached any agreement on the issue of class arbitration.\"  559 U.\u00a0S., at 673.  The case thus involved not the mere absence of express language about class arbitration, but a joint avowal that the parties had never resolved the issue.  Facing that oddity, an arbitral panel compelled class arbitration based solely on its \"own conception of sound policy.\"  Id., at 675; see id., at 676 (\"[T]he panel did [nothing] other than impose its own policy preference\").  This Court rejected the panel's decision for that reason, holding that a party need not \"submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so.\"  Id., at 684.  But the Court went no further.  In particular, it did not resolve cases like this one, where a neutral interpretive rule (even if not an express term) enables an adjudicator to determine a contract's meaning.  To the contrary, the Court disclaimed any view on that question.  Yes, the Court held, \"a contractual basis\" was needed for class arbitration.  Ibid. (emphasis added).  But given the panel's reliance on policy alone, the Court explained that it had \"no occasion to decide what contractual basis\" was required.  Id., at 687, n.\u00a010 (emphasis added); see Oxford Health Plans LLC v. Sutter, 569 U.\u00a0S. 564, 571 (2013) (\"We overturned the arbitral decision [in Stolt-Nielsen] because it lacked any contractual basis for ordering class procedures,\" not because it relied on an inadequate one).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, parts of Stolt-Nielsen--as well as later decisions--indicate that applying the anti-drafter rule to ambiguous language provides a sufficient contractual basis for class arbitration.  In Stolt-Nielsen, we faulted the arbitrators for failing to inquire whether the relevant law \"contain[ed] a default rule\" that would construe an arbitration clause \"as allowing class arbitration in the absence of express consent.\"  559 U.\u00a0S., at 673 (internal quotation marks omitted).  We thus implied that such a default rule--like the anti-drafter canon here--can operate to authorize class arbitration when an agreement's language is ambiguous.  And that is just how Concepcion (the other decision the majority relies on, see ante, at 7-8, 10-12) understood Stolt-Nielsen's reasoning.  Said Concepcion: We held in Stolt-Nielsen \"that an arbitration panel exceeded its power [by] imposing class procedures based on policy judgments rather than the arbitration agreement itself or some background principle of contract law that would affect its interpretation.\"  563 U.\u00a0S., at 347 (emphasis added); see Oxford Health, 569 U.\u00a0S., at 571 (similarly noting that Stolt-Nielsen criticized the arbitrators for failing to consider whether a \"default rule\" resolved the class arbitration question (internal quotation marks omitted)).  The Court has thus (rightly) viewed the use of default rules as a run-of-the-mill aspect of contract interpretation, which (so long as neutrally applied) can support class arbitration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And nothing particular to the anti-drafter rule justifies a different conclusion, as the majority elsewhere suggests, see ante, at 9-11.7  That rule, proclaims the majority, reflects \"public policy considerations,\" rather than \"help[ing] to interpret the meaning of a term\" as understood by the parties.  Ante, at 10.  The majority here notes that some commentators have viewed some equitable factors as supporting the rule, see ante, at 9-10--which is no doubt right.  But see 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts \u00a730:1, p. 11 (4th ed. 2012) (Williston) (stating that the rule is not justified by public interest considerations).  But if the majority means to claim--as it must to prove its point--that the anti-drafter rule has no concern with what \"the part[ies] agreed to,\" Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 684, then the majority is flat-out wrong.  From an ex ante perspective, the rule encourages the drafter to set out its intent in clear contractual language, for the other party then to see and agree to.  See Ayres & Gertner, 99 Yale L. J., at 91, 105, n. 80 (stating the modern view); 2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 380 (1766) (anticipating that view by 200-plus years).  And from an ex\u00a0post perspective, the rule enables an interpreter to resolve any remaining uncertainty in line with the parties' likely expectations.  See 11 Williston \u00a730:1, at 11.  Consider this very contract.  Lamps Plus, knowing about the anti-drafter rule, still chose not to include a term prohibiting class arbitration.  And Varela, seeing only the language sending \"any and all disputes, claims, or controversies\" to arbitration, had no reason to think class disputes barred.  Cf. ibid. (\"[T]he party addressed will understand ambiguous language in the sense most favorable to itself\").  The upshot is that the rule (as this Court recognized in another arbitration case) protects against \"unintended\" consequences.  Mastrobuono, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 63.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And even if that were not so evident, the FAA does not empower a court to halt the operation of such a garden-variety principle of state law.  Nothing in the Act's text requires the displacement of state contract rules, as the majority implicitly concedes.  See ante, at 6.  Nor do the Act's purposes, so long as the state rule (as is true here) extends to all contracts alike, without disfavoring arbitration.  See supra, at 6-7.  The idea that the FAA blocks a state rule satisfying that standard because (a court finds) the rule has too much \"public policy\" in it comes only from the majority's collective mind.  That approach disrespects the preeminent role of the States in designing and enforcing contract rules.  It discards a universally accepted principle of contract interpretation in favor of unsupported assertions about what the parties must have (or could not possibly have) consented to.  It subordinates authoritative state law to (at most) the impalpable emanations of federal policy, impossible to see except in just the right light.8  For that reason, it would never have graced the pages of  the U.\u00a0S. Reports save that this case involves .\u00a0.\u00a0. class proceedings.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The heart of the majority's opinion lies in its cataloging of class arbitration's many sins.  See ante, at 7-8.  In that respect, the opinion comes from the same place as (though goes a step beyond) this Court's prior arbitration decisions.  See, e.g., Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 350 (lamenting that class arbitration \"greatly increases risks to defendants\" by \"aggregat[ing] and decid[ing] at once\" the \"damages allegedly owed to tens of thousands of potential claimants\"); Epic Systems, 584 U.\u00a0S., at __ (slip op., at 8) (similarly bemoaning the greater costs and complexity of class proceedings).  The opinion likewise has more than a little in common with this Court's efforts to pare back class litigation.  See, e.g., Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.\u00a0S. 27 (2013); Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.\u00a0S. 338, 348-360 (2011).  In this case, the result is to disregard the actual contract the parties signed.  And to dismiss the neutral and commonplace default rule that would construe that contract against the drafting party.  No matter what either requires, the majority will prohibit class arbitration.  Does that approach remind you of anything?  It should.  Here (again) is Stolt-Nielsen as Concepcion described it: The panel exceeded its authority by \"imposing class procedures based on policy judgments rather than the arbitration agreement itself or some background principle of contract law that would affect its interpretation.\"  563 U.\u00a0S., at 347; see supra, at 10.  Substitute \"foreclosing\" for \"imposing\" and that is what the Court today has done.  It should instead--as the FAA contemplates--have left the parties' agreement, as construed by state law, alone.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Justice Breyer repeatedly refers to the order in this case as \"interlocutory,\" post, at 5-7 (dissenting opinion), but--as the language quoted above makes clear--Randolph expressly held that such an order is \"final\" under the FAA.  Justice Breyer also claims that Randolph \"explicitly reserved the [jurisdictional] question that we face now,\" post, at 7, but Randolph reserved a different question.  In that case, the District Court had denied a motion to stay.  We noted that, if the District Court had entered a stay instead of dismissing the case, an appeal would have been barred by 9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716(b)(1).  That said, we expressly refrained from addressing whether the District Court should have granted the stay.  See 531 U.\u00a0S., at 87, n.\u00a02.  That is the question we reserved.  Justice Breyer would have us take up that question today, post, at 3, 7, but there is no basis for doing so.  The FAA provides that a district court \"shall on application of one of the parties stay\" the case pending the arbitration.  9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73 (emphasis added).  Here, no party sought a stay.  Thus, Justice Breyer's jurisdictional analysis is premised on two events that did not happen--a District Court ruling that was never issued denying a stay request that was never made.  In short, Justice Breyer has written an opinion for a case other than the one before us.\nFootnote 2\u00a0And contrary to Varela's contention, Brief for Respondent 14-15, and Justice Breyer's dissent, post, at 6-7, this is hardly a case like Microsoft Corp. v. Baker, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017).  There, we held that plaintiffs cannot generate a final appealable order by voluntarily dismissing their claim.  Here, Lamps Plus was the defendant, and the District Court compelled class arbitration over the company's vigorous opposition.\nFootnote 3\u00a0Justice Kagan offers her own interpretation of the contract, concludes that it unambiguously authorizes class arbitration, post, at 2-4, and criticizes us for \"disregard[ing] the actual contract the parties signed,\" post, at 14.  Justice Sotomayor, on the other hand, concludes that the contract is ambiguous about class arbitration but criticizes us for treating the contract as .\u00a0.\u00a0. ambiguous.  Post, at 2-3 (dissenting opinion).  Again, we simply follow this Court's ordinary approach, which \"accord[s] great deference\" to the courts of appeals in their interpretation of state law.  Expressions Hair Design, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___, (slip op., at 7) (quoting Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U.\u00a0S. 469, 484 n.\u00a013 (1986) (collecting cases)).\nFootnote 4\u00a0This Court has not decided whether the availability of class arbitration is a so-called \"question of arbitrability,\" which includes these gateway matters.  Oxford Health Plans LLC v. Sutter, 569 U.\u00a0S. 564, 569, n.\u00a02 (2013).  We have no occasion to address that question here because the parties agreed that a court, not an arbitrator, should resolve the question about class arbitration.\nFootnote 5\u00a0Varela and Justice Kagan contend that our use of contra proferentem in Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U.\u00a0S. 52, 57 (1995), establishes that the rule is not preempted by the FAA.  Brief for Respondent 33-35; post, at 8 (dissenting opinion).  In Mastrobuono, however, we had no occasion to consider a conflict between the FAA and contra proferentem because both rules led to the same result.  Our holding was primarily based on the FAA policy favoring arbitration, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 62, and only after establishing that did we apply contra proferentem, noting that the rule was \"well suited to the facts of this case,\" id., at 63.  See also EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U.\u00a0S. 279, 293, n.\u00a09 (2002) (explaining that Mastrobuono resolved an ambiguous provision by \"read[ing] the agreement to favor arbitration under the FAA rules\").\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1*\u00a0Two intermediate California courts have held, based on similar language, that an arbitration agreement did not authorize class arbitration.  See Nelsen v. Legacy Partners Residential, Inc., 207 Cal. App. 4th 1115, 1129-1131, 144 Cal. Rptr. 3d 198, 210-211 (2012); Kinecta Alternative Financial Solutions, Inc. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles Cty., 205 Cal. App. 4th 506, 517-519, 140 Cal. Rptr. 3d 347, 356-357 (2012), disapproved of on other grounds by Sandquist v. Lebo Automotive, Inc., 1 Cal. 5th 233, 376 P. 3d 506 (2016).\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0I am not persuaded at this point that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction over this case, and for that reason I do not join Justice Breyer's dissenting opinion.  Nevertheless, I believe that Justice Breyer's opinion raises weighty issues that are worthy of further consideration if raised in the appropriate circumstances in the lower federal courts.\nFootnote 2\u00a0The majority notes that I criticize it for not checking for such an off-ramp while being unable to take one myself.  See ante, at 6, n. 3.  But the majority never suggests that it shares my rationale as to why the contract is ambiguous.  In other words, the reasons that I reach the issue that the majority decides say nothing about whether the majority would get there itself, short of deferring to the lower federal court.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0In discussing another arbitration provision, this Court identically reasoned: \"[I]t would seem sensible to interpret the 'all disputes' and 'any remedy or relief' phrases to indicate, at a minimum, an intention to resolve through arbitration any dispute that would otherwise be settled in a court, and to allow the chosen dispute resolvers to award the same varieties and forms of damages or relief as a court would be empowered to award.\"  Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U.\u00a0S. 52, 61-62, n.\u00a07 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, that means sending to arbitration (among other things) class disputes seeking class relief.\nFootnote 2\u00a0An additional semantic point that Lamps Plus makes essentially concedes my reading of the agreement.  At oral argument, Lamps Plus acknowledged that the contract would authorize class arbitration if it provided that Varela could bring to the arbitral forum any \"lawsuits,\" rather than any \"claims,\" he had or could have brought against the company.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 31-32.  The idea is apparently that suits can be classwide while claims must be personal.  But even assuming (without accepting) that is so, the agreement never speaks only of \"claims.\"  Even when that word appears alone (rather than alongside \"disputes\" or \"controversies\"), it in fact functions as a defined term meaning \"claims or controversies.\"  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a (referring to \"all claims or controversies ('claims')\").  And if lawsuits are not necessarily personal (as Lamps Plus admits), then neither are controversies.  So by Lamps Plus's own reasoning, Varela should be able to bring to arbitration all controversies (including classwide ones) he had or could have brought to court.\nFootnote 3\u00a0I say \"the majority's,\" but although five Justices have joined today's opinion, only four embrace its reasoning.  See n.\u00a08, infra.\nFootnote 4\u00a0In its many decades of FAA caselaw, the Court has preempted state law in just one other, \"narrow\" circumstance: Whatever state law might say, courts must find \"clear and unmistakable evidence\" before deciding that an agreement authorizes an arbitrator to decide a so-called \"question of arbitrability.\"  Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U.\u00a0S. 444, 452 (2003) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); Oxford Health Plans LLC v. Sutter, 569 U.\u00a0S. 564, 569, n. 2 (2013).  As the majority acknowledges, that requirement is not at issue here because Varela and Lamps Plus agreed that a judge should decide the availability of class arbitration (even assuming that question is one of arbitrability).  See ante, at 9, n.\u00a04.\nFootnote 5\u00a0Similarly, if Lamps Plus, as the agreement's author, had wanted class arbitration (perhaps because that would resolve many related cases at once) and Varela had resisted it (perhaps because he thought his case better than the others), the anti-drafter rule would have prevented, rather than permitted, class arbitration.\nFootnote 6\u00a0Our decision in DIRECTV, Inc. v. Imburgia, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015), also assumed that a court may generally apply a State's anti-drafter rule to arbitration agreements.  It was only because the court there applied that rule to an unambiguous contract--in contrast to what the court would have done in a non-arbitration case--that we reversed its decision.  See id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 7, 10).\nFootnote 7\u00a0The majority actually sends conflicting signals about the extent to which its holding extends beyond the anti-drafter rule to other background principles that serve to discern the meaning of ambiguous contract language.  Many of the majority's statements indicate that any tool for resolving contractual ambiguity is forbidden if it leads to class arbitration.  See, e.g., ante, at 6 (stating flatly that \"an ambiguous agreement [cannot] provide the necessary 'contractual basis' for compelling class arbitration\").  But the part of the opinion focusing on the anti-drafter rule suggests that today's holding applies to only a subset of contract default rules--to wit, those (supposedly) sounding in \"public policy considerations.\"  See ante, at 9-11.  On that theory of the decision, courts and arbitrators will have to work out over time which interpretive principles fall within that category.  The majority's own flawed analysis of the anti-drafter canon, see infra, at 11-12, indicates the perils of that undertaking.\nFootnote 8\u00a0Given this extraordinary displacement of state law--which, as I have shown, no precedent commands, see supra, at 9-10--I must admit to not understanding Justice Thomas's full concurrence in today's opinion.  See ante, at 2 (expressing \"skeptic[ism]\" about the majority's reasoning but joining its opinion out of a (misplaced) respect for precedent).  I would think the opinion a hard pill to swallow for someone who believes that any implied preemption \"leads to the illegitimate--and thus, unconstitutional--invalidation of state laws.\"  Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.\u00a0S. 555, 604 (2009) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); see, e.g., Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U.\u00a0S. 431, 459 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part) (\"[P]re-emption analysis is not a freewheeling judicial inquiry into whether a state statute is in tension with federal objectives\" (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)).\n\n\n","33":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLARRY LAMONT WHITE  v.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION(2019)\nNo. 17-1077\nArgued: December 3, 2018Decided: March 27, 2019\n\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5 makes it unlawful to (a) \"employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,\" (b) \"make any untrue statement of a material fact,\" or (c) \"engage in any act, practice, or course of business\" that \"operates .\u00a0.\u00a0. as a fraud or deceit\" in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.  In Janus Capital Group, Inc. v. First Derivative Traders, 564 U.\u00a0S. 135, this Court held that to be a \"maker\" of a statement under subsection (b) of that Rule, one must have \"ultimate authority over the statement, including its content and whether and how to communicate it.\"  Id., at 142 (emphasis added).  On the facts of Janus, this meant that an investment adviser who had merely \"participat[ed] in the drafting of a false statement\" \"made\" by another could not be held liable in a private action under subsection (b).  Id., at 145.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Francis Lorenzo, while the director of investment banking at an SEC-registered brokerage firm, sent two e-mails to prospective investors.  The content of those e-mails, which Lorenzo's boss supplied, described a potential investment in a company with \"confirmed assets\" of $10 million.  In fact, Lorenzo knew that the company had recently disclosed that its total assets were worth less than $400,000.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2015, the Commission found that Lorenzo had violated Rule 10b-5, \u00a710(b) of the Exchange Act, and \u00a717(a)(1) of the Securities Act by sending false and misleading statements to investors with intent to defraud.  On appeal, the District of Columbia Circuit held that Lorenzo could not be held liable as a \"maker\" under subsection (b) of the Rule in light of Janus, but sustained the Commission's finding with respect to subsections (a) and (c) of the Rule, as well as \u00a710(b) and \u00a717(a)(1).\nHeld:\u00a0Dissemination of false or misleading statements with intent to defraud can fall within the scope of Rules 10b-5(a) and (c), as well as the relevant statutory provisions, even if the disseminator did not \"make\" the statements and consequently falls outside Rule 10b-5(b).  Pp.\u00a05-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0 It would seem obvious that the words in these provisions are, as ordinarily used, sufficiently broad to include within their scope the dissemination of false or misleading information with the intent to defraud.  By sending e-mails he understood to contain material untruths, Lorenzo \"employ[ed]\" a \"device,\" \"scheme,\" and \"artifice to defraud\" within the meaning of subsection (a) of the Rule, \u00a710(b), and \u00a717(a)(1).  By the same conduct, he \"engage[d] in a[n] act, practice, or course of business\" that \"operate[d] . . . as a fraud or deceit\" under subsection (c) of the Rule.  As Lorenzo does not challenge the appeals court's scienter finding, it is undisputed that he sent the e-mails with \"intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud\" the recipients.  Aaron v. SEC, 446 U. S. 680, 686, and n.\u00a05.  Resort to the expansive dictionary definitions of \"device,\" \"scheme,\" and \"artifice\" in Rule 10b-5(a) and \u00a717(a)(1), and of \"act\" and \"practice\" in Rule 10b-5(c), only strengthens this conclusion.  Under the circumstances, it is difficult to see how Lorenzo's actions could escape the reach of these provisions.  Pp.\u00a05-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Lorenzo counters that the only way to be liable for false statements is through those provisions of the securities laws--like Rule 10b-5(b)--that refer specifically to false statements.  Holding to the contrary, he and the dissent say, would render subsection (b) \"superfluous.\"  The premise of this argument is that each subsection governs different, mutually exclusive, spheres of conduct.  But this Court and the Commission have long recognized considerable overlap among the subsections of the Rule and related provisions of the securities laws.  And the idea that each subsection governs a separate type of conduct is difficult to reconcile with the Rule's language, since at least some conduct that amounts to \"employ[ing]\" a \"device, scheme, or artifice to defraud\" under subsection (a) also amounts to \"engag[ing] in a[n] act .\u00a0.\u00a0. which operates .\u00a0.\u00a0. as a fraud\" under subsection (c).  This Court's conviction is strengthened by the fact that the plainly fraudulent behavior confronted here might otherwise fall outside the Rule's scope.  Using false representations to induce the purchase of securities would seem a paradigmatic example of securities fraud.  Pp.\u00a07-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Lorenzo and the dissent make a few other important arguments.  The dissent contends that applying Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) to conduct like Lorenzo's would render Janus \"a dead letter.\"  Post, at 9.  But Janus concerned subsection (b), and it said nothing about the Rule's application to the dissemination of false or misleading information.  Thus, Janus would remain relevant (and preclude liability) where an individual neither makes nor disseminates false information--provided, of course, that the individual is not involved in some other form of fraud.  Lorenzo also claims that imposing primary liability upon his conduct would erase or at least weaken the distinction between primary and secondary liability under the statute's \"aiding and abetting\" provision.  See 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778t(e).  But the line the Court adopts today is clear: Those who disseminate false statements with intent to defraud are primarily liable under Rules 10b-5(a) and (c), \u00a710(b), and \u00a717(a)(1), even if they are secondarily liable under Rule 10b-5(b).  As for Lorenzo's suggestion that those like him ought to be held secondarily liable, this offer will, too often, prove illusory.  Where a \"maker\" of a false statement does not violate subsection (b) of the Rule (perhaps because he lacked the necessary intent), a disseminator of those statements, even one knowingly engaged in an egregious fraud, could not be held to have violated the \"aiding and abetting\" statute.  And if, as Lorenzo claims, the disseminator has not primarily violated other parts of Rule 10b-5, then such a fraud, whatever its intent or consequences, might escape liability altogether.  That anomalous result is not what Congress intended.

Id., at 145.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, we consider whether those who do not \"make\" statements (as Janus defined \"make\"), but who disseminate false or misleading statements to potential investors with the intent to defraud, can be found to have violated the other parts of Rule 10b-5, subsections (a) and (c), as well as related provisions of the securities laws, \u00a710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, as amended, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778j(b), and \u00a717(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 84-85, as amended, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a777q(a)(1).  We believe that they can.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For our purposes, the relevant facts are not in dispute.  Francis Lorenzo, the petitioner, was the director of investment banking at Charles Vista, LLC, a registered broker-dealer in Staten Island, New York.  Lorenzo's only investment banking client at the time was Waste2Energy Holdings, Inc., a company developing technology to convert \"solid waste\" into \"clean renewable energy.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a June 2009 public filing, Waste2Energy stated that its total assets were worth about $14 million.  This figure included intangible assets, namely, intellectual property, valued at more than $10 million.  Lorenzo was skeptical of this valuation, later testifying that the intangibles were a \"dead asset\" because the technology \"didn't really work.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the summer and early fall of 2009, Waste2Energy hired Lorenzo's firm, Charles Vista, to sell to investors $15 million worth of debentures, a form of \"debt secured only by the debtor's earning power, not by a lien on any specific asset,\" Black's Law Dictionary 486 (10th ed. 2014).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In early October 2009, Waste2Energy publicly disclosed, and Lorenzo was told, that its intellectual property was worthless, that it had \"\u00a0'\u00a0\"[w]rit[ten] off .\u00a0.\u00a0. all [of its] intangible assets,\"\u00a0'\u00a0\" and that its total assets (as of March 31, 2009) amounted to $370,552.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shortly thereafter, on October 14, 2009, Lorenzo sent two e-mails to prospective investors describing the debenture offering.  According to later testimony by Lorenzo, he sent the e-mails at the direction of his boss, who supplied the content and \"approved\" the messages.  The e-mails described the investment in Waste2Energy as having \"3 layers of protection,\" including $10 million in \"confirmed assets.\"  The e-mails nowhere revealed the fact that Waste2Energy had publicly stated that its assets were in fact worth less than $400,000.  Lorenzo signed the e-mails with his own name, he identified himself as \"Vice President--Investment Banking,\" and he invited the recipients to \"call with any questions.\"\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission instituted proceedings against Lorenzo (along with his boss and Charles Vista).  The Commission charged that Lorenzo had violated Rule 10b-5, \u00a710(b) of the Exchange Act, and \u00a717(a)(1) of the Securities Act.  Ultimately, the Commission found that Lorenzo had run afoul of these provisions by sending false and misleading statements to investors with intent to defraud.  As a sanction, it fined Lorenzo $15,000, ordered him to cease and desist from violating the securities laws, and barred him from working in the securities industry for life.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lorenzo appealed, arguing primarily that in sending the e-mails he lacked the intent required to establish a violation of Rule 10b-5, \u00a710(b), and \u00a717(a)(1), which we have characterized as \"\u00a0'a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.'\u00a0\"  Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.\u00a0S. 680, 686, and n.\u00a05 (1980).  With one judge dissenting, the Court of Appeals panel rejected Lorenzo's lack-of-intent argument.  872 F.\u00a03d 578, 583 (CADC 2017).  Lorenzo does not challenge the panel's scienter finding.  Reply Brief 17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lorenzo also argued that, in light of Janus, he could not be held liable under subsection (b) of Rule 10b-5.  872 F.\u00a03d, at 586-587.  The panel agreed.  Because his boss \"asked Lorenzo to send the emails, supplied the central content, and approved the messages for distribution,\" id., at 588, it was the boss that had \"ultimate authority\" over the content of the statement \"and whether and how to communicate it,\" Janus, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 142.  (We took this case on the assumption that Lorenzo was not a \"maker\" under subsection (b) of Rule 10b-5, and do not revisit the court's decision on this point.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals nonetheless sustained (with one judge dissenting) the Commission's finding that, by knowingly disseminating false information to prospective investors, Lorenzo had violated other parts of Rule 10b-5, subsections (a) and (c), as well as \u00a710(b) and \u00a717(a)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lorenzo then filed a petition for certiorari in this Court.  We granted review to resolve disagreement about whether someone who is not a \"maker\" of a misstatement under Janus can nevertheless be found to have violated the other subsections of Rule 10b-5 and related provisions of the securities laws, when the only conduct involved concerns a misstatement.  Compare e.g., 872 F.\u00a03d 578, with WPP Luxembourg Gamma Three Sarl v. Spot Runner, Inc., 655 F.\u00a03d 1039, 1057-1058 (CA9 2011).\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the outset, we review the relevant provisions of Rule 10b-5 and of the statutes.  See Appendix, infra.  As we have said, subsection (a) of the Rule makes it unlawful to \"employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud.\"  Subsection (b) makes it unlawful to \"make any untrue statement of a material fact.\"  And subsection (c) makes it unlawful to \"engage in any act, practice, or course of business\" that \"operates .\u00a0.\u00a0. as a fraud or deceit.\"  See 17 CFR \u00a7240.10b-5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are also two statutes at issue.  Section 10(b) makes it unlawful to \"use or employ .\u00a0.\u00a0.  any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance\" in contravention of Commission rules and regulations.  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778j(b).  By its authority under that section, the Commission promulgated Rule 10b-5.  The second statutory provision is \u00a717(a), which, like Rule 10b-5, is organized into three subsections.  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a777q(a).  Here, however, we consider only the first subsection, \u00a717(a)(1), for this is the only subsection that the Commission charged Lorenzo with violating. Like Rule 10b-5(a), (a)(1) makes it unlawful to \"employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud.\"\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After examining the relevant language, precedent, and purpose, we conclude that (assuming other here-irrelevant legal requirements are met) dissemination of false or misleading statements with intent to defraud can fall within the scope of subsections (a) and (c) of Rule 10b-5, as well as the relevant statutory provisions.  In our view, that is so even if the disseminator did not \"make\" the statements and consequently falls outside subsection (b) of the Rule.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It would seem obvious that the words in these provisions are, as ordinarily used, sufficiently broad to include within their scope the dissemination of false or misleading information with the intent to defraud.  By sending emails he understood to contain material untruths, Lorenzo \"employ[ed]\" a \"device,\" \"scheme,\" and \"artifice to defraud\" within the meaning of subsection (a) of the Rule, \u00a710(b), and \u00a717(a)(1).  By the same conduct, he \"engage[d] in a[n] act, practice, or course of business\" that \"operate[d] .\u00a0.\u00a0. as a fraud or deceit\" under subsection (c) of the Rule.  Recall that Lorenzo does not challenge the appeals court's scienter finding, so we take for granted that he sent the emails with \"intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud\" the recipients.  Aaron, 446 U.\u00a0S., at 686, n. 5.  Under the circumstances, it is difficult to see how his actions could escape the reach of those provisions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resort to dictionary definitions only strengthens this conclusion.  A \"\u00a0'device,'\u00a0\" we have observed, is simply \"\u00a0'[t]hat which is devised, or formed by design'\u00a0\"; a \"\u00a0'scheme'\u00a0\" is a \"\u00a0'project,'\u00a0\" \"\u00a0'plan[,] or program of something to be done'\u00a0\"; and an \"\u00a0'artifice'\u00a0\" is \"\u00a0'an artful stratagem or trick.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 696, n. 13 (quoting Webster's International Dictionary 713, 2234, 157 (2d ed. 1934) (Webster's Second)).  By these lights, dissemination of false or misleading material is easily an \"artful stratagem\" or a \"plan,\" \"devised\" to defraud an investor under subsection (a).  See Rule 10b-5(a) (making it unlawful to \"employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud\"); \u00a717(a)(1) (same).  The words \"act\" and \"practice\" in subsection (c) are similarly expansive.  Webster's Second 25 (defining \"act\" as \"a doing\" or a \"thing done\"); id., at 1937 (defining \"practice\" as an \"action\" or \"deed\"); see Rule 10b-5(c) (making it unlawful to \"engage in a[n] act, practice, or course of business\" that \"operates .\u00a0.\u00a0. as a fraud or deceit\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These provisions capture a wide range of conduct.  Applying them may present difficult problems of scope in borderline cases.  Purpose, precedent, and circumstance could lead to narrowing their reach in other contexts.  But we see nothing borderline about this case, where the relevant conduct (as found by the Commission) consists of disseminating false or misleading information to prospective investors with the intent to defraud.  And while one can readily imagine other actors tangentially involved in dissemination--say, a mailroom clerk--for whom liability would typically be inappropriate, the petitioner in this case sent false statements directly to investors, invited them to follow up with questions, and did so in his capacity as vice president of an investment banking company.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lorenzo argues that, despite the natural meaning of these provisions, they should not reach his conduct.  This is so, he says, because the only way to be liable for false statements is through those provisions that refer specifically to false statements.  Other provisions, he says, concern \"scheme liability claims\" and are violated only when conduct other than misstatements is involved.  Brief for Petitioner 4-6, 28-30.  Thus, only those who \"make\" untrue statements under subsection (b) can violate Rule 10b-5 in connection with statements.  (Similarly, \u00a717(a)(2) would be the sole route for finding liability for statements under \u00a717(a).)  Holding to the contrary, he and the dissent insist, would render subsection (b) of Rule 10b-5 \"superfluous.\"  See post, at 6-7 (opinion of Thomas, J.).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The premise of this argument is that each of these provisions should be read as governing different, mutually exclusive, spheres of conduct.  But this Court and the Commission have long recognized considerable overlap among the subsections of the Rule and related provisions of the securities laws.  See Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U.\u00a0S. 375, 383 (1983) (\"[I]t is hardly a novel proposition that\" different portions of the securities laws \"prohibit some of the same conduct\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  As we have explained, these laws marked the \"first experiment in federal regulation of the securities industry.\"  SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.\u00a0S. 180, 198 (1963).  It is \"understandable, therefore,\" that \"in declaring certain practices unlawful,\" it was thought prudent \"to include both a general proscription against fraudulent and deceptive practices and, out of an abundance of caution, a specific proscription against nondisclosure\" even though \"a specific proscription against nondisclosure\" might in other circumstances be deemed \"surplusage.\"  Id., at 198-199.  \"Each succeeding prohibition\" was thus \"meant to cover additional kinds of illegalities--not to narrow the reach of the prior sections.\"  United States v. Naftalin, 441 U.\u00a0S. 768, 774 (1979).  We have found \"\u00a0'no warrant for narrowing alternative provisions .\u00a0.\u00a0. adopted with the purpose of affording added safeguards.'\u00a0\"  Ibid. (quoting United States v. Gilliland, 312 U.\u00a0S. 86, 93 (1941)); see Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah v. United States, 406 U.\u00a0S. 128, 152-153 (1972) (While \"the second subparagraph of [Rule 10b-5] specifies the making of an untrue statement .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0 [t]he first and third subparagraphs are not so restricted\").  And since its earliest days, the Commission has not viewed these provisions as mutually exclusive.  See, e.g., In re R.\u00a0D. Bayly & Co., 19 S. E. C. 773 (1945) (finding violations of what would become Rules 10b-5(b) and (c) based on the same misrepresentations and omissions); In\u00a0re Arthur Hays & Co., 5 S. E. C. 271 (1939) (finding violations of both \u00a7\u00a717(a)(2) and (a)(3) based on false representations in stock sales).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The idea that each subsection of Rule 10b-5 governs a separate type of conduct is also difficult to reconcile with the language of subsections (a) and (c).  It should go without saying that at least some conduct amounts to \"employ[ing]\" a \"device, scheme, or artifice to defraud\" under subsection (a) as well as \"engag[ing] in a[n] act .\u00a0.\u00a0. which operates .\u00a0.\u00a0. as a fraud\" under subsection (c).  In Affiliated Ute, for instance, we described the \"defendants' activities\" as falling \"within the very language of one or the other of those subparagraphs, a 'course of business' or a 'device, scheme, or artifice' that operated as a fraud.\"  406 U.\u00a0S., at 153.  (The dissent, for its part, offers no account of how the superfluity problems that motivate its interpretation can be avoided where subsections (a) and (c) are concerned.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Coupled with the Rule's expansive language, which readily embraces the conduct before us, this considerable overlap suggests we should not hesitate to hold that Lorenzo's conduct ran afoul of subsections (a) and (c), as well as the related statutory provisions.  Our conviction is strengthened by the fact that we here confront behavior that, though plainly fraudulent, might otherwise fall outside the scope of the Rule.  Lorenzo's view that subsection (b), the making-false-statements provision, exclusively regulates conduct involving false or misleading statements would mean those who disseminate false statements with the intent to cheat investors might escape liability under the Rule altogether.  But using false representations to induce the purchase of securities would seem a paradigmatic example of securities fraud.  We do not know why Congress or the Commission would have wanted to disarm enforcement in this way.  And we cannot easily reconcile Lorenzo's approach with the basic purpose behind these laws: \"to substitute a philosophy of full disclosure for the philosophy of caveat emptor and thus to achieve a high standard of business ethics in the securities industry.\"  Capital Gains, 375 U.\u00a0S., at 186.  See also, e.g., SEC v. W. J. Howey Co., 328 U.\u00a0S. 293, 299 (1946) (the securities laws were designed \"to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits\").\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lorenzo and the dissent make a few other important arguments.  They contend that applying subsections (a) or (c) of Rule 10b-5 to conduct like his would render our decision in Janus (which we described at the outset, supra, at 1-2) \"a dead letter,\" post, at 9.  But we do not see how that is so.  In Janus, we considered the language in subsection (b), which prohibits the \"mak[ing]\" of \"any untrue statement of a material fact.\"  See 564 U.\u00a0S., at 141-143.  We held that the \"maker\" of a \"statement\" is the \"person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement.\"  Id., at 142.  And we found that subsection (b) did not (under the circumstances) cover an investment adviser who helped draft misstatements issued by a different entity that controlled the statements' content.  Id., at 146-148.  We said nothing about the Rule's application to the dissemination of false or misleading information.  And we can assume that Janus would remain relevant (and preclude liability) where an individual neither makes nor disseminates false information--provided, of course, that the individual is not involved in some other form of fraud.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, Lorenzo points to the statute's \"aiding and abetting\" provision.  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778t(e).  This provision, enforceable only by the Commission (and not by private parties), makes it unlawful to \"knowingly or recklessly .\u00a0.\u00a0. provid[e] substantial assistance to another person\" who violates the Rule.  Ibid.; see Janus, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 143 (citing Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U.\u00a0S. 164 (1994)).  Lorenzo claims that imposing primary liability upon his conduct would erase or at least weaken what is otherwise a clear distinction between primary and secondary (i.e., aiding and abetting) liability.  He emphasizes that, under today's holding, a disseminator might be a primary offender with respect to subsection (a) of Rule 10b-5 (by employing a \"scheme\" to \"defraud\") and also secondarily liable as an aider and abettor with respect to subsection (b) (by providing substantial assistance to one who \"makes\" a false statement).  And he refers to two cases that, in his view, argue in favor of circumscribing primary liability.  See Central Bank, 511 U.\u00a0S., at 164; Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U.\u00a0S. 148 (2008).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We do not believe, however, that our decision creates a serious anomaly or otherwise weakens the distinction between primary and secondary liability.  For one thing, it is hardly unusual for the same conduct to be a primary violation with respect to one offense and aiding and abetting with respect to another.  John, for example, might sell Bill an unregistered firearm in order to help Bill rob a bank, under circumstances that make him primarily liable for the gun sale and secondarily liable for the bank robbery.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For another, the cases to which Lorenzo refers do not help his cause.  Take Central Bank, where we held that Rule 10b-5's private right of action does not permit suits against secondary violators.  511 U.\u00a0S., at 177.  The holding of Central Bank, we have said, suggests the need for a \"clean line\" between conduct that constitutes a primary violation of Rule 10b-5 and conduct that amounts to a secondary violation.  Janus, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 143, and n. 6.  Thus, in Janus, we sought an interpretation of \"make\" that could neatly divide primary violators and actors too far removed from the ultimate decision to communicate a statement.  Ibid. (citing Central Bank, 511 U.\u00a0S. 164). The line we adopt today is just as administrable: Those who disseminate false statements with intent to defraud are primarily liable under Rules 10b-5(a) and (c), \u00a710(b), and \u00a717(a)(1), even if they are secondarily liable under Rule 10b-5(b).  Lorenzo suggests that classifying dissemination as a primary violation would inappropriately subject peripheral players in fraud (including him, naturally) to substantial liability.  We suspect the investors who received Lorenzo's e-mails would not view the deception so favorably.  And as Central Bank itself made clear, even a bit participant in the securities markets \"may be liable as a primary violator under [Rule] 10b-5\" so long as \"all of the requirements for primary liability .\u00a0.\u00a0. are met.\"  Id., at 191.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lorenzo's reliance on Stoneridge is even further afield.  There, we held that private plaintiffs could not bring suit against certain securities defendants based on undisclosed deceptions upon which the plaintiffs could not have relied.  552 U.\u00a0S., at 159.  But the Commission, unlike private parties, need not show reliance in its enforcement actions.  And even supposing reliance were relevant here, Lorenzo's conduct involved the direct transmission of false statements to prospective investors intended to induce reliance--far from the kind of concealed fraud at issue in Stoneridge.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for Lorenzo's suggestion that those like him ought to be held secondarily liable, this offer will, far too often, prove illusory.  In instances where a \"maker\" of a false statement does not violate subsection (b) of the Rule (perhaps because he lacked the necessary intent), a disseminator of those statements, even one knowingly engaged in an egregious fraud, could not be held to have violated the \"aiding and abetting\" statute.  That is because the statute insists that there be a primary violator to whom the secondary violator provided \"substantial assistance.\"  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778t(e).  And the latter can be \"deemed to be in violation\" of the provision only \"to the same extent as the person to whom such assistance is provided.\"  Ibid.  In other words, if Acme Corp. could not be held liable under subsection (b) for a statement it made, then a knowing disseminator of those statements could not be held liable for aiding and abetting Acme under subsection (b).  And if, as Lorenzo claims, the disseminator has not primarily violated other parts of Rule 10b-5, then such a fraud, whatever its intent or consequences, might escape liability altogether.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That is not what Congress intended.

First Derivative Traders, 564 U.\u00a0S. 135 (2011), we drew a clear line between primary and secondary liability in fraudulent-misstatement cases: A person does not \"make\" a fraudulent misstatement within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b-5(b)--and thus is not primarily liable for the statement--if the person lacks \"ultimate authority over the statement.\"  Id., at 142.  Such a person could, however, be liable as an aider and abettor under principles of secondary liability.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, the Court eviscerates this distinction by holding that a person who has not \"made\" a fraudulent misstatement can nevertheless be primarily liable for it.  Because the majority misconstrues the securities laws and flouts our precedent in a way that is likely to have far-reaching consequences, I respectfully dissent.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To appreciate the sweeping nature of the Court's holding, it is helpful to begin with the facts of this case.  On October 14, 2009, the owner of the firm at which petitioner Frank Lorenzo worked instructed him to send e-mails to two clients regarding a debenture offering.  The owner explained that he wanted the e-mails to come from the firm's investment-banking division, which Lorenzo directed.  Lorenzo promptly addressed an e-mail to each client, \"cut and pasted\" the contents of each e-mail--which he received from the owner--into the body, and \"sent [them] out.\"  App. 321.  It is undisputed that Lorenzo did not draft the e-mails' contents, though he knew that they contained false or misleading statements regarding the debenture offering.  Both e-mails stated that they were sent \"[a]t the request of\" the owner of the firm.  Id., at 403, 405.  No other allegedly fraudulent conduct is at issue.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2013, the SEC brought enforcement proceedings against the owner of the firm, the firm itself, and Lorenzo.  Even though Lorenzo sent the e-mails at the owner's request, the SEC did not charge Lorenzo with aiding and abetting fraud committed by the owner.  See 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.  \u00a7\u00a7 77o(b), 78o(b)(4)(E), 78t(e).  Instead, the SEC charged Lorenzo as a primary violator of multiple securities laws,1 including Rule 10b-5(b), which prohibits \"mak[ing] any untrue statement of a material fact .\u00a0.\u00a0. in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.\"  17 CFR \u00a7240.10b-5(b) (2018); see Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.\u00a0S. 185, 212-214 (1976) (construing Rule 10b-5(b) to require scienter).  The SEC ultimately concluded that, by \"knowingly sen[ding] materially misleading language from his own email account to prospective investors,\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 77, Lorenzo violated Rule 10b-5(b) and several other antifraud provisions of the securities laws.  The SEC \"barred [him] from serving in the securities industry\" for life.  Id., at 91.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals unanimously rejected the SEC's determination that Lorenzo violated Rule 10b-5(b).  Applying Janus, the court held that Lorenzo did not \"make\" the false statements at issue because he merely \"transmitted statements devised by [his boss] at [his boss'] direction.\"  872 F.\u00a03d 578, 587 (CADC 2017).  The SEC has not challenged that aspect of the decision below.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The panel majority nevertheless upheld the SEC's decision holding Lorenzo primarily liable for the same false statements under other provisions of the securities laws--specifically, \u00a710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act), Rules 10b-5(a) and (c), and \u00a717(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act).  Unlike Rule 10b-5(b), none of these provisions pertains specifically to fraudulent misstatements.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even though Lorenzo undisputedly did not \"make\" the false statements at issue in this case under Rule 10b-5(b), the Court follows the SEC in holding him primarily liable for those statements under other provisions of the securities laws.  As construed by the Court, each of these more general laws completely subsumes Rule 10b-5(b) and \u00a717(a)(2) of the 1933 Act in cases involving fraudulent misstatements, even though these provisions specifically govern false statements.  The majority's interpretation of these provisions cannot be reconciled with their text or our precedents.  Thus, I am once again compelled to \"disagre[e] with the SEC's broad view\" of the securities laws.  Janus, supra, at 145, n.\u00a08.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I begin with the text.  The Court of Appeals held that Lorenzo violated \u00a710(b) of the 1934 Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c).  In relevant part, \u00a710(b) makes it unlawful for a person, in connection with the purchase or sale of a security, \"[t]o use or employ .\u00a0.\u00a0. any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance\" in contravention of an SEC rule.  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778j(b).  Rule 10b-5 was promulgated under this statutory authority.  That Rule makes it unlawful, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to  defraud,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0, or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  17 CFR \u00a7240.10b-5.\nThe Court of Appeals also held that Lorenzo violated \u00a717(a)(1) of the 1933 Act.  Similar to Rule 10b-5, \u00a717(a) of the Act provides that it is unlawful, in connection with the offer or sale of a security,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(1) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(2) to obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact .\u00a0.\u00a0. ; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(3) to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser.\"  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a777q(a)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We can quickly dispose of Rule 10b-5(a) and \u00a717(a)(1).  The act of knowingly disseminating a false statement at the behest of its maker, without more, does not amount to \"employ[ing] any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud\" within the meaning of those provisions.  As the contemporaneous dictionary definitions cited by the majority make clear, each of these words requires some form of planning, designing, devising, or strategizing.  See ante, at 6.  We have previously observed that \"the terms 'device,' 'scheme,' and 'artifice' all connote knowing or intentional practices.\"  Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.\u00a0S. 680, 696 (1980) (emphasis added).  In other words, they encompass \"fraudulent scheme[s],\" such as a \"\u00a0'short selling' scheme,\" a wash sale, a matched order, price rigging, or similar conduct.  United States v. Naftalin, 441 U.\u00a0S. 768, 770, 778 (1979) (applying \u00a717(a)(1)); see Santa Fe Industries, Inc. v. Green, 430 U.\u00a0S. 462, 473 (1977) (interpreting the term \"manipulative\" in \u00a710(b)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, it is undisputed that Lorenzo did not engage in any conduct involving planning, scheming, designing, or strategizing, as Rule 10b-5(a) and \u00a717(a)(1) require for a primary violation.  He sent two e-mails drafted by a superior, to recipients specified by the superior, pursuant to instructions given by the superior, without collaborating on the substance of the e-mails or otherwise playing an independent role in perpetrating a fraud.  That Lorenzo knew the messages contained falsities does not change the essentially administrative nature of his conduct here; he might have assisted in a scheme, but he did not himself plan, scheme, design, or strategize.  In my view, the plain text of Rule 10b-5(a) and \u00a717(a)(1) thus does not encompass Lorenzo's conduct as a matter of primary liability.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The remaining provision, Rule 10b-5(c), seems broader at first blush.  But the scope of this conduct-based provision--and, for that matter, Rule 10b-5(a) and \u00a717(a)(1)--must be understood in light of its codification alongside a prohibition specifically addressing primary liability for false statements.  Rule 10b-5(b) imposes primary liability on the \"make[r]\" of a fraudulent misstatement.  17 CFR \u00a7240.10b-5(b); see Janus, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 141-142.  And \u00a717(a)(2) imposes primary liability on a person who \"obtain[s] money or property by means of\" a false statement.  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a777q(a)(2).  The conduct-based provisions of Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) and \u00a717(a)(1) must be interpreted in view of the specificity of these false-statement provisions, and therefore cannot be construed to encompass primary liability solely for false statements.  This view is consistent with our previous recognition that \"each subparagraph of \u00a717(a) 'proscribes a distinct category of misconduct'\u00a0\" and \"\u00a0'is meant to cover additional kinds of illegalities.'\u00a0\"  Aaron, supra, at 697 (quoting Naftalin, supra, at 774; emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority disregards these express limitations.  Under the Court's rule, a person who has not \"made\" a fraudulent misstatement within the meaning of Rule 10b-5(b) nevertheless could be held primarily liable for facilitating that same statement; the SEC or plaintiff need only relabel the person's involvement as an \"act,\" \"device,\" \"scheme,\" or \"artifice\" that violates Rule 10b-5(a) or (c).  And a person could be held liable for a fraudulent misstatement under \u00a717(a)(1) even if the person did not obtain money or property by means of the statement.  In short, Rule 10b-5(b) and \u00a717(a)(2) are rendered entirely superfluous in fraud cases under the majority's reading.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This approach is in tension with \"\u00a0'the cardinal rule that, if possible, effect shall be given to every clause and part of a statute.'\u00a0\"  RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.\u00a0S. 639, 645 (2012) (quoting D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc. v. Popkin, 285 U.\u00a0S. 204, 208 (1932)).  I would therefore apply the \"old and familiar rule\u00a0\" that \"the specific governs the general.\"  RadLAX, supra, at 645-646 (internal quotation marks omitted); see A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 51 (2012) (canon equally applicable to statutes and regulations).  This canon of construction applies not only to resolve \"contradiction[s]\" between general and specific provisions, but also to avoid \"the superfluity of a specific provision that is swallowed by the general one.\"  RadLAX, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 645.  Here, liability for false statements is \"\u00a0'specifically dealt with'\u00a0\" in Rule 10b-5(b) and \u00a717(a)(2).  Id., at 646 (quoting D. Ginsberg & Sons, supra, at 208).  But Rule 10b-5 and \u00a717(a) also contain general prohibitions that, \"\u00a0'in [their] most comprehensive sense, would include what is embraced in'\u00a0\" the more specific provisions.  566 U.\u00a0S., at 646.  I would hold that the provisions specifically addressing false statements \"\u00a0'must be operative'\u00a0\" as to false-statement cases, and that the more general provisions should be read to apply \"\u00a0'only [to] such cases within [their] general language as are not within the'\u00a0\" purview of the specific provisions on false statements.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adopting this approach to the statutory text would align with our previous admonitions that the securities laws should not be \"[v]iewed in isolation\" and stretched to their limits.  Hochfelder, 425 U.\u00a0S., at 212.  In Hochfelder, for example, we concluded that the key words of \u00a710(b) employed the \"terminology of intentional wrongdoing\" and thus \"strongly suggest[ed]\" that it \"proscribe[s] knowing or intentional misconduct,\" even though the statute did not expressly state as much.  Id., at 197, 214.  We took a similar approach to \u00a717(a)(1) of the 1933 Act.  Aaron, 446 U.\u00a0S., at 695-697.  We have also limited the terms of Rule 10b-5 by recognizing that it was adopted pursuant to \u00a710(b) and thus \"encompasses only conduct already prohibited by \u00a710(b).\"  Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U.\u00a0S. 148, 157 (2008); see Hochfelder, supra, at 212-214.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Contrary to the suggestion of the majority, this approach does not necessarily require treating each provision of Rule 10b-5 or \u00a717(a) as \"governing different, mutually exclusive, spheres of conduct.\"  Ante, at 7.  Nor does it prevent the securities laws from mutually reinforcing one another or overlapping to some extent.  Ante, at 7-8.  It simply contemplates giving full effect to the specific prohibitions on false statements in Rule 10b-5(b) and \u00a717(a)(2) instead of rendering them superfluous.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority worries that this approach would allow people who disseminate false statements with the intent to defraud to escape liability under Rule 10b-5.  Ante, at 9.  That is not so.  If a person's only role is transmitting fraudulent misstatements at the behest of the statements' maker, the person's conduct would be appropriately assessed as a matter of secondary liability pursuant to provisions like 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a777o(b), 78t(e), and 78o(b)(4)(E).  And if a person engages in other acts prohibited by the Rule, such as developing and employing a fraudulent scheme, the person would be primarily liable for that conduct.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority suggests that secondary liability may often prove illusory.  It hypothesizes, for example, a situation in which the \"maker\" of a false statement does not know that it was false and thus does not violate Rule 10b-5(b), but the disseminator knows that the statement is false.  Under that scenario, the majority fears that the person disseminating the statements could be \"engaged in an egregious fraud,\" yet would not be liable as an aider and abettor for lack of a primary violator.  Ante, at 12.  This concern is misplaced.  As an initial matter, I note that \u00a717(a)(2) does not require scienter, so the maker of the statement may still be liable under that provision.  Aaron, supra, at 695-697.  Moreover, an ongoing, \"egregious\" fraud is likely to independently constitute a primary violation of the conduct-based securities laws, wholly apart from the laws prohibiting fraudulent misstatements.  Here, by contrast, we are concerned with the dissemination of two misstatements at the request of their maker.  This type of conduct is appropriately assessed under principles of secondary liability.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority's approach contradicts our precedent in two distinct ways.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the majority's opinion renders Janus a dead letter.  In Janus, we held that liability under Rule 10b-5(b) was limited to the \"make[r]\" of the statement and that \"[o]ne who prepares or publishes a statement on behalf of another is not its maker\" within the meaning of Rule 10b-5(b).  564 U.\u00a0S., at 142 (emphasis added).  It is undisputed here that Lorenzo was not the maker of the fraudulent misstatements.  The majority nevertheless finds primary liability under different provisions of Rule 10b-5, without any real effort to reconcile its decision with Janus.  Although it \"assume[s] that Janus would remain relevant (and preclude liability) where an individual neither makes nor disseminates false information,\" in the next breath the majority states that this would be true only if \"the individual is not involved in some other form of fraud.\"  Ante, at 10.  Given that, under the majority's rule, administrative acts undertaken in connection with a fraudulent misstatement qualify as \"other form[s] of fraud,\" the majority's supposed preservation of Janus is illusory.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the majority fails to maintain a clear line between primary and secondary liability in fraudulent-misstatement cases.  Maintaining this distinction is important because, as the majority notes, there is no private right of action against mere aiders and abettors.  Ante, at 10; see Central Bank of Denver, N.\u00a0A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.\u00a0A., 511 U.\u00a0S. 164, 191 (1994).  Here, however, the majority does precisely what we declined to do in Janus: impose broad liability for fraudulent misstatements in a way that makes the category of aiders and abettors in these cases \"almost nonexistent.\"  564 U.\u00a0S., at 143.  If Lorenzo's conduct here qualifies for primary liability under \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b-5(a) or (c), then virtually any person who assists with the making of a fraudulent misstatement will be primarily liable and thereby subject not only to SEC enforcement, but private lawsuits.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court correctly notes that it is not uncommon for the same conduct to be a primary violation with respect to one offense and aiding and abetting with respect to another--as, for example, when someone illegally sells a gun to help another person rob a bank.  Ante, at 11.  But this case does not involve two distinct crimes.  The majority has interpreted certain provisions of an offense so broadly as to render superfluous the more stringent, on-point requirements of a narrower provision of the same offense.  Criminal laws regularly and permissibly overlap with each other in a way that allows the same conduct to constitute different crimes with different punishments.  That differs significantly from interpreting provisions in a law to completely eliminate specific limitations in a neighboring provision of that very same law.  The majority's overreading of Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) and \u00a717(a)(1) is especially problematic because the heartland of these provisions is conduct-based fraud--\"employ[ing] [a] device, scheme, or artifice to defraud\" or \"engag[ing] in any act, practice, or course of business\"--not mere misstatements.  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a777q(a)(1); 17 CFR \u00a7\u00a7240.10b-5(a), (c).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court attempts to cabin the implications of its holding by highlighting several facts that supposedly would distinguish this case from a case involving a secretary or other person \"tangentially involved in disseminat[ing]\" fraudulent misstatements.  Ante, at 7.  None of these distinctions withstands scrutiny.  The fact that Lorenzo \"sent false statements directly to investors\" in e-mails that \"invited [investors] to follow up with questions,\" ibid., puts him in precisely the same position as a secretary asked to send an identical message from her e-mail account.  And under the unduly capacious interpretation that the majority gives to the securities laws, I do not see why it would matter whether the sender is the \"vice president of an investment banking company\" or a secretary, ibid.--if the sender knowingly sent false statements, the sender apparently would be primarily liable.  To be sure, I agree with the majority that liability would be \"inappropriate\" for a secretary put in a situation similar to Lorenzo's.  Ibid.  But I can discern no legal principle in the majority opinion that would preclude the secretary from being pursued for primary violations of the securities laws.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead of blurring the distinction between primary and secondary liability, I would hold that Lorenzo's conduct did not amount to a primary violation of the securities laws and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0For ease of reference, I use \"securities laws\" to refer to both statutes and SEC regulations.\nFootnote 2\u00a0I recognize that \u00a717(a)(1) could be deemed narrower than \u00a717(a)(2) in the sense that it requires scienter, whereas \u00a717(a)(2) does not.

SMITH, INDIVIDUALLY AND AS SPECIAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR THE COUNTY OF RENSSELAER, NEW YORK(2019)\nNo. 18-485\nArgued: April 17, 2019Decided: June 20, 2019\n\n\nPetitioner Edward McDonough processed ballots as a commissioner of the county board of elections in a primary election in Troy, New York.  Respondent Youel Smith was specially appointed to investigate and to prosecute a case of forged absentee ballots in that election.  McDonough became his primary target.  McDonough alleges that Smith fabricated evidence against him and used it to secure a grand jury indictment.  Smith then brought the case to trial and presented allegedly fabricated testimony.  That trial ended in a mistrial.  Smith again elicited allegedly fabricated evidence in a second trial, which ended on December 21, 2012, with McDonough's acquittal on all charges.  On December 18, 2015, McDonough sued Smith under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, asserting, as relevant here, a claim for fabrication of evidence.  The District Court dismissed the claim as untimely, and the Second Circuit affirmed.  The court held that the 3-year limitations period began to run \"when (1) McDonough learned that the evidence was false and was used against him during the criminal proceedings; and (2) he suffered a loss of liberty as a result of that evidence,\" 898 F.\u00a03d 259, 265.  Thus, the court concluded, McDonough's claim was untimely, because those events undisputedly had occurred by the time McDonough was arrested and stood trial.\nHeld:\u00a0The statute of limitations for McDonough's \u00a71983 fabricated-evidence claim began to run when the criminal proceedings against him terminated in his favor--that is, when he was acquitted at the end of his second trial.  Pp.\u00a03-15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The time at which a \u00a71983 claim accrues \"is a question of federal law,\" \"conforming in general to common-law tort principles,\" and is presumptively--but not always--\"when the plaintiff has 'a complete and present cause of action.'\u00a0\"  Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.\u00a0S. 384, 388.  An accrual analysis begins with identifying \"the specific constitutional right\" alleged to have been infringed.  Manuel v. Joliet, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___.  Here, the claimed right is an assumed due process right not to be deprived of liberty as a result of a government official's fabrication of evidence.  Pp.\u00a04-5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Accrual questions are often decided by referring to the common-law principles governing analogous torts.  Wallace, 549 U.\u00a0S., 388.  The most analogous common-law tort here is malicious prosecution, which accrues only once the underlying criminal proceedings have resolved in the plaintiff's favor.  Following that analogy where it leads: McDonough could not bring his fabricated-evidence claim under \u00a71983 prior to favorable termination of his prosecution.  Malicious prosecution's favorable-termination requirement is rooted in pragmatic concerns with avoiding parallel criminal and civil litigation over the same subject matter and the related possibility of conflicting civil and criminal judgments, and likewise avoids allowing collateral attacks on criminal judgments through civil litigation.  See Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.\u00a0S. 477, 484-485.  Because a civil claim such as McDonough's, asserting that fabricated evidence was used to pursue a criminal judgment, implicates the same concerns, it makes sense to adopt the same rule.  The principles and reasoning of Heck--which emphasized those concerns with parallel litigation and conflicting judgments--confirm the strength of this analogy.  This case differs because the plaintiff in Heck had been convicted and McDonough was acquitted, but McDonough's claims nevertheless challenge the validity of the criminal proceedings against him in essentially the same manner as the plaintiff in Heck challenged the validity of his conviction.  Pp.\u00a05-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0The soundness of this conclusion is reinforced by the consequences that would follow from imposing a ticking limitations clock on criminal defendants as soon as they become aware that fabricated evidence has been used against them.  That rule would create practical problems in jurisdictions where prosecutions regularly last nearly as long as--or even longer than--the limitations period.  Criminal defendants could face the untenable choice of letting their claims expire or filing a civil suit against the very person who is in the midst of prosecuting them.  The parallel civil litigation that would result if plaintiffs chose the second option would run counter to core principles of federalism, comity, consistency, and judicial economy.  Smith's suggested workaround--stays and ad-hoc abstentions--is poorly suited to the type of claim at issue here.  Pp.\u00a09-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0Smith's counterarguments do not sway the result.  First, relying on Wallace, Smith argues that Heck is irrelevant to McDonough's claim.  The Court in Wallace rejected the plaintiff's reliance on Heck, but Wallace involved a false-arrest claim--analogous to common-law false imprisonment--and does not displace the principles in Heck that resolve this case.  Second, Smith argues that McDonough theoretically could have been prosecuted without the fabricated evidence, and was not convicted even with it; and thus, because a violation could exist no matter its effect on the outcome, the date of that outcome is irrelevant.  Although the argument for adopting a favorable-termination requirement would be weaker in the context of a fabricated-evidence claim that does not allege that the violation's consequence was a liberty deprivation occasioned by the criminal proceedings themselves, that is not the nature of McDonough's claim.  His claim remains most analogous to a claim of common-law malicious prosecution.  Nor does it change the result that McDonough suffered harm prior to his acquittal, because the Court has never suggested that the date on which a constitutional injury first occurs is the only date from which a limitations period may run.  Third, Smith argues that the advantages of his rule outweigh its disadvantages as a matter of policy.  But his arguments are unconvincing.  It is not clear that the Second Circuit's approach would provide more predictable guidance, and while perverse incentives for prosecutors and risk of foreclosing meritorious claims could be valid considerations in other contexts, they do not overcome other considerations here.

McDONOUGH, PETITIONER v. YOUEL SMITH, individually and as SPECIAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR THE COUNTY OF RENSSELAER, NEW YORK, aka TREY SMITH\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit\n[June 20, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Edward McDonough alleges that respondent Youel Smith fabricated evidence and used it to pursue criminal charges against him.  McDonough was acquitted, then sued Smith under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983.  The courts below, concluding that the limitations period for McDonough's fabricated-evidence claim began to run when the evidence was used against him, determined that the claim was untimely.  We hold that the limitations period did not begin to run until McDonough's acquittal, and therefore reverse.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case arises out of an investigation into forged absentee ballots that were submitted in a primary election in Troy, New York, in 2009.  McDonough, who processed the ballots in his capacity as a commissioner of the county board of elections, maintains that he was unaware that they had been forged.  Smith was specially appointed to investigate and to prosecute the matter.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0McDonough's complaint alleges that Smith then set about scapegoating McDonough (against whose family Smith harbored a political grudge), despite evidence that McDonough was innocent. Smith leaked to the press that McDonough was his primary target and pressured him to confess.  When McDonough would not, Smith allegedly fabricated evidence in order to inculpate him.  Specifically, McDonough alleges that Smith falsified affidavits, coached witnesses to lie, and orchestrated a suspect DNA analysis to link McDonough to relevant ballot envelopes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Relying in part on this allegedly fabricated evidence, Smith secured a grand jury indictment against McDonough.  McDonough was arrested, arraigned, and released (with restrictions on his travel) pending trial.  Smith brought the case to trial a year later, in January 2012.  He again presented the allegedly fabricated testimony during this trial, which lasted more than a month and ended in a mistrial.  Smith then reprosecuted McDonough.  The second trial also lasted over a month, and again, Smith elicited allegedly fabricated testimony.  The second trial ended with McDonough's acquittal on all charges on December 21, 2012.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On December 18, 2015, just under three years after his acquittal, McDonough sued Smith and other defendants under \u00a71983 in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of New York.  Against Smith, McDonough asserted two different constitutional claims: one for fabrication of evidence, and one for malicious prosecution without probable cause.  The District Court dismissed the malicious prosecution claim as barred by prosecutorial immunity, though timely.  It dismissed the fabricated-evidence claim, however, as untimely.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0McDonough appealed to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which affirmed.  898 F.\u00a03d 259 (2018).  The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court's disposition of the malicious prosecution claim.  As for the timeliness of the fabricated-evidence claim, because all agreed that the relevant limitations period is three years, id., at 265, the question was when that limitations period began to run: upon McDonough's acquittal, or at some point earlier.  In essence, given the dates at issue, McDonough's claim was timely only if the limitations period began running at acquittal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals held that McDonough's fabricated-evidence claim accrued, and thus the limitations period began to run, \"when (1) McDonough learned that the evidence was false and was used against him during the criminal proceedings; and (2) he suffered a loss of liberty as a result of that evidence.\"  Ibid.  This rule, in the Second Circuit's view, followed from its conclusion that a plaintiff has a complete fabricated-evidence claim as soon as he can show that the defendant's knowing use of the fabricated evidence caused him some deprivation of liberty.  Id., at 266.  Those events undisputedly had occurred by the time McDonough was arrested and stood trial.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Second Circuit acknowledged, id., at 267, other Courts of Appeals have held that the statute of limitations for a fabricated-evidence claim does not begin to run until favorable termination of the challenged criminal proceedings.1  We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019), and now reverse.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statute of limitations for a fabricated-evidence claim like McDonough's does not begin to run until the criminal proceedings against the defendant (i.e., the \u00a71983 plaintiff) have terminated in his favor.  This conclusion follows both from the rule for the most natural common-law analogy (the tort of malicious prosecution) and from the practical considerations that have previously led this Court to defer accrual of claims that would otherwise constitute an untenable collateral attack on a criminal judgment.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question here is when the statute of limitations began to run.  Although courts look to state law for the length of the limitations period, the time at which a \u00a71983 claim accrues \"is a question of federal law,\" \"conforming in general to common-law tort principles.\"  Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.\u00a0S. 384, 388 (2007).  That time is presumptively \"when the plaintiff has 'a complete and present cause of action,'\u00a0\" ibid., though the answer is not always so simple.  See, e.g., id., at 388-391, and n. 3; Dodd v. United States, 545 U.\u00a0S. 353, 360 (2005).  Where, for example, a particular claim may not realistically be brought while a violation is ongoing, such a claim may accrue at a later date.  See Wallace, 549 U.\u00a0S., at 389.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An accrual analysis begins with identifying \"\u00a0'the specific constitutional right'\u00a0\" alleged to have been infringed.  Manuel v. Joliet, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 12) (quoting Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.\u00a0S. 266, 271 (1994) (plurality opinion)).  Though McDonough's complaint does not ground his fabricated-evidence claim in a particular constitutional provision, the Second Circuit treated his claim as arising under the Due Process Clause.  898 F.\u00a03d, at 266.  McDonough's claim, this theory goes, seeks to vindicate a \"\u00a0'right not to be deprived of liberty as a result of the fabrication of evidence by a government officer.'\u00a0\"  Ibid. (quoting Zahrey v. Coffey, 221 F.\u00a03d 342, 349 (CA2 2000)); see also, e.g., Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.\u00a0S. 264, 269 (1959).  We assume without deciding that the Second Circuit's articulations of the right at issue and its contours are sound, having not granted certiorari to resolve those separate questions.  See Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.\u00a0S. 477, 480, n.\u00a02 (1994) (accepting the lower courts' characterization of the relevant claims).2\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted above, this Court often decides accrual questions by referring to the common-law principles governing analogous torts.  See Wallace, 549 U.\u00a0S., at 388; Heck, 512 U.\u00a0S., at 483.  These \"principles are meant to guide rather than to control the definition of \u00a71983 claims,\" such that the common law serves \"\u00a0'more as a source of inspired examples than of prefabricated components.'\u00a0\"  Manuel, 580 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Relying on our decision in Heck, McDonough analogizes his fabricated-evidence claim to the common-law tort of malicious prosecution, a type of claim that accrues only once the underlying criminal proceedings have resolved in the plaintiff's favor.  512 U.\u00a0S., at 484; Prosser & Keeton \u00a7119, at 871, 874-875; Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7653, 658 (1976); 3 D. Dobbs, P. Hayden, & E. Bublick, Law of Torts \u00a7\u00a7586, 590, pp. 388-389, 402-404 (2d ed. 2011) (Dobbs).  McDonough is correct that malicious prosecution is the most analogous common-law tort here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Common-law malicious prosecution requires showing, in part, that a defendant instigated a criminal proceeding with improper purpose and without probable cause.  Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7653; see also Dobbs \u00a7586, at 388-389; Prosser & Keeton \u00a7119, at 871.3  The essentials of McDonough's claim are similar: His claim requires him to show that the criminal proceedings against him--and consequent deprivations of his liberty4--were caused by Smith's malfeasance in fabricating evidence.  At bottom, both claims challenge the integrity of criminal prosecutions undertaken \"pursuant to legal process.\"  See Heck, 512 U.\u00a0S., at 484.5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We follow the analogy where it leads: McDonough could not bring his fabricated-evidence claim under \u00a71983 prior to favorable termination of his prosecution.  As Heck explains, malicious prosecution's favorable-termination requirement is rooted in pragmatic concerns with avoiding parallel criminal and civil litigation over the same subject matter and the related possibility of conflicting civil and criminal judgments.  See id., at 484-485; see also Prosser & Keeton \u00a7119, at 874; Dobbs \u00a7589, at 402.  The requirement likewise avoids allowing collateral attacks on criminal judgments through civil litigation.  Heck, 512 U.\u00a0S., at 484.  These concerns track \"similar concerns for finality and consistency\" that have motivated this Court to refrain from multiplying avenues for collateral attack on criminal judgments through civil tort vehicles such as \u00a71983.  Id., at 485; see also Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.\u00a0S. 475, 490 (1973) (noting the \"strong policy requiring exhaustion of state remedies\" in order \"to avoid the unnecessary friction between the federal and state court systems\"); Younger v. Harris, 401 U.\u00a0S. 37, 43 (1971) (\"Since the beginning of this country's history Congress has, subject to few exceptions, manifested a desire to permit state courts to try state cases free from interference by federal courts\").  Because a civil claim such as McDonough's, asserting that fabricated evidence was used to pursue a criminal judgment, implicates the same concerns, it makes sense to adopt the same rule.6\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Heck confirms the strength of this analogy.  In Heck, a prisoner serving a 15-year sentence for manslaughter sought damages under \u00a71983 against state prosecutors and an investigator for alleged misconduct similar to that alleged here, including knowingly destroying exculpatory evidence and causing an illegal voice identification procedure to be employed at the prisoner's trial.  512 U.\u00a0S., at 478-479.  The Court took as a given the lower courts' conclusion that those claims all effectively \"challeng[ed] the legality of\" the plaintiff's conviction.  Id., at 480, n.\u00a02.   Looking first to the common law, the Court observed that malicious prosecution \"provide[d] the closest analogy to\" such claims because, unlike other potentially analogous common-law claims, malicious prosecution \"permits damages for confinement imposed pursuant to legal process.\"  Id., at 484.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Emphasizing the concerns with parallel litigation and conflicting judgments just discussed, see id., at 484-486, the Court in Heck held that \"in order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid,\" a plaintiff in a \u00a71983 action first had to prove that his conviction had been invalidated in some way, id., at 486.  This favorable-termination requirement, the Court explained, applies whenever \"a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply\" that his prior conviction or sentence was invalid.  Id., at 487.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case differs from Heck because the plaintiff in Heck had been convicted, while McDonough was acquitted.  Although some claims do fall outside Heck's ambit when a conviction is merely \"anticipated,\" Wallace, 549 U.\u00a0S., at 393, however, McDonough's claims are not of that kind, see infra, at 11-12.  As articulated by the Court of Appeals, his claims challenge the validity of the criminal proceedings against him in essentially the same manner as the plaintiff in Heck challenged the validity of his conviction.  And the pragmatic considerations discussed in Heck apply generally to civil suits within the domain of habeas corpus, not only to those that challenge convictions.  See Preiser, 411 U.\u00a0S., at 490-491.  The principles and reasoning of Heck thus point toward a corollary result here: There is not \"\u00a0'a complete and present cause of action,'\u00a0\" Wallace, 549 U.\u00a0S., at 388, to bring a fabricated-evidence challenge to criminal proceedings while those criminal proceedings are ongoing.  Only once the criminal proceeding has ended in the defendant's favor, or a resulting conviction has been invalidated within the meaning of Heck, see 512 U.\u00a0S., at 486-487, will the statute of limitations begin to run.7\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The soundness of this conclusion is reinforced by the consequences that would follow from the Second Circuit's approach, which would impose a ticking limitations clock on criminal defendants as soon as they become aware that fabricated evidence has been used against them.  Such a rule would create practical problems in jurisdictions where prosecutions regularly last nearly as long as--or even longer than--the relevant civil limitations period.  See Brief for Petitioner 53-55; Brief for Criminal Defense Organizations et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 23-24.  A significant number of criminal defendants could face an untenable choice between (1) letting their claims expire and (2) filing a civil suit against the very person who is in the midst of prosecuting them.  The first option is obviously undesirable, but from a criminal defendant's perspective the latter course, too, is fraught with peril: He risks tipping his hand as to his defense strategy, undermining his privilege against self-incrimination, and taking on discovery obligations not required in the criminal context.  See SEC v. Dresser Industries, Inc., 628 F.\u00a02d 1368, 1376 (CADC 1980) (en banc).  Moreover, as noted above, the parallel civil litigation that would result if plaintiffs chose the second option would run counter to core principles of federalism, comity, consistency, and judicial economy.  See supra, at 7-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Smith suggests that stays and ad hoc abstention are sufficient to avoid the problems of two-track litigation.  Such workarounds are indeed available when claims falling outside Heck's scope nevertheless are initiated while a state criminal proceeding is pending, see Wallace, 549 U.\u00a0S., at 393-394 (noting the power of district courts to stay civil actions while criminal prosecutions proceed); Heck, 512 U.\u00a0S., at 487-488, n.\u00a08 (noting possibility of abstention), but Smith's solution is poorly suited to the type of claim at issue here.  When, as here, a plaintiff's claim \"necessarily\" questions the validity of a state proceeding, id., at 487, there is no reason to put the onus to safeguard comity on district courts exercising case-by-case discretion--particularly at the foreseeable expense of potentially prejudicing litigants and cluttering dockets with dormant, unripe cases.  Cf. Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.\u00a0S. 930, 943 (2007) (noting that a scheme requiring \"conscientious defense attorneys\" to file unripe suits \"would add to the burden imposed on courts, applicants, and the States, with no clear advantage to any\").  The accrual rule we adopt today, by contrast, respects the autonomy of state courts and avoids these costs to litigants and federal courts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In deferring rather than inviting such suits, we adhere to familiar principles.  The proper approach in our federal system generally is for a criminal defendant who believes that the criminal proceedings against him rest on knowingly fabricated evidence to defend himself at trial and, if necessary, then to attack any resulting conviction through collateral review proceedings.  McDonough therefore had a complete and present cause of action for the loss of his liberty only once the criminal proceedings against him terminated in his favor.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Smith's counterarguments do not sway the result.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, Smith argues that Heck is irrelevant to McDonough's claim, relying on this Court's opinion in Wallace.  Wallace held that the limitations period begins to run on a \u00a71983 claim alleging an unlawful arrest under the Fourth Amendment as soon as the arrestee \"becomes detained pursuant to legal process,\" not when he is ultimately released.  549 U.\u00a0S., at 397.  The Court rejected the plaintiff's reliance on Heck, stating that the Heck rule comes \"into play only when there exists 'a conviction or sentence that has not been .\u00a0.\u00a0. invalidated,' that is to say, an 'outstanding criminal judgment.'\u00a0\"  Wallace, 549 U.\u00a0S., at 393.  The Court thus declined to adopt the plaintiff's theory \"that an action which would impugn an anticipated future conviction cannot be brought until that conviction occurs and is set aside,\" because doing so in the context of an action for false arrest would require courts and litigants \"to speculate about whether a prosecution will be brought, whether it will result in conviction, and whether the pending civil action will impugn that verdict--all this at a time when it can hardly be known what evidence the prosecution has in its possession.\"  Ibid. (citations omitted).8\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Smith is correct that Heck concerned a plaintiff serving a sentence for a still-valid conviction and that Wallace distinguished Heck on that basis, but Wallace did not displace the principles in Heck that resolve this case.  A false-arrest claim, Wallace explained, has a life independent of an ongoing trial or putative future conviction--it attacks the arrest only to the extent it was without legal process, even if legal process later commences.  See 549 U.\u00a0S., at 389-390, 393.  That feature made the claim analogous to common-law false imprisonment.  Id., at 389.  By contrast, a claim like McDonough's centers on evidence used to secure an indictment and at a criminal trial, so it does not require \"speculat[ion] about whether a prosecution will be brought.\"  Id., at 393.  It directly challenges--and thus necessarily threatens to impugn--the prosecution itself.  See Heck, 512 U.\u00a0S., at 486-487.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, Smith notes (1) that a fabricated-evidence claim in the Second Circuit (unlike a malicious prosecution claim) can exist even if there is probable cause and (2) that McDonough was acquitted.  In other words, McDonough theoretically could have been prosecuted without the fabricated evidence, and he was not convicted even with it.  Because a violation thus could exist no matter its effect on the outcome, Smith reasons, \"the date on which that outcome occurred is irrelevant.\"  Brief for Respondent 26.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Smith is correct in one sense.  One could imagine a fabricated-evidence claim that does not allege that the violation's consequence was a liberty deprivation occasioned by the criminal proceedings themselves.  See n.\u00a02, supra. To be sure, the argument for adopting a favorable-termination requirement would be weaker in that context.  That is not, however, the nature of McDonough's claim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As already explained, McDonough's claim remains most analogous to a claim of common-law malicious prosecution, even if the two are not identical.  See supra, at 6-7.  Heck explains why favorable termination is both relevant and required for a claim analogous to malicious prosecution that would impugn a conviction, and that rationale extends to an ongoing prosecution as well: The alternative would impermissibly risk parallel litigation and conflicting judgments.  See supra, at 7-8.  If the date of the favorable termination was relevant in Heck, it is relevant here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It does not change the result, meanwhile, that McDonough suffered harm prior to his acquittal.  The Court has never suggested that the date on which a constitutional injury first occurs is the only date from which a limitations period may run.  Cf. Wallace, 549 U.\u00a0S., at 389-391, and n.\u00a03 (explaining that the statute of limitations for false-arrest claims does not begin running when the initial arrest takes place).  To the contrary, the injury caused by a classic malicious prosecution likewise first occurs as soon as legal process is brought to bear on a defendant, yet favorable termination remains the accrual date.  See Heck, 512 U. S., at 484.9\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third and finally, Smith argues that the advantages of his rule outweigh its disadvantages as a matter of policy.  In his view, the Second Circuit's approach would provide more predictable guidance, while the favorable-termination approach fosters perverse incentives for prosecutors (who may become reluctant to offer favorable resolutions) and risks foreclosing meritorious claims (for example, where an outcome is not clearly \"favorable\").  These arguments are unconvincing.  We agree that clear accrual rules are valuable but fail to see how assessing when proceedings terminated favorably will be, on balance, more burdensome than assessing when a criminal defendant \"learned that the evidence was false and was used against him\" and deprived him of liberty as a result.  898 F.\u00a03d, at 265.  And while the risk of foreclosing certain claims and the potential incentive effects that Smith identifies could be valid considerations in other contexts,10 they do not overcome the greater danger that plaintiffs will be deterred under Smith's theory from suing for redress of egregious misconduct, see supra, at 10--nor do they override the guidance of the common law and precedent.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statute of limitations for McDonough's \u00a71983 claim alleging that he was prosecuted using fabricated evidence began to run when the criminal proceedings against him terminated in his favor--that is, when he was acquitted at the end of his second trial.  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nThomas, J., dissenting\n\u2002588 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 18-485\nEDWARD G. McDONOUGH, PETITIONER v. YOUEL SMITH, individually and as SPECIAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR THE COUNTY OF  RENSSELAER, NEW YORK,  aka TREY SMITH\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit\n[June 20, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch join, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to decide when \"the statute of limitations for a Section 1983 claim based on fabrication of evidence in criminal proceedings begins to run.\"  Pet. for Cert. i.  McDonough, however, declined to take a definitive position on the \"threshold inquiry in a [42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.] \u00a71983 suit\": \"\u00a0'identify[ing] the specific constitutional right' at issue.\"  Manuel v. Joliet, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 12) (quoting Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.\u00a0S. 266, 271 (1994) (plurality opinion)).  Because it is only \"[a]fter pinpointing that right\" that courts can proceed to \"determine the elements of, and rules associated with, an action seeking damages for its violation,\" Manuel, 580 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12), we should have dismissed this case as improvidently granted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0McDonough's failure to specify which constitutional right the respondent allegedly violated profoundly complicates our inquiry.  McDonough argues that malicious prosecution is the common-law tort most analogous to his fabrication-of-evidence claim.  But without \"\u00a0'identify[ing] the specific constitutional right' at issue,\" we cannot adhere to the contours of that right when \"applying, selecting among, or adjusting common-law approaches.\"  Ibid.  McDonough also contends that his suit is timely because he suffered a continuing constitutional violation, but this argument is similarly difficult to evaluate without identifying precisely what that violation was.  Moreover, because the constitutional basis for McDonough's claim is unclear, we are unable to confirm that he has a constitutional claim at all.  In my view, it would be both logical and prudent to address that antecedent question before addressing the statute of limitations for that claim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0McDonough also urges us to resolve the question presented by extending Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.\u00a0S. 475 (1973), and Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.\u00a0S. 477 (1994).  But the analysis under both cases depends on what facts a \u00a71983 plaintiff would need to prove to prevail on his claim.1  And McDonough declines to take a position on that issue as well.  See Brief for Petitioner 19 (\"The Court thus does not need to delve into what the elements of McDonough's constitutional claim are\"); see also id., at 37-38, n.\u00a011.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further complicating this case, McDonough raised a malicious-prosecution claim alongside his fabrication-of-evidence claim.  The District Court dismissed that claim on grounds of absolute immunity.  McDonough has not fully explained the difference between that claim and his fabrication claim, which he insists is both analogous to the common-law tort of malicious prosecution and distinct from his dismissed malicious-prosecution claim.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-12; Reply Brief 3-4.  Additionally, it appears that McDonough's fabrication claim could face dismissal on absolute-immunity grounds on remand.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29-32.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court, while recognizing that it is critical to ascertain the basis for a \u00a71983 claim when deciding how to \"handl[e]\" it, ante, at 5, n.\u00a02, attempts to evade these issues by \"assum[ing] without deciding that the Second Circuit's articulations of the right at issue and its contours are sound.\"  Ante, at 4-5.  But because the parties have not accepted the Second Circuit's view that the claim sounds in procedural due process,2 that claim as \"articulated by the Court of Appeals\" might be different from the claim McDonough actually brought.  Ante, at 9.  The better course would be to dismiss this case as improvidently granted and await a case in which the threshold question of the basis of a \"fabrication-of-evidence\" claim is cleanly presented.  Moreover, even if the Second Circuit were correct that McDonough asserts a violation of the Due Process Clause, it would be preferable for the Court to determine the claim's elements before deciding its statute of limitations.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0McDonough asks the Court to bypass the antecedent question of the nature and elements of his claim and first determine its statute of limitations.  We should have declined the invitation and dismissed the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.  I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0See Floyd v. Attorney General of Pa., 722 Fed. Appx. 112, 114 (CA3 2018); Mills v. Barnard, 869 F.\u00a03d 473, 484 (CA6 2017); Bradford v. Scherschligt, 803 F.\u00a03d 382, 388 (CA9 2015); Castellano v. Fragozo, 352 F.\u00a03d 939, 959-960 (CA5 2003) (en banc).\nFootnote 2\u00a0In accepting the Court of Appeals' treatment of McDonough's claim as one sounding in denial of due process, we express no view as to what other constitutional provisions (if any) might provide safeguards against the creation or use of fabricated evidence enforceable through a 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 action.  See Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U.\u00a0S. 56, 70 (1992) (\"Certain wrongs affect more than a single right and, accordingly, can implicate more than one of the Constitution's commands\").  Moreover, because the Second Circuit understood McDonough's due process claim to allege a deprivation of liberty, we have no occasion to consider the proper handling of a fabricated-evidence claim founded on an allegation that the use of fabricated evidence was so egregious as to shock the conscience, see, e.g., County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.\u00a0S. 833, 849 (1998), or caused harms exclusively to \"interests other than the interest in freedom from physical restraint,\" Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 283 (1994) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment); see also, e.g., W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \u00a7119, p. 870 (5th ed. 1984) (Prosser & Keeton) (\"[O]ne who is wrongfully prosecuted may suffer both in reputation and by confinement\").  Accordingly, we do not address what the accrual rule would be for a claim rooted in other types of harm independent of a liberty deprivation, as no such claim is before us.  See 898 F.\u00a03d 259, 266 (CA2 2018).\nFootnote 3\u00a0The Second Circuit borrowed the common-law elements of malicious prosecution to govern McDonough's distinct constitutional malicious prosecution claim, which is not before us.  See 898 F.\u00a03d, at 268, n.\u00a010.  This Court has not defined the elements of such a \u00a71983 claim, see Manuel v. Joliet, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2017) (slip op., at 14-15), and this case provides no occasion to opine on what the elements of a constitutional malicious prosecution action under \u00a71983 are or how they may or may not differ from those of a fabricated-evidence claim.  Similarly, while noting that only McDonough's malicious prosecution claim was barred on absolute-immunity grounds below, we make no statement on whether or how the doctrine of absolute immunity would apply to McDonough's fabricated-evidence claim.  Any further consideration of that question is properly addressed by the Second Circuit on remand, subject to ordinary principles of waiver and forfeiture.\nFootnote 4\u00a0Though McDonough was not incarcerated pending trial, he was subject to restrictions on his ability to travel and other \"\u00a0'restraints not shared by the public generally,'\u00a0\" Justices of Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon, 466 U.\u00a0S. 294, 301 (1984), and as the case comes to this Court, it is undisputed that McDonough has pleaded a liberty deprivation.  See 898 F.\u00a03d, at 266.\nFootnote 5\u00a0Smith urges the Court to steer away from the comparison to malicious prosecution, noting that the Second Circuit treats malicious prosecution claims and fabricated-evidence claims as distinct.  See id., at 268, and n.\u00a012.  But two constitutional claims may differ yet still both resemble malicious prosecution more than any other common-law tort; comparing constitutional and common-law torts is not a one-to-one matching exercise.  See, e.g., Heck, 512 U.\u00a0S., at 479, 484 (analogizing malicious prosecution to several distinct claims).  Tellingly, Smith has not suggested an alternative common-law analogy.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 44-46.\nFootnote 6\u00a0Such considerations are why Congress has determined that a petition for writ of habeas corpus, not a \u00a71983 action, \"is the appropriate remedy for state prisoners attacking the validity of the fact or length of their confinement,\" Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.\u00a0S. 475, 490 (1973), including confinement pending trial before any conviction has occurred, see id., at 491 (citing Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410 U.\u00a0S. 484 (1973)).\nFootnote 7\u00a0Because McDonough was not free to sue prior to his acquittal, we need not reach his alternative argument that his claim was timely because it alleged a continuing violation.\nFootnote 8\u00a0Heck itself suggested that a similar rule might allow at least some Fourth Amendment unlawful-search claims to proceed without a favorable termination.  See 512 U.\u00a0S., at 487, n.\u00a07.\nFootnote 9\u00a0As for Smith's suggestion that the fabricated evidence could not have caused any liberty deprivation where, as here, there could have been probable cause and there was in fact an acquittal, it suffices to reiterate that we assume the contours of the claim as defined by the Second Circuit, see supra, at 5, 6-7, and nn.\u00a02, 4, and thus accept its undisputed conclusion that there was a sufficient liberty deprivation here, see 898 F.\u00a03d, at 266; see also Garnett v. Undercover Officer C0039, 838 F.\u00a03d 265, 277 (CA2 2016) (explaining that \"a further deprivation of liberty can result from the fabrication of evidence even if the initial arrest is lawful\").\nFootnote 10\u00a0Because McDonough's acquittal was unquestionably a favorable termination, we have no occasion to address the broader range of ways a criminal prosecution (as opposed to a conviction) might end favorably to the accused.  Cf. Heck, 512 U.\u00a0S., at 486-487.  To the extent Smith argues that the law in this area should take account of prosecutors' broad discretion over such matters as the terms on which pleas will be offered or whether charges will be dropped, those arguments more properly bear on the question whether a given resolution should be understood as favorable or not.  Such considerations might call for a context-specific and more capacious understanding of what constitutes \"favorable\" termination for purposes of a \u00a71983 false-evidence claim, but that is not the question before us.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0See Preiser, 411 U.\u00a0S., at 500 (\"[W]hen a state prisoner is challenging the very fact or duration of his physical imprisonment, and the relief he seeks is a determination that he is entitled to immediate release or a speedier release from that imprisonment,\" he cannot bring suit under \u00a71983); Heck, 512 U.\u00a0S., at 486-487 (\"[T]o recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment .\u00a0.\u00a0. a \u00a71983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been\" reversed, expunged, invalidated, or otherwise called into question); accord, id., at 486, n.\u00a06 (explaining that a \u00a71983 action will not lie where a plaintiff would have to negate an element of the offense of which he was convicted to succeed on his \u00a71983 claim).\nFootnote 2\u00a0See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7 (petitioner) (citing the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments); id., at 42 (respondent) (asserting that the claim is not a procedural due process claim).\n\n\n","36":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMADISON v.

Wainwright, 477 U.\u00a0S. 399, this Court held that the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishments precludes executing a prisoner who has \"lost his sanity\" after sentencing.  Id., at 406.  And in Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.\u00a0S. 930, the Court set out the appropriate competency standard: A State may not execute a prisoner whose \"mental state is so distorted by a mental illness\" that he lacks a \"rational understanding\" of \"the State's rationale for [his] execution.\"  Id., at 958-959.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Vernon Madison was found guilty of capital murder and sentenced to death.  While awaiting execution, he suffered a series of strokes and was diagnosed with vascular dementia.  In 2016, Madison petitioned the state trial court for a stay of execution on the ground that he was mentally incompetent, stressing that he could not recollect committing the crime for which he had been sentenced to die.  Alabama responded that Madison had a rational understanding of the reasons for his execution, even assuming he had no memory of committing his crime.  And more broadly, the State claimed that Madison failed to implicate Ford and Panetti because both decisions concerned themselves with gross delusions, which Madison did not have.  Following a competency hearing, the trial court found Madison competent to be executed.  On federal habeas review, this Court summarily reversed the Eleventh Circuit's grant of relief, holding that, under the \"demanding\" and \"deferential standard\" of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), \"[n]either Panetti nor Ford 'clearly established' that a prisoner is incompetent to be executed\" because of a simple failure to remember his crime.  Dunn v. Madison, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___.  But the Court \"express[ed] no view\" on the question of Madison's competency outside of the AEDPA context.  Id., at ___.  When Alabama set a 2018 execution date, Madison returned to state court, arguing once more that his mental condition precluded the State from going forward.  The state court again found Madison mentally competent.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0Under Ford and Panetti, the Eighth Amendment may permit executing a prisoner even if he cannot remember committing his crime.  Panetti asks only about a person's comprehension of the State's reasons for resorting to punishment, not his memory of the crime itself.  And the one may exist without the other.  Such memory loss, however, still may factor into the analysis Panetti demands.  If that loss combines and interacts with other mental shortfalls to deprive a person of the capacity to comprehend why the State is exacting death as a punishment, then the Panetti standard will be satisfied.  Pp.\u00a09-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Under Ford and Panetti, the Eighth Amendment may prohibit executing a prisoner even though he suffers from dementia or another disorder rather than psychotic delusions.  The Panetti standard focuses on whether a mental disorder has had a particular effect; it has no interest in establishing any precise cause. Panetti's references to \"gross delusions,\" 551 U.\u00a0S., at 960, are no more than a predictable byproduct of that case's facts.  Ford and Panetti hinge on the prisoner's \"[in]comprehension of why he has been singled out\" to die, 477 U.\u00a0S., 409, and kick in if and when that failure of understanding is present, irrespective of whether one disease or another is to blame.  In evaluating competency, a judge must therefore look beyond any given diagnosis to a downstream consequence.  Pp.\u00a012-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.\u00a0Because this Court is uncertain whether the state court's decision was tainted by legal error, this case is remanded to that court for renewed consideration of Madison's competency.  The state court's brief 2018 ruling--which states only that Madison \"did not prove a substantial threshold showing of insanity[\u00a0]\"--does not provide any assurance that the court knew a person with dementia, and not psychotic delusions, might receive a stay of execution.  Nor does that court's initial 2016 opinion.  The sole question on which Madison's competency depends is whether he can reach a rational understanding of why the State wants to execute him.  In answering that question--on which this Court again expresses no view--the state court may not rely on any arguments or evidence tainted with the legal errors addressed by this Court.

Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.\u00a0S. 930, 959 (2007).  In this case, Vernon Madison argued that his memory loss and dementia entitled him to a stay of execution, but an Alabama court denied the relief.  We now address two questions relating to the Eighth Amendment's bar, disputed below but not in this Court.  First, does the Eighth Amendment forbid execution whenever a prisoner shows that a mental disorder has left him without any memory of committing his crime?  We (and, now, the parties) think not, because a person lacking such a memory may still be able to form a rational understanding of the reasons for his death sentence.  Second, does the Eighth Amendment apply similarly to a prisoner suffering from dementia as to one experiencing psychotic delusions?  We (and, now, the parties) think so, because either condition may--or, then again, may not--impede the requisite comprehension of his punishment.  The only issue left, on which the parties still disagree, is what those rulings mean for Madison's own execution.  We direct that issue to the state court for further consideration in light of this opinion.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court decided in Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.\u00a0S. 399 (1986), that the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishments precludes executing a prisoner who has \"lost his sanity\" after sentencing.  Id., at 406.  While on death row, Alvin Ford was beset by \"pervasive delusion[s]\" associated with \"[p]aranoid [s]chizophrenia.\"  Id., at 402-403.  Surveying both the common law and state statutes, the Court found a uniform practice against taking the life of such a prisoner.  See id., at 406-409.  Among the reasons for that time-honored bar, the Court explained, was a moral \"intuition\" that \"killing one who has no capacity\" to understand his crime or punishment \"simply offends humanity.\"  Id., at 407, 409; see id., at 409 (citing the \"natural abhorrence civilized societies feel\" at performing such an act).  Another rationale rested on the lack of \"retributive value\" in executing a person who has no comprehension of the meaning of the community's judgment.  Ibid.; see id., at 421 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (stating that the death penalty's \"retributive force[\u00a0] depends on the defendant's awareness of the penalty's existence and purpose\").  The resulting rule, now stated as a matter of constitutional law, held \"a category of defendants defined by their mental state\" incompetent to be executed.  Id., at 419.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court clarified the scope of that category in Panetti v. Quarterman by focusing on whether a prisoner can \"reach a rational understanding of the reason for [his] execution.\"  551 U.\u00a0S., at 958.  Like Alvin Ford, Scott Panetti suffered from \"gross delusions\" stemming from \"extreme psychosis.\"  Id., at 936, 960.  In reversing a ruling that he could still be executed, the Panetti Court set out the appropriate \"standard for competency.\"  Id., at 957.  Ford, the Court now noted, had not provided \"specific criteria.\"  551 U.\u00a0S., at 957.  But Ford had explored what lay behind the Eighth Amendment's prohibition, highlighting that the execution of a prisoner who cannot comprehend the reasons for his punishment offends moral values and \"serves no retributive purpose.\"  551 U.\u00a0S., at 958.  Those principles, the Panetti Court explained, indicate how to identify prisoners whom the State may not execute.  The critical question is whether a \"prisoner's mental state is so distorted by a mental illness\" that he lacks a \"rational understanding\" of \"the State's rationale for [his] execution.\"  Id., at 958-959.  Or similarly put, the issue is whether a \"prisoner's concept of reality\" is \"so impair[ed]\" that he cannot grasp the execution's \"meaning and purpose\" or the \"link between [his] crime and its punishment.\"  Id., at 958, 960.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vernon Madison killed a police officer in 1985 during a domestic dispute.  An Alabama jury found him guilty of capital murder, and the trial court sentenced him to death.  He has spent most of the ensuing decades on the State's death row.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In recent years, Madison's mental condition has sharply deteriorated.  Madison suffered a series of strokes, including major ones in 2015 and 2016.  See Tr. 19, 46-47 (Apr. 14, 2016).  He was diagnosed as having vascular dementia, with attendant disorientation and confusion, cognitive impairment, and memory loss.  See id., at 19-20, 52-54.  In particular, Madison claims that he can no longer recollect committing the crime for which he has been sentenced to die.  See Tr., Pet. Exh. 2, p. 8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After his 2016 stroke, Madison petitioned the trial court for a stay of execution on the ground that he had become mentally incompetent.  Citing Ford and Panetti, he argued that \"he no longer understands\" the \"status of his case\" or the \"nature of his conviction and sentence.\"  Pet. for Suspension in No. CC-85-1385.80 (C.\u00a0C. Mobile Cty., Ala., Feb. 12, 2016), pp.\u00a011, 14.  And in a later filing, Madison emphasized that he could not \"independently recall the facts of the offense he is convicted of.\"  Brief Pursuant to Order (Apr. 21, 2016), p.\u00a08.  Alabama countered that Madison had \"a rational understanding of [the reasons for] his impending execution,\" as required by Ford and Panetti, even assuming he had no memory of committing his crime.  Brief on Madison's Competency (April 21, 2016), pp.\u00a04-5, 8.  And more broadly, the State claimed that Madison could not possibly qualify as incompetent under those two decisions because both \"concerned themselves with '[g]ross delusions'\u00a0\"--which all agree Madison does not have.  Id., at 2; see ibid. (Madison \"failed to implicate\" Ford and Panetti because he \"does not suffer from psychosis or delusions\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Expert reports from two psychologists largely aligned with the parties' contending positions.  Dr. John Goff, Madison's expert, found that although Madison \"underst[ood] the nature of execution\" in the abstract, he did not comprehend the \"reasoning behind\" Alabama's effort to execute him.  Tr., Pet. Exh. 2 (Apr. 14, 2016), p.\u00a08; see id., at 9.  Goff stated that Madison had \"Major Vascular Neurological Disorder\"--also called vascular dementia--which had caused \"significant cognitive decline.\"  Ibid.  And Goff underscored that Madison \"demonstrate[d] retrograde amnesia\" about his crime, meaning that he had no \"independent recollection[ ]\" of the murder.  Id., at 8; see id., at 9.  For his part, Dr. Karl Kirkland, the court-appointed expert, reported that Madison \"was able to discuss his case\" accurately and \"appear[ed] to understand his legal situation.\"  Tr., Ct. Exh. 1, pp.\u00a010-11.  Although Kirkland acknowledged that Madison's strokes had led to cognitive decline, see id., at 10, the psychologist made no mention of Madison's diagnosed vascular dementia.  Rather, Kirkland highlighted that \"[t]here was no evidence of psychosis, paranoia, or delusion.\"  Id., at 9; see ibid. (Madison \"did not seem delusional at all\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At a competency hearing, Alabama similarly stressed Madison's absence of psychotic episodes or delusions.  The State asked both experts to affirm that Madison was \"neither delusional [n]or psychotic.\"  Tr. 56; see id., at 22.  And its closing argument focused on their agreement that he was not.  As the State summarized: \"He's not psychotic.  He's not delusional.\"  Id., at 81.  On the State's view, that fact answered the competency question because \"[t]he Supreme Court is looking at whether someone's delusions or someone's paranoia or someone's psychosis is standing in the way of\" rationally understanding his punishment.  Id., at 82.  Madison's counsel disputed that point.  \"[T]he State would like to say, well, he's not delusional, he's not psychotic,\" the attorney recapped.  Id., at 83.  But, she continued, \"[t]hat's not really the criteria\" under Panetti.  Tr. 83.  Rather, the Court there barred executing a person with any mental illness--\"dementia\" and \"brain injuries\" no less than psychosis and delusions--that prevents him from comprehending \"why he is being executed.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trial court found Madison competent to be executed.  Its order first recounted the evidence given by each expert witness.  The summary of Kirkland's report and testimony began by stating that the psychologist had \"found no evidence of paranoia[,] delusion [or] psychosis.\"  Order (Apr. 29, 2016), p.\u00a05 (2016 Order).  The court then noted Kirkland's view that Madison could \"give details of the history of his case\" and \"appear[ed] to understand his legal situation.\"  Ibid.  Turning to the Goff report, the court noted the expert's finding that Madison was \"amnesic\" and could not recollect his crime.  Id., at 6; see id., at 7.  In a single, final paragraph, the court provided both its ruling and its reasoning.  Madison had failed to show, the court wrote, that he did not \"rationally understand the punishment he is about to suffer and why he is about to suffer it.\"  Id., at 10.  The court \"accept[ed] the testimony of Dr. Kirkland as to the understanding Madison has concerning the situation.\"  Ibid.  \"Further,\" the court concluded, \"the evidence does not support that Mr. Madison is delusional.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Madison next sought habeas relief in federal court, where he faced the heavy burden of showing that the state-court ruling \"involved an unreasonable application of[\u00a0] clearly established federal law\" or rested on an \"unreasonable determination of the facts.\"  Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d).  The District Court rejected his petition, but the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled that Madison had demonstrated both kinds of indisputable error.  See Madison v. Commissioner, 851 F.\u00a03d 1173 (2017).  This Court then summarily reversed the appeals court's decision.  See Dunn v. Madison, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017) (per curiam).  We explained, contrary to the Eleventh Circuit's principal holding, that \"[n]either Panetti nor Ford 'clearly established' that a prisoner is incompetent to be executed\" because of a simple failure to remember his crime.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  And we found that the state court did not act unreasonably--otherwise put, did not err \"beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement\"--when it found that Madison had the necessary understanding to be executed.  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  But we made clear that our decision was premised on AEDPA's \"demanding\" and \"deferential standard.\"  Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 3, 4).  \"We express[ed] no view\" on the question of Madison's competency \"outside of the AEDPA context.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4).1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Alabama set an execution date in 2018, Madison returned to state court to argue again that his mental condition precluded the State from going forward.  In his petition, Madison reiterated the facts and arguments he had previously presented to the state court.  But Madison also claimed that since that court's decision (1) he had suffered further cognitive decline and (2) a state board had suspended Kirkland's license to practice psychology, thus discrediting his prior testimony.  See Pet. to Suspend Execution in No. CC-85-1385.80 (C. C. Mobile Cty., Ala., Dec. 18, 2017), pp.\u00a01-2, 16-19.2  Alabama responded that nothing material had changed since the court's first competency hearing.  See Motion to Dismiss (Dec. 20, 2017), p.\u00a09.  The State also repeated its argument that Panetti permits executing Madison, pointing to the experts' agreement that he is \"not delusional or psychotic\" and asserting that neither \"memory impairment [n]or dementia [could] suffice to satisfy the Panetti and Ford standards\" without \"an expansion\" of those decisions.  Motion to Dismiss 4, 10.  A week before the scheduled execution, the state court again found Madison mentally competent.  Its brief order stated only that Madison \"did not provide a substantial threshold showing of insanity[ ] sufficient to convince this Court to stay the execution.\"  App. A to Pet. for Cert.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Madison then filed in this Court a request to stay his execution and a petition for certiorari.  We ordered the stay on the scheduled execution date and granted the petition a few weeks later.  See 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018).  Because the case now comes to us on direct review of the state court's decision (rather than in a habeas proceeding), AEDPA's deferential standard no longer governs.  (And for that reason--contrary to the dissent's suggestion, post, at 12--our decision on Madison's habeas petition cannot help resolve the questions raised here.)\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two issues relating to Panetti's application are before us.  Recall that our decision there held the Eighth Amendment to forbid executing a prisoner whose mental illness makes him unable to \"reach a rational understanding of the reason for [his] execution.\"  551 U.\u00a0S., at 958; see supra, at 2-3.  The first question presented is whether Panetti prohibits executing Madison merely because he cannot remember committing his crime.  The second question raised is whether Panetti permits executing Madison merely because he suffers from dementia, rather than psychotic delusions.3  In prior stages of this case, as we have described, the parties disagreed about those matters.  See supra, at 4-8.  But at this Court, Madison accepted Alabama's positon on the first issue and Alabama accepted Madison's on the second.  See, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 11, 36. And rightly so.  As the parties now recognize, the standard set out in Panetti supplies the answers to both questions.  First, a person lacking memory of his crime may yet rationally understand why the State seeks to execute him; if so, the Eighth Amendment poses no bar to his execution.  Second, a person suffering from dementia may be unable to rationally understand the reasons for his sentence; if so, the Eighth Amendment does not allow his execution.  What matters is whether a person has the \"rational understanding\" Panetti requires--not whether he has any particular memory or any particular mental illness.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider initially a person who cannot remember his crime because of a mental disorder, but who otherwise has full cognitive function.  The memory loss is genuine: Let us say the person has some kind of amnesia, which has produced a black hole where that recollection should be.  But the person remains oriented in time and place; he can make logical connections and order his thoughts; and he comprehends familiar concepts of crime and punishment.  Can the State execute him for a murder?  When we considered this case before, using the deferential standard applicable in habeas, we held that a state court could allow such an execution without committing inarguable error.  See Madison, 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (stating that no prior decision had \"clearly established\" the opposite); supra, at 6.  Today, we address the issue straight-up, sans any deference to a state court.  Again, is the failure to remember committing a crime alone enough to prevent a State from executing a prisoner?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not, under Panetti's own terms.  That decision asks about understanding, not memory--more specifically, about a person's understanding of why the State seeks capital punishment for a crime, not his memory of the crime itself.  And the one may exist without the other. Do you have an independent recollection of the Civil War?  Obviously not.  But you may still be able to reach a rational--indeed, a sophisticated--understanding of that conflict and its consequences.  Do you recall your first day of school?  Probably not.  But if your mother told you years later that you were sent home for hitting a classmate, you would have no trouble grasping the story.  And similarly, if you somehow blacked out a crime you committed, but later learned what you had done, you could well appreciate the State's desire to impose a penalty.  Assuming, that is, no other cognitive impairment, loss of memory of a crime does not prevent rational understanding of the State's reasons for resorting to punishment.  And that kind of comprehension is the Panetti standard's singular focus.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same answer follows from the core justifications Panetti offered for framing its Eighth Amendment test as it did.  Echoing Ford, Panetti reasoned that execution has no retributive value when a prisoner cannot appreciate the meaning of a community's judgment.  See 551 U.\u00a0S., at 958-959 (citing 477 U.\u00a0S., at 407-408); supra, at 3.  But as just explained, a person who can no longer remember a crime may yet recognize the retributive message society intends to convey with a death sentence.  Similarly, Ford and Panetti stated that it \"offends humanity\" to execute a person so wracked by mental illness that he cannot comprehend the \"meaning and purpose of the punishment.\"  477 U.\u00a0S., at 407; 551 U.\u00a0S., at 960; see id., at 958.  But that offense to morality must be much less when a person's mental disorder causes nothing more than an episodic memory loss.  Moral values do not exempt the simply forgetful from punishment, whatever the neurological reason for their lack of recall.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But such memory loss still may factor into the \"rational understanding\" analysis that Panetti demands.  If that loss combines and interacts with other mental shortfalls to deprive a person of the capacity to comprehend why the State is exacting death as punishment, then the Panetti standard will be satisfied.  That may be so when a person has difficulty preserving any memories, so that even newly gained knowledge (about, say, the crime and punishment) will be quickly forgotten.  Or it may be so when cognitive deficits prevent the acquisition of such knowledge at all, so that memory gaps go forever uncompensated.  As Panetti indicated, neurologists, psychologists, and other experts can contribute to a court's understanding of issues of that kind.  See id., at 962.  But the sole inquiry for the court remains whether the prisoner can rationally understand the reasons for his death sentence.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next consider a prisoner who suffers from dementia or a similar disorder, rather than psychotic delusions.  The dementia, as is typical, has compromised this prisoner's cognitive functions.  But it has not resulted in the kind of delusional beliefs that Alvin Ford and Scott Panetti held.  May the prisoner nonetheless receive a stay of execution under Ford and Panetti?  Or instead, is a delusional disorder a prerequisite to declaring a mentally ill person incompetent to be executed?  We did not address that issue when we last considered this case, on habeas review; in that sense, the question is one of first impression.  See supra, at 6, n.\u00a01.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But here too, Panetti has already answered the question.  Its standard focuses on whether a mental disorder has had a particular effect: an inability to rationally understand why the State is seeking execution.  See supra, at 2-3.  Conversely, that standard has no interest in establishing any precise cause: Psychosis or dementia, delusions or overall cognitive decline are all the same under Panetti, so long as they produce the requisite lack of comprehension.  To be sure, Panetti on occasion spoke of \"gross delusions\" in explaining its holding.  551 U.\u00a0S., at 960.  And similarly, Ford talked about the \"insane,\" which sometimes refers to persons holding such irrational beliefs.  See, e.g., 477 U.\u00a0S., at 401, 410.4  But those references are no more than a predictable byproduct of the two cases' facts.  At the same time (and interchangeably), Panetti used more inclusive terms, such as \"mental illness,\" \"mental disorder,\" and \"psychological dysfunction.\"  551 U.\u00a0S., at 936, 959, 960; see Ford, 477 U.\u00a0S., at 408-409, n.\u00a02 (referring to prisoners with \"mental illness\").  And most important, Panetti framed its test, as just described, in a way utterly indifferent to a prisoner's specific mental illness.  The Panetti standard concerns, once again, not the diagnosis of such illness, but a consequence--to wit, the prisoner's inability to rationally understand his punishment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And here too, the key justifications Ford and Panetti offered for the Eighth Amendment's bar confirm our conclusion about its reach.  As described above, those decisions stated that an execution lacks retributive purpose when a mentally ill prisoner cannot understand the societal judgment underlying his sentence.  See Panetti, 551 U.\u00a0S., at 958-959; Ford, 477 U.\u00a0S., at 409; supra, at 2-3.  And they indicated that an execution offends morality in the same circumstance.  See 551 U.\u00a0S., at 958, 960; 477 U.\u00a0S., at 409; supra, at 2-3.  Both rationales for the constitutional bar thus hinge (just as the Panetti standard deriving from them does) on the prisoner's \"[in]comprehension of why he has been singled out\" to die.  477 U.\u00a0S., at 409; see supra, at 2-3.  Or said otherwise, if and when that failure of understanding is present, the rationales kick in--irrespective of whether one disease or another (say, psychotic delusions or dementia) is to blame.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In evaluating competency to be executed, a judge must therefore look beyond any given diagnosis to a downstream consequence.  As Ford and Panetti recognized, a delusional disorder can be of such severity--can \"so impair the prisoner's concept of reality\"--that someone in its thrall will be unable \"to come to grips with\" the punishment's meaning.  Panetti, 551 U.\u00a0S., at 958; Ford, 477 U.\u00a0S., at 409.  But delusions come in many shapes and sizes, and not all will interfere with the understanding that the Eighth Amendment requires.  See Panetti, 551 U.\u00a0S., at 962 (remanding the case to consider expert evidence on whether the prisoner's delusions did so).  And much the same is true of dementia.  That mental condition can cause such disorientation and cognitive decline as to prevent a person from sustaining a rational understanding of why the State wants to execute him.  See supra, at 11-12.  But dementia also has milder forms, which allow a person to preserve that understanding.  Hence the need--for dementia as for delusions as for any other mental disorder--to attend to the particular circumstances of a case and make the precise judgment Panetti requires.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The only question left--and the only one on which the parties now disagree--is whether Madison's execution may go forward based on the state court's decision below.  Madison's counsel says it cannot because that ruling was tainted by legal error--specifically, the idea that only delusions, and not dementia, can support a finding of mental incompetency.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12, 21, 25, 27.  Alabama counters that the state court did not rely on that (concededly) incorrect view of the law.  See id., at 37-41.  But we come away at the least unsure whether that is so--especially given Alabama's evidence and arguments in the state court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted earlier, the 2018 ruling we review today contains only one sentence of explanation.  See supra, at 7-8.  It states that Madison \"did not provide a substantial threshold showing of insanity[ ] sufficient to convince this Court to stay the execution.\"  App. A to Pet. for Cert.  If the state court used the word \"insanity\" to refer to a delusional disorder, then error occurred: The court would have denied a stay on the ground that Madison did not have that specific kind of mental illness.  And the likelihood that the court made that mistake is heightened by the State's emphasis, at that stage of the proceedings (as at others), that Madison was \"not delusional or psychotic\" and that \"dementia\" could not suffice to bar his execution absent \"an expansion of Ford and Panetti.\"  Motion to Dismiss 4, 10; see supra, at 4-8; but see post, at 9-10, and n.\u00a04 (disregarding those arguments).5  Alabama argues, however, that the court spoke of \"insanity\" only because the state statute under which Madison sought relief uses that term.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37; Ala. Code \u00a715-16-23 (2011) (allowing a stay of execution \"on account of the [convict's] insanity\").  But even if so, that does not advance the State's view that the state court properly understood the Eighth Amendment bar when assessing Madison's competency.  Alabama told this Court in opposing certiorari that its statute covers only those with delusional disorders, and not those with dementia.  See Brief in Opposition 12 (\"[T]he sole question to be answered under the state statute was whether Madison was insane, not whether he suffered from dementia\").  The state court's (supposed) echoing of statutory language understood in that way cannot provide assurance that the court knew a person with dementia might receive a stay of execution; indeed, it suggests exactly the opposite.  The court's 2018 order thus calls out for a do-over.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alabama further contends, however, that we should look past the state court's 2018 decision to the court's initial 2016 determination of competency.  (The dissent similarly begins with the 2016 ruling, see post, at 6-7, even though that is not the decision under review here.)  According to the State, nothing material changed in the interim period, see supra, at 7; thus, we may find the meaning of the later ruling in the earlier one, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 36-37.  And, the State continues, the 2016 opinion gets the law right.  Alabama's proof is that the court, after summarizing the psychologists' testimony, found that \"Madison has a rational[\u00a0] understanding, as required by Panetti,\" concerning the \"punishment he is about to suffer and why he is about to suffer it.\"  2016 Order, at 10; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 39; supra, at 5-6.  (The dissent quotes the same passage.  See post, at 7.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the state court's initial decision does not aid Alabama's cause.  First, we do not know that the court in 2018 meant to incorporate everything in its prior opinion.  The order says nothing to that effect; and though it came out the same way as the earlier decision, it need not have rested on all the same reasoning.  Second, the 2016 opinion itself does not show that the state court realized that persons suffering from dementia could satisfy the Panetti standard.  True enough, as Alabama says, that the court accurately stated that standard in its decision.  But as described above, Alabama had repeatedly argued to the court (over Madison's objection) that only prisoners suffering from delusional disorders could qualify as incompetent under Panetti.  See, e.g., Brief on Madison's Competency 2 (Madison \"failed to implicate\" Ford and Panetti because he \"does not suffer from psychosis or delusions\"); Tr. 82 (\"The Supreme Court [in Panetti] is looking at whether someone's delusions or someone's paranoia or someone's psychosis is standing in the way of\" rationally understanding his punishment); see also supra, at 4-5; but see post, at 9-10, and n.\u00a04 (disregarding those arguments).  And Alabama relied on the expert opinion of a psychologist who highlighted Madison's lack of \"psychosis, paranoia, or delusion,\" while never mentioning his dementia.  Tr., Ct. Exh. 1 (Apr. 14, 2016), p. 9.  That too-limited understanding of Panetti's compass is reflected in the court's 2016 opinion.  In its single paragraph of analysis, the court \"accept[ed] the testimony\" of the State's preferred psychologist.6  And the court further found that \"the evidence does not support that Mr. Madison is delusional\"--without ever considering his undisputed dementia.  2016 Order,  at 10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For those reasons, we must return this case to the state court for renewed consideration of Madison's competency (assuming Alabama sets a new execution date).  See, e.g., Kindred Nursing Centers L. P. v. Clark, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 9) (remanding when \"uncertain\" whether \"an impermissible taint occurred\"); Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U.\u00a0S. 738, 751-752 (1990) (similar).  In that proceeding, two matters disputed below should now be clear.  First, under Ford and Panetti, the Eighth Amendment may permit executing Madison even if he cannot remember committing his crime.  Second, under those same decisions, the Eighth Amendment may prohibit executing Madison even though he suffers from dementia, rather than delusions.  The sole question on which Madison's competency depends is whether he can reach a \"rational understanding\" of why the State wants to execute him.  Panetti, 551 U.\u00a0S., at 958.  In answering that question--on which we again express no view, see supra, at 6--the state court may not rely on any arguments or evidence tainted with the legal errors we have addressed.  And because that is so, the court should consider whether it needs to supplement the existing record.  Some evidence in that record, including portions of the experts' reports and testimony, expressly reflects an incorrect view of the relevance of delusions or memory; still other evidence might have implicitly rested on those same misjudgments.  The state court, we have little doubt, can evaluate such matters better than we.  It must do so as the first step in assessing Madison's competency--and ensuring that if he is to be executed, he understands why.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We accordingly vacate the judgment of the state court and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kavanaugh took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nAlito, J., dissenting\n\u2002586 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-7505\nVERNON MADISON, PETITIONER v. ALABAMA\non writ of certiorari to the circuit court of alabama, mobile county\n[February 27, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch join, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What the Court has done in this case makes a mockery of our Rules.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner's counsel convinced the Court to stay his client's execution and to grant his petition for a writ of certiorari for the purpose of deciding a clear-cut constitutional question: Does the Eighth Amendment prohibit the execution of a murderer who cannot recall committing the murder for which the death sentence was imposed?  The petition strenuously argued that executing such a person is unconstitutional.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After persuading the Court to grant review of this question, counsel abruptly changed course.  Perhaps because he concluded (correctly) that petitioner was unlikely to prevail on the question raised in the petition, he conceded that the argument advanced in his petition was wrong, and he switched to an entirely different argument, namely, that the state court had rejected petitioner's claim that he is incompetent to be executed because the court erroneously thought that dementia, as opposed to other mental conditions, cannot provide a basis for such a claim.  See Brief for Petitioner 16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was not a question that the Court agreed to hear; indeed, there is no mention whatsoever of this argument in the petition--not even a hint.  Nor is this question fairly included within those on which the Court granted review.  On the contrary, it is an entirely discrete and independent question.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Counsel's tactics flagrantly flouted our Rules.  Our Rules make it clear that we grant certiorari to decide the specific question or questions of law set out in a petition for certiorari.  See this Court's Rule 14.1(a) (\"Only the questions set out in the petition, or fairly included therein, will be considered by the Court\").  Our whole certiorari system would be thrown into turmoil if we allowed counsel to obtain review of one question and then switch to an entirely different question after review is granted.  In the past when counsel have done this, we have dismissed the writ as improvidently granted.  See, e.g., Visa, Inc. v. Osborn, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016); City and County of San Francisco v. Sheehan, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015).  We should do that here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead, the majority rewards counsel's trick.  It vacates the judgment below because it is unsure whether the state court committed the error claimed in petitioner's merits brief.  But not only was there no trace of this argument in the petition, there is nothing in the record showing that the state court ever adopted the erroneous view that petitioner claims it took.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question on which we granted review was an outgrowth of our per curiam decision in Dunn v. Madison, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017), which concerned an Eleventh Circuit decision granting petitioner federal habeas relief.  Prior to that decision, this Court had held in Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.\u00a0S. 399 (1986), that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the execution of a person who is \"insane,\" and in Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.\u00a0S. 930 (2007), the Court elaborated on this rule, explaining that a person cannot be executed if he lacks a rational understanding of the reason for the execution.  The Eleventh Circuit interpreted those cases to mean that petitioner could not be executed because he did not remember killing his victim, Mobile, Alabama, police officer Julius Schulte.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We summarily reversed.  Under the relevant provision of the federal habeas statute, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d), which was enacted as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), petitioner could not obtain federal habeas relief unless the state court's rejection of his memory-loss claim represented an unreasonable application of federal law as clearly established at the time by decisions of this Court.  We held that neither Ford nor Panetti clearly established that a person cannot be executed if he does not remember committing the crime for which the death sentence was imposed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our opinion stated, however, that it \"express[ed] no view on the merits of the underlying question outside of the AEDPA context.\"  Dunn, 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  And a concurring opinion authored by Justice Ginsburg and joined by Justices Breyer and Sotomayor teed up this question for review in a later case.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (\"The issue whether a State may administer the death penalty to a person whose disability leaves him without memory of his commission of a capital offense is a substantial question not yet addressed by the Court.  Appropriately presented, the issue would warrant full airing\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking this cue, petitioner then sought relief in state court based on his inability to remember his crime, and when that effort failed, he filed the petition at issue now.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The centerpiece of the petition and petitioner's 11th-hour application for a stay of execution1 was the argument that he could not constitutionally be executed because he did not remember killing Officer Schulte.  The petition repeatedly noted petitioner's inability to remember his crime.  See Pet. for Cert. i, iii, 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 18, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28.  And the petition was very clear about the question on which review was sought:\n\"[T]his case presents this Court with the appropriate vehicle to consider the substantial question of whether the execution of a prisoner with no memory of the underlying offense is consistent with the evolving standards of decency inherent in this Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.\"  Id., at 2.\nThis same point was made time and again:\n&TLRbull2;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"[B]ecause [petitioner's] disability renders him unable to remember the underlying offense for which he is to be punished, his execution does not comport with the evolving standards of decency required by this Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.\"  Id., at 18.\n&TLRbull2;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"[I]mposing death on a prisoner, who, like Mr. Madison, suffers from substantial memory deficits by virtue of multiple stroke and resulting vascular dementia serves no retributive or deterrent purpose.\"  Id., at 22.\n&TLRbull2;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"[E]xecuting an individual with no memory of the underlying offense serves no retributive purpose.\"  Ibid.\n&TLRbull2;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"[W]here the person being punished has no memory of the commission of the offense for which he is to be executed, the 'moral quality' of that punishment is lessened and unable to match outrage over the offense.\"  Id., at 22-23.\n&TLRbull2;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Mr. Madison's severe memory impairments as a result of vascular dementia render him incompetent to be executed under the Eight Amendment.\"  Id., at 25 (quotation altered).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, the body of the petition makes it clear that review was sought on the question invited by the Dunn concurrence, and the thrust of the wording of the two questions was the same.  They read as follows:\n\"1.\u2002Consistent with the Eighth Amendment, and this Court's decisions in Ford and Panetti, may the State execute a prisoner whose mental disability leaves him without memory of his commission of the capital offense?  See Dunn v. Madison, [583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (Ginsburg, J., joined by Breyer and Sotomayor, JJ., concurring).]\n\"2.\u2002Do evolving standards of decency and the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment bar the execution of a prisoner whose competency has been compromised by vascular dementia and multiple strokes causing severe cognitive dysfunction and a degenerative medical condition which prevents him from remembering the crime for which he was convicted or understanding the circumstances of his scheduled execution?\u00a0\"  Pet. for Cert. iii.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the exception of the final phrase in question two (\"or understanding the circumstances of his scheduled execution\"), both questions solely concern the effect of memory loss on an Eighth Amendment analysis.  The final phrase in question two and certain passages in the petition, if read with an exceedingly generous eye, might be seen as a basis for considering whether the evidence in the state-court record shows that petitioner's dementia rendered him incapable of having a rational understanding of the reason for his execution.  But that is the sort of factbound question on which we rarely grant review, see this Court's Rule 10, and it is questionable whether we did so here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But whether or not the petition may be fairly read to present that factbound question, it is a travesty to read it as challenging the state-court order on the ground that the state court erroneously believed that dementia cannot provide a basis for a Ford\/Panetti claim.  There is no inkling of that argument in the petition.  Although the petition described the state-court order at numerous places, the petition never claimed that the order was based on an impermissible distinction between dementia and other mental conditions.  See, e.g., Pet. for Cert. ii, 2-3, 16.  And in fact, there is a point in the petition where such an interpretation of the state-court order would surely have been mentioned if the petition had intended to raise it as a ground for review.  The petition noted that \"courts have recognized dementia and attendant cognitive decline and memory impairment as a basis for a finding of incompetency to be executed,\" id., at 25, but the petition did not follow that statement by claiming that the state court in this case took a contradictory position.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the petition did not raise--indeed, did not even hint at--the argument on which the Court now grants relief, the Court's decision is insupportable.2  It violates our Rule that \"[o]nly the questions set out in the petition, or fairly included therein, will be considered by the Court.\"  See Rule 14.1(a).\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if it were proper for us to consider whether the order below was based on an erroneous distinction between dementia and other mental conditions, there is little reason to think that it was.  After a full evidentiary hearing in 2016, the state court rejected petitioner's Ford\/Panetti claim based on a correct statement of the holding of those decisions.  It found that petitioner \"ha[d] not carried his burden [of showing] by a preponderance of the evidence .\u00a0.\u00a0. that he .\u00a0.\u00a0. does not rationally understand the punishment he is about to suffer and why he is about to suffer it.\"  Order (Apr. 29, 2016), p.\u00a010.  The court's order went on to say that it \"specifically [found] that Madison has a rationa[l] understanding, as required by Panetti, that he is going to be executed because of the murder he committed and a rationa[l] understanding that the State is seeking retribution and that he will die when he is executed.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In concluding that the state court might have drawn a distinction between dementia and other mental conditions, the majority seizes upon the wording of the order issued after a subsequent hearing in 2018.  Ante, at 14.  In that order, the same judge wrote: \"Defendant did not provide a substantial threshold showing of insanity, a requirement set out by the United States Supreme Court, sufficient to convince this Court to stay the execution.\"  Order (Jan. 16, 2018), p.\u00a01 (emphasis added).  The majority worries that the state-court judge might not have applied the same standard in 2018 as he had two years earlier and might have viewed \"insanity\" as something narrower than the standard mandated by Ford and Panetti.  This concern is unfounded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taken out of context, the term \"insanity\" might not be read to encompass dementia, but in context, it is apparent that the state court's use of that term was based on the way in which it was used in Ford and Panetti.  The state court did not simply refer to \"insanity.\"  It referred to \"insanity, a requirement set out by the United States Supreme Court.\"  Thus, it followed the term \"insanity\" with an appositive, which is a word or phrase that renames the word or phrase that precedes it.  In other words, what the state court clearly meant by \"insanity\" was what this Court termed insanity in Ford and Panetti.  What was that?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Ford, the Court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the execution of a person who is \"insane,\" and in the portion of Justice Marshall's lead opinion that was joined by a plurality, Justice Marshall equated insanity with a mental condition that \"prevents [a person] from comprehending the reasons for the penalty or its implications.\"  477 U.\u00a0S., at 417.  Justice Powell, who provided the fifth vote for the decision, took a similar position.  See id., at 422-423 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  In Panetti, which built on the holding in Ford, the Court used the term in a similar way.  See 551 U.\u00a0S., at 958-960.  Accordingly, a defendant suffers from \"insanity,\" as the term is used in Ford and Panetti, if the prisoner does not understand the reason for his execution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today's decision does not reject this interpretation of the state-court order; it says only that it is vacating and remanding because it is \"at the least unsure\" whether the state court used the term \"insanity\" in this way.  Ante, at 14. The majority cites two reasons for its uncertainty, but both are weak.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the majority attributes to the state court an interpretation of the term \"insanity\" that was advanced by the State in this Court in its brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari.  Ante, at 15.  In that submission, the State argued that certiorari should be denied because petitioner had sought relief in state court under the wrong provision of state law, namely, Ala. Code \u00a715-16-23 (2011), which authorizes the suspension of the execution of an inmate who is \"insane.\"  The State argued that petitioner's memory loss did not render him \"insane\" within the meaning of this statute and that if he wished to argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the execution of an inmate who cannot remember his crime, he \"should have filed a petition for post-conviction relief\" under Alabama Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.4.  Brief in Opposition 11-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority's argument based on the State's brief in opposition suffers from multiple defects.  For one thing, nothing suggests that the state court rejected petitioner's application on the ground that he invoked the wrong provision of state law; the State's filing in the state court made no mention of the argument set out in its brief in opposition filed here.  Moreover, if the state court had rejected petitioner's application on the ground that he moved under the wrong provision of state law, it is doubtful that we could review that decision, for then it would appear to rest on an adequate and independent state-law ground.  And to top things off, the majority's argument distorts what the State's brief in opposition attempted to say about the term \"insane.\"  The State did not argue that a defendant who lacks a rational understanding of the reason for his execution due to dementia is not \"insane\" under Ala. Code \u00a715-16-23.  Instead, the State's point was that a defendant is not \"insane\" in that sense merely because he cannot remember committing the crime for which he was convicted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority's other proffered basis for doubt is that the State \"repeatedly argued to the [state] court (over Madison's objection) that only prisoners suffering from delusional disorders could qualify as incompetent under Panetti.\"  Ante, at 16.  The majority, however, cites no place where the State actually made such an argument.  To be sure, the State, in contending that petitioner was not entitled to relief under Ford and Panetti, argued strenuously that he was not delusional.  (The State made this argument because petitioner's counsel claimed that petitioner was in fact delusional and fell within Ford and Panetti for that reason.3)  But arguing, as the State did, that petitioner was not entitled to relief because the claim that he was delusional was untrue is not the same as arguing that petitioner could be executed even if his dementia rendered him incapable of understanding the reason for his execution.  The majority cites no place where the State made the latter argument in the state court.4  And even if the State had made such an argument, what matters is the basis for the state court's decision, not what counsel for the State wrote or said.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I add one more comment regarding the majority's uncertainty about the basis for the state-court decision: Our decision two years ago in Dunn evinced no similar doubts.  There, we said that the state court \"held that, under this Court's decisions in Ford and Panetti, Madison was entitled to relief if he could show\" that he lacks a rational understanding of the circumstances of his punishment.  583 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (quotation altered).  And we said that the state court \"determined that Madison is competent to be executed because--notwithstanding his memory loss--he recognizes that he will be put to death as punishment for the murder he was found to have committed.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4); see also ibid. (referring to the state court's \"finding that Madison understands both that he was tried and imprisoned for murder and that Alabama will put him to death as punishment for that crime\").  Why the majority cannot now see what it understood without any apparent difficulty two years ago is hard to grasp.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For all these reasons, what the Court has done in this case cannot be defended, and therefore it is hard to escape thinking that the real reason for today's decision is doubt on the part of the majority regarding the correctness of the state court's factual finding on the question whether Madison has a rational understanding of the reason for his execution.  There is no question that petitioner suffers from severe physical and mental problems, and the question whether he is capable of understanding the reason for his execution was vigorously litigated below.  But if the Court thinks it is proper for us to reach that question and to reverse the state court's finding based on a cold record, it should own up to what it is doing.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner has abandoned the question on which he succeeded in persuading the Court to grant review, and it is highly improper for the Court to grant him relief on a ground not even hinted at in his petition.  The writ should be dismissed as improvidently granted, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Neither did we opine on--or even mention--the subsidiary legal question whether a mental disorder other than delusions may render a person incompetent to be executed.  Alabama told the Eleventh Circuit that it could not, thus reprising the claim the State had made in the trial court.  See Madison, 851 F.\u00a03d, at 1188 (describing Alabama's argument that \"only a prisoner suffering from gross delusions can show incompetency under Panetti\"); Recording of Oral Arg. in No. 16-12279 (CA11, June 23, 2016), at 26:36-26:45 (\"In this case, what we have is someone who claims to have a mental illness, dementia,\" but does not have \"delusions, which is what Panetti requires\"); id., at 26:48-27:21 (When asked if someone with \"severe dementia\" but no delusions could be executed, the State responded \"I think so because .\u00a0.\u00a0. they don't have delusions\").  (Alabama alternatively argued that the state court's decision was not based on that view, see Brief for Appellee in No. 16-12279 (CA11), pp. 37-38; the quotations the dissent picks out, see post, at 10, n.\u00a04, come from that additional argument.)  The Eleventh Circuit rejected the State's contention that dementia could not preclude an execution as \"inconsistent with the principles underlying\" Ford and Panetti.  851 F.\u00a03d, at 1188.  But we had no reason to address that holding in light of the errors we saw in other parts of the appeals court's analysis.\nFootnote 2\u00a0As Madison's petition recounted, the license suspension followed the opening of a criminal investigation into whether Kirkland had committed narcotics offenses.  See Pet. to Suspend Execution 17-19.\nFootnote 3\u00a0The dissent is in high dudgeon over our taking up the second question, arguing that it was not presented in Madison's petition for certiorari.  See post, at 1-6.  But that is incorrect.  The petition presented two questions--the same two we address here.  The first question asked whether the Eighth Amendment bars executing Madison because he has no \"memory of his commission of the capital offense.\"  Pet. for Cert. iii.  The second question asked whether that Amendment bars his execution because his \"vascular dementia\" and \"severe cognitive dysfunction\" prevent him from either remembering his crime \"or understanding the circumstances of his scheduled execution.\"  Ibid.  So the first question concerned whether memory loss alone could form the basis of a Panetti claim and the second whether the varied consequences of dementia could do so.  The body of the petition, to be sure, devoted more space to the first question.  But it clearly referenced the second.  See Pet. for Cert. 18 (\"[T]his Court has never sought to constrain the world of maladies that can give rise to a finding that a prisoner is incompetent to be executed\"); id., at 25 (\"[C]ourts have recognized dementia and attendant cognitive decline and memory impairment as a basis for a finding of incompetency to be executed\").  And in any event, the number of words spent on each is not what matters.  Our Rule states that the Court will consider \"[o]nly the questions set out in the petition, or fairly included therein.\"  This Court's Rule 14.1(a).  Here, we consider, in order, the two questions set out in Madison's petition.\nFootnote 4\u00a0Alternatively, however, the term may also be used to encompass persons with other mental conditions, so long as they are \"severe enough [to] prevent[\u00a0] a person from having legal capacity and excuse[ ] the person from criminal or civil responsibility.\"  Black's Law Dictionary 914 (10th ed. 2014).  In that different understanding, \"insanity\" connotes a general standard of legal competency rather than a more limited description of delusional disorders.\nFootnote 5\u00a0The State once again repeated that argument in its Brief in Opposition to Madison's certiorari petition.  See Brief in Opposition 11-12 (\"Madison does not argue that he is insane.  Instead, he argues that he suffers from dementia\" and that his execution should be barred \"under a yet-unannounced expansion of Ford and Panetti\").\nFootnote 6\u00a0The court well understood that expert's exclusive focus on whether Madison had psychotic delusions.  In summarizing his testimony, the court began as follows: \"Dr. Kirkland in his exam found no evidence of paranoia or delusion at the time of his examin[ation], on March 31, 2016.  He also found that there was no psychosis present.\"  2016 Order, at 5; see supra, at 5.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Petitioner sought and obtained a stay of execution based on this same argument.  See Application for Stay of Execution 2, 6 (moving the Court to stay petitioner's execution so that it could address the \"substantial\" and \"critical\" question whether executing petitioner, \"whose severe cognitive dysfunction leaves him without memory of his commission of the capital offense,\" would violate the Eighth Amendment).\nFootnote 2\u00a0The Court is unable to cite a single place in the petition that makes any reference to the argument that the state court failed to understand that dementia could satisfy the Ford\/Panetti test.\nFootnote 3\u00a0Petitioner's papers emphasized again and again that he suffers from delusions.  See Pet. for Suspension in No. CC-85-1385.80 (C. C. Mobile Cty., Ala., Feb. 12, 2016), p.\u00a01 (\"Mr. Madison has long suffered from serious mental illness, marked by paranoid delusions and other disabilities\"); id., at 5 (\"At Mr. Madison's trial, Dr. Barry Amyx established that Mr. Madison suffers from a delusional disorder that has existed since he was an adolescent\"); ibid. (\"This well-documented history of paranoia was one of the reasons Dr. Amyx concluded that Mr. Madison had a delusional disorder in a paranoid, really a persecutory type\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); ibid. (\"Dr. Amyx noted that Mr. Madison exhibited delusional thinking about .\u00a0.\u00a0. medication and believed that he was being used as a guinea pig in medical experiments\"); id., at 6 (emphasizing a \"more recent observation\" that \"\u00a0'Mr. Madison consistently presented with paranoid delusions'\u00a0\"); id., at 8 (\"Mr. Madison exhibited delusional and disoriented behavior in June 2015\"); id., at 14 (\"decades of delusional thinking and psychotropic medications\"); see also Pet. for Suspension in No. CC-85-1385.80 (C. C. Mobile Cty., Ala., Dec. 18, 2017), pp. 6-7 (detailing similar statements).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This line of argument fell apart when petitioner's own expert testified that he found no indication that petitioner was \"[e]ither delusional or psychotic.\"  Tr. 56 (Apr. 14, 2016).\nFootnote 4\u00a0Unable to cite any place where the State made this argument to the state court, the Court claims that the State did so in the Eleventh Circuit.  Ante, at 6-7, n.\u00a01.  But even if that were so, it is hard to see what that would have to do with the question whether the state court thought that dementia could not satisfy the Ford\/Panetti test.  And in any event, the Court does not fairly describe the State's argument in the Eleventh Circuit.  The State's Eleventh Circuit brief argued that merely suffering from a mental condition like dementia is not enough to render a prisoner incompetent to be executed; instead, the prisoner must also establish that he lacks a rational understanding of the reason for his execution.  See Brief for Appellee in No. 16-12279 (CA11), pp. 37-38 (Brief for Appellee) (\"The fairest reading of the state court's opinion is that it assumed that dementia and memory loss caused by strokes is a mental illness and went straight to the rational understanding question.  Thus, it is not that the trial court refused to consider Madison's claims pertaining to dementia--Madison cannot point to any portion of the state court order that says this--it is that the trial court correctly noted that Madison failed to prove that any dementia interfered with Madison's ability to have a rational understanding of his execution, including the reasons therefor\"); id., at 27 (\"The Supreme Court has not held that a petitioner can show incompetence without demonstrating a mental illness or that dementia and memory loss definitively preclude rational understanding\"); id., at 29 (\"To the extent the state court followed the lead of the Supreme Court, this Court, and the ABA and required Madison to show that a mental illness prevented him from having a rational understanding of his punishment, doing so was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that the State's brief, in addressing the standard for granting federal habeas relief under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d), stated that this Court \"ha[d] never held that dementia or memory loss is sufficient to show a lack of rational understanding,\" Brief for Appellee 29, but that was because a claim under \u00a72254(d) must be based on a clearly established Supreme Court holding.  See Recording of Oral Arg. in No. 16-12279 (CA11, June 23, 2016), at \u00a032:37-33:30 (State rejecting a suggestion that Panetti holds \"if you don't remember committing the crime at all, and it is clear based on the medical testimony that you don't remember committing this crime, then you don't have\u00a0 a rational understanding of the factual basis for the imposition of the death penalty\": \"First of all, under AEDPA deference, I think that that is not the holding of Panetti. . . .\u00a0 I think under AEDPA deference, it's pretty clear that the holding of Panetti is very narrow. . . .\u00a0 I would say the holding in Panetti is that documented mental illness that results in a delusion has to be considered when talking about rational understanding\"); id., at 36:00-36:30 (\"I think the Supreme Court has never held that not remembering something is equivalent to not having a rational understanding.\u00a0 I think that is just undeniably true.\u00a0 And if AEDPA deference applies, then I don't think the state court could have been unreasonable in rejecting the view that memory is required\").\u00a0 The State did not argue either that dementia cannot satisfy Ford and Panetti or that the state court based its decision on that ground.  On the contrary, Alabama wrote that \"even if the trial court had determined that dementia and severe memory loss--or even total amnesia--are insufficient to meet the rational understanding test, that finding would not contradict clearly established federal law.\"  Brief for Appellee 29; see also id., at 30 (\"Even assuming the state court held, as a matter of law, that amnesia is not sufficient to show a lack of rational understanding, that determination was not unreasonable in light of clearly established federal law\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority acknowledges that the State made this concededly correct habeas argument, but then oddly writes it off as an \"additional\" or alternative argument.\u00a0 Ante, at 7, n. 1.\u00a0 Yet, as the State's brief and oral argument illustrate, the State's core contention was that the state court did not unreasonably apply clearly established law under Panetti's \"very narrow\" holding.\u00a0 (And as we later held in Dunn, the State was correct.) \u00a0The majority simply cannot escape the inconvenient fact that the State never argued, as a non-AEDPA matter, that petitioner could be executed even if his dementia precluded a rational understanding.\n\n\n","37":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMANHATTAN COMMUNITY ACCESS CORP. ET AL. v. HALLECK ET AL.(2019)\nNo. 17-1702\nArgued: February 25, 2019Decided: June 17, 2019\n\n\nNew York state law requires cable operators to set aside channels on their cable systems for public access.  Those channels are operated by the cable operator unless the local government chooses to itself operate the channels or designates a private entity to operate the channels.  New York City (the City) has designated a private nonprofit corporation, petitioner Manhattan Neighborhood Network (MNN), to operate the public access channels on Time Warner's cable system in Manhattan.  Respondents DeeDee Halleck and Jesus Papoleto Melendez produced a film critical of MNN to be aired on MNN's public access channels.  MNN televised the film.  MNN later suspended Halleck and Melendez from all MNN services and facilities.  The producers sued, claiming that MNN violated their First Amendment free-speech rights when it restricted their access to the public access channels because of the content of their film.  The District Court dismissed the claim on the ground that MNN is not a state actor and therefore is not subject to First Amendment constraints on its editorial discretion.  Reversing in relevant part, the Second Circuit concluded that MNN is a state actor subject to First Amendment constraints.\nHeld:\u00a0MNN is not a state actor subject to the First Amendment.  Pp.\u00a05-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment prohibits only governmental, not private, abridgment of speech.  See, e.g., Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U.\u00a0S. 727, 737.  This Court's state-action doctrine distinguishes the government from individuals and private entities.  Pp.\u00a05-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1)\u00a0A private entity may qualify as a state actor when, as relevant here, the entity exercises \"powers traditionally exclusively reserved to the State.\"  Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.\u00a0S. 345, 352.  The Court has stressed that \"very few\" functions fall into that category.  Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks, 436 U.\u00a0S. 149, 158.  The relevant function in this case--operation of public access channels on a cable system--has not traditionally and exclusively been performed by government.  Since the 1970s, a variety of private and public actors have operated public access channels.  Early Manhattan public access channels were operated by private cable operators with some help from private nonprofit organizations.  That practice continued until the early 1990s, when MNN began to operate the channels.  Operating public access channels on a cable system is not a traditional, exclusive public function.  Pp.\u00a06-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2)\u00a0The producers contend that the relevant function here is more generally the operation of a public forum for speech, which, they claim, is a traditional, exclusive public function.  But that analysis mistakenly ignores the threshold state-action question.  Providing some kind of forum for speech is not an activity that only governmental entities have traditionally performed.  Therefore, a private entity who provides a forum for speech is not transformed by that fact alone into a state actor.  See Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.\u00a0S. 507, 520-521.

But the City's designation is analogous to a government license, a government contract, or a government-granted monopoly, none of which converts a private entity into a state actor--unless the private entity is performing a traditional, exclusive public function.  See, e.g., San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483 U.\u00a0S. 522, 543-544.  And the fact that MNN is subject to the State's extensive regulation \"does not by itself convert its action into that of the State.\"  Jackson, 419 U.\u00a0S., at 350.  Pp.\u00a011-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The producers alternatively contend that the public access channels are actually the City's property and that MNN is essentially managing government property on the City's behalf.  But the City does not own or lease the public access channels and does not possess any formal easement or other property interest in the channels.  It does not matter that a provision in the franchise agreements between the City and Time Warner allowed the City to designate a private entity to operate the public access channels on Time Warner's cable system.  Nothing in the agreements suggests that the City possesses any property interest in the cable system or in the public access channels on that system.

To draw the line between governmental and private, this Court applies what is known as the state-action doctrine.  Under that doctrine, as relevant here, a private entity may be considered a state actor when it exercises a function \"traditionally exclusively reserved to the State.\"  Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.\u00a0S. 345, 352 (1974).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This state-action case concerns the public access channels on Time Warner's cable system in Manhattan.  Public access channels are available for private citizens to use.  The public access channels on Time Warner's cable system in Manhattan are operated by a private nonprofit corporation known as MNN.  The question here is whether MNN--even though it is a private entity--nonetheless is a state actor when it operates the public access channels.  In other words, is operation of public access channels on a cable system a traditional, exclusive public function?  If so, then the First Amendment would restrict MNN's exercise of editorial discretion over the speech and speakers on the public access channels.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the state-action doctrine as it has been articulated and applied by our precedents, we conclude that operation of public access channels on a cable system is not a traditional, exclusive public function.  Moreover, a private entity such as MNN who opens its property for speech by others is not transformed by that fact alone into a state actor.  In operating the public access channels, MNN is a private actor, not a state actor, and MNN therefore is not subject to First Amendment constraints on its editorial discretion.  We reverse in relevant part the judgment of the Second Circuit, and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the 1970s, public access channels have been a regular feature on cable television systems throughout the United States.  In the 1970s, Federal Communications Commission regulations required certain cable operators to set aside channels on their cable systems for public access.  In 1979, however, this Court ruled that the FCC lacked statutory authority to impose that mandate.  See FCC v. Midwest Video Corp., 440 U.\u00a0S. 689 (1979).  A few years later, Congress passed and President Reagan signed the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984.  98 Stat. 2779.  The Act authorized state and local governments to require cable operators to set aside channels on their cable systems for public access.  47 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7531(b).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The New York State Public Service Commission regulates cable franchising in New York State and requires cable operators in the State to set aside channels on their cable systems for public access.  16 N.\u00a0Y. Codes, Rules & Regs. \u00a7\u00a7895.1(f), 895.4(b) (2018).  State law requires that use of the public access channels be free of charge and first-come, first-served.  \u00a7\u00a7895.4(c)(4) and (6).  Under state law, the cable operator operates the public access channels unless the local government in the area chooses to itself operate the channels or designates a private entity to operate the channels.  \u00a7895.4(c)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Time Warner (now known as Charter) operates a cable system in Manhattan.  Under state law, Time Warner must set aside some channels on its cable system for public access.  New York City (the City) has designated a private nonprofit corporation named Manhattan Neighborhood Network, commonly referred to as MNN, to operate Time Warner's public access channels in Manhattan.  This case involves a complaint against MNN regarding its management of the public access channels.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because this case comes to us on a motion to dismiss, we accept the allegations in the complaint as true.  See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.\u00a0S. 662, 678 (2009).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DeeDee Halleck and Jesus Papoleto Melendez produced public access programming in Manhattan.  They made a film about MNN's alleged neglect of the East Harlem community.  Halleck submitted the film to MNN for airing on MNN's public access channels, and MNN later televised the film.  Afterwards, MNN fielded multiple complaints about the film's content.  In response, MNN temporarily suspended Halleck from using the public access channels.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Halleck and Melendez soon became embroiled in another dispute with MNN staff.  In the wake of that dispute, MNN ultimately suspended Halleck and Melendez from all MNN services and facilities.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Halleck and Melendez then sued MNN, among other parties, in Federal District Court.  The two producers claimed that MNN violated their First Amendment free-speech rights when MNN restricted their access to the public access channels because of the content of their film.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MNN moved to dismiss the producers' First Amendment claim on the ground that MNN is not a state actor and therefore is not subject to First Amendment restrictions on its editorial discretion.  The District Court agreed with MNN and dismissed the producers' First Amendment claim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Second Circuit reversed in relevant part.  882 F.\u00a03d 300, 308 (2018).  In the majority opinion authored by Judge Newman and joined by Judge Lohier, the court stated that the public access channels in Manhattan are a public forum for purposes of the First Amendment.  Reasoning that \"public forums are usually operated by governments,\" the court concluded that MNN is a state actor subject to First Amendment constraints.  Id., at 306-307.  Judge Lohier added a concurring opinion, explaining that MNN also qualifies as a state actor for the independent reason that \"New York City delegated to MNN the traditionally public function of administering and regulating speech in the public forum of Manhattan's public access channels.\"  Id., at 309.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge Jacobs dissented in relevant part, opining that MNN is not a state actor.  He reasoned that a private entity's operation of an open forum for speakers does not render the host entity a state actor.  Judge Jacobs further stated that the operation of public access channels is not a traditional, exclusive public function.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to resolve disagreement among the Courts of Appeals on the question whether private operators of public access cable channels are state actors subject to the First Amendment.  586 U.\u00a0S. __ (2018).  Compare 882 F.\u00a03d 300 (case below), with Wilcher v. Akron, 498 F.\u00a03d 516 (CA6 2007); and Alliance for Commu- nity Media v. FCC, 56 F.\u00a03d 105 (CADC 1995).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ratified in 1791, the First Amendment provides in relevant part that \"Congress shall make no law .\u00a0.\u00a0. abridging the freedom of speech.\"  Ratified in 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment makes the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause applicable against the States: \"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  \u00a71.  The text and original meaning of those Amendments, as well as this Court's longstanding precedents, establish that the Free Speech Clause prohibits only governmental abridgment of speech.  The Free Speech Clause does not prohibit private abridgment of speech.  See, e.g., Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U.\u00a0S. 727, 737 (1996) (plurality opinion); Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U.\u00a0S. 557, 566 (1995); Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.\u00a0S. 507, 513 (1976); cf. Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.\u00a0S. 241, 256 (1974).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accord with the text and structure of the Constitution, this Court's state-action doctrine distinguishes the government from individuals and private entities.  See Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Assn., 531 U.\u00a0S. 288, 295-296 (2001).  By enforcing that constitutional boundary between the governmental and the private, the state-action doctrine protects a robust sphere of individual liberty.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, the producers claim that MNN, a private entity, restricted their access to MNN's public access channels because of the content of the producers' film.  The producers have advanced a First Amendment claim against MNN.  The threshold problem with that First Amendment claim is a fundamental one: MNN is a private entity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Relying on this Court's state-action precedents, the producers assert that MNN is nonetheless a state actor subject to First Amendment constraints on its editorial discretion.  Under this Court's cases, a private entity can qualify as a state actor in a few limited circumstances--including, for example, (i)\u00a0when the private entity performs a traditional, exclusive public function, see, e.g., Jackson, 419 U.\u00a0S., at 352-354; (ii)\u00a0when the government compels the private entity to take a particular action, see, e.g., Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.\u00a0S. 991, 1004-1005 (1982); or (iii)\u00a0when the government acts jointly with the private entity, see, e.g., Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.\u00a0S. 922, 941-942 (1982).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The producers' primary argument here falls into the first category: The producers contend that MNN exercises a traditional, exclusive public function when it operates the public access channels on Time Warner's cable system in Manhattan.  We disagree.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the Court's cases, a private entity may qualify as a state actor when it exercises \"powers traditionally exclusively reserved to the State.\"  Jackson, 419 U.\u00a0S., at 352.  It is not enough that the federal, state, or local government exercised the function in the past, or still does.  And it is not enough that the function serves the public good or the public interest in some way.  Rather, to qualify as a traditional, exclusive public function within the meaning of our state-action precedents, the government must have traditionally and exclusively performed the function.  See Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.\u00a0S. 830, 842 (1982); Jackson, 419 U.\u00a0S., at 352-353; Evans v. Newton, 382 U.\u00a0S. 296, 300 (1966).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has stressed that \"very few\" functions fall into that category.  Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks, 436 U.\u00a0S. 149, 158 (1978).  Under the Court's cases, those functions include, for example, running elections and operating a company town.  See Terry v. Adams, 345 U.\u00a0S. 461, 468-470 (1953) (elections); Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.\u00a0S. 501, 505-509 (1946) (company town); Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.\u00a0S. 649, 662-666 (1944) (elections); Nixon v. Condon, 286 U.\u00a0S. 73, 84-89 (1932) (elections).1  The Court has ruled that a variety of functions do not fall into that category, including, for example: running sports associations and leagues, administering insurance payments, operating nursing homes, providing special education, representing indigent criminal defendants, resolving private disputes, and supplying electricity.  See American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.\u00a0S. 40, 55-57 (1999) (insurance payments); National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Tarkanian, 488 U.\u00a0S. 179, 197, n.\u00a018 (1988) (college sports); San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483 U.\u00a0S. 522, 544-545 (1987) (amateur sports); Blum, 457 U.\u00a0S., at 1011-1012 (nursing home); Rendell-Baker, 457 U.\u00a0S., at 842 (special education); Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.\u00a0S. 312, 318-319 (1981) (public defender); Flagg Bros., 436 U.\u00a0S., at 157-163 (private dispute resolution); Jackson, 419 U.\u00a0S., at 352-354 (electric service).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The relevant function in this case is operation of public access channels on a cable system.  That function has  not traditionally and exclusively been performed by  government.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the 1970s, when public access channels became a regular feature on cable systems, a variety of private and public actors have operated public access channels, including: private cable operators; private nonprofit organizations; municipalities; and other public and private community organizations such as churches, schools, and libraries.  See Denver Area, 518 U.\u00a0S., at 761-762 (plurality opinion); R. Oringel & S. Buske, The Access Manager's Handbook: A Guide for Managing Community Television 14-17 (1987).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The history of public access channels in Manhattan further illustrates the point.  In 1971, public access channels first started operating in Manhattan.  See D. Brenner, M. Price, & M. Meyerson, Cable Television and Other Nonbroadcast Video \u00a76:29, p.\u00a06-47 (2018).  Those early Manhattan public access channels were operated in large part by private cable operators, with some help from private nonprofit organizations.  See G. Gillespie, Public Access Cable Television in the United States and Canada 37-38 (1975); Janes, History and Structure of Public Access Television, 39 J. Film & Video, No. 3, pp. 15-17 (1987).  Those private cable operators continued to operate the public access channels until the early 1990s, when MNN (also a private entity) began to operate the public access channels.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, operating public access channels on a cable system is not a traditional, exclusive public function within the meaning of this Court's cases.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To avoid that conclusion, the producers widen the lens and contend that the relevant function here is not simply the operation of public access channels on a cable system, but rather is more generally the operation of a public forum for speech.  And according to the producers, operation of a public forum for speech is a traditional, exclusive public function.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That analysis mistakenly ignores the threshold state-action question.  When the government provides a forum for speech (known as a public forum), the government may be constrained by the First Amendment, meaning that the government ordinarily may not exclude speech or speakers from the forum on the basis of viewpoint, or sometimes even on the basis of content.  See, e.g., Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.\u00a0S. 546, 547, 555 (1975) (private theater leased to the city); Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.\u00a0S. 92, 93, 96 (1972) (sidewalks); Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, 307 U.\u00a0S. 496, 515-516 (1939) (streets and parks).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, when a private entity provides a forum for speech, the private entity is not ordinarily constrained by the First Amendment because the private entity is not a state actor.  The private entity may thus exercise editorial discretion over the speech and speakers in the forum.  This Court so ruled in its 1976 decision in Hudgens v. NLRB.  There, the Court held that a shopping center owner is not a state actor subject to First Amendment requirements such as the public forum doctrine.  424 U.\u00a0S., at 520-521; see also Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U.\u00a0S. 551, 569-570 (1972); Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U.\u00a0S. 539, 547 (1972); Alliance for Community Media, 56 F.\u00a03d, at 121-123.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Hudgens decision reflects a commonsense principle: Providing some kind of forum for speech is not an activity that only governmental entities have traditionally performed.  Therefore, a private entity who provides a forum for speech is not transformed by that fact alone into a state actor.  After all, private property owners and private lessees often open their property for speech.  Grocery stores put up community bulletin boards.  Comedy clubs host open mic nights.  As Judge Jacobs persuasively explained, it \"is not at all a near-exclusive function of the state to provide the forums for public expression, politics, information, or entertainment.\"  882 F.\u00a03d, at 311 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, merely hosting speech by others is not a traditional, exclusive public function and does not alone transform private entities into state actors subject to First Amendment constraints.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the rule were otherwise, all private property owners and private lessees who open their property for speech would be subject to First Amendment constraints and would lose the ability to exercise what they deem to be appropriate editorial discretion within that open forum.  Private property owners and private lessees would face the unappetizing choice of allowing all comers or closing the platform altogether.  \"The Constitution by no means requires such an attenuated doctrine of dedication of private property to public use.\"  Hudgens, 424 U.\u00a0S., at 519 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Benjamin Franklin did not have to operate his newspaper as \"a stagecoach, with seats for everyone.\"  F. Mott, American Journalism 55 (3d ed. 1962).  That principle still holds true.  As the Court said in Hudgens, to hold that private property owners providing a forum for speech are constrained by the First Amendment would be \"to create a court-made law wholly disregarding the constitutional basis on which private ownership of property rests in this country.\"  424 U.\u00a0S., at 517 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Constitution does not disable private property owners and private lessees from exercising editorial discretion over speech and speakers on their property.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The producers here are seeking in effect to circumvent this Court's case law, including Hudgens.  But Hudgens is sound, and we therefore reaffirm our holding in that case.3\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, the producers retort that this case differs from Hudgens because New York City has designated MNN to operate the public access channels on Time Warner's cable system, and because New York State heavily regulates MNN with respect to the public access channels.  Under this Court's cases, however, those facts do not establish that MNN is a state actor.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0New York City's designation of MNN to operate the public access channels is analogous to a government license, a government contract, or a government-granted monopoly.  But as the Court has long held, the fact that the government licenses, contracts with, or grants a monopoly to a private entity does not convert the private entity into a state actor--unless the private entity is performing a traditional, exclusive public function.  See, e.g., San Francisco Arts & Athletics, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 543-544 (exclusive-use rights and corporate charters); Blum, 457 U.\u00a0S., at 1011 (licenses); Rendell-Baker, 457 U.\u00a0S., at 840-841 (contracts); Polk County, 454 U.\u00a0S., at 319, n.\u00a09, and 320-322 (law licenses); Jackson, 419 U.\u00a0S., at 351-352 (electric monopolies); Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, 412 U.\u00a0S. 94, 120-121 (1973) (broadcast licenses); Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.\u00a0S. 163, 176-177 (1972) (liquor licenses); cf. Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 638-639 (1819) (corporate charters).  The same principle applies if the government funds or subsidizes a private entity.  See Blum, 457 U.\u00a0S., at 1011; Rendell-Baker, 457 U.\u00a0S., at 840.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Numerous private entities in America obtain government licenses, government contracts, or government-granted monopolies.  If those facts sufficed to transform a private entity into a state actor, a large swath of private entities in America would suddenly be turned into state actors and be subject to a variety of constitutional constraints on their activities.  As this Court's many state-action cases amply demonstrate, that is not the law.  Here, therefore, the City's designation of MNN to operate the public access channels on Time Warner's cable system does not make MNN a state actor.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So, too, New York State's extensive regulation of MNN's operation of the public access channels does not make MNN a state actor.  Under the State's regulations, air time on the public access channels must be free, and programming must be aired on a first-come, first-served basis.  Those regulations restrict MNN's editorial discretion and in effect require MNN to operate almost like a common carrier.  But under this Court's cases, those restrictions do not render MNN a state actor.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., the leading case on point, the Court stated that the \"fact that a business is subject to state regulation does not by itself convert its action into that of the State.\"  419 U.\u00a0S., at 350.  In that case, the Court held that \"a heavily regulated, privately owned utility, enjoying at least a partial monopoly in the providing of electrical service within its territory,\" was not a state actor.  Id., at 358.  The Court explained that the \"mere existence\" of a \"regulatory scheme\"--even if \"extensive and detailed\"--did not render the utility a state actor.  Id., at 350, and n.\u00a07.  Nor did it matter whether the State had authorized the utility to provide electric service to the community, or whether the utility was the only entity providing electric service to much of that community.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case closely parallels Jackson.  Like the electric utility in Jackson, MNN is \"a heavily regulated, privately owned\" entity.  Id., at 358.  As in Jackson, the regulations do not transform the regulated private entity into a state actor.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Put simply, being regulated by the State does not make one a state actor.  See Sullivan, 526 U.\u00a0S., at 52; Blum, 457 U.\u00a0S., at 1004; Rendell-Baker, 457 U.\u00a0S., at 841-842; Jackson, 419 U.\u00a0S., at 350; Moose Lodge, 407 U.\u00a0S., at 176-177.  As the Court's cases have explained, the \"being heavily regulated makes you a state actor\" theory of state action is entirely circular and would significantly endanger individual liberty and private enterprise.  The theory would be especially problematic in the speech context, because it could eviscerate certain private entities' rights to exercise editorial control over speech and speakers on their properties or platforms.  Not surprisingly, as Justice Thomas has pointed out, this Court has \"never even hinted that regulatory control, and particularly direct regulatory control over a private entity's First Amendment speech rights,\" could justify subjecting the regulated private entity to the constraints of the First Amendment.  Denver Area, 518 U.\u00a0S., at 829 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, we conclude that MNN is not subject to First Amendment constraints on how it exercises its editorial discretion with respect to the public access channels.  To be sure, MNN is subject to state-law constraints on its editorial discretion (assuming those state laws do not violate a federal statute or the Constitution).  If MNN violates those state laws, or violates any applicable contracts, MNN could perhaps face state-law sanctions or liability of some kind.  We of course take no position on any potential state-law questions.  We simply conclude that MNN, as a private actor, is not subject to First Amendment constraints on how it exercises editorial discretion over the speech and speakers on its public access channels.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps recognizing the problem with their argument that MNN is a state actor under ordinary state-action principles applicable to private entities and private property, the producers alternatively contend that the public access channels are actually the property of New York City, not the property of Time Warner or MNN.  On this theory, the producers say (and the dissent agrees) that MNN is in essence simply managing government property on behalf of New York City.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The short answer to that argument is that the public access channels are not the property of New York City.  Nothing in the record here suggests that a government (federal, state, or city) owns or leases either the cable system or the public access channels at issue here.  Both Time Warner and MNN are private entities.  Time Warner is the cable operator, and it owns its cable network, which contains the public access channels.  MNN operates those public access channels with its own facilities and equipment.  The City does not own or lease the public access channels, and the City does not possess a formal easement or other property interest in those channels.  The franchise agreements between the City and Time Warner do not say that the City has any property interest in the public access channels.  On the contrary, the franchise agreements expressly place the public access channels \"under the jurisdiction\" of MNN.  App. 22.  Moreover, the producers did not allege in their complaint that the City has a property interest in the channels.  And the producers have not cited any basis in state law for such a conclusion.  Put simply, the City does not have \"any formal easement or other property interest in those channels.\"  Denver Area, 518 U.\u00a0S., at 828 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It does not matter that a provision in the franchise agreements between the City and Time Warner allowed the City to designate a private entity to operate the public access channels on Time Warner's cable system.  Time Warner still owns the cable system.  And MNN still operates the public access channels.  To reiterate, nothing in the franchise agreements suggests that the City possesses any property interest in Time Warner's cable system, or in the public access channels on that system.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that the City has allowed the cable operator, Time Warner, to lay cable along public rights-of-way in the City.  But Time Warner's access to public rights-of-way does not alter the state-action analysis.  For Time Warner, as for other cable operators, access to public rights-of-way is essential to lay cable and construct a physical cable infrastructure.  See Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.\u00a0S. 622, 628 (1994).  But the same is true for utility providers, such as the electric utility in Jackson.  Put simply, a private entity's permission from government to use public rights-of-way does not render that private entity a state actor.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having said all that, our point here should not be read too broadly.  Under the laws in certain States, including New York, a local government may decide to itself operate the public access channels on a local cable system (as many local governments in New York State and around the country already do), or could take appropriate steps to obtain a property interest in the public access channels.  Depending on the circumstances, the First Amendment might then constrain the local government's operation of the public access channels.  We decide only the case before us in light of the record before us.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is sometimes said that the bigger the government, the smaller the individual.  Consistent with the text of the Constitution, the state-action doctrine enforces a critical boundary between the government and the individual, and thereby protects a robust sphere of individual liberty.  Expanding the state-action doctrine beyond its traditional boundaries would expand governmental control while restricting individual liberty and private enterprise.  We decline to do so in this case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MNN is a private entity that operates public access channels on a cable system.  Operating public access channels on a cable system is not a traditional, exclusive public function.  A private entity such as MNN who opens its property for speech by others is not transformed by that fact alone into a state actor.  Under the text of the Constitution and our precedents, MNN is not a state actor subject to the First Amendment.  We reverse in relevant part the judgment of the Second Circuit, and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nSotomayor, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1702\nMANHATTAN COMMUNITY ACCESS CORPORATION, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v.

I write to address the one that is.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is a case about an organization appointed by the government to administer a constitutional public forum.  (It is not, as the Court suggests, about a private property owner that simply opened up its property to others.)  New York City (the City) secured a property interest in public-access television channels when it granted a cable franchise to a cable company.  State regulations require those public-access channels to be made open to the public on terms that render them a public forum.  The City contracted out the administration of that forum to a private organization, petitioner Manhattan Community Access Corporation (MNN).  By accepting that agency relationship, MNN stepped into the City's shoes and thus qualifies as a state actor, subject to the First Amendment like any other.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A cable-television franchise is, essentially, a license to create a system for distributing cable TV in a certain area.  It is a valuable right, usually conferred on a private company by a local government.  See 47 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7522(9)-(10), 541(a)(2), (b)(1); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.\u00a0S. 622, 628 (1994).  A private company cannot enter a local cable market without one.  \u00a7541(b)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cable companies transmit content through wires that stretch \"between a transmission facility and the television sets of individual subscribers.\"  Id., at 627-628.  Creating this network of wires is a disruptive undertaking that \"entails the use of public rights-of-way and easements.\"  Id., at 628.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0New York State authorizes municipalities to grant cable franchises to cable companies of a certain size only if those companies agree to set aside at least one public access channel.  16 N.\u00a0Y. Codes, Rules & Regs. \u00a7\u00a7895.1(f), 895.4(b)(1) (2016).  New York then requires that those public-access channels be open to all comers on \"a first-come, first-served, nondiscriminatory basis.\"  \u00a7895.4(c)(4).  Likewise, the State prohibits both cable franchisees and local governments from \"exercis[ing] any editorial control\" over the channels, aside from regulating obscenity and other unprotected content.  \u00a7\u00a7895.4(c)(8)-(9).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Years ago, New York City (no longer a party to this suit) and Time Warner Entertainment Company (never a party to this suit) entered into a cable-franchise agreement.  App. 22.  Time Warner received a cable franchise; the City received public-access channels.  The agreement also provided that the public-access channels would be operated by an independent, nonprofit corporation chosen by the Manhattan borough president.  But the City, as the practice of other New York municipalities confirms, could have instead chosen to run the channels itself.  See \u00a7895.4(c)(1); Brief for Respondents 35 (citing examples).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MNN is the independent nonprofit that the borough president appointed to run the channels; indeed, MNN appears to have been incorporated in 1991 for that precise purpose, with seven initial board members selected by the borough president (though only two thus selected today).  See App. 23; Brief for Respondents 7, n.\u00a01.  The City arranged for MNN to receive startup capital from Time Warner and to be funded through franchise fees from Time Warner and other Manhattan cable franchisees.  App. 23; Brief for New York County Lawyers Association (NYCLA) as Amicus Curiae 27; see also App. to Brief for Respondents 19a.  As the borough president announced upon MNN's formation in 1991, MNN's \"central charge is to administer and manage all the public access channels of the cable television systems in Manhattan.\"  App. to Brief for NYCLA as Amicus Curiae 1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As relevant here, respondents DeeDee Halleck and Jesus Papoleto Melendez sued MNN in U.\u00a0S. District Court for the Southern District of New York under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983.  They alleged that the public-access channels, \"[r]equired by state regulation and [the] local franchise agreements,\" are \"a designated public forum of unlimited character\"; that the City had \"delegated control of that public forum to MNN\"; and that MNN had, in turn, engaged in viewpoint discrimination in violation of respondents' First Amendment rights.  App. 39.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court dismissed respondents' First Amendment claim against MNN.  The U.\u00a0S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed that dismissal, concluding that the public-access channels \"are public forums and that [MNN's] employees were sufficiently alleged to be state actors taking action barred by the First Amendment.\"  882 F.\u00a03d 300, 301-302 (2018).   Because the case before us arises from a motion to dismiss, respondents' factual allegations must be accepted as true.  Hernandez v. Mesa, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (\u00a0per curiam) (slip op., at 1).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would affirm the judgment below.  The channels are clearly a public forum: The City has a property interest in them, and New York regulations require that access to those channels be kept open to all.  And because the City (1) had a duty to provide that public forum once it granted a cable franchise and (2) had a duty to abide by the First Amendment once it provided that forum, those obligations did not evaporate when the City delegated the administration of that forum to a private entity.  Just as the City would have been subject to the First Amendment had it chosen to run the forum itself, MNN assumed the same responsibility when it accepted the delegation.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a person alleges a violation of the right to free speech, courts generally must consider not only what was said but also in what context it was said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the one hand, there are \"public forums,\" or settings that the government has opened in some way for speech by the public (or some subset of it).  The Court's precedents subdivide this broader category into various subcategories, with the level of leeway for government regulation of speech varying accordingly.  See Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 7).  Compare Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.\u00a0S. 474, 480 (1988) (streets and public parks, traditional public forums), with Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.\u00a0S. 546, 555 (1975) (city-leased theater, designated public forum), with Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal., Hastings College of Law v. Martinez, 561 U.\u00a0S. 661, 669, 679, and n. 12 (2010) (program for registered student organizations, limited public forum).  But while many cases turn on which type of \"forum\" is implicated, the important point here is that viewpoint discrimination is impermissible in them all.  See Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U.\u00a0S. 98, 106 (2001).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, there are contexts that do not fall under the \"forum\" rubric.  For one, there are contexts in which the government is simply engaging in its own speech and thus has freedom to select the views it prefers.  See, e.g., Walker v. Texas Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc., 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2015) (slip op., at 6-7) (specialty license plates); Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.\u00a0S. 460, 467-469, 481 (2009) (privately donated permanent monuments in a public park).1  In addition, there are purely private spaces, where the First Amendment is (as relevant here) inapplicable.  The First Amendment leaves a private store owner (or homeowner), for example, free to remove a customer (or dinner guest) for expressing unwanted views.  See, e.g., Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U.\u00a0S. 551, 569-570 (1972).  In these settings, there is no First Amendment right against viewpoint discrimination.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, respondents alleged viewpoint discrimination.  App. 39.  So a key question in this case concerns what the Manhattan public-access channels are: a public forum of some kind, in which a claim alleging viewpoint discrimination would be cognizable, or something else, such as government speech or purely private property, where picking favored viewpoints is appropriately commonplace.2  Neither MNN nor the majority suggests that this is an instance of government speech.  This case thus turns first and foremost on whether the public-access channels are or are not purely private property.3\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has not defined precisely what kind of governmental property interest (if any) is necessary for a public forum to exist.  See Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U.\u00a0S. 788, 801 (1985) (\"a speaker must seek access to public property or to private property dedicated to public use\").  But see ante, at 11, n.\u00a03 (appearing to reject the phrase \"private property dedicated to public use\" as \"passing dicta\").  I assume for the sake of argument in this case that public-forum analysis is inappropriate where the government lacks a \"significant property interest consistent with the communicative purpose of the forum.\"  Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U.\u00a0S. 727, 829 (1996) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such an interest is present here.  As described above, New York State required the City to obtain public-access channels from Time Warner in exchange for awarding a cable franchise.  See supra, at 2.  The exclusive right to use these channels (and, as necessary, Time Warner's infrastructure) qualifies as a property interest, akin at the very least to an easement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The last time this Court considered a case centering on public-access channels, five Justices described an interest like the one here as similar to an easement.  Although Justice Breyer did not conclude that a public-access channel was indeed a public forum, he likened the cable company's agreement to reserve such channels \"to the reservation of a public easement, or a dedication of land for streets and parks, as part of a municipality's approval of a subdivision of land.\"  Denver Area, 518 U.\u00a0S., at 760-761 (joined by Stevens and Souter, JJ.).  And Justice Kennedy observed not only that an easement would be an appropriate analogy, id., at 793-794 (opinion concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part, joined by Ginsburg, J.), but also that \"[p]ublic access channels meet the definition of a public forum,\" id., at 791, \"even though they operate over property to which the cable operator holds title,\" id., at 792; see also id., at 792-793 (noting that the entire cable system's existence stems from the municipality's decision to grant the franchise).  What those five Justices suggested in 1996 remains true today.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A common idiom describes property as a 'bundle\u00a0of\u00a0sticks'--a collection of individual rights which, in certain combinations, constitute property.\"  United States v. Craft, 535 U.\u00a0S. 274, 278 (2002).  Rights to exclude and to use are two of the most crucial sticks in the bundle.  See id., at 283.  \"State law determines .\u00a0.\u00a0. which sticks are in a person's bundle,\" id., at 278, and therefore defining property itself is a state-law exercise.4  As for whether there is a sufficient property interest to trigger First Amendment forum analysis, related precedents show that there is.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted above, there is no disputing that Time Warner owns the wires themselves.  See Turner, 512 U.\u00a0S., at 628.  If the wires were a road, it would be easy to define the public's right to walk on it as an easement.  See, e.g., In re India Street, 29 N.\u00a0Y. 2d 97, 100-103, 272 N.\u00a0E 2d 518, 518-520 (1971).  Similarly, if the wires were a theater, there would be no question that a government's long-term lease to use it would be sufficient for public-forum purposes.  Southeastern Promotions, 420 U.\u00a0S., at 547, 555.  But some may find this case more complicated because the wires are not a road or a theater that one can physically occupy; they are a conduit for transmitting signals that appear as television channels.  In other words, the question is how to understand the right to place content on those channels using those wires.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The right to convey expressive content using someone else's physical infrastructure is not new.  To give another low-tech example, imagine that one company owns a billboard and another rents space on that billboard.  The renter can have a property interest in placing content on the billboard for the lease term even though it does not own the billboard itself.  See, e.g., Naegele Outdoor Advertising Co. of Minneapolis v. Lakeville, 532 N.\u00a0W. 2d 249, 253 (Minn. 1995); see also Matter of XAR Corp. v. Di Donato, 76 App. Div. 2d 972, 973, 429 N.\u00a0Y.\u00a0S. 2d 59, 60 (1980) (\"Although invariably labeled 'leases,' agreements to erect advertising signs or to place signs on walls or fences are easements in gross\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same principle should operate in this higher tech realm.  Just as if the channels were a billboard, the City obtained rights for exclusive use of the channels by the public for the foreseeable future; no one is free to take the channels away, short of a contract renegotiation.  Cf. Craft, 535 U.\u00a0S., at 283.  The City also obtained the right to administer, or delegate the administration of, the channels.  The channels are more intangible than a billboard, but no one believes that a right must be tangible to qualify as a property interest.  See, e.g., Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.\u00a0S. 40, 48-49 (1960) (treating destruction of valid liens as a taking); Adams Express Co. v. Ohio State Auditor, 166 U.\u00a0S. 185, 219 (1897) (treating \"privileges, corporate franchises, contracts or obligations\" as taxable property).  And it is hardly unprecedented for a government to receive a right to transmit something over a private entity's infrastructure in exchange for conferring something of value on that private entity; examples go back at least as far as the 1800s.5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do not suggest that the government always obtains a property interest in public-access channels created by franchise agreements.  But the arrangement here is consistent with what the Court would treat as a governmental property interest in other contexts.  New York City gave Time Warner the right to lay wires and sell cable TV.  In exchange, the City received an exclusive right to send its own signal over Time Warner's infrastructure--no different than receiving a right to place ads on another's billboards.  Those rights amount to a governmental property interest in the channels, and that property interest is clearly \"consistent with the communicative purpose of the forum,\" Denver Area, 518 U.\u00a0S., at 829 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  Indeed, it is the right to transmit the very content to which New York law grants the public open and equal access.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the question of a governmental property interest resolved, it should become clear that the public-access channels are a public forum.6  Outside of classic examples like sidewalks and parks, a public forum exists only where the government has deliberately opened up the setting for speech by at least a subset of the public.  Cornelius, 473 U.\u00a0S., at 802.  \"Accordingly, the Court has looked to the policy and practice of the government,\" as well as the nature of the property itself, \"to ascertain whether it intended to designate a place not traditionally open to assembly and debate as a public forum.\"  See ibid.  For example, a state college might make its facilities open to student groups, or a municipality might open up an auditorium for certain public meetings.  See id., at 802-803.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The requisite governmental intent is manifest here.  As noted above, New York State regulations require that the channels be made available to the public \"on a first-come, first-served, nondiscriminatory basis.\"  16 N.\u00a0Y. Codes, Rules & Regs. \u00a7895.4(c)(4); see also \u00a7\u00a7895.4(c)(8)-(9).  The State, in other words, mandates that the doors be wide open for public expression.  MNN's contract with Time Warner follows suit.  App. 23.  And that is essentially how MNN itself describes things.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 9 (\"We do not prescreen videos.  We--they come into the door.  We put them on the air\").7  These regulations \"evidenc[e] a clear intent to create a public forum.\"  Cornelius, 473 U.\u00a0S., at 802.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If New York's public-access channels are a public forum, it follows that New York cannot evade the First Amendment by contracting out administration of that forum to a private agent.  When MNN took on the responsibility of administering the forum, it stood in the City's shoes and became a state actor for purposes of 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This conclusion follows from the Court's decision in West v. Atkins, 487 U.\u00a0S. 42 (1988).  The Court in West unanimously held that a doctor hired to provide medical care to state prisoners was a state actor for purposes of \u00a71983.  Id., at 54; see also id., at 58 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Each State must provide medical care to prisoners, the Court explained, id., at 54, and when a State hires a private doctor to do that job, the doctor becomes a state actor, \"\u00a0'clothed with the authority of state law,'\u00a0\" id., at 55.  If a doctor hired by the State abuses his role, the harm is \"caused, in the sense relevant for state-action inquiry,\" by the State's having incarcerated the prisoner and put his medical care in that doctor's hands.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact that the doctor was a private contractor, the Court emphasized, made no difference.  Ibid.  It was \"the physician's function within the state system,\" not his private-contractor status, that determined whether his conduct could \"fairly be attributed to the State.\"  Id., at 55-56.  Once the State imprisoned the plaintiff, it owed him duties under the Eighth Amendment; once the State delegated those duties to a private doctor, the doctor became a state actor.  See ibid.; see also id., at 56-57.  If the rule were any different, a State would \"\u00a0'be free to contract out all services which it is constitutionally obligated to provide and leave its citizens with no means for vindication of those rights, whose protection has been delegated to 'private' actors, when they have been denied.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 56, n.\u00a014.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0West resolves this case.  Although the settings are different, the legal features are the same: When a government (1) makes a choice that triggers constitutional obligations, and then (2) contracts out those constitutional responsibilities to a private entity, that entity--in agreeing to take on the job--becomes a state actor for purposes of \u00a71983.8 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not all acts of governmental delegation necessarily trigger constitutional obligations, but this one did.  New York State regulations required the City to secure public-access channels if it awarded a cable franchise.  16 N.\u00a0Y. Codes, Rules & Regs. \u00a7895.4(b)(1).  The City did award a cable franchise.  The State's regulations then required the City to make the channels it obtained available on a \"first-come, first-served, nondiscriminatory basis.\"9  \u00a7895.4(c)(4).  That made the channels a public forum.  See supra, at 9-10.  Opening a public forum, in turn, entailed First Amendment obligations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The City could have done the job itself, but it instead delegated that job to a private entity, MNN.  MNN could have said no, but it said yes.  (Indeed, it appears to exist entirely to do this job.)  By accepting the job, MNN accepted the City's responsibilities.  See West, 487 U.\u00a0S., at 55. The First Amendment does not fall silent simply because a government hands off the administration of its constitutional duties to a private actor.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority acknowledges that the First Amendment could apply when a local government either (1) has a property interest in public-access channels or (2) is more directly involved in administration of those channels than the City is here.  Ante, at 15.  And it emphasizes that it \"decide[s] only the case before us in light of the record before us.\"  Ibid.  These case-specific qualifiers sharply limit the immediate effect of the majority's decision, but that decision is still meaningfully wrong in two ways.  First, the majority erroneously decides the property question against the plaintiffs as a matter of law.  Second, and more fundamentally, the majority mistakes a case about the government choosing to hand off responsibility to an agent for a case about a private entity that simply enters a marketplace.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority's explanation for why there is no governmental property interest here, ante, at 14-15, does not hold up.  The majority focuses on the fact that \"[b]oth Time Warner and MNN are private entities\"; that Time Warner \"owns its cable network, which contains the public access channels\"; and that \"MNN operates those public access channels with its own facilities and equipment.\"  Ante, at 14; see also ante, at 15.  Those considerations cannot resolve this case.  The issue is not who owns the cable network or that MNN uses its own property to operate the channels.  The key question, rather, is whether the channels themselves are purely private property.  An advertiser may not own a billboard, but that does not mean that its long-term lease is not a property interest.  See supra, at 8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority also says that \"[n]othing in the record here suggests that a government .\u00a0.\u00a0. owns or leases either the cable system or the public access channels at issue here.\"  Ante, at 14.  But the cable system itself is irrelevant, and, as explained above, the details of the exchange that yielded Time Warner's cable franchise suggest a governmental property interest in the channels.  See supra, at 6-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority observes that \"the franchise agreements expressly place the public access channels 'under the jurisdiction' of MNN,\" ante, at 14, but that language simply describes the City's appointment of MNN to administer the channels.  The majority also chides respondents for failing to \"alleg[e] in their complaint that the City has a property interest in the channels,\" ibid., but, fairly read, respondents' complaint includes such an assertion.10  In any event, any ambiguity or imprecision does not justify resolving the case against respondents at the motion-to-dismiss stage.  To the extent the majority has doubts about respondents' complaint--or factual or state-law issues that may bear upon the existence of a property interest--the more prudent course would be to vacate and remand for the lower courts to consider those matters more fully.  In any event, as I have explained, the best course of all would be to affirm.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More fundamentally, the majority's opinion erroneously fixates on a type of case that is not before us: one in which a private entity simply enters the marketplace and is then subject to government regulation.  The majority swings hard at the wrong pitch.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority focuses on Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.\u00a0S. 345 (1974), which is a paradigmatic example of a line of cases that reject \u00a71983 liability for private actors that simply operate against a regulatory backdrop.  Jackson emphasized that the \"fact that a business is subject to state regulation does not by itself convert its action into that of the State.\"  Id., at 350; accord, ante, at 12.  Thus, the fact that a utility company entered the marketplace did not make it a state actor, even if it was highly regulated.  See Jackson, 419 U.\u00a0S., at 358; accord, ante, at 12-13.  The same rule holds, of course, for private comedy clubs and grocery stores.  See ante, at 9.11\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Jackson line of cases is inapposite here.  MNN is not a private entity that simply ventured into the marketplace.  It occupies its role because it was asked to do so by the City, which secured the public-access channels in exchange for giving up public rights of way, opened those channels up (as required by the State) as a public forum, and then deputized MNN to administer them.  That distinguishes MNN from a private entity that simply sets up shop against a regulatory backdrop.  To say that MNN is nothing more than a private organization regulated by the government is like saying that a waiter at a restaurant is an independent food seller who just happens to be highly regulated by the restaurant's owners.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority also relies on the Court's statements that its \"public function\" test requires that a function have been \"traditionally and exclusively performed\" by the government.  Ante, at 6 (emphasis deleted); see Jackson, 419 U.\u00a0S., at 352.  Properly understood, that rule cabins liability in cases, such as Jackson, in which a private actor ventures of its own accord into territory shared (or regulated) by the government (e.g., by opening a power company or a shopping center).  The Court made clear in West that the rule did not reach further, explaining that \"the fact that a state employee's role parallels one in the private sector\" does not preclude a finding of state action.  487 U.\u00a0S., at 56, n.\u00a015.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the government hires an agent, in other words, the question is not whether it hired the agent to do something that can be done in the private marketplace too.  If that were the key question, the doctor in West would not have been a state actor.  Nobody thinks that orthopedics is a function \"traditionally exclusively reserved to the State,\" Jackson, 419 U.\u00a0S., at 352.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority consigns West to a footnote, asserting that its \"scenario is not present here because the government has no [constitutional] obligation to operate public access channels.\"  Ante, at 7, n.\u00a01.  The majority suggests that West is different because \"the State was constitutionally obligated to provide medical care to prison inmates.\"  Ante, at 7, n.\u00a01.  But what the majority ignores is that the State in West had no constitutional obligation to open the prison or incarcerate the prisoner in the first place; the obligation to provide medical care arose when it made those prior choices.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The City had a comparable constitutional obligation here--one brought about by its own choices, made against a state-law backdrop.  The City, of course, had no constitutional obligation to award a cable franchise or to operate public-access channels.  But once the City did award a cable franchise, New York law required the City to obtain public-access channels, see supra, at 2, and to open them up as a public forum, see supra, at 9-10.  That is when the City's obligation to act in accordance with the First Amendment with respect to the channels arose.  That is why, when the City handed the administration of that forum off to an agent, the Constitution followed.  See supra, at 10-13.12\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority is surely correct that \"when a private entity provides a forum for speech, the private entity is not ordinarily constrained by the First Amendment.\"  Ante, at 9.  That is because the majority is not talking about constitutional forums--it is talking about spaces where private entities have simply invited others to come speak.  A comedy club can decide to open its doors as wide as it wants, but it cannot appoint itself as a government agent.  The difference is between providing a service of one's own accord and being asked by the government to administer a constitutional responsibility (indeed, here, existing to do so) on the government's behalf.13\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To see more clearly the difference between the cases on which the majority fixates and the present case, leave aside the majority's private comedy club.  Imagine instead that a state college runs a comedy showcase each year, renting out a local theater and, pursuant to state regulations mandating open access to certain kinds of student activities, allowing students to sign up to perform on a first-come, first-served basis.  Cf. Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.\u00a0S. 819 (1995).  After a few years, the college decides that it is tired of running the show, so it hires a performing-arts nonprofit to do the job.  The nonprofit prefers humor that makes fun of a certain political party, so it allows only student acts that share its views to participate.  Does the majority believe that the nonprofit is indistinguishable, for purposes of state action, from a private comedy club opened by local entrepreneurs?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I hope not.  But two dangers lurk here regardless.  On the one hand, if the City's decision to outsource the channels to a private entity did render the First Amendment irrelevant, there would be substantial cause to worry about the potential abuses that could follow.  Can a state university evade the First Amendment by hiring a nonprofit to apportion funding to student groups?  Can a city do the same by appointing a corporation to run a municipal theater?  What about its parks?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, the majority hastens to qualify its decision, see ante, at 7, n.\u00a01, 15, and to cabin it to the specific facts of this case, ante, at 15.  Those are prudent limitations.  Even so, the majority's focus on Jackson still risks sowing confusion among the lower courts about how and when government outsourcing will render any abuses that follow beyond the reach of the Constitution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, there should be no confusion here.  MNN is not a private entity that ventured into the marketplace and found itself subject to government regulation.  It was asked to do a job by the government and compensated accordingly.  If it does not want to do that job anymore, it can stop (subject, like any other entity, to its contractual obligations).  But as long as MNN continues to wield the power it was given by the government, it stands in the government's shoes and must abide by the First Amendment like any other government actor.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is not a case about bigger governments and smaller individuals, ante, at 16; it is a case about principals and agents.  New York City opened up a public forum on public-access channels in which it has a property interest.  It asked MNN to run that public forum, and MNN accepted the job.  That makes MNN subject to the First Amendment, just as if the City had decided to run the public forum itself.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the majority emphasizes that its decision is narrow and factbound, ante, at 15, that does not make it any less misguided.  It is crucial that the Court does not continue to ignore the reality, fully recognized by our precedents, that private actors who have been delegated constitutional responsibilities like this one should be accountable to the Constitution's demands.  I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Relatedly, this Court has recognized that a private entity may, under certain circumstances, be deemed a state actor when the government has outsourced one of its constitutional obligations to a private entity.  In West v. Atkins, for example, the State was constitutionally obligated to provide medical care to prison inmates.  487 U.\u00a0S. 42, 56 (1988).  That scenario is not present here because the government has no such obligation to operate public access channels.\nFootnote 2\u00a0A distinct question not raised here is the degree to which the First Amendment protects private entities such as Time Warner or MNN from government legislation or regulation requiring those private entities to open their property for speech by others.  Cf. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.\u00a0S. 622, 636-637 (1994).\nFootnote 3\u00a0In Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Inc., this Court said in passing dicta that \"a speaker must seek access to public property or to private property dedicated to public use to evoke First Amendment concerns.\"  473 U.\u00a0S. 788, 801 (1985).  But Cornelius dealt with government-owned property.  As Justice Thomas explained in Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, the Court's admittedly imprecise and overbroad phrase in Cornelius is not consistent with this Court's case law and should not be read to suggest that private property owners or private lessees are subject to First Amendment constraints whenever they dedicate their private property to public use or otherwise open their property for speech.  518 U.\u00a0S. 727, 827-828 (1996) (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0That does not mean that no restrictions apply at all to the government's expression in such spaces, but it does mean that the government can pick and choose among different views.  See Walker, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___, ___-___ (slip op., at 6, 17-18); Summum, 555 U.\u00a0S., at 468.\nFootnote 2\u00a0The channels are not, of course, a physical place.  Under the Court's precedents, that makes no difference: Regardless of whether something \"is a forum more in a metaphysical than in a spatial or geographic sense, .\u00a0.\u00a0. the same principles are applicable.\"  Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.\u00a0S. 819, 830 (1995) (treating \"Student Activities Fund\" as the forum at issue and citing cases in which a school's mail system and a charity drive were the relevant forums).\nFootnote 3\u00a0As discussed below, it is possible that some (or even many) public-access channels are government speech.  The channels that MNN administers, however, are clearly better thought of as a public forum given the New York regulations mandating open and equal access.  See infra, at 9-10, and n.\u00a07.\nFootnote 4\u00a0The parties have not pointed this Court to any New York law definitively establishing the status of the channels.  But even if there were uncertainty about the status of the channels under New York law, that would not be a reason to resolve the case against respondents (plaintiffs below) at the motion to dismiss stage.  See infra, at 12, n.\u00a09, 14.\nFootnote 5\u00a0For example, during the railroad boom, governments obtained not only physical easements in favor of the public over tracks used, owned, and managed by private railroads, including rights to use the rails and all relevant \"fixtures and appurtenances,\" see, e.g., Lake Superior & Mississippi R. Co. v. United States, 93 U.\u00a0S. 442, 444, 453-454 (1877), but also, in some situations, rights to transmit personnel and freight for free or at reduced rates, Ellis, Railroad Land Grant Rates, 1850-1945, 21 J. Land & P. U. Econ. 207, 209, 211-212 (1945).\nFootnote 6\u00a0Though the majority disagrees on the property question, I do not take it seriously to dispute that this point would follow.  See ante, at 14-15.\nFootnote 7\u00a0New York may be uncommon (as it often is); public-access channels in other States may well have different policies and practices that make them more like government speech than constitutional forums.  See Brief for Respondents 30-31; Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 13-15.  New York's scheme, however, is the only one before us.\nFootnote 8\u00a0Governments are, of course, not constitutionally required to open prisons or public forums, but once they do either of these things, constitutional obligations attach.  The rule that a government may not evade the Constitution by substituting a private administrator, meanwhile, is not a prison-specific rule.  More than 50 years ago, for example, this Court made clear in Evans v. Newton, 382 U.\u00a0S. 296 (1966), that the city of Macon, Georgia, could not evade the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause by handing off control of a park to a group \"of 'private' trustees.\"  Id., at 301.  Rather, \"the public character of [the] park require[d] that it be treated as a public institution subject to the command of the Fourteenth Amendment, regardless of who ha[d] title under state law.\"  Id., at 302.\nFootnote 9\u00a0Accordingly, this is not a case in which a private entity has been asked to exercise standardless discretion.  See, e.g., American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.\u00a0S. 40, 52 (1999).  Had New York law left MNN free to choose its favorite submissions, for example, a different result might well follow.\nMNN has suggested to this Court that its contract with Time Warner allows it \"to curate content, to decide to put shows together on one of our channels or a different channel.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 6; see Reply Brief 9.  But MNN's contract cannot defeat New York law's \"first-come, first-served, nondiscriminatory\" scheduling requirement, 16 N.\u00a0Y. Codes, Rules & Regs. \u00a7895.4(c)(4), and the discretion MNN asserts seems to be at most some limited authority to coordinate the exact placement and timing of the content it is obliged to accept indiscriminately, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 25-26.  That seems akin to the authority to make reasonable time, place, and manner provisions, which is consistent with administering any public forum.  See Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.\u00a0S. 781, 791 (1989).  As for any factual assertions about how the channels are operated in practice, this case arises from MNN's motion to dismiss, so the facts asserted against it must be accepted as true.  Hernandez v. Mesa, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (per curiam) (slip op., at 1).  And any uncertainty about the facts or New York law, in any event, would be a reason to vacate and remand, not reverse.\nFootnote 10\u00a0Respondents alleged that the City \"created an electronic public forum\" and \"delegat[ed] control of that forum to\" MNN.  App. 17.  They further alleged that \"[a]lmost all cable franchise agreements require cable operators--as a condition for easements to use the public rights-of-way--to dedicate some channels for programming by the public,\" id., at 20, invoked the state regulations requiring the designation of a channel here, id., at 21, and then alleged that the City's franchise agreement \"requires Time Warner to set aside\" the channels, id., at 22.  While the complaint does not use the words \"property interest,\" those allegations can be read to include the idea that whatever was \"set aside\" or \"dedicate[d],\" id., at 20, 22, qualified as a sufficient City property interest to support respondents' assertion of a public forum.  Cf. People v. Brooklyn & Queens Transit Corp., 273 N.\u00a0Y. 394, 400-401, 7 N.\u00a0E. 2d 833, 835 (1937) (discussing dedications of property to public use); cf. also Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U.\u00a0S. 727, 794 (1996) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part) (noting this theory).\nFootnote 11\u00a0There was a time when this Court's precedents may have portended the kind of First Amendment liability for purely private property owners that the majority spends so much time rejecting.  See Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.\u00a0S. 501, 505-509 (1946) (treating a company-owned town as subject to the First Amendment); Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc., 391 U.\u00a0S. 308, 315-320, and n.\u00a09, 325 (1968) (extending Marsh to cover a private shopping center to the extent that it sought to restrict speech about its businesses).  But the Court soon stanched that trend.  See Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U.\u00a0S. 551, 561-567 (1972) (cabining Marsh and refusing to extend Logan Valley); Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.\u00a0S. 507, 518 (1976) (making clear that \"the rationale of Logan Valley did not survive\" Lloyd).  Ever since, this Court has been reluctant to find a \"public function\" when it comes to \"private commercial transactions\" (even if they occur against a legal or regulatory backdrop), see, e.g., Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks, 436 U.\u00a0S. 149, 161-163 (1978), instead requiring a closer connection between the private entity and a government or its agents, see, e.g., Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Assn., 531 U.\u00a0S. 288, 298 (2001) (nonprofit interscholastic athletic association \"pervasive[ly] entwine[d]\" with governmental institutions and officials); Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.\u00a0S. 922, 942 (1982) (state-created system \"whereby state officials [would] attach property on the ex\u00a0parte application of one party to a private dispute\"); see also Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.\u00a0S. 715, 723-725 (1961) (restaurant in municipal parking garage partly maintained by municipal agency); accord, ante, at 6-7.  Jackson exemplifies the line of cases that supplanted cases like Logan Valley--not cases like this one.\nFootnote 12\u00a0Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.\u00a0S. 345 (1974), by contrast, exemplifies a type of case in which a private actor provides a service that there is no governmental obligation to provide at all.  See id., at 353 (no state requirement for government to provide utility service); see also, e.g., Hudgens, 424 U.\u00a0S. 507 (shopping center).  In West v. Atkins, 487 U.\u00a0S. 42 (1988), by contrast, the prison was obligated to provide health care in accordance with the Eighth Amendment to its prisoners once it incarcerated them, and here, the City was required to provide a public forum to its residents in accordance with the First Amendment once it granted the cable franchise.  See supra, at 11-13.\nFootnote 13\u00a0Accordingly, the majority need not fear that \"all private property owners and private lessees who open their property for speech [c]ould be subject to First Amendment constraints.\"  Ante, at 10.  Those kinds of entities are not the government's agents; MNN is.  Whether such entities face \"extensive regulation\" or require \"government licenses, government contracts, or government-granted monopolies,\" ante, at 12, is immaterial, so long as they have not accepted the government's request to fulfill the government's duties on its behalf.\n\n\n","38":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMERCK SHARP &AMP; DOHME CORP. v. ALBRECHT ET AL.(2019)\nNo. 17-290\nArgued: January 7, 2019Decided: May 20, 2019\n\n\nPetitioner Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. manufactures Fosamax, a drug that treats and prevents osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.  However, the mechanism through which Fosamax treats and prevents osteoporosis may increase the risk that patients will suffer \"atypical femoral fractures,\" that is, a rare type of complete, low-energy fracture that affects the thigh bone.  When the Food and Drug Administration first approved of the manufacture and sale of Fosamax in 1995, the Fosamax label did not warn of the then-speculative risk of atypical femoral fractures associated with the drug.  But stronger evidence connecting Fosamax to atypical femoral fractures developed after 1995.  And the FDA ultimately ordered Merck to add a warning about atypical femoral fractures to the Fosamax label in 2011.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents are more than 500 individuals who took Fosamax and suffered atypical femoral fractures between 1999 and 2010.  Respondents sued Merck seeking tort damages on the ground that state law imposed upon Merck a legal duty to warn respondents and their doctors about the risk of atypical femoral fractures associated with using Fosamax.  Merck, in defense, argued that respondents' state-law failure-to-warn claims should be dismissed as pre-empted by federal law.  Merck conceded that the FDA regulations would have permitted Merck to try to change the label to add a warning before 2010, but Merck asserted that the FDA would have rejected that attempt.  In particular, Merck claimed that the FDA's rejection of Merck's 2008 attempt to warn of a risk of \"stress fractures\" showed that the FDA would also have rejected any attempt by Merck to warn of the risk of atypical femoral fractures associated with the drug.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court agreed with Merck's pre-emption argument and granted summary judgment to Merck, but the Third Circuit vacated and remanded.  The Court of Appeals recognized that its pre-emption analysis was controlled by this Court's decision in Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, which held that a state-law failure-to-warn claim is pre-empted where there is \"clear evidence\" that the FDA would not have approved a change to the label.  The Court of Appeals, however, suggested that the \"clear evidence\" standard had led to varying lower court applications and that it would be helpful for this Court to \"clarif[y] or buil[d] out the doctrine.\"  852 F.\u00a03d 268, 284.  \nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0\"Clear evidence\" is evidence that shows the court that the drug manufacturer fully informed the FDA of the justifications for the warning required by state law and that the FDA, in turn, informed the drug manufacturer that the FDA would not approve a change to the drug's label to include that warning.  Pp.\u00a09-15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The Wyeth Court undertook a careful review of the history of federal regulation of drugs and drug labeling and found both a reluctance by Congress to displace state laws that would penalize drug manufacturers for failing to warn consumers of the risks associated with their drugs and an insistence by Congress that drug manufacturers bear the responsibility for the content of their drug labels.  Accordingly, this Court held in Wyeth that \"absent clear evidence that the FDA would not have approved a change\" to the label, the Court \"will not conclude that it was impossible . . . to comply with both federal and state requirements.\"  555 U. S., at 571.  Applying that rule to the facts of that case, the Court said that Wyeth's evidence of pre-emption fell short for two reasons.  First, the record did not show that Wyeth \"supplied the FDA with an evaluation or analysis concerning the specific dangers\" that would have merited the warning.  Id., at 572-573.  And second, the record did not show that Wyeth \"attempted to give the kind of warning required by [state law] but was prohibited from doing so by the FDA.\"  Ibid., and n. 5.  Pp. 10-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Thus, in a case like Wyeth, showing that federal law prohibited the drug manufacturer from adding a warning that would satisfy state law requires the drug manufacturer to show that it fully informed the FDA of the justifications for the warning required by state law and that the FDA, in turn, informed the drug manufacturer that the FDA would not approve changing the drug's label to include that warning.  These conclusions flow from this Court's precedents on impossibility pre-emption and the statutory and regulatory scheme that the Court reviewed in Wyeth.  See 555 U.\u00a0S., at 578.  In particular, this Court has refused to find clear evidence of impossibility where the laws of one sovereign permit an activity that the laws of the other sovereign restrict or even prohibit.  And as explained in Wyeth, FDA regulations permit drug manufacturers to change a label to \"reflect newly acquired information\" if the changes \"add or strengthen a .\u00a0.\u00a0. warning\" for which there is \"evidence of a causal association.\"  21 CFR \u00a7314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A).

The Supremacy Clause grants \"supreme\" status only to the \"the Laws of the United States.\"  U.\u00a0S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.

The question often involves the use of legal skills to determine whether agency disapproval fits facts that are not in dispute.  Moreover, judges, rather than lay juries, are better equipped to evaluate the nature and scope of an agency's determination, and are better suited to understand and to interpret agency decisions in light of the governing statutory and regulatory context.  While contested brute facts will sometimes prove relevant to a court's legal determination about the meaning and effect of an agency decision, such factual questions are subsumed within an already tightly circumscribed legal analysis and do not warrant submission alone or together with the larger pre-emption question to a jury.

DORIS ALBRECHT, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit\n[May 20, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Congress enacted the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, ch. 675, 52 Stat. 1040, as amended, 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7301 et seq., it charged the Food and Drug Administration with ensuring that prescription drugs are \"safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested\" in the drug's \"labeling.\"  \u00a7355(d).  When the FDA exercises this authority, it makes careful judgments about what warnings should appear on a drug's label for the safety of consumers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For that reason, we have previously held that \"clear evidence\" that the FDA would not have approved a change to the drug's label pre-empts a claim, grounded in state law, that a drug manufacturer failed to warn consumers of the change-related risks associated with using the drug.  See Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.\u00a0S. 555, 571 (2009).  We here determine that this question of pre-emption is one for a judge to decide, not a jury.  We also hold that \"clear evidence\" is evidence that shows the court that the drug manufacturer fully informed the FDA of the justifications for the warning required by state law and that the FDA, in turn, informed the drug manufacturer that the FDA would not approve a change to the drug's label to include that warning.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The central issue in this case concerns federal pre-emption, which as relevant here, takes place when it is \"\u00a0'impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements.'\u00a0\" Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. Bartlett, 570 U.\u00a0S. 472, 480 (2013).  See also U.\u00a0S. Const., Art. VI, cl.\u00a02.  The state law that we consider is state common law or state statutes that require drug manufacturers to warn drug consumers of the risks associated with drugs.  The federal law that we consider is the statutory and regulatory scheme through which the FDA regulates the information that appears on brand-name prescription drug labels.  The alleged conflict between state and federal law in this case has to do with a drug that was manufactured by petitioner Merck Sharp & Dohme and was administered to respondents without a warning of certain associated risks.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The FDA regulates the safety information that appears on the labels of prescription drugs that are marketed in the United States.  21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7355(b)(1)(F); 21 CFR \u00a7201.57(a) (2018).  Although we commonly understand a drug's \"label\" to refer to the sticker affixed to a prescription bottle, in this context the term refers more broadly to the written material that is sent to the physician who prescribes the drug and the written material that comes with the prescription bottle when the drug is handed to the patient at the pharmacy.  21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7321(m).  These (often lengthy) package inserts contain detailed information about the drug's medical uses and health risks.  \u00a7355(b)(1)(F); 21 CFR \u00a7201.57(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FDA regulations set out requirements for the content, the format, and the order of the safety information on the drug label.  \u00a7201.57(c).  Those regulations require drug labels to include, among other things: (1)\u00a0prominent \"boxed\" warnings about risks that may lead to death or serious injury; (2)\u00a0contraindications describing any situation in which the drug should not be used because the risk of use outweighs any therapeutic benefit; (3)\u00a0warnings and precautions about other potential safety hazards; and (4)\u00a0any adverse reactions for which there is some basis to believe a causal relationship exists between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As those requirements make clear, the category in which a particular risk appears on a drug label is an indicator of the likelihood and severity of the risk.  The hierarchy of label information is designed to \"prevent overwarning\" so that less important information does not \"overshadow\" more important information.  73 Fed. Reg. 49605-49606 (2008).  It is also designed to exclude \"[e]xaggeration of risk, or inclusion of speculative or hypothetical risks,\" that \"could discourage appropriate use of a beneficial drug.\"  Id., at 2851.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prospective drug manufacturers work with the FDA to develop an appropriate label when they apply for FDA approval of a new drug.  21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7355(a), 355(b), 355(d)(7); 21 CFR \u00a7314.125(b)(6).  But FDA regulations also acknowledge that information about drug safety may change over time, and that new information may require changes to the drug label.  \u00a7\u00a7314.80(c), 314.81(b)(2)(i).  Drug manufacturers generally seek advance permission from the FDA to make substantive changes to their drug labels.  However, an FDA regulation called the \"changes being effected\" or \"CBE\" regulation permits drug manufacturers to change a label without prior FDA approval if the change is designed to \"add or strengthen a .\u00a0.\u00a0. warning\" where there is \"newly acquired information\" about the \"evidence of a causal association\" between the drug and a risk of harm.  21 CFR \u00a7314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Merck Sharp & Dohme manufactures Fosamax, a drug that treats and prevents osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.  App. 192; In\u00a0re Fosamax (Alendronate Sodium) Products Liability Litigation, 852 F.\u00a03d 268, 271, 274-275 (CA3 2017).  Fosamax belongs to a class of drugs called \"bisphosphonates.\"  Fosamax and other bisphosphonates work by affecting the \"bone remodeling process,\" that is, the process through which bones are continuously broken down and built back up again.  App. 102, 111.  For some postmenopausal women, the two parts of the bone remodeling process fall out of sync; the body removes old bone cells faster than it can replace them.  That imbalance can lead to osteoporosis, a disease that is characterized by low bone mass and an increased risk of bone fractures.  Fosamax (like other bisphosphonates) slows the breakdown of old bone cells and thereby helps postmenopausal women avoid osteoporotic fractures.  Id., at 102.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the mechanism through which Fosamax decreases the risk of osteoporotic fractures may increase the risk of a different type of fracture.  Id., at 400-444, 661-663.  That is because all bones--healthy and osteoporotic alike--sometimes develop microscopic cracks that are not due to any trauma, but are instead caused by the mechanical stress of everyday activity.  Id., at 102.  Those so-called \"stress fractures\" ordinarily heal on their own through the bone remodeling process.  But, by slowing the breakdown of old bone cells, Fosamax and other bisphosphonates may cause stress fractures to progress to complete breaks that cause great pain and require surgical intervention to repair.  Id., at 106-109, 139, 144-145.  When that rare type of complete, low-energy fracture affects the thigh bone, it is called an \"atypical femoral fracture.\"  Id., at 101.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Fosamax label that the FDA approved in 1995 did not warn of the risk of atypical femoral fractures.  852 F.\u00a03d, at 274-275.  At that time, Merck's scientists were aware of at least a theoretical risk of those fractures.  Indeed, as far back as 1990 and 1991, when Fosamax was undergoing preapproval clinical trials, Merck scientists expressed concern in internal discussions that Fosamax could inhibit bone remodeling to such a \"\u00a0'profound'\u00a0\" degree that \"inadequate repair may take place\" and \"\u00a0'micro-fractures would not heal.'\u00a0\"  App. 111-113.  When Merck applied to the FDA for approval of Fosamax, Merck brought those theoretical considerations to the FDA's attention.  852 F.\u00a03d, at 274-275.  But, perhaps because the concerns were only theoretical, the FDA approved Fosamax's label without requiring any mention of this risk.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Evidence connecting Fosamax to atypical femoral fractures developed after 1995.  Merck began receiving adverse event reports from the medical community indicating that long-term Fosamax users were suffering atypical femoral fractures.  App. 122-125.  For example, Merck received a report from a doctor who said that hospital staff had begun calling atypical femoral fractures the \"\u00a0'Fosamax Fracture'\u00a0\" because \"\u00a0'100% of patients in his practice who have experienced femoral fractures (without being hit by a taxicab), were taking Fosamax .\u00a0.\u00a0. for over 5 years. '\u00a0\"   Id., at 126.  Merck performed a statistical analysis of Fosamax adverse event reports, concluding that these reports revealed a statistically significant incidence of femur fractures.  3 App. in No. 14-1900 (CA3), pp. A1272-A1273, A1443.  And about the same time, Merck began to see numerous scholarly articles and case studies documenting possible connections between long-term Fosamax use and atypical femoral fractures.  App. 106-110, 116-122.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2008, Merck applied to the FDA for preapproval to change Fosamax's label to add language to both the \"Adverse Reaction[s]\" and the \"Precaution[s]\" sections of the label.  Id., at 670.  In particular, Merck proposed adding a reference to \"\u00a0'low-energy femoral shaft fracture'\u00a0\" in the Adverse Reactions section, and cross-referencing a longer discussion in the Precautions section that focused on the risk of stress fractures associated with Fosamax.  Id., at 728.  The FDA approved the addition to the Adverse Reactions section, but rejected Merck's proposal to warn of a risk of \"stress fractures.\"  Id., at 511-512.  The FDA explained that Merck's \"justification\" for the proposed change to the Precautions section was \"inadequate,\" because \"[i]dentification of 'stress fractures' may not be clearly related to the atypical subtrochanteric fractures that have been reported in the literature.\"  Id., at 511.  The FDA invited Merck to \"resubmit\" its application and to \"fully address all the deficiencies listed.\"  Id., at 512; see 21 CFR \u00a7314.110(b).  But Merck instead withdrew its application and decided to make the changes to the Adverse Reactions section through the CBE process.  App. 654-660.  Merck made no changes to the Precautions section at issue here.  Id., at 274.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A warning about \"atypical femoral fractures\" did not appear on the Fosamax label until 2011, when the FDA ordered that change based on its own analyses.  Id., at 246-252, 526-534.  Merck was initially resistant to the change, proposing revised language that, once again, referred to the risk of \"stress fractures.\"  Id., at 629-634.  But the FDA, once again, rejected that language.  And this time, the FDA explained that \"the term 'stress fracture' was considered and was not accepted\" because, \"for most practitioners, the term 'stress fracture' represents a minor fracture and this would contradict the seriousness of the atypical femoral fractures associated with bisphosphonate use.\"  Id., at 566.  In January 2011, Merck and the FDA ultimately agreed upon adding a three-paragraph discussion of atypical femoral fractures to the Warnings and Precautions section of the Fosamax label.  Id., at 223-224.  The label now refers to the fractures five times as \"atypical\" without using the term \"stress fracture.\"  Ibid.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The respondents here are more than 500 individuals who took Fosamax and who suffered atypical femoral fractures between 1999 and 2010.  Brief for Respondents 7.  Respondents, invoking federal diversity jurisdiction, filed separate actions seeking tort damages on the ground that, during the relevant period, state law imposed upon Merck a legal duty to warn them and their doctors about the risk of atypical femoral fractures associated with using Fosamax.  Id., at 1. One respondent, for example, filed a complaint alleging that she took Fosamax for roughly 10 years and suffered an atypical femoral fracture.  One day in 2009, when the respondent was 70 years old, she turned to unlock the front door of her house, heard a popping sound, and suddenly felt her left leg give out beneath her.  She needed surgery, in which doctors repaired her leg with a rod and screws.  She explained she would not have used Fosamax for so many years if she had known that she might suffer an atypical femoral fracture as a result.  See id., at 18-19.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Merck, in defense, argued that respondents' state-law failure-to-warn claims should be dismissed as pre-empted by federal law.  Both Merck and the FDA have long been aware that Fosamax could theoretically increase the risk of atypical femoral fractures.  But for some period of time between 1995 (when the FDA first approved a drug label for Fosamax) and 2010 (when the FDA decided to require Merck to add a warning about atypical femoral fractures to Fosamax's label), both Merck and the FDA were unsure whether the developing evidence of a causal link between Fosamax and atypical femoral fractures was strong enough to require adding a warning to the Fosamax drug label.  Merck conceded that the FDA's CBE regulation would have permitted Merck to try to change the label to add a warning before 2010, but Merck asserted that the FDA would have rejected that attempt.  In particular, Merck pointed to the FDA's rejection of Merck's 2008 attempt to amend the Fosamax label to warn of the risk of \"stress fractures\" associated with Fosamax.  On that basis, Merck claimed that federal law prevented Merck from complying with any state-law duty to warn the respondents of the risk of atypical femoral fractures associated with Fosamax.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court agreed with Merck's pre-emption argument and granted summary judgment to Merck, In\u00a0re Fosamax (Alendronate Sodium): Products Liability Litigation, 2014 WL 1266994, *17 (D NJ, Mar. 22, 2017), but the Court of Appeals vacated and remanded, 852 F.\u00a03d, at 302.  The Court of Appeals concluded that its pre-emption analysis was controlled by this Court's decision in Wyeth.  Ibid.  The Court of Appeals understood that case as making clear that a failure-to-warn claim grounded in state law is pre-empted where there is \"\u00a0'clear evidence that the FDA would not have approved a change to the .\u00a0.\u00a0. label.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 280 (quoting Wyeth, 555 U.\u00a0S., at 571).  The Court of Appeals, however, suggested that this statement had led to varying lower court applications and that it would be helpful for this Court to \"clarif[y] or buil[d] out the doctrine.\"  852 F.\u00a03d, at 284.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In attempting to do so itself, the Court of Appeals held that \"the Supreme Court intended to announce a standard of proof when it used the term 'clear evidence' in Wyeth.\"  Ibid.  That is, the Court of Appeals believed that \"[t]he term 'clear evidence' .\u00a0.\u00a0. does not refer directly to the type of facts that a manufacturer must show, or to the circumstances in which preemption will be appropriate.\"  Id., at 285.  \"Rather, it specifies how difficult it will be for the manufacturer to convince the factfinder that the FDA would have rejected a proposed label change.\"  Ibid.  And in the Court of Appeals' view, \"for a defendant to establish a preemption defense under Wyeth, the factfinder must conclude that it is highly probable that the FDA would not have approved a change to the drug's label.\"  Id., at 286.  Moreover and importantly, the Court of Appeals also held that \"whether the FDA would have rejected a proposed label change is a question of fact that must be answered by a jury.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Merck filed a petition for a writ of certiorari.  Merck's petition asked the Court to decide whether Merck's case and others like it \"must .\u00a0.\u00a0. go to a jury\" to determine whether the FDA, in effect, has disapproved a state-law-required labeling change.  In light of differences and uncertainties among the courts of appeals and state supreme courts in respect to the application of Wyeth, we granted certiorari.  See, e.g., Mason v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 596 F.\u00a03d 387, 391 (CA7 2010) (\"The Supreme Court .\u00a0.\u00a0. did not clarify what constitutes 'clear evidence'\u00a0\"); Reckis v. Johnson & Johnson, 471 Mass. 272, 286, 28 N.\u00a0E.\u00a03d 445, 457 (2015) (\"Wyeth did not define 'clear evidence' .\u00a0.\u00a0. \" (some internal quotation marks omitted)).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We stated in Wyeth v. Levine that state law failure-to-warn claims are pre-empted by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and related labeling regulations when there is \"clear evidence\" that the FDA would not have approved the warning that state law requires.  555 U.\u00a0S., at 571.  We here decide that a judge, not the jury, must decide the pre-emption question.  And we elaborate  Wyeth's requirements along the way.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We begin by describing Wyeth.  In that case, the plaintiff developed gangrene after a physician's assistant injected her with Phenergan, an antinausea drug.  The plaintiff brought a state-law failure-to-warn claim against Wyeth, the drug's manufacturer, for failing to provide an adequate warning about the risks that accompany various methods of administering the drug.  In particular, the plaintiff claimed that directly injecting Phenergan into a patient's vein (the \"IV-push\" method of administration) creates a significant risk of catastrophic consequences.  And those consequences could be avoided by introducing the drug into a saline solution that slowly descends into a patient's vein (the \"IV-drip\" method of administration).  A jury concluded that Wyeth's warning label was inadequate, and that the label's inadequacy caused the plaintiff's injury.  On appeal, Wyeth argued that the plaintiff's state-law failure-to-warn claims were pre-empted because it was impossible for Wyeth to comply with both state law duties and federal labeling obligations.  The Vermont Supreme Court rejected Wyeth's pre-emption claim.  Id., at 563.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We too considered Wyeth's pre-emption argument, and we too rejected it. In rejecting Wyeth's argument, we undertook a careful review of the history of federal regulation of drugs and drug labeling.  Id., at 566-568.  In doing so, we \"assum[ed] that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\"  Id., at 565 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And we found nothing within that history to indicate that the FDA's power to approve or to disapprove labeling changes, by itself, pre-empts state law.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rather, we concluded that Congress enacted the FDCA \"to bolster consumer protection against harmful products;\" that Congress provided no \"federal remedy for consumers harmed by unsafe or ineffective drugs\"; that Congress was \"awar[e] of the prevalence of state tort litigation;\" and that, whether Congress' general purpose was to protect consumers, to provide safety-related incentives to manufacturers, or both, language, history, and purpose all indicate that \"Congress did not intend FDA oversight to be the exclusive means of ensuring drug safety and effectiveness.\"  Id., at 574-575 (emphasis added). See also id., at 574 (\"If Congress thought state-law suits posed an obstacle to its objectives, it surely would have enacted an express pre-emption provision at some point during the FDCA's 70-year history\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We also observed that \"through many amendments to the FDCA and to FDA regulations, it has remained a central premise of federal drug regulation that the manufacturer bears responsibility for the content of its label at all times.\"  Id., at 570-571.  A drug manufacturer \"is charged both with crafting an adequate label and with ensuring that its warnings remain adequate as long as the drug is on the market.\"  Id., at 571.  Thus, when the risks of a particular drug become apparent, the manufacturer has \"a duty to provide a warning that adequately describe[s] that risk.\"  Ibid.  \"Indeed,\" we noted, \"prior to 2007, the FDA lacked the authority to order manufacturers to revise their labels.\"  Ibid.  And even when \"Congress granted the FDA this authority,\" in the 2007 Amendments to the FDCA, Congress simultaneously \"reaffirmed the manufacturer's obligations and referred specifically to the CBE regulation, which both reflects the manufacturer's ultimate responsibility for its label and provides a mechanism for adding safety information to the label prior to FDA approval.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of Congress' reluctance to displace state laws that would penalize drug manufacturers for failing to warn consumers of the risks associated with their drugs, and Congress' insistence on requiring drug manufacturers to bear the responsibility for the content of their drug labels, we were unpersuaded by Wyeth's pre-emption argument.   In Wyeth's case, we concluded, \"when the risk of gangrene from IV-push injection of Phenergan became apparent, Wyeth had a duty\" under state law \"to provide a warning that adequately described that risk, and the CBE regulation permitted it to provide such a warning before receiving the FDA's approval.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, and more directly relevant here, we pointed out that \"the FDA retains authority to reject labeling changes made pursuant to the CBE regulation in its review of the manufacturer's supplemental application, just as it retains such authority in reviewing all supplemental applications.\"  Ibid.  We then said that, nonetheless, \"absent clear evidence that the FDA would not have approved a change to Phenergan's label, we will not conclude that it was impossible for Wyeth to comply with both federal and state requirements.\"  Ibid. (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We reviewed the record and concluded that \"Wyeth has offered no such evidence.\"  Id., at 572.  We said that  Wyeth's evidence of pre-emption fell short for two reasons.  First, the record did not show that Wyeth \"supplied the FDA with an evaluation or analysis concerning the specific dangers\" that would have merited the warning.  Id., at 572-573.  We could find \"no evidence in this record that either the FDA or the manufacturer gave more than passing attention to the issue of IV-push versus IV-drip administration\"--the matter at issue in the case.   Id., at 572 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Second, the record did not show that Wyeth \"attempted to give the kind of warning required by [state law] but was prohibited from doing so by the FDA.\"  Ibid., and n.\u00a05.  The \"FDA had not made an affirmative decision to preserve\" the warning as it was or \"to prohibit Wyeth from strengthening its warning.\"  Id., at 572.  For those reasons, we could not \"credit Wyeth's contention that the FDA would have prevented it from adding a stronger warning about the IV-push method of intravenous administration.\"  And we could not conclude that \"it was impossible for Wyeth to comply with both federal and state requirements.\"  Id., at 573.  We acknowledged that meeting the standard we set forth would be difficult, but, we said, \"[i]mpossibility pre-emption is a demanding defense.\"  Ibid.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The underlying question for this type of impossibility pre-emption defense is whether federal law (including appropriate FDA actions) prohibited the drug manufacturer from adding any and all warnings to the drug label that would satisfy state law.  And, of course, in order to succeed with that defense the manufacturer must show that the answer to this question is yes.  But in Wyeth, we confronted that question in the context of a particular set of circumstances.  Accordingly, for purposes of this case, we assume--but do not decide--that, as was true of the warning at issue in Wyeth, there is sufficient evidence to find that Merck violated state law by failing to add a warning about atypical femoral fractures to the Fosamax label.  In a case like Wyeth, showing that federal law prohibited the drug manufacturer from adding a warning that would satisfy state law requires the drug manufacturer to show that it fully informed the FDA of the justifications for the warning required by state law and that the FDA, in turn, informed the drug manufacturer that the FDA would not approve changing the drug's label to include that warning.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These conclusions flow from our precedents on impossibility pre-emption and the statutory and regulatory scheme that we reviewed in Wyeth.  See 555 U.\u00a0S., at 578.  In particular, \"it has long been settled that state laws that conflict with federal law are without effect.\" Mutual Pharmaceutical Co., 570 U.\u00a0S., at 480.  But as we have cautioned many times before, the \"possibility of impossibility [is] not enough.\" PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, 564 U.\u00a0S. 604, 625, n. 8 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Consequently, we have refused to find clear evidence of such impossibility where the laws of one sovereign permit an activity that the laws of the other sovereign restrict or even prohibit.  See, e.g., Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N.\u00a0A. v. Nelson, 517 U.\u00a0S. 25, 31 (1996); Michigan Canners & Freezers Assn., Inc. v. Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Bd., 467 U.\u00a0S. 461, 478, and n. 21 (1984).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, as we explained in Wyeth, 555 U.\u00a0S., at 571-573, federal law--the FDA's CBE regulation--permits drug manufacturers to change a label to \"reflect newly acquired information\" if the changes \"add or strengthen a .\u00a0.\u00a0. warning\" for which there is \"evidence of a causal association,\" without prior approval from the FDA.  21 CFR \u00a7314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A).  Of course, the FDA reviews CBE submissions and can reject label changes even after the manufacturer has made them.  See \u00a7\u00a7314.70(c)(6), (7).  And manufacturers cannot propose a change that is not based on reasonable evidence.  \u00a7314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A).  But in the interim, the CBE regulation permits changes, so a drug manufacturer will not ordinarily be able to show that there is an actual conflict between state and federal law such that it was impossible to comply with both.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We do not further define Wyeth's use of the words \"clear evidence\" in terms of evidentiary standards, such as \"preponderance of the evidence\" or \"clear and convincing evidence\" and so forth, because, as we shall discuss, infra, at 15-17, courts should treat the critical question not as a matter of fact for a jury but as a matter of law for the judge to decide.  And where that is so, the judge must simply ask himself or herself whether the relevant federal and state laws \"irreconcilably conflic[t].\"  Rice v. Norman Williams Co., 458 U.\u00a0S. 654, 659 (1982); see ibid. (\"The existence of a hypothetical or potential conflict is insufficient to warrant the pre-emption of the state statute\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We do note, however, that the only agency actions that can determine the answer to the pre-emption question, of course, are agency actions taken pursuant to the FDA's congressionally delegated authority.  The Supremacy Clause grants \"supreme\" status only to the \"the Laws of the United States.\"  U.\u00a0S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.  And pre-emption takes place \"\u00a0'only when and if [the agency] is acting within the scope of its congressionally delegated authority, .\u00a0.\u00a0. for an agency literally has no power to act, let alone pre-empt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign State, unless and until Congress confers power upon it.'\u00a0\"  New York v. FERC, 535 U.\u00a0S. 1, 18 (2002) (some alterations omitted).  Federal law permits the FDA to communicate its disapproval of a warning by means of notice-and-comment rulemaking setting forth labeling standards, see, e.g., 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7355(d); 21 CFR \u00a7\u00a7201.57, 314.105; by formally rejecting a warning label that would have been adequate under state law, see, e.g., 21 CFR \u00a7\u00a7314.110(a), 314.125(b)(6); or with other agency action carrying the force of law, cf., e.g., 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7355(o)(4)(A).  The question of disapproval \"method\" is not now before us.  And we make only the obvious point that, whatever the means the FDA uses to exercise its authority, those means must lie within the scope of the authority Congress has lawfully delegated.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We turn now to what is the determinative question before us: Is the question of agency disapproval primarily one of fact, normally for juries to decide, or is it a question of law, normally for a judge to decide without a jury?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The complexity of the preceding discussion of the law helps to illustrate why we answer this question by concluding that the question is a legal one for the judge, not a jury.  The question often involves the use of legal skills to determine whether agency disapproval fits facts that are not in dispute.  Moreover, judges, rather than lay juries, are better equipped to evaluate the nature and scope of an agency's determination.  Judges are experienced in \"[t]he construction of written instruments,\" such as those normally produced by a federal agency to memorialize its considered judgments.  Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U.\u00a0S. 370, 388 (1996).  And judges are better suited than are juries to understand and to interpret agency decisions in light of the governing statutory and regulatory context.  Cf. 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7706 (specifying that a \"reviewing court,\" not a jury, \"shall .\u00a0.\u00a0. determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action\"); see also H. R. Rep. No. 1980, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 44 (1946) (noting longstanding view that \"questions respecting the .\u00a0.\u00a0. terms of any agency action\" and its \"application\" are \"questions of law\").  To understand the question as a legal question for judges makes sense given the fact that judges are normally familiar with principles of administrative law.  Doing so should produce greater uniformity among courts; and greater uniformity is normally a virtue when a question requires a determination concerning the scope and effect of federal agency action.  Cf. Markman, 517 U.\u00a0S., at 390-391.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We understand that sometimes contested brute facts will prove relevant to a court's legal determination about the meaning and effect of an agency decision.  For example, if the FDA rejected a drug manufacturer's supplemental application to change a drug label on the ground that the information supporting the application was insufficient to warrant a labeling change, the meaning and scope of that decision might depend on what information the FDA had before it.  Yet in litigation between a drug consumer and a drug manufacturer (which will ordinarily lack an official administrative record for an FDA decision), the litigants may dispute whether the drug manufacturer submitted all material information to the FDA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But we consider these factual questions to be subsumed within an already tightly circumscribed legal analysis.  And we do not believe that they warrant submission alone or together with the larger pre-emption question to a jury.  Rather, in those contexts where we have determined that the question is \"for the judge and not the jury,\" we have also held that \"courts may have to resolve subsidiary factual disputes\" that are part and parcel of the broader legal question.  Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2015) (slip op., at 6-7).  And, as in contexts as diverse as the proper construction of patent claims and the voluntariness of criminal confessions, they create a question that \"\u00a0'falls somewhere between a pristine legal standard and a simple historical fact.'\u00a0\"  Markman, 517 U.\u00a0S., at 388 (quoting Miller v. Fenton, 474 U.\u00a0S. 104, 114 (1985)).  In those circumstances, \"\u00a0'the fact\/law distinction at times has turned on a determination that, as a matter of the sound administration of justice, one judicial actor is better positioned than another to decide the issue in question.'\u00a0\"  Markman, 517 U.\u00a0S., at 388 (quoting Miller, 474 U.\u00a0S., at 114). In this context, that \"better positioned\" decisionmaker is the judge.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the Court of Appeals treated the pre-emption question as one of fact, not law, and because it did not have an opportunity to consider fully the standards we have described in Part II of our opinion, we vacate its judgment and remand the case to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nThomas, J., concurring\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-290\nMERCK SHARP & DOHME CORP., PETITIONER v.

VI, cl. 2.\nUnder this Clause, \"[w]here state and federal law 'directly conflict,' state law must give way.\"  PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, 564 U.\u00a0S. 604, 617 (2011).  Although the Court has articulated several theories of pre-emption, Merck's sole argument here is that state law is pre-empted because it is impossible for Merck to comply with federal and state law.  I remain skeptical that \"physical impossibility\" is a proper test for deciding whether a direct conflict exists between federal and state law.  But even under our impossibility precedents, Merck's pre-emption defense fails.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I have explained before, it is not obvious that the \"\u00a0'physical impossibility' standard is the best proxy for determining when state and federal laws 'directly conflict' for purposes of the Supremacy Clause.\"  Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.\u00a0S. 555, 590 (2009) (opinion concurring in judgment).  Evidence from the founding suggests that, under the original meaning of the Supremacy Clause, federal law pre-empts state law only if the two are in logical contradiction.  See ibid.; Nelson, Preemption, 86 Va. L. Rev. 225, 260-261 (2000).  Sometimes, federal law will logically contradict state law even if it is possible for a person to comply with both.  For instance, \"if federal law gives an individual the right to engage in certain behavior that state law prohibits, the laws would give contradictory commands notwithstanding the fact that an individual could comply with both by electing to refrain from the covered behavior.\"  Wyeth, 555 U.\u00a0S., at 590 (opinion of Thomas, J.).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Merck does not advance this logical-contradiction standard, and it is doubtful that a pre-emption defense along these lines would succeed here.  \"To say, as the statute does, that [Merck] may not market a drug without federal approval (i.e., without [a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)] approved label) is not to say that federal approval gives [Merck] the unfettered right, for all time, to market its drug with the specific label that was federally approved.\"  Id., at 592.  Nothing in the federal brand-name-drug \"statutory or regulatory scheme necessarily insulates [Merck] from liability under state law simply because the FDA has approved a particular label.\"  Id., at 593.  The relevant question would be whether federal law gives Merck \"an unconditional right to market [a] federally approved drug at all times with the precise label initially approved by the FDA,\" id., at 592, or whether it instead provides a federal floor that can be supplemented by different state standards, see Brief for Cato Institute as Amicus Curiae 14, n.\u00a04.  Absent a federal statutory right to sell a brand-name drug with an FDA-approved label, FDA approval \"does not represent a finding that the drug, as labeled, can never be deemed unsafe by later federal  action, or as in this case, the application of state law.\"  Wyeth, supra, at 592 (opinion of Thomas, J.).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying the Court's impossibility precedents leads to the same conclusion.  The question for impossibility is whether it was \"lawful under federal law for [Merck] to do what state law required of\" it.  Mensing, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 618.  Because \"[p]re-emption analysis requires us to compare federal and state law,\" I \"begin by identifying the [relevant] state tort duties and federal labeling requirements.\"  Id., at 611.  Respondents' claim here is \"that state law obligated Merck to add a warning about atypical femur fractures\" to the Warnings and Precautions section of Fosamax's label.  In\u00a0re Fosamax (Alendronate Sodium) Prods. Liability Litig., 852 F. 3d 268, 282 (CA3 2017).  Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a manufacturer of a brand-name drug \"bears responsibility for the content of its label at all times.\"  Wyeth, 555 U.\u00a0S., at 570-571 (majority opinion).  The manufacturer \"is charged both with crafting an adequate label and with ensuring that its warnings remain adequate as long as the drug is on the market.\"  Id., at 571.  Generally, to propose labeling changes, the manufacturer can submit a Prior Approval Supplement (PAS) application, which requires FDA approval before the changes are made.  21 CFR \u00a7314.70(b) (2018).  Alternatively, under the FDA's Changes Being Effected (CBE) regulation, if the manufacturer would like to change a label to \"add or strengthen a contraindication, warning, precaution, or adverse reaction\" \"to reflect newly acquired information,\" it can change the label immediately upon filing its supplemental application with the FDA, without waiting for FDA approval.  \u00a7314.70(c)(6)(iii); see Wyeth, supra, at 568.  If the FDA later disapproves the CBE application, \"it may order the manufacturer to cease distribution of the drug product(s)\" with the new labeling.  \u00a7314.70(c)(7).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, Merck's impossibility pre-emption defense fails because it does not identify any federal law that \"prohibited [it] from adding any and all warnings .\u00a0.\u00a0. that would satisfy state law.\"  Ante, at 13.  By its reference to \"the Laws of the United States,\" the Supremacy Clause \"requires that pre-emptive effect be given only to those federal standards and policies that are set forth in, or necessarily follow from, the statutory text that was produced through the constitutionally required bicameral and presentment procedures.\"  Wyeth, supra, at 586 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  Merck's primary argument, based on various agency communications, is that the FDA would have rejected a hypothetical labeling change submitted via the CBE process.  But neither agency musings nor hypothetical future rejections constitute pre-emptive \"Laws\" under the Supremacy Clause.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court describes, in 2008 Merck submitted PAS applications to add certain language regarding fractures to the Adverse Reactions and the Warnings and Precautions sections of Fosamax's label.  Ante, at 6. In 2009, the FDA sent Merck a \"complete response\" letter \"agree[ing] that atypical and subtrochanteric fractures should be added\" to the Adverse Reactions section.  App. 510-511.  But the letter said that Merck's proposed Warnings and Precautions language, which focused on \"the risk factors for stress fractures,\" was \"inadequate\" because \"[i]dentification of 'stress fractures' may not be clearly related to the atypical subtrochanteric fractures that have been reported in the literature.\"  Id., at 511.  In accord with FDA regulations, the letter required Merck to take one of three actions: (1) \"[r]esubmit the application .\u00a0.\u00a0. , addressing all deficiencies identified in the complete response letter\"; (2) \"[w]ithdraw the application .\u00a0.\u00a0. without prejudice to a subsequent submission\"; or (3) \"[a]sk the agency to provide .\u00a0.\u00a0. an opportunity for a hearing,\" after which \"the agency will either approve\" or \"refuse to approve the application.\"  21 CFR \u00a7314.110(b); see App. 512.  As this regulation suggests and the FDA has explained, complete response letters merely \"infor[m] sponsors of changes that must be made before an application can be approved, with no implication as to the ultimate approvability of the application.\"  73 Fed. Reg. 39588 (2008) (emphasis added).  In other words, the 2009 letter neither marked \"the consummation of the agency's decisionmaking process\" nor determined Merck's \"rights or obligations.\"  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.\u00a0S. 154, 178 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Instead, it was \"of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.\"  Ibid.  Therefore, the letter was not a final agency action with the force of law, so it cannot be \"Law\" with pre-emptive effect.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Merck's argument that the 2009 letter and other agency communications suggest that the FDA would have denied a future labeling change fares no better: hypothetical agency action is not \"Law.\"  As Merck acknowledges, it could have resubmitted its PAS applications, sought a hearing, or changed its label at any time through the CBE process.  See Reply Brief 13.  Indeed, when Merck instead decided to withdraw its PAS applications, it added atypical femoral fractures to the Adverse Reactions section through the CBE process.  That process also enabled Merck to add language to the Warnings and Precautions section, but Merck did not do so.  If it had, it could have satisfied its federal and alleged state-law duties--meaning that it was possible for Merck to independently satisfy both sets of duties.  Merck's belief that the FDA would have eventually rejected a CBE application does not make an earlier CBE change impossible.  As the Court correctly explains, \"\u00a0'the possibility of impossibility [is] not enough.'\u00a0\"  Ante, at 13-14.  The very point of the CBE process is that a manufacturer can \"unilaterally\" make a labeling change that does not violate other federal law, Wyeth, 555 U.\u00a0S., at 573; see id., at 570; e.g., 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7352, at least until the FDA rules on its application.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because Merck points to no statute, regulation, or other agency action with the force of law that would have prohibited it from complying with its alleged state-law duties, its pre-emption defense should fail as a matter of law.\n\nAlito, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-290\nMERCK SHARP & DOHME CORP., PETITIONER v. DORIS ALBRECHT, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit\n[May 20, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Kavanaugh join, concurring in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I concur in the judgment because I agree with the Court's decision on the only question that it actually decides, namely, that whether federal law allowed Merck to include in the Fosamax label the warning alleged to be required by state law is a question of law to be decided by the courts, not a question of fact.  I do not, however, join the opinion of the Court because I am concerned that its discussion of the law and the facts may be misleading on remand.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I begin with the law.  The Court correctly notes that a drug manufacturer may prove impossibility pre-emption by showing that \"federal law (including appropriate [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)] actions) prohibited the drug manufacturer from adding any and all warnings to the drug label that would satisfy state law.\"  Ante, at 13.  But in expounding further on the pre-emption analysis, the Court provides a skewed summary.  While dwelling on our decision in Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.\u00a0S. 555 (2009), see ante, at 9-14, the Court barely notes a statutory provision enacted after the underlying events in that case that may have an important bearing on the ultimate pre-emption analysis in this case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7355(o)(4)(A), which was enacted in 2007, Congress has imposed on the FDA a duty to initiate a label change \"[i]f the Secretary becomes aware of new information, including any new safety information .\u00a0.\u00a0. that the Secretary determines should be included in the labeling of the drug.\"1  This provision does not relieve drug manufacturers of their own responsibility to maintain their drug labels, see \u00a7355(o)(4)(I), but the FDA's \"actions,\" ante, at 13, taken pursuant to this duty arguably affect the pre-emption analysis.  This is so because, if the FDA declines to require a label change despite having received and considered information regarding a new risk, the logical conclusion is that the FDA determined that a label change was unjustified.  See United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U.\u00a0S. 1, 14-15 (1926) (\"The presumption of regularity supports the official acts of public officers and, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they have properly discharged their official duties\").  The FDA's duty does not depend on whether the relevant drug manufacturer, as opposed to some other entity or individual, brought the new information to the FDA's attention.  Cf. ante, at 13 (\"the drug manufacturer [must] show that it fully informed the FDA of the justifications for the warning required by state law\").  Nor does \u00a7355(o)(4)(A) require the FDA to communicate to the relevant drug manufacturer that a label change is unwarranted; instead, the FDA could simply consider the new information and decide not to act.  Cf. ante, at 13 (\"[T]he FDA, in turn, [must have] informed the drug manufacturer that the FDA would not approve changing the drug's label to include that warning\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 355(o)(4)(A) is thus highly relevant to the pre-emption analysis, which turns on whether \"federal law (including appropriate FDA actions) prohibited the drug manufacturer from adding any and all warnings to the drug label that would satisfy state law.\"  Ante, at 13 (emphasis added).  On remand, I assume that the Court of Appeals will consider the effect of \u00a7355(o)(4)(A) on the pre-emption issue in this case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two other aspects of the Court's discussion of the legal background must also be mentioned.  First, although the Court's discussion of the point is a bit opaque, the Court holds--correctly, in my view--that Wyeth's use of the phrase \"clear evidence\" was merely a rhetorical flourish.  As the Court explains, a judge, in determining whether federal law would permit a label change allegedly required by state law, \"must simply ask himself or herself whether the relevant federal and state laws 'irreconcilably conflic[t].'\u00a0\"  Ante, at 14 (quoting Rice v. Norman Williams Co., 458 U.\u00a0S. 654, 659 (1982)).  Standards of proof, such as preponderance of the evidence and clear and convincing evidence, have no place in the resolution of this question  of law.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, for reasons that entirely escape me, the Court refuses to acknowledge that there are two ways in which a drug manufacturer may attempt to alter a drug's label.  The Court notes that a manufacturer may proceed under the FDA's \" 'changes being effected'\u00a0\" or \" 'CBE'\u00a0\" regulation, which permits a manufacturer to change a label without prior FDA approval under some circumstances.  See ante, at 3-4, 14.  But the Court refuses to note that a manufacturer may (and, in many circumstances, must) submit a Prior Approval Supplement (PAS).  21 CFR \u00a7314.70(b) (2018).  As the name suggests, changes proposed in a  PAS must receive FDA approval before drug manufacturers may make the changes.  \u00a7314.70(b)(3).  And \"[h]istorically,\" the FDA has \"accepted PAS applications instead of CBE supplements, as occurred in this case, particularly where significant questions exist on whether to revise or how to modify existing drug labeling.\"  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 5.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I now turn to the facts.  Resolution of the legal question that the Court decides does not require much discussion of the facts, but if the Court wishes to include such a summary, its presentation should be balanced.  Instead, the Court provides a one-sided account.  For example, it highlights historical accounts dating back to the 1990s that purportedly linked atypical femoral fractures with Fosamax use, see ante, at 5, 7, but it omits any mention of the extensive communication between Merck and the FDA during the relevant period.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A reader of the Court's opinion will inevitably be left with the impression that, once the FDA rejected Merck's proposed warning in 2009, neither the FDA nor Merck took any other actions related to atypical femoral fractures \"until 2011,\" ante, at 6.  But that is simply not true.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While Merck's 2008 proposal was pending, the FDA remained in contact with Merck about the issue of atypical femoral fractures, which Merck, at the time, labeled as a type of stress fracture.  See, e.g., App. 707, 746-748.  An internal Merck memorandum describes a phone call in which an FDA official allegedly told Merck that \"[t]he conflicting nature of the literature does not provide a clear path forward, and more time will be need[ed] for FDA to formulate a formal opinion on the issue of a precaution around these data.\"  Id., at 767.  In an e-mail about a week later, another FDA official told Merck that the FDA would \"close out\" Merck's applications if Merck \"agree[d] to hold off on the [Precautions] language at this time.\"  Id., at 508.  The official went on to say that the FDA \"would then work with .\u00a0.\u00a0. Merck to decide on language for a [Precautions] atypical fracture language, if it is warranted.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, months after the FDA rejected Merck's proposed warning, the FDA issued a Safety Announcement regarding its \"[o]ngoing safety review of oral bisphosphonates and atypical subtrochanteric femur fractures.\"  Id., at 519.  The Safety Announcement stated that, \"[a]t this point, the data that FDA has reviewed have not shown a clear connection between bisphosphonate use and a risk of atypical subtrochanteric femur fractures.\"  Ibid.  Nonetheless, the Safety Announcement announced the FDA's intent to further study the issue alongside a task force formed to address the atypical fractures.  Id., at 519-520.  And the Safety Announcement concluded by admonishing healthcare professionals to \"continue to follow the recommendations in the drug label when prescribing oral bisphosphonates\" and patients to \"not stop taking their medication unless told to do so by their healthcare professional.\"  Id., at 520-521.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In September 2010, the task force published its report, which concluded that, although there was no established \"causal association\" between bisphosphonates and atypical femoral fractures, \"recent observations suggest that the risk rises with increasing duration of exposure, and there is concern that lack of awareness and underreporting may mask the true incidence of the problem.\"  Id., at 284.  The same day, the FDA issued a statement acknowledging the task force report and committing to \"considering label revisions.\"  Id., at 523-525.  And in October 2010, the FDA issued another Safety Announcement in which the FDA stated that it would initiate changes in the Precautions section of bisphosphonate drug labels to warn of atypical femoral fractures.  Id., at 246-249.  It was not until then that, pursuant to its \u00a7355(o)(4)(A) obligations, the FDA instructed Merck to include a warning about such fractures in its Fosamax drug labels.  Id., at 526-534.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, for years the FDA was: aware of this issue, communicating with drug manufacturers, studying all relevant information, and instructing healthcare professionals and patients alike to continue to use Fosamax as directed.  For this reason, the FDA itself, speaking through the Solicitor General, takes the position that the FDA's decision not to require a label change prior to October 2010 reflected the FDA's \"determin[ation]\" that a new warning \"should [not] be included in the labeling of the drug,\" \u00a7355(o)(4)(A).  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 30, 33-34.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, I concur in the judgment only.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1In 2007, Congress \"granted the FDA statutory authority to require a manufacturer to change its drug label based on safety information that becomes available after a drug's initial approval,\" but even after this amendment, brand-name-drug \"manufacturers remain responsible for updating their labels.\"  Wyeth, 555 U.\u00a0S., at 567-568; see 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7355(o)(4).  As I understand the Court's opinion, if proper agency actions pursuant to this amendment, or other federal law, \"prohibited the drug manufacturer from .\u00a0.\u00a0. satisfy[ing] state law,\" state law would be pre-empted under our impossibility precedents regardless of whether the manufacturer \"show[ed] that it fully informed the FDA of the justifications for the warning required by state law.\"  Ante, at 13; see, e.g., Wyeth, 555 U.\u00a0S., at 576; id., at 582 (Breyer, J., concurring).  Of course, the only proper agency actions are those \"that are set forth in, or necessarily follow from, the statutory text,\" and they must have the force of law to be pre-emptive.  Id., at 586 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  I am aware of no such agency action here that prevented Merck from complying with state law.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1Prior to October 2018, \u00a7355(o)(4)(A)'s language contained slight differences not relevant here.

TEMPNOLOGY, LLC, NKA OLD COLD LLC(2019)\nNo. 17-1657\nArgued: February 20, 2019Decided: May 20, 2019\n\n\nPetitioner Mission Product Holdings, Inc., entered into a contract with Respondent Tempnology, LLC, which gave Mission a license to use Tempnology's trademarks in connection with the distribution of certain clothing and accessories.  Tempnology filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and sought to reject its agreement with Mission.  Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code enables a debtor to \"reject any executory contract\"--meaning a contract that neither party has finished performing.  11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7365(a).  It further provides that rejection \"constitutes a breach of such contract.\"  \u00a7365(g).  The Bankruptcy Court approved Tempnology's rejection and further held that the rejection terminated Mission's rights to use Tempnology's trademarks.  The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel reversed, relying on Section 365(g)'s statement that rejection \"constitutes a breach\" to hold that rejection does not terminate rights that would survive a breach of contract outside bankruptcy.  The First Circuit rejected the Panel's judgment and reinstated the Bankruptcy Court's decision.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0This case is not moot.  Mission presents a plausible claim for money damages arising from its inability to use Tempnology's trademarks, which is sufficient to preserve a live controversy.  See Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.\u00a0S. 165, 172.  Tempnology's various arguments that Mission is not entitled to damages do not so clearly preclude recovery as to render this case moot.  Pp.\u00a06-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0A debtor's rejection of an executory contract under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code has the same effect as a breach of that contract outside bankruptcy.  Such an act cannot rescind rights that the contract previously granted.  Pp.\u00a07-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a) Section 365(g) provides that rejection \"constitutes a breach.\"  And \"breach\" is neither a defined nor a specialized bankruptcy term--it means in the Code what it means in contract law outside bankruptcy.  See Field v. Mans, 516 U.\u00a0S. 59, 69.  Outside bankruptcy, a licensor's breach cannot revoke continuing rights given to a counterparty under a contract (assuming no special contract term or state law).  And because rejection \"constitutes a breach,\" the same result must follow from rejection in bankruptcy.  In preserving a counterparty's rights, Section 365 reflects the general bankruptcy rule that the estate cannot possess anything more than the debtor did outside bankruptcy.  See Board of Trade of Chicago v. Johnson, 264 U.\u00a0S. 1, 15.  And conversely, allowing rejection to rescind a counterparty's rights would circumvent the Code's stringent limits on \"avoidance\" actions--the exceptional cases in which debtors may unwind pre-bankruptcy transfers that undermine the bankruptcy process.  See, e.g., \u00a7548(a).  Pp.\u00a08-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Tempnology's principal counterargument rests on a negative inference drawn from provisions of Section 365 identifying categories of contracts under which a counterparty may retain specified rights after rejection.  See \u00a7\u00a7365(h), (i), (n).  Tempnology argues that these provisions indicate that the ordinary consequence of rejection must be something different--i.e., the termination of contractual rights previously granted.  But that argument offers no account of how to read Section 365(g) (rejection \"constitutes a breach\") to say essentially its opposite.  And the provisions Tempnology treats as a reticulated scheme of exceptions each emerged at a different time and responded to a discrete problem--as often as not, correcting a judicial ruling of just the kind Tempnology urges.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tempnology's remaining argument turns on how the special features of trademark law may affect the fulfillment of the Code's goals.  Unless rejection terminates a licensee's right to use a trademark, Tempnology argues, a debtor must choose between monitoring the goods sold under a license or risking the loss of its trademark, either of which would impede a debtor's ability to reorganize.  But the distinctive features of trademarks do not persuade this Court to adopt a construction of Section 365 that will govern much more than trademark licenses.  And Tempnology's plea to facilitate reorganizations cannot overcome what Section 365(a) and (g) direct.  In delineating the burdens a debtor may and may not escape, Section 365's edict that rejection is breach expresses a more complex set of aims than Tempnology acknowledges.

TEMPNOLOGY, LLC, nka OLD COLD LLC\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit\n[May 20, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code enables a debtor to \"reject any executory contract\"--meaning a contract that neither party has finished performing.  11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7365(a).  The section further provides that a debtor's rejection of a contract under that authority \"constitutes a breach of such contract.\"  \u00a7365(g).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today we consider the meaning of those provisions in the context of a trademark licensing agreement.  The question is whether the debtor-licensor's rejection of that contract deprives the licensee of its rights to use the trademark.  We hold it does not.  A rejection breaches a contract but does not rescind it.  And that means all the rights that would ordinarily survive a contract breach, including those conveyed here, remain in place.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case arises from a licensing agreement gone wrong.  Respondent Tempnology, LLC, manufactured clothing and accessories designed to stay cool when used in exercise.  It marketed those products under the brand name \"Coolcore,\" using trademarks (e.g., logos and labels) to distinguish the gear from other athletic apparel.  In 2012, Tempnology entered into a contract with petitioner Mission Product Holdings, Inc.  See App. 203-255.  The agreement gave Mission an exclusive license to distribute certain Coolcore products in the United States.  And more important here, it granted Mission a non-exclusive license to use the Coolcore trademarks, both in the United States and around the world.  The agreement was set to expire in July 2016.  But in September 2015, Tempnology filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  And it soon afterward asked the Bankruptcy Court to allow it to \"reject\" the licensing agreement.  \u00a7365(a).             \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code sets out a framework for reorganizing a bankrupt business.  See \u00a7\u00a71101-1174.  The filing of a petition creates a bankruptcy estate consisting of all the debtor's assets and rights.  See \u00a7541.  The estate is the pot out of which creditors' claims are paid.  It is administered by either a trustee or, as in this case, the debtor itself.  See \u00a7\u00a71101, 1107.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 365(a) of the Code provides that a \"trustee [or debtor], subject to the court's approval, may assume or reject any executory contract.\"  \u00a7365(a).  A contract is executory if \"performance remains due to some extent on both sides.\"  NLRB v. Bildisco & Bildisco, 465 U.\u00a0S. 513, 522, n. 6 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Such an agreement represents both an asset (the debtor's right to the counterparty's future performance) and a liability (the debtor's own obligations to perform).  Section 365(a) enables the debtor (or its trustee), upon entering bankruptcy, to decide whether the contract is a good deal for the estate going forward.  If so, the debtor will want to assume the contract, fulfilling its obligations while benefiting from the counterparty's performance.  But if not, the debtor will want to reject the contract, repudiating any further performance of its duties.  The bankruptcy court will generally approve that choice, under the deferential \"business judgment\" rule.  Id., at 523.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Section 365(g), \"the rejection of an executory contract[\u00a0] constitutes a breach of such contract.\"  As both parties here agree, the counterparty thus has a claim against the estate for damages resulting from the debtor's nonperformance.  See Brief for Petitioner 17, 19; Brief for Respondent 30-31.  But such a claim is unlikely to ever be paid in full.  That is because the debtor's breach is deemed to occur \"immediately before the date of the filing of the [bankruptcy] petition,\" rather than on the actual post-petition rejection date.  \u00a7365(g)(1).  By thus giving the counterparty a pre-petition claim, Section 365(g) places that party in the same boat as the debtor's unsecured creditors, who in a typical bankruptcy may receive only cents on the dollar.  See Bildisco, 465 U.\u00a0S., at 531-532 (noting the higher priority of post-petition claims).     \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, the Bankruptcy Court (per usual) approved Tempnology's proposed rejection of its executory licensing agreement with Mission.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 83-84.  That meant, as laid out above, two things on which the parties agree.  First, Tempnology could stop performing under the contract.  And second, Mission could assert (for whatever it might be worth) a pre-petition claim in the bankruptcy proceeding for damages resulting from Tempnology's nonperformance.    \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Tempnology thought still another consequence ensued, and it returned to the Bankruptcy Court for a declaratory judgment confirming its view.  According to Tempnology, its rejection of the contract also terminated the rights it had granted Mission to use the Coolcore trademarks.  Tempnology based its argument on a negative inference.  See Motion in No. 15-11400 (Bkrtcy. Ct. NH), pp.\u00a09-14.  Several provisions in Section 365 state that a counterparty to specific kinds of agreements may keep exercising contractual rights after a debtor's rejection.  For example, Section 365(h) provides that if a bankrupt landlord rejects a lease, the tenant need not move out; instead, she may stay and pay rent (just as she did before) until the lease term expires.  And still closer to home, Section 365(n) sets out a similar rule for some types of intellectual property licenses: If the debtor-licensor rejects the agreement, the licensee can continue to use the property (typically, a patent), so long as it makes whatever payments the contract demands.  But Tempnology pointed out that neither Section 365(n) nor any similar provision covers trademark licenses.  So, it reasoned, in that sort of contract a different rule must apply: The debtor's rejection must extinguish the rights that the agreement had conferred on the trademark licensee.  The Bankruptcy Court agreed.  See In\u00a0re Tempnology, LLC, 541 B.\u00a0R. 1 (Bkrtcy. Ct. NH 2015).  It held, relying on the same \"negative inference,\" that Tempnology's rejection of the licensing agreement revoked Mission's right to use the Coolcore marks.  Id., at 7.                     \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel reversed, relying heavily on a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit about the effects of rejection on trademark licensing agreements.  See In\u00a0re Tempnology, LLC, 559 B.\u00a0R. 809, 820-823 (Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA1 2016); Sunbeam Products, Inc. v. Chicago Am. Mfg., LLC, 686 F.\u00a03d 372, 376-377 (CA7 2012).  Rather than reason backward from Section 365(n) or similar provisions, the Panel focused on Section 365(g)'s statement that rejection of a contract \"constitutes a breach.\"  Outside bankruptcy, the court explained, the breach of an agreement does not eliminate rights the contract had already conferred on the non-breaching party.  See 559 B.\u00a0R., at 820.  So neither could a rejection of an agreement in bankruptcy have that effect.  A rejection \"convert[s]\" a \"debtor's unfulfilled obligations\" to a pre-petition damages claim.  Id., at 822 (quoting Sunbeam, 686 F.\u00a03d, at 377).  But it does not \"terminate the contract\" or \"vaporize[\u00a0]\" the counterparty's rights.  559 B.\u00a0R., at 820, 822 (quoting Sunbeam, 686 F.\u00a03d, at 377).  Mission could thus continue to use the Coolcore trademarks.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit rejected the Panel's and Seventh Circuit's view, and reinstated the Bankruptcy Court decision terminating Mission's license.  See In\u00a0re Tempnology, LLC, 879 F.\u00a03d 389 (2018).  The majority first endorsed that court's inference from  Section 365(n) and similar provisions.  It next reasoned that special features of trademark law counsel against allowing a licensee to retain rights to a mark after the licensing agreement's rejection.  Under that body of law, the majority stated, the trademark owner's \"[f]ailure to monitor and exercise [quality] control\" over goods associated with a trademark \"jeopardiz[es] the continued validity of [its] own trademark rights.\"  Id., at 402.  So if (the majority continued) a licensee can keep using a mark after an agreement's rejection, the licensor will need to carry on its monitoring activities.  And according to the majority, that would frustrate \"Congress's principal aim in providing for rejection\": to \"release the debtor's estate from burdensome obligations.\"  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Judge Torruella dissented, mainly for the Seventh Circuit's reasons.  See id., at 405-407.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to resolve the division between the First and Seventh Circuits.  586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).  We now affirm the Seventh's reasoning and reverse the decision below.1\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before reaching the merits, we pause to consider Tempnology's claim that this case is moot.  Under settled law, we may dismiss the case for that reason only if \"it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever\" to Mission assuming it prevails.  Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.\u00a0S. 165, 172 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).  That demanding standard is not met here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mission has presented a claim for money damages--essentially lost profits--arising from its inability to use the Coolcore trademarks between the time Tempnology rejected the licensing agreement and its scheduled expiration date.  See Reply Brief 22, and n.\u00a08.  Such claims, if at all plausible, ensure a live controversy.  See Memphis Light, Gas & Water Div. v. Craft, 436 U.\u00a0S. 1, 8-9 (1978).  For better or worse, nothing so shows a continuing stake in a dispute's outcome as a demand for dollars and cents.  See 13C C. Wright, A. Miller & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a73533.3, p. 2 (3d ed. 2008) (Wright & Miller) (\"[A] case is not moot so long as a claim for monetary relief survives\").  Ultimate recovery on that demand may be uncertain or even unlikely for any number of reasons, in this case as in others.  But that is of no moment.  If there is any chance of money changing hands, Mission's suit remains live.  See Chafin, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 172.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tempnology makes a flurry of arguments about why Mission is not entitled to damages, but none so clearly precludes recovery as to make this case moot.  First, Tempnology contends that Mission suffered no injury because it \"never used the trademark[s] during [the post-rejection] period.\"  Brief for Respondent 24; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 33.  But that gets things backward.  Mission's non-use of the marks during that time is precisely what gives rise to its damages claim; had it employed the marks, it would not have lost any profits.  So next, Tempnology argues that Mission's non-use was its own \"choice,\" for which damages cannot lie.  See id., at 26.  But recall that the Bankruptcy Court held that Mission could not use the marks after rejection (and its decision remained in effect through the agreement's expiration).  See supra, at 4.  And although (as Tempnology counters) the court issued \"no injunction,\" Brief for Respondent 26, that difference does not matter: Mission need not have flouted a crystal-clear ruling and courted yet more legal trouble to preserve its claim.  Cf. 13B Wright & Miller \u00a73533.2.2, at 852 (\"[C]ompliance [with a judicial decision] does not moot [a case] if it remains possible to undo the effects of compliance,\" as through compensation).  So last, Tempnology claims that it bears no blame (and thus should not have to pay) for Mission's injury because all it did was \"ask[\u00a0] the court to make a ruling.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 34-35.  But whether Tempnology did anything to Mission amounting to a legal wrong is a prototypical merits question, which no court has addressed and which has no obvious answer.  That means it is no reason to find this case moot.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so too for Tempnology's further argument that Mission will be unable to convert any judgment in its favor to hard cash.  Here, Tempnology notes that the bankruptcy estate has recently distributed all of its assets, leaving nothing to satisfy Mission's judgment.  See Brief for Respondent 27.  But courts often adjudicate disputes whose \"practical impact\" is unsure at best, as when \"a defendant is insolvent.\"  Chafin, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 175.  And Mission notes that if it prevails, it can seek the unwinding of prior distributions to get its fair share of the estate.  See Reply Brief 23.  So although this suit \"may not make [Mission] rich,\" or even better off, it remains a live controversy--allowing us to proceed.  Chafin, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 176.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is the effect of a debtor's (or trustee's) rejection of a contract under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code?  The parties and courts of appeals have offered us two starkly different answers.  According to one view, a rejection has the same consequence as a contract breach outside bankruptcy: It gives the counterparty a claim for damages, while leaving intact the rights the counterparty has received under the contract.  According to the other view, a rejection (except in a few spheres) has more the effect of a contract rescission in the non-bankruptcy world: Though also allowing a damages claim, the rejection terminates the whole agreement along with all rights it conferred.  Today, we hold that both Section 365's text and fundamental principles of bankruptcy law command the first, rejection-as-breach approach.  We reject the competing claim that by specifically enabling the counterparties in some contracts to retain rights after rejection, Congress showed that it wanted the counterparties in all other contracts to lose their rights.  And we reject an argument for the rescission approach turning on the distinctive features of trademark licenses.  Rejection of a contract--any contract--in bankruptcy operates not as a rescission but as a breach.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We start with the text of the Code's principal provisions on rejection--and find that it does much of the work.  As noted earlier, Section 365(a) gives a debtor the option, subject to court approval, to \"assume or reject any executory contract.\"  See supra, at 2.  And Section 365(g) describes what rejection means.  Rejection \"constitutes a breach of [an executory] contract,\" deemed to occur \"immediately before the date of the filing of the petition.\"  See supra, at 3.  Or said more pithily for current purposes, a rejection is a breach.  And \"breach\" is neither a defined nor a specialized bankruptcy term.  It means in the Code what it means in contract law outside bankruptcy.  See Field v. Mans, 516 U. S. 59, 69 (1995) (Congress generally meant for the Bankruptcy Code to \"incorporate the established meaning\" of \"terms that have accumulated settled meaning\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  So the first place to go in divining the effects of rejection is to non-bankruptcy contract law, which can tell us the effects of breach.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider a made-up executory contract to see how the law of breach works outside bankruptcy.  A dealer leases a photocopier to a law firm, while agreeing to service it every month; in exchange, the firm commits to pay a monthly fee.  During the lease term, the dealer decides to stop servicing the machine, thus breaching the agreement in a material way.  The law firm now has a choice (assuming no special contract term or state law).  The firm can keep up its side of the bargain, continuing to pay for use of the copier, while suing the dealer for damages from the service breach.  Or the firm can call the whole deal off, halting its own payments and returning the copier, while suing for any damages incurred.  See 13 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts \u00a739:32, pp. 701-702 (4th ed. 2013) (\"[W]hen a contract is breached in the course of performance, the injured party may elect to continue the contract or refuse to perform further\").  But to repeat: The choice to terminate the agreement and send back the copier is for the law firm.  By contrast, the dealer has no ability, based on its own breach, to terminate the agreement.  Or otherwise said, the dealer cannot get back the copier just by refusing to show up for a service appointment.  The contract gave the law firm continuing rights in the copier, which the dealer cannot unilaterally revoke.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And now to return to bankruptcy: If the rejection of the photocopier contract \"constitutes a breach,\" as the Code says, then the same results should follow (save for one twist as to timing).  Assume here that the dealer files a Chapter 11 petition and decides to reject its agreement with the law firm.  That means, as above, that the dealer will stop servicing the copier.  It means, too, that the law firm has an option about how to respond--continue the contract or walk away, while suing for whatever damages go with its choice.  (Here is where the twist comes in: Because the rejection is deemed to occur \"immediately before\" bankruptcy, the firm's damages suit is treated as a pre-petition claim on the estate, which will likely receive only cents on the dollar.  See supra, at 3.)  And most important, it means that assuming the law firm wants to keep using the copier, the dealer cannot take it back.  A rejection does not terminate the contract.  When it occurs, the debtor and counterparty do not go back to their pre-contract positions.  Instead, the counterparty retains the rights it has received under the agreement.  As after a breach, so too after a rejection, those rights survive.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All of this, it will hardly surprise you to learn, is not just about photocopier leases.  Sections 365(a) and (g) speak broadly, to \"any executory contract[s].\"  Many licensing agreements involving trademarks or other property are of that kind (including, all agree, the Tempnology-Mission contract).  The licensor not only grants a license, but provides associated goods or services during its term; the licensee pays continuing royalties or fees.  If the licensor breaches the agreement outside bankruptcy (again, barring any special contract term or state law), everything said above goes.  In particular, the breach does not revoke the license or stop the licensee from doing what it allows.  See, e.g., Sunbeam, 686 F.\u00a03d, at 376 (\"Outside of bankruptcy, a licensor's breach does not terminate a licensee's right to use [the licensed] intellectual property\").  And because rejection \"constitutes a breach,\" \u00a7365(g), the same consequences follow in bankruptcy.  The debtor can stop performing its remaining obligations under the agreement.  But the debtor cannot rescind the license already conveyed.  So the licensee can continue to do whatever the license authorizes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In preserving those rights, Section 365 reflects a general bankruptcy rule: The estate cannot possess anything more than the debtor itself did outside bankruptcy.  See Board of Trade of Chicago v. Johnson, 264 U.\u00a0S. 1, 15 (1924) (establishing that principle); \u00a7541(a)(1) (defining the estate to include the \"interests of the debtor in property\" (emphasis added)).  As one bankruptcy scholar has put the point: Whatever \"limitation[s] on the debtor's property [apply] outside of bankruptcy[\u00a0] appl[y] inside of bankruptcy as well.  A debtor's property does not shrink by happenstance of bankruptcy, but it does not expand, either.\"  D. Baird, Elements of Bankruptcy 97 (6th ed. 2014).  So if the not-yet debtor was subject to a counterparty's contractual right (say, to retain a copier or use a trademark), so too is the trustee or debtor once the bankruptcy petition has been filed.  The rejection-as-breach rule (but not the rejection-as-rescission rule) ensures that result.  By insisting that the same counterparty rights survive rejection as survive breach, the rule prevents a debtor in bankruptcy from recapturing interests it had given up.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And conversely, the rejection-as-rescission approach would circumvent the Code's stringent limits on \"avoidance\" actions--the exceptional cases in which trustees (or debtors) may indeed unwind pre-bankruptcy transfers that undermine the bankruptcy process.  The most notable example is for fraudulent conveyances--usually, something-for-nothing transfers that deplete the estate (and so cheat creditors) on the eve of bankruptcy.  See \u00a7548(a).  A trustee's avoidance powers are laid out in a discrete set of sections in the Code, see \u00a7\u00a7544-553, far away from Section 365.  And they can be invoked in only narrow circumstances--unlike the power of rejection, which may be exercised for any plausible economic reason.  See, e.g., \u00a7548(a) (describing the requirements for avoiding fraudulent transfers); supra, at 2-3.  If trustees (or debtors) could use rejection to rescind previously granted interests, then rejection would become functionally equivalent to avoidance.  Both, that is, would roll back a prior transfer.  And that result would subvert everything the Code does to keep avoidances cabined--so they do not threaten the rule that the estate can take only what the debtor possessed before filing.  Again, then, core tenets of bankruptcy law push in the same direction as Section 365's text: Rejection is breach, and has only its consequences.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tempnology's main argument to the contrary, here as in the courts below, rests on a negative inference.  See Brief for Respondent 33-41; supra, at 3-4.  Several provisions of Section 365, Tempnology notes, \"identif[y] categories of contracts under which a counterparty\" may retain specified contract rights \"notwithstanding rejection.\"  Brief for Respondent 34.  Sections 365(h) and (i) make clear that certain purchasers and lessees of real property and timeshare interests can continue to exercise rights after a debtor has rejected the lease or sales contract.  See \u00a7365(h)(1) (real-property leases); \u00a7365(i) (real-property sales contracts); \u00a7\u00a7365(h)(2), (i) (timeshare interests).  And Section 365(n) similarly provides that licensees of some intellectual property--but not trademarks--retain contractual rights after rejection.  See \u00a7365(n); \u00a7101(35A); supra, at 4.  Tempnology argues from those provisions that the ordinary consequence of rejection must be something different--i.e., the termination, rather than survival, of contractual rights previously granted.  Otherwise, Tempnology concludes, the statute's \"general rule\" would \"swallow the exceptions.\"  Brief for Respondent 19.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But that argument pays too little heed to the main provisions governing rejection and too much to subsidiary ones.  On the one hand, it offers no account of how to read Section 365(g) (recall, rejection \"constitutes a breach\") to say essentially its opposite (i.e., that rejection and breach have divergent consequences).  On the other hand, it treats as a neat, reticulated scheme of \"narrowly tailored exception[s],\" id., at 36 (emphasis deleted), what history reveals to be anything but.  Each of the provisions Tempnology highlights emerged at a different time, over a span of half a century.  See, e.g., 52 Stat. 881 (1938) (real-property leases); \u00a71(b), 102 Stat. 2538 (1988) (intellectual property).  And each responded to a discrete problem--as often as not, correcting a judicial ruling of just the kind Tempnology urges.  See Andrew, Executory Contracts in Bankruptcy, 59 U. Colo. L. Rev. 845, 911-912, 916-919 (1988) (identifying judicial decisions that the provisions overturned); compare, e.g., In re Sombrero Reef Club, Inc., 18 B. R. 612, 618-619 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SD Fla. 1982), with, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7365(h)(2), (i).  Read as generously as possible to Tempnology, this mash-up of legislative interventions says nothing much of anything about the content of Section 365(g)'s general rule.  Read less generously, it affirmatively refutes Tempnology's rendition.  As one bankruptcy scholar noted after an exhaustive review of the history: \"What the legislative record [reflects] is that whenever Congress has been confronted with the consequences of the [view that rejection terminates all contractual rights], it has expressed its disapproval.\"  Andrew, 59 U. Colo. L. Rev., at 928.  On that account, Congress enacted the provisions, as and when needed, to reinforce or clarify the general rule that contractual rights survive rejection.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider more closely, for example, Congress's enactment of Section 365(n), which addresses certain intellectual property licensing agreements.  No one disputes how that provision came about.  In Lubrizol Enterprises v. Richmond Metal Finishers, the Fourth Circuit held that a debtor's rejection of an executory contract worked to revoke its grant of a patent license.  See 756 F. 2d 1043, 1045-1048 (1985).  In other words, Lubrizol adopted the same rule for patent licenses that the First Circuit announced for trademark licenses here.  Congress sprang into action, drafting Section 365(n) to reverse Lubrizol and ensure the continuation of patent (and some other intellectual property) licensees' rights.  See 102 Stat. 2538 (1988); S. Rep. No. 100-505, pp.\u00a02-4 (1988) (explaining that Section 365(n) \"corrects [Lubrizol's] perception\" that \"Section 365 was ever intended to be a mechanism for stripping innocent licensee[s] of rights\").  As Tempnology highlights, that provision does not cover trademark licensing agreements, which continue to fall, along with most other contracts, within Section 365(g)'s general rule.  See Brief for Respondent 38.  But what of that?  Even put aside the claim that Section 365(n) is part of a pattern--that Congress whacked Tempnology's view of rejection wherever it raised its head.  See supra, at 13.  Still, Congress's repudiation of Lubrizol for patent contracts does not show any intent to ratify that decision's approach for almost all others.  Which is to say that no negative inference arises.  Congress did nothing in adding Section 365(n) to alter the natural reading of Section 365(g)--that rejection and breach have the same results.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tempnology's remaining argument turns on the way special features of trademark law may affect the fulfillment of the Code's goals.  Like the First Circuit below, Tempnology here focuses on a trademark licensor's duty to monitor and \"exercise quality control over the goods and services sold\" under a license.  Brief for Respondent 20; see supra, at 5.  Absent those efforts to keep up quality, the mark will naturally decline in value and may eventually become altogether invalid.  See 3 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition \u00a718:48, pp.\u00a018-129, 18-133 (5th ed. 2018).  So (Tempnology argues) unless rejection of a trademark licensing agreement terminates the licensee's rights to use the mark, the debtor will have to choose between expending scarce resources on quality control and risking the loss of a valuable asset.  See Brief for Respondent 59.  \"Either choice,\" Tempnology concludes, \"would impede a [debtor's] ability to reorganize,\" thus \"undermining a fundamental purpose of the Code.\"  Id., at 59-60.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To begin with, that argument is a mismatch with Tempnology's reading of Section 365.  The argument is trademark-specific.  But Tempnology's reading of Section 365 is not.  Remember, Tempnology construes that section to mean that a debtor's rejection of a contract terminates the counterparty's rights \"unless the contract falls within an express statutory exception.\"  Id., at 27-28; see supra, at 12.  That construction treats trademark agreements identically to most other contracts; the only agreements getting different treatment are those falling within the discrete provisions just discussed.  And indeed, Tempnology could not have discovered, however hard it looked, any trademark-specific rule in Section 365.  That section's special provisions, as all agree, do not mention trademarks; and the general provisions speak, well, generally.  So Tempnology is essentially arguing that distinctive features of trademarks should persuade us to adopt a construction of Section 365 that will govern not just trademark agreements, but pretty nearly every executory contract.  However serious Tempnology's trademark-related concerns, that would allow the tail to wag the Doberman.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And even putting aside that incongruity, Tempnology's plea to facilitate trademark licensors' reorganizations cannot overcome what Sections 365(a) and (g) direct.  The Code of course aims to make reorganizations possible.  But it does not permit anything and everything that might advance that goal.  See, e.g., Florida Dept. of Revenue v. Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 554 U.\u00a0S. 33, 51 (2008) (observing that in enacting Chapter 11, Congress did not have \"a single purpose,\" but \"str[uck] a balance\" among multiple competing interests (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Here, Section 365 provides a debtor like Tempnology with a powerful tool: Through rejection, the debtor can escape all of its future contract obligations, without having to pay much of anything in return.  See supra, at 3.  But in allowing rejection of those contractual duties, Section 365 does not grant the debtor an exemption from all the burdens that generally applicable law--whether involving contracts or trademarks--imposes on property owners.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7959(b) (requiring a trustee to manage the estate in accordance with applicable law).  Nor does Section 365 relieve the debtor of the need, against the backdrop of that law, to make economic decisions about preserving the estate's value--such as whether to invest the resources needed to maintain a trademark.  In thus delineating the burdens that a debtor may and may not escape, Congress also weighed (among other things) the legitimate interests and expectations of the debtor's counterparties.  The resulting balance may indeed impede some reorganizations, of trademark licensors and others.  But that is only to say that Section 365's edict that rejection is breach expresses a more complex set of aims than Tempnology acknowledges.  \nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated above, we hold that under Section 365, a debtor's rejection of an executory contract in bankruptcy has the same effect as a breach outside bankruptcy.  Such an act cannot rescind rights that the contract previously granted.  Here, that construction of Section 365 means that the debtor-licensor's rejection cannot revoke the trademark license.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nSotomayor, J., concurring\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1657\nMISSION PRODUCT HOLDINGS, INC., PETITIONER v. TEMPNOLOGY, LLC, nka OLD COLD LLC\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit\n[May 20, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor, concurring.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I agree with the Court that a debtor's choice to reject an executory contact under 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7365(a) functions as a breach of the contract rather than unwinding the rejected contract as if it never existed.  Ante, at 8-10.  This result follows from traditional bankruptcy principles and from the general rule set out in \u00a7365(g) of the Bankruptcy Code.  I also agree that no specific aspects of trademark law compel a contrary rule that equates rejection with rescission.  I therefore join the Court's opinion in full.  I write separately to highlight two potentially significant features of today's holding.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Court does not decide that every trademark licensee has the unfettered right to continue using licensed marks postrejection.  The Court granted certiorari to decide whether rejection \"terminates rights of the licensee that would survive the licensor's breach under applicable nonbankruptcy law.\"  Pet. for Cert. i.  The answer is no, for the reasons the Court explains.  But the baseline inquiry remains whether the licensee's rights would survive a breach under applicable nonbankruptcy law.  Special terms in a licensing contract or state law could bear on that question in individual cases.  See ante, at 9-10; Brief for American Intellectual Property Law Association as Amicus Curiae 20-25 (discussing examples of contract terms that could potentially lead a bankruptcy court to limit licensee rights postrejection).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the Court's holding confirms that trademark licensees' postrejection rights and remedies are more expansive in some respects than those possessed by licensees of other types of intellectual property.  Those variances stem from \u00a7365(n), one of several subject-specific provisions in the Bankruptcy Code that \"embellis[h] on or twea[k]\" the general rejection rule.  Ante, at 13, n.\u00a02.  Section 365(n)--which  applies to patents, copyrights, and four other types of intellectual property, but not to trademarks, \u00a7101(35A)--alters the general rejection rule in several respects.  For example, a covered licensee that chooses to retain its rights postrejection must make all of its royalty payments; the licensee has no right to deduct damages from its payments even if it otherwise could have done so under nonbankruptcy law.  \u00a7365(n)(2)(C)(i).  This provision and others in \u00a7365(n) mean that the covered intellectual property types are governed by different rules than trademark licenses.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although these differences may prove significant for individual licensors and licensees, they do not alter the outcome here.  The Court rightly rejects Tempnology's argument that the presence of \u00a7365(n) changes what \u00a7365(g) says.  As the Senate Report accompanying \u00a7365(n) explained, the bill did not \"address or intend any inference to be drawn concerning the treatment of executory contracts\" under \u00a7365's general rule.  S. Rep. No. 100-505, p.\u00a05 (1988); see ante, at 14.  To the extent trademark licensees are treated differently from licensees of other forms of intellectual property, that outcome leaves Congress with the option to tailor a provision for trademark licenses, as it has repeatedly in other contexts.  See ante, at 13-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With these observations, I join the Court's opinion.\n\nGorsuch, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1657\nMISSION PRODUCT HOLDINGS, INC., PETITIONER v.

Under the Constitution, our power extends only to deciding \"Cases\" and \"Controversies\" where the outcome matters to real parties in the real world.  Art.\u00a0III, \u00a72.  Because it's unclear whether we have anything like that here, I would dismiss the petition as improvidently granted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case began when Mission licensed the right to use certain of Tempnology's trademarks.  After Tempnology entered bankruptcy, it sought and won from a bankruptcy court an order declaring that Mission could no longer use those trademarks.  On appeal and now in this Court, Mission seeks a ruling that the bankruptcy court's declaration was wrong.  But whoever is right about that, it isn't clear how it would make a difference: After the bank-ruptcy court ruled, the license agreement expired by its own terms, so nothing we might say here could restore Mission's ability to use Tempnology's trademarks.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recognizing that its original case seems to have become moot, Mission attempts an alternative theory in briefing before us.  Now Mission says that if it prevails here it will, on remand, seek money damages from Tempnology's estate for the profits it lost when, out of respect for the bankruptcy court's order, it refrained from using the trademarks while its license still existed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But it's far from clear whether even this theory can keep the case alive.  A damages claim \"suffices to avoid mootness only if viable,\" which means damages must at least be \"legally available for [the alleged] wrong.\"  13C C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a73533.3, p. 22 (3d ed. 2008).  Yet, as far as Mission has told us, Tempnology did nothing that could lawfully give rise to a damages claim.  After all, when Tempnology asked the bankruptcy court to issue a declaratory ruling on a question of law, it was exercising its protected \"First Amendment right to petition the Government for redress of grievances.\"  Bill Johnson's Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U.\u00a0S. 731, 741 (1983).  And petitioning a court normally isn't an actionable wrong that can give rise to a claim for damages.  Absent a claim of malice (which Mission hasn't suggested would have any basis here), the ordinary rule is that \"\u00a0'no action lies against a party for resort to civil courts'\u00a0\" or for \"the assertion of a legal argument.\"  Lucsik v. Board of Ed. of Brunswick City School Dist., 621 F.\u00a02d 841, 842 (CA6 1980) (per curiam); see, e.g., W.\u00a0R. Grace & Co. v. Rubber Workers, 461 U.\u00a0S. 757, 770, n.\u00a014 (1983); Russell v. Farley, 105 U.\u00a0S. 433, 437-438 (1882).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maybe Mission's able lawyers will conjure something better on remand.  But, so far at least, the company hasn't come close to articulating a viable legal theory on which a claim for damages could succeed.  And where our jurisdiction is so much in doubt, I would decline to proceed to the merits.  If the legal questions here are of sufficient importance, a live case presenting them will come along soon enough; there is no need to press the bounds of our constitutional authority to reach them today.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0In its briefing before this Court, Mission contends that its exclusive distribution rights survived the licensing agreement's rejection for the same reason as its trademark rights did.  See Brief for Petitioner 40-44; supra, at 2.  But the First Circuit held that Mission had waived that argument, see 879 F.\u00a03d, at 401, and we have no reason to doubt that conclusion.  Our decision thus affects only Mission's trademark rights.\nFootnote 2 At the same time, Congress took the opportunity when drafting those provisions to fill in certain details, generally left to state law, about the post-rejection relationship between the debtor and counterparty.  See, e.g., Andrew, Executory Contracts in Bankruptcy, 59 U. Colo. L. Rev. 845, 903, n. 200 (1988) (describing Congress's addition of subsidiary rules for real property leases in Section 365(h)); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29 (noting that Congress similarly set out detailed rules for patent licenses in Section 365(n)).  The provisions are therefore not redundant of Section 365(g): Each sets out a remedial scheme embellishing on or tweaking the general rejection-as-breach rule.\n\n\n","40":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOATH HAMZA AHMED AL-ALWI  v.

Indeed, in light of the \"unconventional nature\" of the \"war on terror,\" there was a \"substantial prospect\" that detention for the \"duration of the relevant conflict\" could amount to \"perpetual detention.\"  Id., at 519-521.  But as this was \"not the situation we face[d] as of th[at] date,\" the plurality reserved the question whether the AUMF or the Constitution would permit such a result.  Id., at 517-518.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my judgment, it is past time to confront the difficult question left open by Hamdi.  See Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.\u00a0S. 723, 797-798 (2008) (\"Because our Nation's past military conflicts have been of limited duration, it has been possible to leave the outer boundaries of war powers undefined.  If, as some fear, terrorism continues to pose dangerous threats to us for years to come, the Court might not have this luxury\"); Hussain v. Obama, 572 U.\u00a0S. 1079 (2014) (statement of Breyer, J., respecting denial of  certiorari).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some 17 years have elapsed since petitioner Moath Hamza Ahmed al-Alwi, a Yemeni national, was first held at the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  In the decision below, the District of Columbia Circuit agreed with the Government that it may continue to detain him so long as \"armed hostilities between United States forces and [the Taliban and al-Qaeda] persist.\"  901 F.\u00a03d 294, 298-299 (2018).  The Government represents that such hostilities are ongoing, but does not state that any end is in sight.  Brief in Opposition 4-5.  As a consequence, al-Alwi faces the real prospect that he will spend the rest of his life in detention based on his status as an enemy combatant a generation ago, even though today's conflict may differ substantially from the one Congress anticipated when it passed the AUMF, as well as those \"conflicts that informed the development of the law of war.\"  Hamdi, 542 U.\u00a0S., at 521 (plurality opinion).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The denial of a writ of certiorari imports no expression of opinion upon the merits of the case.\"  United States v. Carver, 260 U.\u00a0S. 482, 490 (1923).  I would, in an appropriate case, grant certiorari to address whether, in light of the duration and other aspects of the relevant conflict, Congress has authorized and the Constitution permits continued detention.\n\n\n\n","41":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMONT v. UNITED STATES(2019)\nNo. 17-8995\nArgued: February 26, 2019Decided: June 3, 2019\n\n\nPetitioner Mont was released from federal prison in 2012 and began a 5-year term of supervised release that was scheduled to end on March 6, 2017.  On June 1, 2016, he was arrested on state drug trafficking charges and has been in state custody since that time.  In October 2016, Mont pleaded guilty to state charges.  He then admitted in a filing in Federal District Court that he violated his supervised-release conditions by virtue of the new state convictions, and he requested a hearing.  The District Court scheduled a hearing for November, but later rescheduled it several times to allow the state court to first sentence Mont.  On March 21, 2017, Mont was sentenced to six years' imprisonment, and his roughly 10 months of pretrial custody were credited as time served.  On March 30, the District Court issued a warrant for Mont and set a supervised-release hearing.  Mont then challenged the District Court's jurisdiction on the ground that his supervised release had been set to expire on March 6.  The District Court ruled that it had jurisdiction under 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73583(i) based on a summons it had issued in November 2016.  It then revoked Mont's supervised release and ordered him to serve an additional 42 months' imprisonment to run consecutive to his state sentence.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed on alternative grounds, holding that Mont's supervised-release period was tolled under \u00a73624(e), which provides that a \"term of supervised release does not run during any period in which the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction for a .\u00a0.\u00a0. crime unless the imprisonment is for a period of less than 30 consecutive days.\"  Because the roughly 10 months of pretrial custody was \"in connection with [Mont's] conviction\" and therefore tolled the period of supervised release, the court concluded that there was ample time left on Mont's term of supervised release when the March warrant issued.\nHeld:\u00a0Pretrial detention later credited as time served for a new conviction is \"imprison[ment] in connection with a conviction\" and thus tolls the supervised-release term under \u00a73624(e), even if the court must make the tolling calculation after learning whether the time will be credited.  Pp.\u00a06-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The text of \u00a73624(e) compels this reading.  First, dictionary definitions of the term \"imprison,\" both now and at the time Congress created supervised release, may very well encompass pretrial detention, and Mont has not pressed any serious argument to the contrary.  Second, the phrase \"in connection with a conviction\" encompasses a period of pretrial detention for which a defendant receives credit against the sentence ultimately imposed.  \"In connection with\" can bear a \"broad interpretation,\" Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U.\u00a0S. 71, 85, but the outer bounds need not be determined here, as pretrial incarceration is directly tied to the conviction when it is credited toward the new sentence.  This reading is buttressed by the fact that Congress, like most States, instructs courts calculating a term of imprisonment to credit pretrial detention as time served on a subsequent conviction.  See \u00a73585(b)(1).  Third, the text undeniably requires courts to retrospectively calculate whether a period of pretrial detention should toll a period of supervised release by including the 30-day minimum.  The statute does not require courts to make a tolling determination as soon as a defendant is arrested on new charges or to continually reassess the tolling calculation throughout the pretrial-detention period.  Its 30-day minimum-incarceration threshold contemplates the opposite.  Pp.\u00a06-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The statutory context also supports this reading.  First, \u00a73624(e) provides that supervised release \"runs concurrently\" with \"probation or supervised release or parole for another offense,\" but excludes periods of \"imprison[ment]\" served \"in connection with a conviction.\"  This juxtaposition reinforces the fact that prison time is \"not interchangeable\" with supervised release, United States v. Johnson, 529 U.\u00a0S. 53, 59, and furthers the statutory design of \"successful[ly] transition[ing]\" a defendant from \"prison to liberty,\" Johnson v. United States, 529 U.\u00a0S. 694, 708-709.  Second, it would be an exceedingly odd construction of the statute to give a defendant the windfall of satisfying a new sentence of imprisonment and an old sentence of supervised release with the same period of pretrial detention.  Supervised release is a form of punishment prescribed along with a term of imprisonment as part of the same sentence.  And Congress denies defendants credit for time served if the detention time has already \"been credited against another sentence.\"  \u00a73585(b).  Pp.\u00a08-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Mont's argument that the statute's present tense forbids any backward looking tolling analysis confuses the rule with a court's analysis of whether that rule was satisfied.  The present-tense phrasing does not address whether a judge must be able to make a supervised-release determination at any given time.  Moreover, any uncertainty about whether supervised release is tolled matters little from either the court's or the defendant's perspective.  As for the court, the defendant need not be supervised when he is held in custody; as for the defendant, there is nothing unfair about not knowing during pretrial detention whether he is also under supervised release.  Pp.\u00a010-12.\n723 Fed. Appx. 325, affirmed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.\u00a0J., and Ginsburg, Alito, and Kavanaugh, JJ., joined.

MONT, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit\n[June 3, 2019]  \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case requires the Court to decide whether a convicted criminal's period of supervised release is tolled--in effect, paused--during his pretrial detention for a new criminal offense.  Specifically, the question is whether that pretrial detention qualifies as \"imprison[ment] in connection with a conviction for a Federal, State, or local crime.\"  18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73624(e).  Given the text and statutory context of \u00a73624(e),we conclude that if the court's later imposed sentence credits the period of pretrial detention as time served for the new offense, then the pretrial detention also tolls the supervised-release period.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2004, petitioner Jason Mont began distributing cocaine and crack cocaine in northern Ohio.  After substantial drug sales to a confidential informant and a search of his home that uncovered handguns and $2,700 in cash, a federal grand jury indicted Mont for multiple drug and firearm offenses.  He later pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, and to possessing a firearm and ammunition after having been convicted of a felony.  See 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(1) (2000 ed.); 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7841(a)(1), 846 (2000 ed.).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court sentenced Mont to 120 months' imprisonment, later reduced to 84 months, to be followed by 5 years of supervised release.  Mont was released from federal prison on March 6, 2012, and his supervised release was \"slated to end on March 6, 2017.\"  723 Fed. Appx. 325, 326 (CA6 2018); see 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73624(e) (a \"term of supervised release commences on the day the person is released from imprisonment\").  Among other standard conditions, Mont's supervised release required that he \"not commit another federal, state, or local crime,\" \"not illegally possess a controlled substance,\" and \"refrain from any unlawful use of a controlled substance.\"  Judgment in No. 4:05-cr-00229 (ND Ohio), Doc. 37, p. 111.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mont did not succeed on supervised release.  In March 2015, an Ohio grand jury charged him with two counts of marijuana trafficking in a sealed indictment.  Mont was arrested and released on bond while awaiting trial for those charges.  Things only got worse from there.  In October 2015, Mont tested positive for cocaine and oxycodone during a routine drug test conducted as part of his supervised release.  But Mont's probation officer did not immediately report these violations to the District Court; instead, the officer referred him for additional substance-abuse counseling.  Mont proceeded to test positive in five more random drug tests over the next few months.  He also used an \"\u00a0'unknown' liquid to try to pass two subsequent drug tests.\"  723 Fed. Appx., at 326.  In January 2016, Mont's probation officer finally reported the supervised-release violations, including Mont's use of drugs and attempts to adulterate his urine samples.  The violation report also informed the District Court about the pending state charges and the anticipated trial date of March 2016 in state court.  The District Court declined to issue an arrest warrant at that time, but it asked to \"\u00a0'be notified of the resolution of the state charges.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.; see 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73606 (explaining that the District Court \"may issue a warrant for the arrest\" of the releasee for \"violation of a condition of release\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On June 1, 2016, approximately four years and three months into his 5-year term of supervised release, Mont was arrested again on new state charges of trafficking in cocaine, and his bond was revoked on the earlier marijuana-trafficking charges.  He was incarcerated in the Mahoning County Jail and has remained in state custody since that date.  Mont's probation officer filed a report with the District Court stating that he had violated the terms of his release based on these new state offenses.  The officer later advised the court that because Mont's incarceration rendered him unavailable for supervision, the Probation Office was \"toll[ing]\" his federal supervision.  App. 21.  The officer promised to keep the court apprised of the pending state charges and stated that, if Mont were convicted, the officer would ask the court to take action at that time.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In October 2016, Mont entered into plea agreements with state prosecutors in exchange for a predetermined  6-year sentence.  The state trial court accepted Mont's guilty pleas on October 6, 2016, and set the cases for sentencing in December 2016.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Three weeks later, Mont filed a written admission in the District Court \"acknowledg[ing]\" that he had violated his conditions of supervised release \"by virtue of his conviction following guilty pleas to certain felony offenses\" in state court.  Record in No. 4:05-cr-00229 (ND Ohio), Doc. 92, p.\u00a0419.  Even though he had yet to be sentenced for the state offenses, Mont sought a hearing on the supervised-release violations at the court's \"earliest convenience.\"  Ibid.  The court initially scheduled a hearing for November 9, 2016, but then, over Mont's objection, rescheduled the hearing several times to allow for \"the conclusion of the State sentencing.\"  App. 8; 723 Fed. Appx., at 327.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On March 21, 2017, Mont was sentenced in state  court to six years' imprisonment.  The judge \"credited the roughly ten months that Mont had already been incarcerated pending a disposition as time served.\"  Id., at 327.  The District Court issued a warrant on March 30, 2017, and ultimately set a supervised-release hearing for June 28, 2017.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two days before that hearing, Mont challenged the jurisdiction of the District Court based on the fact that his supervised release had initially been set to expire on March 6, 2017.  The court concluded that it had authority to supervise Mont, revoked his supervised release, and ordered him to serve an additional 42 months' imprisonment to run consecutive to his state sentence.  The court held that it retained jurisdiction to revoke the release under 18 U. S. C. \u00a73583(i), which preserves, for a \"reasonably necessary\" period of time, the court's power to adjudicate violations and revoke a term of supervised release after the term has expired \"if, before its expiration, a warrant or summons has been issued on the basis of an allegation of such a violation.\"  The court further held that it retained authority to revoke Mont's term of supervised release because it gave \"notice by way of a summons\" on November 1, 2016, when it originally scheduled the hearing.  App. 22.  The court also concluded that the delay between the guilty pleas in October 2016 and the hearing date in June 2017 was \"reasonably necessary.\"  Id., at 24.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Sixth Circuit affirmed on alternative grounds.  The court could find no evidence in the record that a summons had issued within the meaning of \u00a73583(i).  723 Fed. Appx., at 329, n.\u00a05.  But because Circuit precedent provided an alternative basis for affirmance, the court did not further consider the Government's argument that the District Court retained jurisdiction under \u00a73583(i).  Instead, the court held that Mont's supervised-release period was tolled while he was held in pretrial detention in state custody under \u00a73624(e), which provides:\n\"(e) Supervision After Release.-- .\u00a0.\u00a0. The term of supervised release commences on the day the person is released from imprisonment and runs concurrently with any Federal, State, or local term of probation or supervised release or parole for another offense to which the person is subject or becomes subject during the term of supervised release.  A term of supervised release does not run during any period in which the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction for a Federal, State, or local crime unless the imprisonment is for a period of less than 30 consecutive days.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Relying on Circuit precedent, the Sixth Circuit explained that when a defendant is convicted of the offense for which he was held in pretrial detention for longer than 30 days and \"\u00a0'his pretrial detention is credited as time served toward his sentence, then the pretrial detention is \"in connection with\" a conviction and tolls the period of supervised release under \u00a73624.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 328 (quoting United States v. Goins, 516 F.\u00a03d 416, 417 (2008)).  Because Mont's term of supervised release had been tolled between June 2016 and March 2017, there was ample time left on his supervised-release term when the warrant issued on March 30, 2017.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Courts of Appeals disagree on whether \u00a73624(e) tolls supervised release for periods of pretrial detention lasting longer than 30 days when that incarceration is later credited as time served on a conviction.  Compare United States v. Ide, 624 F. 3d 666, 667 (CA4 2010)  (supervised-release period tolls); United States v. Molina-Gazca, 571 F. 3d 470, 474 (CA5 2009) (same); United States v. Johnson, 581 F. 3d 1310, 1312-1313 (CA11 2009) (same); Goins, supra, at 417 (same), with United States v. Marsh, 829 F. 3d 705, 709 (CADC 2016) (supervised-release period does not toll); United States v. Morales-Alejo, 193 F. 3d 1102, 1106 (CA9 1999) (same).  We granted certiorari to resolve this split of authority.  586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hold that pretrial detention later credited as time served for a new conviction is \"imprison[ment] in connection with a conviction\" and thus tolls the supervised-release term under \u00a73624(e).  This is so even if the court must make the tolling calculation after learning whether the time will be credited.  In our view, this reading is compelled by the text and statutory context of \u00a73624(e).\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 3624(e) provides for tolling when a person \"is imprisoned in connection with a conviction.\"  This phrase, sensibly read, includes pretrial detention credited toward another sentence for a new conviction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the definition of \"is imprisoned\" may well include pretrial detention.  Both now and at the time Congress created supervised release, see \u00a7212(a)(2), 98 Stat. 1999-2000, the term \"imprison\" has meant \"[t]o put in a prison,\" \"to incarcerate,\" \"[t]o confine a person, or restrain his liberty, in any way.\"  Black's Law Dictionary 681 (5th ed. 1979); 5 Oxford English Dictionary 113 (1933); accord, Black's Law Dictionary 875 (10th ed. 2014).  These definitions encompass pretrial detention, and, despite the dissent's reliance on a narrower definition, post, at 5-7 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.), even Mont has not pressed any serious argument to the contrary.  As the Sixth Circuit previously recognized, if imprisonment referred only to \"confinement that is the result of a penalty or sentence, then the phrase 'in connection with a conviction' [would] becom[e] entirely superfluous.\"  Goins, supra, at 421.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the phrase \"in connection with a conviction\" encompasses a period of pretrial detention for which a defendant receives credit against the sentence ultimately imposed.  The Court has often recognized that \"in connection with\" can bear a \"broad interpretation.\"  Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U. S. 71, 85 (2006) (interpreting \"in connection with the purchase or sale\" broadly in the context of \u00a710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778j(b)); see, e.g., United States v. American Union Transport, Inc., 327 U.\u00a0S. 437, 443 (1946) (describing the phrase \"in connection with\" in the Shipping Act, 1916, 39 Stat. 728, as \"broad and general\").  The Court has also recognized that \"\u00a0'\u00a0in connection with' is essentially indeterminate because connections, like relations, stop nowhere.\"  Maracich v. Spears, 570 U.\u00a0S. 48, 59 (2013) (quotation altered).  Here, however, we need not consider the outer bounds of the term \"in connection with,\" as pretrial incarceration is directly tied to the conviction when it is credited toward the new sentence.  The judgment of the state court stated as much, crediting the pretrial detention that Mont served while awaiting trial and sentencing for his crimes against his ultimate sentence for those same crimes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This reading of \"imprison[ment] in connection with a conviction\" is buttressed by the fact that Congress, like most States, instructs courts calculating a term of imprisonment to credit pretrial detention as time served on a subsequent conviction.  See 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73585(b)(1); Tr. of Oral Arg. 54 (statement of the Assistant Solicitor General representing that the same rule applies in 45 States and the District of Columbia).  Thus, it makes sense that the phrase \"imprison[ment] in connection with a conviction\" would include pretrial detention later credited as time served, especially since both provisions were passed as part of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.  See \u00a7212(a)(2), 98 Stat. 2008-2009.  If Congress intended a narrower interpretation, it could have easily used narrower language, such as \"after a conviction\" or \"following a conviction.\"  See e.g., Bail Reform Act of 1984, \u00a7209(d)(4), 98 Stat. 1987 (adding Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 46(h), allowing courts to direct forfeiture of property \"after conviction of the offense charged\" (emphasis added)).  We cannot override Congress' choice to employ the more capacious phrase \"in connection with.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, the text undeniably requires courts to retrospectively calculate whether a period of pretrial detention should toll a period of supervised release.  Whereas \u00a73624(e) instructs courts precisely when the supervised-release clock begins--\"on the day the person is released\"--the statute does not require courts to make a tolling determination as soon as a defendant is arrested on new charges or to continually reassess the tolling calculation throughout the period of his pretrial detention.  Congress contemplated the opposite by including a minimum-incarceration threshold: tolling occurs \"unless the imprisonment is for a period of less than 30 consecutive days.\"  \u00a73624(e).  This calculation must be made after either release from custody or entry of judgment; there is no way for a court to know on day 5 of a defendant's pretrial detention whether the period of custody will extend beyond 30 days.  Thus, at least some uncertainty as to whether supervised release is tolled is built into \u00a73624(e) by legislative design.  This fact confirms that courts should make the tolling calculation upon the defendant's release from custody or upon entry of judgment.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statutory context also supports our reading.  Supervised release is \"a form of postconfinement monitoring\" that permits a defendant a kind of conditional liberty by allowing him to serve part of his sentence outside of  prison.  Johnson v. United States, 529 U.\u00a0S. 694, 697 (2000).  Recognizing that Congress provided for supervised release to facilitate a \"transition to community life,\" we have declined to offset a term of supervised release by the amount of excess time a defendant spent in prison after two of his convictions were declared invalid.  United States v. Johnson, 529 U.\u00a0S. 53, 59-60 (2000).  As we explained: \"The objectives of supervised release would be unfulfilled if excess prison time were to offset and reduce terms of supervised release\" because \"[s]upervised release has no statutory function until confinement ends.\"  Id., at 59.  This understanding of supervised release informs our reading of the tolling provision.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider \u00a73624(e) itself.  The sentence preceding the one at issue here specifies that supervised release \"runs concurrently\" with \"probation or supervised release or parole for another offense.\"  \u00a73624(e) (emphasis added).  But the next sentence (the one at issue here) excludes periods of \"imprison[ment]\" served \"in connection with a conviction.\"  The juxtaposition of these two sentences reinforces the fact that prison time is \"not interchangeable\" with supervised release.  Id., at 59.  Permitting a period of probation or parole to count toward supervised release but excluding a period of incarceration furthers the statutory design of \"successful[ly] transition[ing]\" a defendant from \"prison to liberty.\"  Johnson, supra, at 708-709.  Allowing pretrial detention credited toward another sentence to toll the period of supervised release is consistent with that design.  Cf. A. Scalia & B. Garner,  Reading Law 167 (2012) (explaining that \"the whole-text canon\" requires consideration of \"the entire text, in view of its structure\" and \"logical relation of its many parts\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, it would be an exceedingly odd construction of the statute to give a defendant the windfall of satisfying a new sentence of imprisonment and an old sentence of supervised release with the same period of pretrial detention.  Supervised release is a form of punishment that Congress prescribes along with a term of imprisonment as part of the same sentence.  See generally \u00a73583.  And Congress denies defendants credit for time served if the detention time has already \"been credited against another sentence.\"  \u00a73585(b).  Yet Mont's reading of \u00a73624(e) would deprive the Government of its lawfully imposed sentence of supervised release while the defendant is serving a separate sentence of incarceration--one often imposed by a different sovereign.  Under our view, in contrast, time in pretrial detention constitutes supervised release only if the charges against the defendant are dismissed or the defendant is acquitted.  This ensures that the defendant is not faulted for conduct he might not have committed, while otherwise giving full effect to the lawful judgment previously imposed on the defendant.1\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In response to these points, Mont follows the D.\u00a0C. Circuit in arguing that the present tense of the statute (\"\u00a0'is imprisoned'\u00a0\") forbids any backward looking tolling analysis.  See Marsh, 829 F.\u00a03d, at 709.  Mont contends that, when a defendant is held in pretrial detention, a court cannot say at that moment that he \"is imprisoned in connection with a conviction.\"  He relies on the Dictionary Act, which provides that \"[i]n determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the context indicates otherwise[,] words used in the present tense include the future as well as the present.\"  1 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mont's argument confuses the rule (\"any period in which the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction\") with a court's analysis of whether that rule was satisfied.  Of course, the determination whether supervised release has been tolled cannot be made at the exact moment when the defendant is held in pretrial detention.  Rather, the court must await the outcome of those separate proceedings before it will know whether \"imprison[ment]\" is tied to a conviction.  But the statute does not require the court to make a contemporaneous assessment.  Quite the opposite: As discussed, the statute undeniably contemplates that there will be uncertainty about the status of supervised release when a defendant has been held for a short period of time and it is unclear whether the imprisonment will exceed 30 days.  There is no reason the statute would preclude postponing calculation just because the custody period extends beyond 30 days.  Once the court makes the calculation, it will determine whether the relevant period ultimately qualified as a period \"in which the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction\" for 30 or more days.  In short, the present-tense phrasing of the statute does not address whether a judge must be able to make a supervised-release determination at any given time.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, any uncertainty about whether supervised release is tolled matters little from either the court's or the defendant's perspective.  As for the court, the defendant need not be supervised when he is held in custody, so it does not strike us as \"odd\" to make a delayed determination concerning tolling.  Marsh, supra, at 710. The court need not monitor the defendant's progress in transitioning back into the community because the defendant is not in the community.  And if the court is concerned about losing authority over the defendant because of an impending conclusion to supervised release, it can simply issue a summons or warrant under \u00a73583(i) for alleged violations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the defendant, there is nothing unfair about not knowing during pretrial detention whether he is also subject to court supervision.  The answer to that question cannot meaningfully influence his behavior.  A defendant in custody will be unable to comply with many ordinary conditions of supervised release intended to reacclimate him to society--for example, making restitution payments, attending substance-abuse counseling, meeting curfews, or participating in job training.  The rules he can \"comply\" with are generally mandated by virtue of being in prison--for example, no new offenses or use of drugs.  See \u00a7\u00a73563(a)-(b) (listing mandatory and discretionary conditions).  In this case, Mont's supervised-release conditions required that he \"work regularly at a lawful occupation\" and \"support his .\u00a0.\u00a0. dependants and meet other family responsibilities.\"  Judgment in No. 4:05-cr-00229 (ND Ohio), Doc. 37, at 111.  Mont could not fulfill these conditions while sitting in an Ohio jail, and his probation officer correctly deemed him \"unavailable for supervision.\"2   App. 21.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying \u00a73624(e) to Mont, the pretrial-detention period tolled his supervised release beginning in June 2016.  Mont therefore had about nine months remaining on his term of supervised release when the District Court revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to an additional 42 months' imprisonment.  And because \u00a73624(e) independently tolled the supervised-release period, it is immaterial whether the District Court could have issued a summons or warrant under \u00a73583(i) to preserve its authority.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of the statutory text and context of \u00a73624(e), pretrial detention qualifies as \"imprison[ment] in connection with a conviction\" if a later imposed sentence credits that detention as time served for the new offense.  Such pretrial detention tolls the supervised-release period, even though the District Court may need to make the tolling determination after the conviction.  Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Sixth Circuit.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nSotomayor, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-8995\nJASON J. MONT, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit\n[June 3, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Breyer, Justice Kagan, and Justice Gorsuch join, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A term of supervised release is tolled when an offender \"is imprisoned in connection with a conviction.\"  18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73624(e).  The question before the Court is whether pretrial detention later credited as time served for a new offense has this tolling effect.  The Court concludes that it does, but it reaches that result by adopting a backward-looking approach at odds with the statute's language and by reading the terms \"imprisoned\" and \"in connection with\" in unnatural isolation.  Because I cannot agree that a person \"is imprisoned in connection with a conviction\" before any conviction has occurred, I respectfully dissent.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 empowers a court to impose a term of supervised release following imprisonment.  See 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a73583(a), (b).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The clock starts running on a supervised release term when the offender exits the jailhouse doors.  \u00a73624(e).  During the term, offenders are bound to follow court-imposed conditions.  Some apply to all supervised release terms, such as a requirement to refrain from committing other crimes.  \u00a73583(d).  Others apply only at a sentencing court's discretion, such as a condition that the offender allow visits from a probation officer.  See \u00a73563(b)(16); \u00a73583(d).  The probation officer, in turn, is tasked with monitoring and seeking to improve the offender's \"conduct and condition\" and reporting to the sentencing court, among other duties.  \u00a73603.  During the supervised release term, the court has the power to change its conditions and to extend the term if less than the maximum term was previously imposed.  \u00a73583(e)(2).  If an offender violates any of the conditions of release, the court can revoke supervised release and require the person to serve all or part of the supervised release term in prison, without giving credit for time previously served on postrelease supervision.  \u00a73583(e)(3).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the normal course, a supervised release term ends after the term specified by the district court.  But, crucially, the term \"does not run during any period in which the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction for a Federal, State, or local crime unless the imprisonment is for a period of less than 30 consecutive days.\"  \u00a73624(e).  In other words, certain periods of \"imprisonment\" postpone the expiration of the supervised release term.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A district court's revocation power generally lasts only as long as the supervised release term.  If the court issues a warrant or summons for an alleged violation before the term expires, however, the court's revocation power can extend for a \"reasonably necessary\" period beyond the term's expiration.  \u00a73583(i).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though the mechanics of supervised release tolling may seem arcane, these calculations can have weighty consequences.  For petitioner Jason Mont, tolling enabled a court to order an additional 31&TLRdivsl;2 years of federal imprisonment after he serves his current state sentence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mont was convicted in 2005 for federal drug and gun crimes.  The District Court sentenced him to prison time and to five years of supervised release.  In 2012, Mont was released from prison and his supervised release term began.  Left to run its course, the term would have ended on March 6, 2017.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mont's time on supervised release did not go well.  In January 2016, his probation officer informed the District Court that Mont had failed two drug tests and tried to pass two further drug tests by using an \"\u00a0'unknown'\u00a0\" liquid.  723 Fed. Appx. 325, 326 (CA6 2018).  The officer noted that Mont also had been charged with state marijuana-trafficking offenses.  Upon learning of these alleged  violations of the supervised release conditions, the District Court could have issued a warrant for Mont's arrest, but it did not do so at that time.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On June 1, 2016, Mont was arrested on a new state indictment for trafficking cocaine, and the State took him into custody.  The probation officer reported the arrest to the District Court, but the record does not reflect any action by the court in response.  After several months in custody, Mont pleaded guilty to certain of the state charges.  He also admitted to the District Court that he had violated the terms of his supervised release, and he requested a hearing.  The District Court set a November hearing to consider his alleged supervised release violation, but continuances delayed that hearing.  Months more passed as Mont, still detained, awaited sentencing.  In the meantime, the original end date of his federal supervised release term--March 6, 2017--came and went.  On March 21, 2017, the state court sentenced Mont to six years in prison and retroactively credited the approximately 10 months he had spent in pretrial detention toward his sentence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that point, Mont's probation officer reported Mont's state convictions and sentences to the Federal District Court, which--after its many earlier opportunities--finally issued a warrant for Mont's arrest on March 30, 2017.  Mont objected, claiming that the court had no power to issue the warrant because his supervised release term had expired on March 6.  The District Court rejected that contention and sentenced Mont to 42 months in prison, to run consecutively to his state sentence.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  In its view, the District Court had jurisdiction to revoke Mont's supervised release because his pretrial detention triggered the tolling provision in \u00a73624(e) and thus shifted back the end date of his supervised release term.  The Sixth Circuit construed the tolling provision to apply to Mont's detention because his state-court indictment ultimately led to a conviction and Mont subsequently received credit for the period of detention as time served for that conviction.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority errs by affirming the Sixth Circuit's construction of the tolling statute.  Most naturally read, a person \"is imprisoned in connection with a conviction\" only while he or she serves a prison term after a conviction.  The statute does not allow for tolling when an offender is in pretrial detention and a conviction is no more than a possibility.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first clue to the meaning of \u00a73624(e) is its present-tense construction.  In normal usage, no one would say that a person \"is imprisoned in connection with a conviction\" before any conviction has occurred, because the phrase would convey something that is not yet--and, indeed, may never be--true: that the detention has the requisite connection to a conviction.  After all, many detained individuals are never convicted because they ultimately are acquitted or have their cases dismissed.3  Until a conviction happens, it is impossible to tell whether any given pretrial detention is \"connect[ed] with\" a conviction or not.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reading the phrase \"is imprisoned\" to require a real-time assessment of the character of a conviction does not just match the colloquial sense of the phrase; it also gives meaning to the tense of the words Congress chose.  The Court generally \"look[s] to Congress' choice of verb tense to ascertain a statute's temporal reach.\"  Carr v. United States, 560 U.\u00a0S. 438, 448 (2010).  Doing so abides by the Dictionary Act, which provides that \"words used in the present tense include the future as well as the present\" absent contextual clues to the contrary, 1 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71, and thus \"the present tense generally does not include the past,\" Carr, 560 U.\u00a0S., at 448.  Applying this presumption here leads to the straightforward result that the phrase \"is imprisoned\" does not mean \"was imprisoned.\"  Adhering to the present-tense framework of the statute, then, pretrial detention does not meet the statutory definition, no matter what later happens.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The other language in \u00a73624(e)--\"imprisoned in connection with a conviction\"--confirms this result.  Had Congress wanted to toll supervised release during pretrial confinement, it could have chosen an alternative to the word \"imprisoned\" that more readily conveys that intent, such as \"confined\" or \"detained.\"  See Black's Law Dictionary 362 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"confinement\" as \"the quality, state, or condition of being imprisoned or restrained\"); id., at 543 (defining \"detention\" as \"[t]he act or an instance of holding a person in custody; confinement or compulsory delay\").  Instead, Congress selected a word--\"imprisoned\"--that is most naturally understood in context to mean postconviction incarceration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress regularly uses the word \"imprisoned\" (or \"imprisonment\") to refer to a prison term following a conviction.  The United States Code is littered with statutes providing that an individual shall be \"imprisoned\" following a conviction for a specific offense.  See, e.g., 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71832, 2199, 2344.  Congress also classifies crimes as felonies, misdemeanors, or infractions based on \"the maximum term of imprisonment authorized.\"  \u00a73559(a).  And even in the Sentencing Reform Act itself, which added the tolling provision at issue, Congress used the word \"imprisonment\" to refer to incarceration after a conviction.  See \u00a73582(a) (describing the factors courts consider when imposing \"a term of imprisonment\"); \u00a73582(b) (referring to \"a sentence to imprisonment\"); \u00a73582(c)(1)(B) (discussing when courts may \"modify an imposed term of imprisonment\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court also has previously equated the word \"imprisonment\" with a \"prison term\" or a \"sentence\"--phrases that imply post-trial detention.  See Tapia v. United States, 564 U.\u00a0S. 319, 327 (2011) (referring in passing to \"imprisonment\" as a \"prison term\"); Barber v. Thomas, 560 U.\u00a0S. 474, 484 (2010) (\"[T]erm of imprisonment\" can refer \"to the sentence that the judge imposes\" or \"the time that the prisoner actually serves\" of such a sentence); see also Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.\u00a0S. 25, 37 (1972) (\"[N]o person may be imprisoned for any offense .\u00a0.\u00a0. unless he was represented by counsel at his trial\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, dictionary definitions of the word \"imprison\" sweep more broadly than just post-trial incarceration.  See ante, at 6.  But the word \"imprisoned\" does not appear in this statute in isolation; Congress referred to imprisonment \"in connection with a conviction.\"  As part of that phrase and given its usual meaning, the word \"imprisoned\" is best read as referring to the state of an individual serving time following a conviction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The present tense of the statute and the phrase \"imprisoned in connection with a conviction\" thus lead to the same conclusion: Pretrial detention does not toll supervised release.4\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority justifies a contrary interpretation of the tolling provision only by jettisoning the present-tense view of the statute and affording snippets of text broader meaning than they merit in context.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority's first error is its conclusion that courts can take a wait-and-see approach to tolling.  If a conviction ultimately materializes and a court credits the offender's pretrial custody toward the resulting sentence, the majority reasons, then the pretrial detention retroactively will toll supervised release.  If not, then there will be no tolling.  See ante, at 6-8.  The offender's supervised release status thus will be uncertain until the court calculates tolling either \"upon the defendant's release from custody or upon entry of judgment.\"  Ante, at 8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority's retrospective approach cannot be squared with the language of \u00a73624(e).  Because Congress phrased the provision in the present tense, the statute calls for a contemporaneous assessment of whether a person \"is imprisoned\" with the requisite connection to a conviction.  The majority erroneously shifts the statute's frame of reference from that present-tense assessment (what is) to a backward-looking review (what was or what has been).5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority's textual argument hinges on what the majority perceives to be an advantage of the retrospective approach: It accounts for the fact that the statute provides for tolling only if a period of imprisonment lasts longer than 30 days.  \u00a73624(e).  According to the majority, the 30-day provision shows Congress' expectation that courts look backwards when evaluating whether tolling is appropriate.  If Congress anticipated such an analysis as to the length of the detention, the majority implies, surely it provided more generally for backward-looking review of the relationship between the detention and any ensuing conviction.  See ante, at 8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This argument, however, assumes a problem of the majority's own making.  The 30-day minimum creates no anomalies if the statute is read to toll supervised release only during detention following a conviction.  Under that more natural reading, courts in most cases will not be left in the dark about the length of a period of detention or its relationship to a conviction; the conviction and sentence of imprisonment at the time imposed will answer both questions.6\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the majority's approach, however, this language creates a dilemma.  Unlike a term of imprisonment following a conviction, the duration of pretrial confinement is uncertain at its outset.  Thus if (as the majority contends) Congress meant to toll such periods of detention, the 30-day limitation means that every single time a person on supervised release enters detention, it will be unclear for up to a month whether the supervised release term is being tolled or not.  See ante, at 8 (conceding that there will be \"no way for a court to know on day 5 of a defendant's pretrial detention whether the period of custody will extend beyond 30 days\").  If pretrial detention lasts longer than 30 days, the uncertainty will continue until a judgment of conviction is entered and credit for pretrial detention is computed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the difficulties inherent in predicting how long pretrial detention will last (and whether that detention eventually will turn out to have any connection to a conviction, see supra, at 4-5, and n. 3) most naturally compel the conclusion that Congress never intended to force district courts to grapple with them in the first place.  These uncertainties generally would not arise--and courts thus would not need to rely on hindsight--if the Court were to adopt Mont's reading.  Yet the majority instead takes as a given that the statute tolls supervised release during pretrial detention, and then uses the uncertainties inherent in that process to justify a backward-looking analysis.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority's error is compounded by the centerpiece of its textual analysis, which relies on artificially isolating the terms \"imprisoned\" and \"in connection with.\"  The majority says that imprisonment is a term so capacious as to encompass pretrial detention, ante, at 6-7, and that the phrase \"in connection with\" sweeps broadly enough to include pretrial detention that is ultimately credited to a new sentence, ante, at 7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whether or not these phrases independently have the far-reaching meaning that the majority ascribes to them--a conclusion that is by no means inevitable--the terms are still limited by their relationship to each other and by the present-tense framework of the statute.  Individual phrases must not be taken \"\u00a0'in a vacuum,'\u00a0\" because doing so overrides the \"\u00a0'fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.'\u00a0\"  Home Depot U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A., Inc. v. Jackson, ante, at ___ (slip op., at 5) (quoting Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.\u00a0S. 803, 809 (1989)).  As discussed, in the context of a phrase referring to conviction, the term \"imprisoned\" most naturally means imprisonment following a conviction.  Supra, at 5-7.  And seen from the point at which a person is detained and awaiting a verdict, his confinement is not \"in connection with\" a conviction that has not happened and may never occur.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority's approach has the further flaw of treating tolling as the only meaningful avenue to preserve a district court's revocation power when an offender is detained pretrial.  But the statute already provides a way for a court to extend its revocation power: If a court issues a warrant or summons while the supervised release term is running, that action triggers an extension of the court's revocation authority \"beyond\" the supervised release term \"for any period reasonably necessary for the adjudication\" of the matters that led to the warrant or summons.  See \u00a73583(i).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this very case, the District Court had at least three opportunities to issue a warrant prior to the expiration of Mont's original supervised release term.  Mont's probation officer notified the District Court of Mont's potential supervised release violations in January 2016, more than a year before Mont's supervised release was set to expire.  723 Fed. Appx. 325, 326 (CA6 2018).  In June 2016, the probation officer alerted the District Court to Mont's arrest.  Ibid.  And in October 2016, Mont filed a written admission with the District Court that he had violated supervised release.  Id., at 326-327.  The District Court was empowered at each step of this process to issue a warrant.  Indeed, the court apparently intended to do just that after Mont's written admission, though the Sixth Circuit later found that there was no evidence of such a warrant in the record.  See id., at 329, n.\u00a05.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, the delayed revocation process provides a straightforward, and statutorily prescribed, path for district courts to decide which charges are significant enough to justify a warrant and thus to extend the court's revocation power.  The majority's overly broad reading of the tolling provision is thus unnecessary as well as a distortion of the clear statutory text.\nV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lacking a strong textual basis for its backward-looking analysis, the majority is left to rely on intuitions about how best to fulfill the statute's purpose.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To begin with, the majority emphasizes that supervised release and incarceration have different aims.  See ante, at 8-10.  True enough.  The Court has explained that supervised release is intended \"to assist individuals in their transition to community life,\" and as a result is not \"interchangeable\" with periods of incarceration.  United States v. Johnson, 529 U.\u00a0S. 53, 58-60 (2000).  But the goals of supervised release can be fulfilled to some degree even when an offender is detained.  Cf. Burns v. United States, 287 U.\u00a0S. 216, 223 (1932) (noting that a probationer is still \"subject to the conditions of\" probation \"even in jail\").  Offenders on supervised release may well be able to comply with several mandatory conditions of supervised release while detained, such as submitting to a DNA sample or taking drug tests.  See \u00a73583(d).  And probation officers have experience coordinating with correctional facilities in the prerelease context.  See \u00a73624(c)(3) (providing that the probation system \"shall, to the extent practicable, offer assistance to a prisoner during prerelease custody\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if an offender's detention does make it meaningfully harder to fulfill the goals of supervised release, moreover, the majority's reading permits the same incongruities.  Under the majority's interpretation, supervised release continues to run for offenders who are confined pretrial for less than 30 days and for those who are detained pretrial but are later acquitted or released after charges are dropped.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34.7  At best, the majority offers a half-a-loaf policy rationale that cannot justify departing from the best reading of the statute's text.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority also invokes the general principle against double-counting sentences, see, e.g., \u00a73585(b), and objects that Mont's reading of the statute would give defendants a \"windfall.\"  Ante, at 9-10.  This argument, however, fails to recognize the distinct character of pretrial detention.  Its purpose is to ensure that an alleged offender attends trial and is incapacitated if he or she is a danger to the community, not to punish the offender for a conviction.  See United States v. Morales-Alejo, 193 F.\u00a03d 1102, 1105 (CA9 1999) (citing \u00a73142(c); United States v. Salerno, 481 U.\u00a0S. 739, 748 (1987)).  A State or the Federal Government may later choose to credit an equivalent period of time toward a new sentence, but that credit does not retroactively transform the character of the detention itself into \"imprison[ment] in connection with a conviction,\" \u00a73624(e)--particularly in the context of this present-tense statute.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, the majority's approach creates a serious risk of unfairness.  Offenders in pretrial detention will have no notice of whether they are bound by the terms of supervised release.  This effectively compels all offenders to comply with the terms of their release, even though only some will ultimately get credit for that compliance, because otherwise they risk being charged with a violation if their supervised release term is not tolled.8  Although the majority indicates that offenders generally will comply with the terms of their release simply by following prison rules, the range of supervised release conditions is too broad to guarantee complete overlap with prison directives.  See, e.g., Doherty, Indeterminate Sentencing Returns: The Invention of Supervised Release, 88 N.\u00a0Y.\u00a0U.\u00a0L.\u00a0Rev. 958, 1012-1013 (2013) (describing mandatory condition of cooperating in DNA collection and special conditions of taking prescribed medications and undergoing periodic polygraph testing).  Altogether, I am not nearly as sanguine as the majority that the uncertainty created by the majority's expansive tolling rule \"matters little from either the court's or the defendant's perspective.\"  Ante, at 11.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court errs by treating Mont's pretrial detention as tolling his supervised release term.  Because its approach misconstrues the operative text and fosters needless uncertainty and unfairness, I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Our reading leaves intact a district court's ability to preserve its authority by issuing an arrest warrant or summons under \u00a73583(i) based on the conduct at issue in the new charges, irrespective of whether the defendant is later convicted or acquitted of those offenses.  But preserving jurisdiction through \u00a73583(i) is not a prerequisite to a court maintaining authority under \u00a73624(e), nor does it impact the tolling calculation under \u00a73624(e).\nFootnote 2\u00a0Although a defendant in pretrial detention is unable to be supervised, it does not necessarily follow that the defendant will be punished by his inability to comply with the terms of his supervised release if the detention period is not later credited as time served for a conviction.  In that circumstance, the district court may always modify the terms of his supervision.  See 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73583(e)(2).  And, as the Government explained at oral argument, modification of supervised release may not be necessary to the extent that \"the defendant can't be deemed to have been required to\" comply with the terms of supervised release while in custody.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 45.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0I accept the dates as given in the Sixth Circuit's opinion, although that opinion notes some immaterial discrepancies in the record.  See 723 Fed. Appx. 325, 326, nn. 1-2 (2018).\nFootnote 2\u00a0The District Court held that it had jurisdiction because of a summons it issued on November 1, 2016, which would have given the court power to sanction a supervised release violation even after the term expired.  See 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73583(i).  The Sixth Circuit did not affirm on this ground, however, because it \"failed to detect any .\u00a0.\u00a0. evidence in the record\" of a November 2016 summons.  723 Fed. Appx., at 329, n.\u00a05.\nFootnote 3\u00a0See Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics, T. Cohen & B. Reaves, Pretrial Release of Felony Defendants in State Courts; State Court Processing Statistics, 1990-2004, p. 7 (Nov. 2007) (roughly one in five defendants held in pretrial detention for state felony charges conclude their cases without a conviction), https:\/\/www.bjs.gov\/content\/pub\/pdf\/prfdsc.pdf (as last visited May 30, 2019).\nFootnote 4\u00a0I note that rejecting the Sixth Circuit's contrary interpretation of the statute would not necessarily resolve this case in Mont's favor.  The Government views Mont's guilty plea as a \"conviction\" and thus argues that his supervised release should, at the least, have been tolled during the five months he was detained between his plea and sentencing.  See Brief for United States 39-44.  Because the Sixth Circuit did not directly address whether a guilty plea constitutes a \"conviction,\" the appropriate course would be to remand to the Sixth Circuit to consider this argument in the first instance.  See, e.g., Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.\u00a0S. 709, 718, n.\u00a07 (2005).\nFootnote 5\u00a0Although Congress did not use a phrase like \"was imprisoned\" or \"has been imprisoned\" in this provision, it did employ such formulations in several other tolling provisions.  See 38 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73103(b)(3) (eligibility period \"shall not run\" during any period in which a veteran \"was .\u00a0.\u00a0. prevented\" from accessing a rehabilitation program); \u00a73031(b) (time period \"shall not run\" during a period in which an individual \"had not met\" a discharge requirement); 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71854(f\u00a0) (statute of limitations for a federal claim \"shall be tolled\" for the period in which a related state-law claim \"was pending\").\nFootnote 6\u00a0The Government gestures to some uncertainties inherent in predicting the length of imprisonment even following a conviction, such as the presence of indeterminate sentencing schemes and the possibility that a determinate sentence can be shortened or interrupted temporarily.  See Brief for United States 34-35 (citing 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a73621(e)(2)(B), 3622).  However, these provisions in no way suggest that a court regularly would find itself unsure whether a prisoner's sentence will extend past 30 days.\nFootnote 7\u00a0Imagine two offenders on supervised release and detained pending trial on similar charges who receive precisely the same supervision during their detention.  One ultimately is convicted and the other's charges are dismissed on statute of limitations grounds.  Today's decision means that the detention time for the convicted person will not count toward his or her supervised release term, even though the detention of the other person--who was detained for similar conduct and received the same monitoring and supervision--will count down the supervised release clock.  The better practice is to read the statute on its plain terms and rely on a district court's power to clarify any ambiguity in its authority by issuing a warrant when an alleged supervised release violation is sufficiently serious.  See \u00a73583(i).\nFootnote 8\u00a0The majority suggests that offenders will not necessarily face punishment for a failure to comply with supervision conditions while in detention.  Ante, at 12, n.\u00a02.  Given the consequences of revocation, however, offenders may well be unwilling to take that chance.

As part of that program, Morris County also distributes funds to help preserve religious buildings such as synagogues, temples, churches, and mosques.  But it turns out that New Jersey law, as recently interpreted by the New Jersey Supreme Court, prohibits Morris County from awarding grants to preserve religious buildings.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petitioners here argue that the State's exclusion of religious buildings--because they are religious--from Morris County's historic preservation program constitutes unconstitutional discrimination against religion in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  The New Jersey Supreme Court concluded that the State's discrimination did not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my view, the decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court is in serious tension with this Court's religious equality precedents.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As this Court has repeatedly held, governmental discrimination against religion--in particular, discrimination against religious persons, religious organizations, and religious speech--violates the Free Exercise Clause and the Equal Protection Clause.  In the words of Justice Brennan, the \"government may not use religion as a basis of classification for the imposition of duties, penalties, privileges or benefits.\"  McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U.\u00a0S. 618, 639 (1978) (opinion concurring in judgment).  Under the Constitution, the government may not discriminate against religion generally or against particular religious denominations.  See Larson v. Valente, 456 U.\u00a0S. 228, 244 (1982).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The principle of religious equality eloquently articulated by Justice Brennan in McDaniel is now firmly rooted in this Court's jurisprudence.  As Justice Kennedy later wrote for the Court, a law may not discriminate against \"some or all religious beliefs,\" and \"a law targeting religious beliefs as such is never permissible.\"  Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.\u00a0S. 520, 532, 533 (1993).  Put another way, the government may not \"impose special disabilities on the basis of .\u00a0.\u00a0. religious status.\"  Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U.\u00a0S. 872, 877 (1990).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have applied that bedrock principle of religious equality in numerous cases.  See, e.g, Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017); Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U.\u00a0S. 98 (2001); Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.\u00a0S. 819 (1995); Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.\u00a0S. 384 (1993); McDaniel, 435 U.\u00a0S. 618.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, in McDaniel, a Tennessee statute disqualified ministers from serving as delegates to Tennessee's constitutional convention.  The Court ruled the statute unconstitutional, explaining that the Constitution does not allow the government to discriminate against religious persons by prohibiting their service in a public office.  See 435 U.\u00a0S., at 629.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Good News, a school district in New York allowed residents to use the local public high school for social, civic, and recreational events.  But the school district prohibited a religious organization from using the school, simply because the organization was religious.  This Court held that the school district's exclusion of the religious organization was unconstitutional discrimination against religion.  See 533 U.\u00a0S., at 109.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That same principle of religious equality applies to governmental benefits or grants programs in which religious organizations or people seek benefits or grants on the same terms as secular organizations or people--at least, our precedents say, so long as the government does not fund the training of clergy, for example.  See Trinity Lutheran, 582 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13); Locke v. Davey, 540 U.\u00a0S. 712, 721, 725 (2004).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Trinity Lutheran, Missouri barred a religious school from obtaining a state funding grant for the school's playground.  By contrast, Missouri allowed secular private schools to obtain state funding grants for their schools' playgrounds.  This Court held that Missouri's law was unconstitutional.  The Court stated that the Constitution \"protects religious observers against unequal treatment.\"  582 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (alterations omitted).  In the Court's description, Missouri's law reflected an unconstitutional policy of \"No churches need apply.\"  Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 13-14).  The Court minced no words: Discriminating against religious schools because the schools are religious \"is odious to our Constitution.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, New Jersey's \"No religious organizations need apply\" for historic preservation grants appears similar to, for example, Missouri's \"No religious schools need apply\" for school playground grants and New York's \"No religious clubs need apply\" for use of school facilities and Tennessee's \"No ministers need apply\" for state office.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be clear, this is not a case like Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.\u00a0S. 577 (1992); Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.\u00a0S. 783 (1983); or County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.\u00a0S. 573 (1989), where the government itself is engaging in religious speech, such as a government-sponsored prayer or a government-sponsored religious display.  Nor is this a case like Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.\u00a0S. 682 (2014), or Smith, 494 U.\u00a0S. 872, where a religious group or person is asking for an accommodation or exemption from a generally applicable law.  Under the Court's precedents, both of those categories of cases can pose difficult questions.  This kind of case, by contrast, should not be as difficult: Barring religious organizations because they are religious from a general historic preservation grants program is pure discrimination against religion.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At some point, this Court will need to decide whether governments that distribute historic preservation funds may deny funds to religious organizations simply because the organizations are religious.  But at this point and in this case, it is appropriate to deny certiorari, for two main reasons.  First, the factual details of the Morris County program are not entirely clear.  In particular, it is not evident precisely what kinds of buildings can be funded under the Morris County program.  That factual uncertainty about the scope of the program could hamper our analysis of petitioners' religious discrimination claim.  Second, this Court decided Trinity Lutheran only recently, and there is not yet a robust post-Trinity Lutheran body of case law in the lower courts on the question whether governments may exclude religious organizations from general historic preservation grants programs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For those reasons, denial of certiorari is appropriate.  As always, a denial of certiorari does not imply agreement or disagreement with the decision of the relevant federal court of appeals or state supreme court.  In my view, prohibiting historic preservation grants to religious organizations simply because the organizations are religious would raise serious questions under this Court's precedents and the Constitution's fundamental guarantee of equality.\n\n\non petitions for writs of certiorari to the supreme court of new jersey\nNos. 18-364 and 18-365.\u2003Decided March 4, 2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Statement of Justice Kavanaugh, with whom Justice Alito and Justice Gorsuch join, respecting the denial of certiorari.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Morris County, New Jersey, distributes historic preservation funds to help preserve local buildings such as libraries, schoolhouses, performing arts centers, and museums.

OLIVEIRA(2019)\nNo. 17-340\nArgued: October 3, 2018Decided: January 15, 2019\n\n\nPetitioner New Prime Inc. is an interstate trucking company, and respondent Dominic Oliveira is one of its drivers.  Mr. Oliveira works under an operating agreement that calls him an independent contractor and contains a mandatory arbitration provision.  When Mr. Oliveira filed a class action alleging that New Prime denies its drivers lawful wages, New Prime asked the court to invoke its statutory authority under the Federal Arbitration Act to compel arbitration.  Mr. Oliveira countered that the court lacked authority because \u00a71 of the Act excepts from coverage disputes involving \"contracts of employment\" of certain transportation workers.  New Prime insisted that any question regarding \u00a71's applicability belonged to the arbitrator alone to resolve, or, assuming the court could address the question, that \"contracts of employment\" referred only to contracts that establish an employer-employee relationship and not to contracts with independent contractors.  The District Court and First Circuit agreed with Mr. Oliveira.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0A court should determine whether a \u00a71 exclusion applies before ordering arbitration.  A court's authority to compel arbitration under the Act does not extend to all private contracts, no matter how emphatically they may express a preference for arbitration.  Instead, antecedent statutory provisions limit the scope of a court's \u00a7\u00a73 and 4 powers to stay litigation and compel arbitration \"accord[ing to] the terms\" of the parties' agreement.  Section 2 provides that the Act applies only when the agreement is set forth as \"a written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce.\"  And \u00a71 helps define \u00a72's terms, warning, as relevant here, that \"nothing\" in the Act \"shall apply\" to \"contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\"  For a court to invoke its statutory authority under \u00a7\u00a73 and 4, it must first know if the parties' agreement is excluded from the Act's coverage by the terms of \u00a7\u00a71 and 2.  This sequencing is significant.  See, e.g., Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co. of America, 350 U.\u00a0S. 198, 201-202.  New Prime notes that the parties' contract contains a \"delegation clause,\" giving the arbitrator authority to decide threshold questions of arbitrability, and that the \"severability principle\" requires that both sides take all their disputes to arbitration.  But a delegation clause is merely a specialized type of arbitration agreement and is enforceable under \u00a7\u00a73 and 4 only if it appears in a contract consistent with \u00a72 that does not trigger \u00a71's exception.  And, the Act's severability principle applies only if the parties' arbitration agreement appears in a contract that falls within the field \u00a7\u00a71 and 2 describe.  Pp.\u00a03-6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Because the Act's term \"contract of employment\" refers to any agreement to perform work, Mr. Oliveira's agreement with New Prime falls within \u00a71's exception.  Pp.\u00a06-15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0\"[I]t's a 'fundamental canon of statutory construction' that words generally should be 'interpreted as taking their ordinary . . . meaning . . . at the time Congress enacted the statute.' \"  Wisconsin Central Ltd. v. United States, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (quoting Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42).  After all, if judges could freely invest old statutory terms with new meanings, this Court would risk amending legislation outside the \"single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure\" the Constitution commands.  INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 951.  The Court would risk, too, upsetting reliance interests by subjecting people today to different rules than they enjoyed when the statute was passed.  At the time of the Act's adoption in 1925, the phrase \"contract of employment\" was not a term of art, and dictionaries tended to treat \"employment\" more or less as a synonym for \"work.\"  Contemporaneous legal authorities provide no evidence that a \"contract of employment\" necessarily signaled a formal employer-employee relationship.  Evidence that Congress used the term \"contracts of employment\" broadly can be found in its choice of the neighboring term \"workers,\" a term that easily embraces independent contractors.  Pp.\u00a06-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0New Prime argues that by 1925, the words \"employee\" and \"independent contractor\" had already assumed distinct meanings.  But while the words \"employee\" and \"employment\" may share a common root and intertwined history, they also developed at different times and in at least some different ways.  The evidence remains that, as dominantly understood in 1925, a \"contract of employment\" did not necessarily imply the existence of an employer-employee relationship.  New Prime's argument that early 20th-century courts sometimes used the phrase \"contracts of employment\" to describe what are recognized today as agreements between employers and employees does nothing to negate the possibility that the term also embraced agreements by independent contractors to perform work.  And its effort to explain away the statute's suggestive use of the term \"worker\" by noting that the neighboring terms \"seamen\" and \"railroad employees\" included only employees in 1925 rests on a precarious premise.  The evidence suggests that even \"seamen\" and \"railroad employees\" could be independent contractors at the time the Arbitration Act passed.  Left to appeal to the Act's policy, New Prime suggests that this Court order arbitration to abide Congress' effort to counteract judicial hostility to arbitration and establish a favorable federal policy toward arbitration agreements.  Courts, however, are not free to pave over bumpy statutory texts in the name of more expeditiously advancing a policy goal.  Rather, the Court should respect \"the limits up to which Congress was prepared\" to go when adopting the Arbitration Act.  United States v. Sisson, 399 U. S. 267, 298.  This Court also declines to address New Prime's suggestion that it order arbitration anyway under its inherent authority to stay litigation in favor of an alternative dispute resolution mechanism of the parties' choosing.

But like most laws, this one bears its qualifications.  Among other things, \u00a71 says that \"nothing herein\" may be used to compel arbitration in disputes involving the \"contracts of employment\" of certain transportation workers.  9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71.  And that qualification has sparked these questions: When a contract delegates questions of arbitrability to an arbitrator, must a court leave disputes over the application of \u00a71's exception for the arbitrator to resolve?  And does the term \"contracts of employment\" refer only to contracts between employers and employees, or does it also reach contracts with independent contractors?  Because courts across the country have disagreed on the answers to these questions, we took this case to resolve them.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0New Prime is an interstate trucking company and Dominic Oliveira works as one of its drivers.  But, at least on paper, Mr. Oliveira isn't an employee; the parties' contracts label him an independent contractor.  Those agreements also instruct that any disputes arising out of the parties' relationship should be resolved by an arbitrator--even disputes over the scope of the arbitrator's authority.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eventually, of course, a dispute did arise.  In a class action lawsuit in federal court, Mr. Oliveira argued that New Prime denies its drivers lawful wages.  The company may call its drivers independent contractors.  But, Mr. Oliveira alleged, in reality New Prime treats them as employees and fails to pay the statutorily due minimum wage.  In response to Mr. Oliveira's complaint, New Prime asked the court to invoke its statutory authority under the Act and compel arbitration according to the terms found in the parties' agreements.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That request led to more than a little litigation of its own.  Even when the parties' contracts mandate arbitration, Mr. Oliveira observed, the Act doesn't always authorize a court to enter an order compelling it.  In particular, \u00a71 carves out from the Act's coverage \"contracts of employment of .\u00a0.\u00a0. workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\"  And at least for purposes of this collateral dispute, Mr. Oliveira submitted, it doesn't matter whether you view him as an employee or independent contractor.  Either way, his agreement to drive trucks for New Prime qualifies as a \"contract[\u00a0] of employment of .\u00a0.\u00a0. [a] worker[\u00a0] engaged in .\u00a0.\u00a0. interstate commerce.\"  Accordingly, Mr. Oliveira argued, the Act supplied the district court with no authority to compel arbitration in this case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Naturally, New Prime disagreed.  Given the extraordinary breadth of the parties' arbitration agreement, the company insisted that any question about \u00a71's application belonged for the arbitrator alone to resolve.  Alternatively and assuming a court could address the question, New Prime contended that the term \"contracts of employment\" refers only to contracts that establish an employer-employee relationship.  And because Mr. Oliveira is, in fact as well as form, an independent contractor, the company argued, \u00a71's exception doesn't apply; the rest of the statute does; and the district court was (once again) required to order arbitration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ultimately, the district court and the First Circuit sided with Mr. Oliveira.  857 F. 3d 7 (2017).  The court of appeals held, first, that in disputes like this a court should resolve whether the parties' contract falls within the Act's ambit or \u00a71's exclusion before invoking the statute's authority to order arbitration.  Second, the court of appeals held that \u00a71's exclusion of certain \"contracts of employment\" removes from the Act's coverage not only employer-employee contracts but also contracts involving independent contractors.  So under any account of the parties' agreement in this case, the court held, it lacked authority under the Act to order arbitration.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In approaching the first question for ourselves, one thing becomes clear immediately.  While a court's authority under the Arbitration Act to compel arbitration may be considerable, it isn't unconditional.  If two parties agree to arbitrate future disputes between them and one side later seeks to evade the deal, \u00a7\u00a73 and 4 of the Act often require a court to stay litigation and compel arbitration  \"accord[ing to] the terms\" of the parties' agreement.  But this authority doesn't extend to all private contracts, no matter how emphatically they may express a preference for arbitration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead, antecedent statutory provisions limit the scope of the court's powers under \u00a7\u00a73 and 4.  Section 2 provides that the Act applies only when the parties' agreement to arbitrate is set forth as a \"written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce.\"  And \u00a71 helps define \u00a72's terms.  Most relevant for our purposes, \u00a71 warns that \"nothing\" in the Act \"shall apply\" to \"contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\"  Why this very particular qualification?  By the time it adopted the Arbitration Act in 1925, Congress had already prescribed alternative employment dispute resolution regimes for many transportation workers.  And it seems Congress \"did not wish to unsettle\" those arrangements in favor of whatever arbitration procedures the parties' private contracts might happen to contemplate.  Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.\u00a0S. 105, 121 (2001).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the statute's terms and sequencing, we agree with the First Circuit that a court should decide for itself whether \u00a71's \"contracts of employment\" exclusion applies before ordering arbitration.  After all, to invoke its statutory powers under \u00a7\u00a73 and 4 to stay litigation and compel arbitration according to a contract's terms, a court must first know whether the contract itself falls within or beyond the boundaries of \u00a7\u00a71 and 2.  The parties' private agreement may be crystal clear and require arbitration of every question under the sun, but that does not necessarily mean the Act authorizes a court to stay litigation and send the parties to an arbitral forum.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing in our holding on this score should come as a surprise.  We've long stressed the significance of the statute's sequencing.  In Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co. of America, 350 U.\u00a0S. 198, 201-202 (1956), we recognized that \"Sections 1, 2, and 3 [and 4] are integral parts of a whole.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [Sections] 1 and 2 define the field in which Congress was legislating,\" and \u00a7\u00a73 and 4 apply only to contracts covered by those provisions.  In Circuit City, we acknowledged that \"Section 1 exempts from the [Act] .\u00a0.\u00a0. contracts of employment of transportation workers.\"  532 U.\u00a0S., at 119.  And in Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.\u00a0S. 1, 10-11, and n.\u00a05 (1984), we noted that \"the enforceability of arbitration provisions\" under \u00a7\u00a73 and 4 depends on whether those provisions are \"part of a written maritime contract or a contract 'evidencing a transaction involving commerce'\u00a0\" under \u00a72--which, in turn, depends on the application of \u00a71's exception for certain \"contracts of employment.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, New Prime resists this straightforward understanding.  The company argues that an arbitrator should resolve any dispute over \u00a71's application because of the \"delegation clause\" in the parties' contract and what is sometimes called the \"severability principle.\"  A delegation clause gives an arbitrator authority to decide even the initial question whether the parties' dispute is subject to arbitration.  Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U.\u00a0S. 63, 68-69 (2010).  And under the severability principle, we treat a challenge to the validity of an arbitration agreement (or a delegation clause) separately from a challenge to the validity of the entire contract in which it appears.  Id., at 70-71.  Unless a party specifically challenges the validity of the agreement to arbitrate, both sides may be required to take all their disputes--including disputes about the validity of their broader contract--to arbitration.  Ibid.  Applying these principles to this case, New Prime notes that Mr. Oliveira has not specifically challenged the parties' delegation clause and submits that any controversy should therefore proceed only and immediately before an arbitrator.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But all this overlooks the necessarily antecedent statutory inquiry we've just discussed.  A delegation clause is merely a specialized type of arbitration agreement, and the Act \"operates on this additional arbitration agreement just as it does on any other.\"  Id., at 70.  So a court may use \u00a7\u00a73 and 4 to enforce a delegation clause only if the clause appears in a \"written provision in .\u00a0.\u00a0. a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce\" consistent with \u00a72.  And only if the contract in which the clause appears doesn't trigger \u00a71's \"contracts of employment\" exception.  In exactly the same way, the Act's severability principle applies only if the parties' arbitration agreement appears in a contract that falls within the field \u00a7\u00a71 and 2 describe.  We acknowledged as much some time ago, explaining that, before invoking the severability principle, a court should \"determine[\u00a0] that the contract in question is within the coverage of the Arbitration Act.\"  Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.\u00a0S. 395, 402 (1967).\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That takes us to the second question: Did the First Circuit correctly resolve the merits of the \u00a71 challenge in this case?  Recall that \u00a71 excludes from the Act's compass \"contracts of employment of .\u00a0.\u00a0. workers engaged in .\u00a0.\u00a0. interstate commerce.\"  Happily, everyone before us agrees that Mr. Oliveira qualifies as a \"worker[\u00a0] engaged in .\u00a0.\u00a0. interstate commerce.\"  For purposes of this appeal, too, Mr. Oliveira is willing to assume (but not grant) that his contracts with New Prime establish only an independent contractor relationship.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With that, the disputed question comes into clear view: What does the term \"contracts of employment\" mean?  If it refers only to contracts that reflect an employer-employee relationship, then \u00a71's exception is irrelevant and a court is free to order arbitration, just as New Prime urges.  But if the term also encompasses contracts that require an independent contractor to perform work, then the exception takes hold and a court lacks authority under the Act to order arbitration, exactly as Mr. Oliveira argues.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In taking up this question, we bear an important caution in mind.  \"[I]t's a 'fundamental canon of statutory construction' that words generally should be 'interpreted as taking their ordinary .\u00a0.\u00a0. meaning .\u00a0.\u00a0. at the time Congress enacted the statute.'\u00a0\"  Wisconsin Central Ltd. v. United States, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 9) (quoting Perrin v. United States, 444 U.\u00a0S. 37, 42 (1979)).  See also Sandifer v. United States Steel Corp., 571 U.\u00a0S. 220, 227 (2014).  After all, if judges could freely invest old statutory terms with new meanings, we would risk amending legislation outside the \"single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure\" the Constitution commands.  INS v. Chadha, 462 U.\u00a0S. 919, 951 (1983).  We would risk, too, upsetting reliance interests in the settled meaning of a statute.  Cf. 2B N. Singer & J. Singer, Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a756A:3 (rev. 7th ed. 2012).  Of course, statutes may sometimes refer to an external source of law and fairly warn readers that they must abide that external source of law, later amendments and modifications included.  Id., \u00a751:8 (discussing the reference canon).  But nothing like that exists here.  Nor has anyone suggested any other appropriate reason that might allow us to depart from the original meaning of the statute at hand.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That, we think, holds the key to the case.  To many lawyerly ears today, the term \"contracts of employment\" might call to mind only agreements between employers and employees (or what the common law sometimes called masters and servants).  Suggestively, at least one recently published law dictionary defines the word \"employment\" to mean \"the relationship between master and servant.\" Black's Law Dictionary 641 (10th ed. 2014).  But this modern intuition isn't easily squared with evidence of the term's meaning at the time of the Act's adoption in 1925.  At that time, a \"contract of employment\" usually meant nothing more than an agreement to perform work.  As a result, most people then would have understood \u00a71 to exclude not only agreements between employers and employees but also agreements that require independent contractors to perform work.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What's the evidence to support this conclusion?  It turns out that in 1925 the term \"contract of employment\" wasn't defined in any of the (many) popular or legal dictionaries the parties cite to us.  And surely that's a first hint the phrase wasn't then a term of art bearing some specialized meaning.  It turns out, too, that the dictionaries of the era consistently afforded the word \"employment\" a broad construction, broader than may be often found in dictionaries today.  Back then, dictionaries tended to treat \"employment\" more or less as a synonym for \"work.\"  Nor did they distinguish between different kinds of work or workers: All work was treated as employment, whether or not the common law criteria for a master-servant relationship happened to be satisfied.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What the dictionaries suggest, legal authorities confirm.  This Court's early 20th-century cases used the phrase \"contract of employment\" to describe work agreements involving independent contractors.2  Many state court cases did the same.3  So did a variety of federal statutes.4  And state statutes too.5  We see here no evidence that a \"contract of employment\" necessarily signaled a formal employer-employee or master-servant relationship.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More confirmation yet comes from a neighboring term in the statutory text.  Recall that the Act excludes from its coverage \"contracts of employment of .\u00a0.\u00a0. any .\u00a0.\u00a0. class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.\"  9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71 (emphasis added).  Notice Congress didn't use the word \"employees\" or \"servants,\" the natural choices if the term \"contracts of employment\" addressed them alone.  Instead, Congress spoke of \"workers,\" a term that everyone agrees easily embraces independent contractors.  That word choice may not mean everything, but it does supply further evidence still that Congress used the term \"contracts of employment\" in a broad sense to capture any contract for the performance of work by workers.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What does New Prime have to say about the case building against it?  Mainly, it seeks to shift the debate from the term \"contracts of employment\" to the word \"employee.\"  Today, the company emphasizes, the law often distinguishes between employees and independent contractors.  Employees are generally understood as those who work \"in the service of another person (the employer) under an express or implied contract of hire, under which the employer has the right to control the details of work performance.\"  Black's Law Dictionary, at 639.  Meanwhile, independent contractors are sometimes described as those \"entrusted to undertake a specific project but who [are] left free to do the assigned work and to choose the method for accomplishing it.\"  Id., at 888. New Prime argues that, by 1925, the words \"employee\" and \"independent contractor\" had already assumed these distinct meanings.6  And given that, the company contends, the phrase \"contracts of employment\" should be understood to refer only to relationships between employers and employees.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unsurprisingly, Mr. Oliveira disagrees.  He replies that, while the term \"employment\" dates back many centuries, the word \"employee\" only made its first appearance in English in the 1800s.  See Oxford English Dictionary (3d ed., Mar. 2014), www.oed.com\/view\/Entry\/61374 (all Internet materials as last visited Jan. 9, 2019).  At that time, the word from which it derived, \"employ,\" simply meant to \"apply (a thing) to some definite purpose.\"  3 J. Murray, A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles 129 (1891).  And even in 1910, Black's Law Dictionary reported that the term \"employee\" had only \"become somewhat naturalized in our language.\"  Black's Law Dictionary 421 (2d ed. 1910).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still, the parties do share some common ground.  They agree that the word \"employee\" eventually came into wide circulation and came to denote those who work for a wage at the direction of another.  They agree, too, that all this came to pass in part because the word \"employee\" didn't suffer from the same \"historical baggage\" of the older common law term \"servant,\" and because it proved useful when drafting legislation to regulate burgeoning industries and their labor forces in the early 20th century.7  The parties even agree that the development of the term \"employee\" may have come to influence and narrow our understanding of the word \"employment\" in comparatively recent years and may be why today it might signify to some a \"relationship between master and servant.\"8\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if the parties' extended etymological debate persuades us of anything, it is that care is called for.  The words \"employee\" and \"employment\" may share a common root and an intertwined history.  But they also developed at different times and in at least some different ways.  The only question in this case concerns the meaning of the term \"contracts of employment\" in 1925.  And, whatever the word \"employee\" may have meant at that time, and however it may have later influenced the meaning of \"employment,\" the evidence before us remains that, as dominantly understood in 1925, a contract of employment did not necessarily imply the existence of an employer-employee or master-servant relationship.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When New Prime finally turns its attention to the term in dispute, it directs us to Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U.\u00a0S. 1, 13 (1915).  There and in other cases like it, New Prime notes, courts sometimes used the phrase \"contracts of employment\" to describe what today we'd recognize as agreements between employers and employees.  But this proves little.  No one doubts that employer-employee agreements to perform work qualified as \"contracts of employment\" in 1925--and documenting that fact does nothing to negate the possibility that \"contracts of employment\" also embraced agreements by independent contractors to perform work.  Coming a bit closer to  the mark, New Prime eventually cites a handful of early 20th-century legal materials that seem to use the term \"contracts of employment\" to refer exclusively to employer-employee agreements.9  But from the record amassed before us, these authorities appear to represent at most the vanguard, not the main body, of contemporaneous usage.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0New Prime's effort to explain away the statute's suggestive use of the term \"worker\" proves no more compelling.  The company reminds us that the statute excludes \"contracts of employment\" for \"seamen\" and \"railroad employees\" as well as other transportation workers.  And because \"seamen\" and \"railroad employees\" included only employees in 1925, the company reasons, we should understand \"any other class of workers engaged in .\u00a0.\u00a0. interstate commerce\" to bear a similar construction.  But this argument rests on a precarious premise.  At the time of the Act's passage, shipboard surgeons who tended injured sailors were considered \"seamen\" though they likely served in an independent contractor capacity.10  Even the term \"railroad employees\" may have swept more broadly at the time of the Act's passage than might seem obvious today.  In 1922, for example, the Railroad Labor Board interpreted the word \"employee\" in the Transportation Act of 1920 to refer to anyone \"engaged in the customary work directly contributory to the operation of the railroads.\"11  And the Erdman Act, a statute enacted to address disruptive railroad strikes at the end of the 19th century, seems to evince an equally broad understanding of \"railroad employees.\"12\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unable to squeeze more from the statute's text, New Prime is left to appeal to its policy.  This Court has said that Congress adopted the Arbitration Act in an effort to counteract judicial hostility to arbitration and establish \"a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.\"  Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.\u00a0S. 1, 24 (1983).  To abide that policy, New Prime suggests, we must order arbitration according to the terms of the parties' agreement.  But often and by design it is \"hard-fought compromise[\u00a0],\" not cold logic, that supplies the solvent needed for a bill to survive the legislative process.  Board of Governors, FRS v. Dimension Financial Corp., 474 U.\u00a0S. 361, 374 (1986).  If courts felt free to pave over bumpy statutory texts in the name of more expeditiously advancing a policy goal, we would risk failing to \"tak[e] .\u00a0.\u00a0. account of\" legislative compromises essential to a law's passage and, in that way, thwart rather than honor \"the effectuation of congressional intent.\"  Ibid.  By respecting the qualifications of \u00a71 today, we \"respect the limits up to which Congress was prepared\" to go when adopting the Arbitration Act.  United States v. Sisson, 399 U.\u00a0S. 267, 298 (1970).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, and stretching in a different direction entirely, New Prime invites us to look beyond the Act.  Even if the statute doesn't supply judges with the power to compel arbitration in this case, the company says we should order it anyway because courts always enjoy the inherent authority to stay litigation in favor of an alternative dispute resolution mechanism of the parties' choosing.  That, though, is an argument we decline to tangle with.  The courts below did not address it and we granted certiorari only to resolve existing confusion about the application of the Arbitration Act, not to explore other potential avenues for reaching a destination it does not.\n\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Congress enacted the Arbitration Act in 1925, the term \"contracts of employment\" referred to agreements to perform work.  No less than those who came before him, Mr. Oliveira is entitled to the benefit of that same understanding today.  Accordingly, his agreement with New Prime falls within \u00a71's exception, the court of appeals was correct that it lacked authority under the Act to order arbitration, and the judgment is\nAffirmed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kavanaugh took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nGinsburg, J., concurring\n\u2002586 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-340\nNEW PRIME INC., PETITIONER v.

PREAP ET AL.(2019)\nNo. 16-1363\nArgued: October 10, 2018Decided: March 19, 2019\n\n\nFederal immigration law empowers the Secretary of Homeland Security to arrest and hold a deportable alien pending a removal decision, and generally gives the Secretary the discretion either to detain the alien or to release him on bond or parole.  8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71226(a).  Another provision, \u00a71226(c)--enacted out of \"concer[n] that deportable criminal aliens who are not detained continue to engage in crime and fail to appear for their removal hearings,\" Demore v. Kim, 538 U.\u00a0S. 510, 513--sets out four categories of aliens who are inadmissible or deportable for bearing certain links to terrorism or for committing specified crimes.  Section 1226(c)(1) directs the Secretary to arrest any such criminal alien \"when the alien is released\" from jail, and \u00a71226(c)(2) forbids the Secretary to release any \"alien described in paragraph (1)\" pending a determination on removal (with one exception not relevant here).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents, two classes of aliens detained under \u00a71226(c)(2), allege that because they were not immediately detained by immigration officials after their release from criminal custody, they are not aliens \"described in paragraph (1),\" even though all of them fall into at least one of the four categories covered by \u00a7\u00a71226(c)(1)(A)-(D).  Because the Government must rely on \u00a71226(a) for their detention, respondents argue, they are entitled to bond hearings to determine if they should be released pending a decision on their status.  The District Courts ruled for respondents, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\u00a0The judgments are reversed, and the cases are remanded.\n831 F. 3d 1193 and 667 Fed. Appx. 966, reversed and remanded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, III-A, III-B-1, and IV, concluding that the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of \u00a71226(c) is contrary to the plain text and structure of the statute.  Pp.\u00a010-17, 20-26.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The statute's text does not support the argument that because respondents were not arrested immediately after their release, they are not \"described in\" \u00a71226(c)(1).  Since an adverb cannot modify a noun, \u00a71226(c)(1)'s adverbial clause \"when . . . released\" does not modify the noun \"alien,\" which is modified instead by the adjectival clauses appearing in subparagraphs (A)-(D).  Respondents contend that an adverb can \"describe\" a person even though it cannot modify the noun used to denote that person, but this Court's interpretation is not dependent on a rule of grammar.  The grammar merely complements what is conclusive here: the meaning of \"described\" as it appears in \u00a71226(c)(2)--namely, \"to communicate verbally . . . an account of salient identifying features,\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 610.  That is the relevant definition since the indisputable job of the \"descri[ption] in paragraph (1)\" is to \"identif[y]\" for the Secretary which aliens she must arrest immediately \"when [they are] released.\"  Yet the \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released\" clause could not possibly describe aliens in that sense.  If it did, the directive given to the Secretary in \u00a71226(c)(1) would be incoherent.  Moreover, Congress's use of the definite article in \"when the alien is released\" indicates that the scope of the word \"alien\" \"has been previously specified in context.\"  Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1294.  For that noun to have been previously specified, its scope must have been settled by the time the \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released\" clause appears at the end of paragraph (1).  Thus, the class of people to whom \"the alien\" refers must be fixed by the predicate offenses identified in subparagraphs (A)-(D).  Pp.\u00a010-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Subsections (a) and (c) do not establish separate sources of arrest and release authority; subsection (c) is a limit on the authority conferred by subsection (a).  Accordingly, all the relevant detainees will have been arrested by authority that springs from subsection (a), and that fact alone will not spare them from subsection (c)(2)'s prohibition on release.  The text of \u00a71226 itself contemplates that aliens arrested under subsection (a) may face mandatory detention under subsection (c).  If \u00a71226(c)'s detention mandate applied only to those arrested pursuant to subsection (c)(1), there would have been no need for subsection (a)'s sentence on the release of aliens to include the words \"[e]xcept as provided in subsection (c).\"  It is also telling that subsection (c)(2) does not limit mandatory detention to those arrested \"pursuant to\" subsection (c)(1) or \"under authority created by\" subsection (c)(1), but to anyone so much as \"described in\" subsection (c)(1).  Pp.\u00a015-17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0This reading of \u00a71226(c) does not flout the interpretative canon against surplusage.  The \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released\" clause still functions to clarify when the duty to arrest is triggered and to exhort the Secretary to act quickly.  Nor does this reading have the incongruous result of forbidding the release of a set of aliens whom there is no duty to arrest in the first place.  Finally, the canon of constitutional avoidance does not apply where there is no ambiguity.  See Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.\u00a0S. 40, 50.  Pp.\u00a020-26.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Kavanaugh, concluded in Parts II and III-B-2:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0This Court has jurisdiction to hear these cases.  The limitation on review in \u00a71226(e) applies only to \"discretionary\" decisions about the \"application\" of \u00a71226 to particular cases.  It does not block lawsuits over \"the extent of the Government's detention authority under the 'statutory framework' as a whole.\"  Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___.  For reasons stated in Jennings, \"\u00a71252(b)(9) does not present a jurisdictional bar.\"  See id., at ___.  Whether the District Court in the Preap case had jurisdiction under \u00a71252(f)(1) to grant injunctive relief is irrelevant because the court had jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs' request for declaratory relief.  And, the fact that by the time of class certification the named plaintiffs had obtained either cancellation of removal or bond hearings did not make these cases moot.  At least one named plaintiff in both cases could have been returned to detention and then denied a subsequent bond hearing.  Even if that had not been so, these cases would not be moot because the harms alleged are transitory enough to elude review.  County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.\u00a0S. 44, 52.  Pp.\u00a07-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Even assuming that \u00a71226(c)(1) requires immediate arrest, the result below would be wrong, because a statutory rule that officials \"\u00a0'shall' act within a specified time\" does not by itself \"preclud[e] action later,\" Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U.\u00a0S. 149, 158.  This principle for interpreting time limits on statutory mandates was a fixture of the legal backdrop when Congress enacted \u00a71226(c).  Cf. Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U.\u00a0S. 202, 209.  Pp.\u00a017-20.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Gorsuch, concluded that three statutory provisions--8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71252(b)(9), 1226(e), and 1252(f)(1)--limit judicial review in these cases and it is unlikely that the District Courts had Article III jurisdiction to certify the classes.

BASSAM YUSUF KHOURY, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\n[March 19, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, III-A, III-B-1, and IV, and an opinion with respect to Parts II and III-B-2, in which The Chief Justice and Justice Kavanaugh join.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aliens who are arrested because they are believed to be deportable may generally apply for release on bond or parole while the question of their removal is being decided.  These aliens may secure their release by proving to the satisfaction of a Department of Homeland Security officer or an immigration judge that they would not endanger others and would not flee if released from custody.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress has decided, however, that this procedure is too risky in some instances.  Congress therefore adopted a special rule for aliens who have committed certain dangerous crimes and those who have connections to terrorism.  Under a statutory provision enacted in 1996, 110 Stat. 3009-585, 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71226(c), these aliens must be arrested \"when [they are] released\" from custody on criminal charges and (with one narrow exception not involved in these cases) must be detained without a bond hearing until the question of their removal is resolved.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In these cases, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that this mandatory-detention requirement applies only if a covered alien is arrested by immigration officials as soon as he is released from jail.  If the alien evades arrest for some short period of time--according to respondents, even 24 hours is too long--the mandatory-detention requirement is inapplicable, and the alien must have an opportunity to apply for release on bond or parole.  Four other Circuits have rejected this interpretation of the statute, and we agree that the Ninth Circuit's interpretation is wrong.  We therefore reverse the judgments below and remand for further proceedings.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under federal immigration law, aliens present in this country may be removed if they fall \"within one or more .\u00a0.\u00a0. classes of deportable aliens.\"  8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71227(a).  In these cases, we focus on two provisions governing the arrest, detention, and release of aliens who are believed to be subject to removal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first provision, \u00a71226(a),1 applies to most such aliens, and it sets out the general rule regarding their arrest and detention pending a decision on removal.  Section 1226(a) contains two sentences, one dealing with taking an alien into custody and one dealing with detention.  The first sentence empowers the Secretary of Homeland Security2 to arrest and hold an alien \"pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States.\"  The second sentence generally gives the Secretary the discretion either to detain the alien or to release him on bond or parole.  If the alien is detained, he may seek review of his detention by an officer at the  Department of Homeland Security and then by an immigration judge (both exercising power delegated by the Secretary), see 8 CFR \u00a7\u00a7236.1(c)(8) and (d)(1), 1003.19, 1236.1(d)(1) (2018); and the alien may secure his release if he can convince the officer or immigration judge that he poses no flight risk and no danger to the community.  See \u00a7\u00a71003.19(a), 1236.1(d); Matter of Guerra, 24 I. & N. Dec. 37 (BIA 2006).  But while 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71226(a) generally permits an alien to seek release in this way, that provision's sentence on release states that all this is subject to an exception that is set out in \u00a71226(c).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 1226(c) was enacted as part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, and it sprang from a \"concer[n] that deportable criminal aliens who are not detained continue to engage in crime and fail to appear for their removal hearings in large numbers.\"  Demore v. Kim, 538 U.\u00a0S. 510, 513 (2003).  To address this problem, Congress mandated that aliens who were thought to pose a heightened risk be arrested and detained without a chance to apply for release on bond or parole.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 1226(c) consists of two paragraphs, one on the decision to take an alien into \"[c]ustody\" and another on the alien's subsequent \"[r]elease.\"3  The first paragraph (on custody) sets out four categories of covered aliens, namely, those who are inadmissible or deportable on specified grounds.  It then provides that the Secretary must take any alien falling into one of these categories \"into custody\" \"when the alien is released\" from criminal custody.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second paragraph (on release from immigration custody) states that \"an alien described in paragraph (1)\" may be released \"only if [the Secretary] decides\" that release is \"necessary to provide protection\" for witnesses or others cooperating with a criminal investigation, or their relatives or associates.  That exception is not implicated in the present cases.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The categories of predicates for mandatory detention identified in subparagraphs (A)-(D) generally involve the commission of crimes.  As will become relevant to our analysis, however, some who satisfy subparagraph (D)--e.g., close relatives of terrorists and those who are thought likely to engage in terrorist activity, see 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71182(a)(3)(B)(i)(IX)--may never have been charged with any crime in this country.4  Still, since the vast majority of mandatory-detention cases do involve convictions, we follow the heading of subsection (c), as well as our cases and the courts below, in referring to aliens who satisfy subparagraphs (A)-(D) collectively as \"criminal aliens.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Board of Immigration Appeals has held that subsection (c)(2), which requires the detention of aliens \"described in\" subsection (c)(1), applies to all aliens who fall within subparagraphs (A)-(D), whether or not they were arrested immediately \"when [they were] released\" from criminal custody.  Matter of Rojas, 23 I. & N. Dec. 117 (BIA 2001) (en banc).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents in the two cases before us are aliens who were detained under \u00a71226(c)(2)'s mandatory-detention requirement--and thus denied a bond hearing--pending a decision on their removal.  See Preap v. Johnson, 831 F. 3d 1193 (CA9 2016); Khoury v. Asher, 667 Fed. Appx. 966 (CA9 2016).  Though all respondents had been convicted of criminal offenses covered in \u00a7\u00a71226(c)(1)(A)-(D), none were arrested by immigration officials immediately after their release from criminal custody.  Indeed, some were not arrested until several years later.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent Mony Preap, the lead plaintiff in the case that bears his name, is a lawful permanent resident with two drug convictions that qualify him for mandatory detention under \u00a71226(c).  Though he was released from criminal custody in 2006, immigration officials did not detain him until 2013, when he was released from jail after an arrest for another offense.  His co-plaintiffs Juan Lozano Magdaleno and Eduardo Vega Padilla were taken into immigration detention, respectively, 5 and 11 years after their release from custody for a \u00a71226(c) predicate offense.  Preap, Magdaleno, and Padilla filed habeas petitions and a class-action complaint alleging that because they were not arrested \"immediately\" after release from criminal custody, they are exempt from mandatory detention under \u00a71226(c) and are entitled to a bond hearing to determine if they should be released pending a decision on their status.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the named plaintiffs in Preap were not taken into custody on immigration grounds until years after their release from criminal custody, the District Court certified a broad class comprising all aliens in California \"\u00a0'who are or will be subjected to mandatory detention under 8 U.\u00a0S. C. section 1226(c) and who were not or will not have been taken into custody by the government immediately upon their release from criminal custody for a [s]ection 1226(c)(1) offense.'\u00a0\"  831 F.\u00a03d, at 1198 (emphasis added).  The District Court granted a preliminary injunction against the mandatory detention of the members of this class, holding that criminal aliens are exempt from mandatory detention under \u00a71226(c) (and are thus entitled to a bond hearing) unless they are arrested \"\u00a0'when [they are] released,' and no later.\"  Preap v. Johnson, 303 F.\u00a0R.\u00a0D. 566, 577 (ND Cal. 2014) (quoting 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71226(c)(1)).  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Khoury, the other case now before us, involves habeas petitions and a class-action complaint filed in the Western District of Washington.  The District Court certified a class comprising all aliens in that district \"who were subjected to mandatory detention under 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71226(c) even though they were not detained immediately upon their release from criminal custody.\"  667 Fed. Appx., at 967.  The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents, and the Ninth Circuit again affirmed, citing its decision on the same day in Preap.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because Preap and Khoury created a split with four other Courts of Appeals, we granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's ruling that criminal aliens who are not arrested immediately upon release are thereby exempt from mandatory detention under \u00a71226(c).  583 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).  We now reverse.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before addressing the merits of the Court of Appeals' interpretation, we resolve four questions regarding our jurisdiction to hear these cases.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first potential hurdle concerns \u00a71226(e), which states:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The [Secretary's] discretionary judgment regarding the application of [\u00a71226] shall not be subject to review.  No court may set aside any action or decision by the [Secretary] under this section regarding the detention or release of any alien or the grant, revocation, or denial of bond or parole.\"  (Emphasis added.)\nAs we have held, this limitation applies only to \"discretionary\" decisions about the \"application\" of \u00a71226 to particular cases.  It does not block lawsuits over \"the extent of the Government's detention authority under the 'statutory framework' as a whole.\"  Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2018) (slip op., at 11-12) (quoting Demore, 538 U.\u00a0S., at 517).  And the general extent of the Government's authority under \u00a71226(c) is precisely the issue here.  Respondents' argument is not that the Government exercised its statutory authority in an unreasonable fashion.  Instead, they dispute the extent of the statutory authority that the Government claims.  Because this claim of authority does not constitute a mere \"discretionary\" \"application\" of the relevant statute, our review is not barred by \u00a71226(e).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor are we stripped of jurisdiction by \u00a71252(b)(9), which provides:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Judicial review of all questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States under this subchapter [including \u00a7\u00a71225 and 1226] shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under this section.\"  (Emphasis added.)\nAs in Jennings, respondents here \"are not asking for review of an order of removal; they are not challenging the decision to detain them in the first place or to seek removal [as opposed to the decision to deny them bond hearings]; and they are not even challenging any part of the process by which their removability will be determined.  Under these circumstances,\" we held in Jennings, see 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 10-11), \"\u00a71252(b)(9) does not present a jurisdictional bar.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government raised a third concern before the District Court in Preap: that under 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71252(f)(1), that court lacked jurisdiction to enter the requested injunction. As \u00a71252(f)(1) cautions:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Regardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the identity of the party or parties bringing the action, no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of [\u00a7\u00a71221-1232] other than with respect to the application of such provisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings under such part have been initiated.\"\nDid the Preap court overstep this limit by granting injunctive relief for a class of aliens that includes some who have not yet faced--but merely \"will face\"--mandatory detention?  The District Court said no, but we need not decide.  Whether the Preap court had jurisdiction to enter such an injunction is irrelevant because the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs' request for declaratory relief, and for independent reasons given below, we are ordering the dissolution of the injunction that the District Court ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, and again before the Preap District Court, the Government raised a fourth potential snag: mootness. Class actions are \"[n]ormally .\u00a0.\u00a0. moot if no named class representative with an unexpired claim remain[s] at the time of class certification.\"  United States v. Sanchez-Gomez, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 4).  But that general norm is no hurdle here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The suggestion of mootness in these cases was based on the fact that by the time of class certification the named plaintiffs had obtained either cancellation of removal or bond hearings.  See 831 F. 3d, at 1197-1198; Khoury v. Asher, 3 F. Supp. 3d 877, 879-880 (WD Wash. 2014).  But those developments did not make the cases moot because at least one named plaintiff in both cases had obtained release on bond, as opposed to cancellation of removal, and that release had been granted following a preliminary injunction in a separate case.  Unless that preliminary injunction was made permanent and was not disturbed on appeal, these individuals faced the threat of re-arrest and mandatory detention.  And indeed, we later ordered that that injunction be dissolved.  See Jennings, 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 31).  Thus, in both cases, there was at least one named plaintiff with a live claim when the class was certified.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if that had not been so, these cases would not be moot because the fact that a class \"was not certified until after the named plaintiffs' claims had become moot does not deprive us of jurisdiction\" when, as in these cases, the harms alleged are transitory enough to elude review.  County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.\u00a0S. 44, 52 (1991) (affirming jurisdiction over a class action challenging a county's failure to provide \"prompt\" determinations of probable cause for those subjected to warrantless arrest and detention).  Respondents claim that they would be harmed by detention without a hearing pending a decision on their removal.  Because this type of injury ends as soon as the decision on removal is made, it is transitory.  So the fact that the named plaintiffs obtained some relief before class certification does not moot their claims.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having assured ourselves of our jurisdiction, we turn to the merits.  Respondents contend that they are not properly subject to \u00a71226(c)'s mandatory-detention scheme, but instead are entitled to the bond hearings available to those held under the general arrest and release authority provided in \u00a71226(a).  Respondents' primary textual argument turns on the interaction of paragraphs (1) and (2) of \u00a71226(c).  Recall that those paragraphs govern, respectively, the \"[c]ustody\" and \"[r]elease\" of criminal aliens guilty of a predicate offense.  Paragraph (1) directs the Secretary to arrest any such alien \"when the alien is released,\" and paragraph (2) forbids the Secretary to release any \"alien described in paragraph (1)\" pending a determination on removal (with one exception not relevant here).  Because the parties' arguments about the meaning of \u00a71226(c) require close attention to the statute's terms and structure, we reproduce the provision in full below.  But only the portions of the statute that we have highlighted are directly relevant to respondents' argument.  Section 1226(c) provides:\n\"(c) Detention of criminal aliens\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(1) Custody\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The [Secretary] shall take into custody any alien who--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(A) is inadmissible by reason of having committed any offense covered in section 1182(a)(2) of this title,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(B) is deportable by reason of having committed any offense covered in section 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), (A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D) of this title,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(C) is deportable under section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) of this title on the basis of an offense for which the alien has been sentence[d] to a term of imprisonment of at least 1 year, or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(D) is inadmissible under section 1182(a)(3)(B) of this title or deportable under section 1227(a)(4)(B) of this title,\n\"when the alien is released, without regard to whether the alien is released on parole, supervised release, or probation, and without regard to whether the alien may be arrested or imprisoned again for the same  offense.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(2) Release\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The [Secretary] may release an alien described in paragraph (1) only if the [Secretary] decides pursuant to section 3521 of title 18 that release of the alien from custody is necessary to provide protection to a witness, a potential witness, a person cooperating with an investigation into major criminal activity, or an immediate family member or close associate of a witness, potential witness, or person cooperating with such an investigation, and the alien satisfies the [Secretary] that the alien will not pose a danger to the safety of other persons or of property and is likely to appear for any scheduled proceeding.  A decision relating to such release shall take place in accordance with a procedure that considers the severity of the offense committed by the alien.\"  (Emphasis added.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents argue that they are not subject to mandatory detention because they are not \"described in\" \u00a71226(c)(1), even though they (and all the other members of the classes they represent) fall into at least one of the categories of aliens covered by subparagraphs (A)-(D) of that provision.  An alien covered by these subparagraphs is not \"described in\" \u00a71226(c)(1), respondents contend, unless the alien was also arrested \"when [he or she was] released\" from criminal custody.  Indeed, respondents insist that the alien must have been arrested immediately after release.  Since they and the other class members were not arrested immediately, respondents conclude, they are not \"described in\" \u00a71226(c)(1).  So to detain them, the Government must rely not on \u00a71226(c) but on the general provisions of \u00a71226(a).  And thus, like others detained under \u00a71226(a), they are owed bond hearings in which they can earn their release by proving that they pose no flight risk and no danger to others--or so they claim.  But neither the statute's text nor its structure supports this argument.  In fact, both cut the other way.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, respondents' position runs aground on the plain text of \u00a71226(c).  Respondents are right that only an alien \"described in paragraph (1)\" faces mandatory detention, but they are wrong about which aliens are \"described in\" paragraph (1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph (1) provides that the Secretary \"shall take\" into custody any \"alien\" having certain characteristics and that the Secretary must do this \"when the alien is released\" from criminal custody.  The critical parts of the provision consist of a verb (\"shall take\"), an adverbial clause (\"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released\"), a noun (\"alien\"), and a series of adjectival clauses (\"who .\u00a0.\u00a0. is inadmissible,\" \"who .\u00a0.\u00a0. is deportable,\" etc.).  As an initial matter, no one can deny that the adjectival clauses modify (and in that sense \"describ[e]\") the noun \"alien\" or that the adverbial clause \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released\" modifies the verb \"shall take.\"  And since an adverb cannot modify a noun, the \"when released\" clause cannot modify \"alien.\"  Again, what modifies (and in that sense \"describe[s]\") the noun \"alien\" are the adjectival clauses that appear in subparagraphs (A)-(D).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents and the dissent contend that this grammatical point is not the end of the matter--that an adverb can \"describe\" a person even though it cannot modify the noun used to denote that person.  See post, at 5-6 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  But our interpretation is not dependent on a rule of grammar.  The preliminary point about grammar merely complements what is critical, and indeed conclusive in these cases: the particular meaning of the term \"described\" as it appears in \u00a71226(c)(2).  As we noted in Luna Torres v. Lynch, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6), the term \"\u00a0'describe' takes on different meanings in different contexts.\"  A leading definition of the term is \"to communicate verbally .\u00a0.\u00a0. an account of salient identifying features,\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 610 (1976), and that is clearly the meaning of the term used in the phrase \"an alien described in paragraph (1).\"  (Emphasis added.)  This is clear from the fact that the indisputable job of the \"descri[ption] in paragraph (1)\" is to \"identif[y]\" for the Secretary--to list the \"salient .\u00a0.\u00a0. features\" by which she can pick out--which aliens she must arrest immediately \"when [they are] released.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And here is the crucial point: The \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released\" clause could not possibly describe aliens in that sense; it plays no role in identifying for the Secretary which aliens she must immediately arrest.  If it did, the directive in \u00a71226(c)(1) would be nonsense.  It would be ridiculous to read paragraph (1) as saying: \"The Secretary must arrest, upon their release from jail, a particular subset of criminal aliens.  Which ones?  Only those who are arrested upon their release from jail.\"  Since it is the Secretary's action that determines who is arrested upon release, \"being arrested upon release\" cannot be one of her criteria in figuring out whom to arrest.  So it cannot \"describe\"--it cannot give the Secretary an \"identifying featur[e]\" of--the relevant class of aliens.  On any other reading of paragraph (1), the command that paragraph (1) gives the Secretary would be downright incoherent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our reading is confirmed by Congress's use of the definite article in \"when the alien is released.\"  Because \"[w]ords are to be given the meaning that proper grammar and usage would assign them,\" A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 140 (2012), the \"rules of grammar govern\" statutory interpretation \"unless they contradict legislative intent or purpose,\" ibid. (citing Costello v. INS, 376 U.\u00a0S. 120, 122-126 (1964)).  Here grammar and usage establish that \"the\" is \"a function word .\u00a0.\u00a0. indicat[ing] that a following noun or noun equivalent is definite or has been previously specified by context.\"  Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1294 (11th ed. 2005).  See also Work v. United States ex\u00a0rel. McAlester-Edwards Co., 262 U.\u00a0S. 200, 208 (1923) (Congress's \"use of the definite article [in a reference to \"the appraisement\"] means an appraisement specifically provided for\").  For \"the alien\"--in the clause \"when the alien is released\"--to have been previously specified, its scope must have been settled by the time the \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released\" clause appears at the tail end of paragraph (1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, we hold that the scope of \"the alien\" is fixed by the predicate offenses identified in subparagraphs (A)-(D).5  And since only those subparagraphs settle who is \"described in paragraph (1),\" anyone who fits their description falls under paragraph (2)'s detention mandate--even if (as with respondents) the Secretary did not arrest them immediately \"when\" they were \"released.\"\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In reaching the contrary conclusion, the Ninth Circuit thought that the very structure of \u00a71226 favors respondents' reading.  In particular, the Ninth Circuit reasoned, each subsection's arrest and release provisions must work together.  Thus, aliens must be arrested under the general arrest authority in subsection (a) in order to get a bond hearing under subsection (a)'s release provision.  And in order to face mandatory detention under subsection (c), criminal aliens must have been arrested under subsection (c).  But since subsection (c) authorizes only immediate arrest, the argument continues, those arrested later fall under subsection (a), not (c).  Accordingly, the court concluded, those arrested well after release escape subsection (c)'s detention mandate.  See 831 F. 3d, at 1201-1203.  But this argument misreads the structure of \u00a71226; and in any event, the Ninth Circuit's conclusion would not follow even if we granted all its premises about statutory structure.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the Ninth Circuit viewed subsections (a) and (c) as establishing separate sources of arrest and release authority, in fact subsection (c) is simply a limit on the authority conferred by subsection (a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recall that subsection (a) has two sentences that provide the Secretary with general discretion over the arrest and release of aliens, respectively.  We read each of subsection (c)'s two provisions--paragraph (1) on arrest, and paragraph (2) on release--as modifying its counterpart sentence in subsection (a).  In particular, subsection (a) creates authority for anyone's arrest or release under \u00a71226--and it gives the Secretary broad discretion as to both actions--while subsection (c)'s job is to subtract some of that discretion when it comes to the arrest and release of criminal aliens.  Thus, subsection (c)(1) limits subsection (a)'s first sentence by curbing the discretion to arrest: The Secretary must arrest those aliens guilty of a predicate offense.  And subsection (c)(2) limits subsection (a)'s second sentence by cutting back the Secretary's discretion over the decision to release: The Secretary may not release aliens \"described in\" subsection (c)(1)--that is, those guilty of a predicate offense.  Accordingly, all the relevant detainees will have been arrested by authority that springs from subsection (a), and so, contrary to the Court of Appeals' view, that fact alone will not spare them from subsection (c)(2)'s prohibition on release.  This reading comports with the Government's practice of applying to the arrests of all criminal aliens certain procedural requirements, such as the need for a warrant, that appear only in subsection (a).  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 13-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The text of \u00a71226 itself contemplates that aliens arrested under subsection (a) may face mandatory detention under subsection (c).  The second sentence in subsection (a)--which generally authorizes the Secretary to release an alien pending removal proceedings--features an exception \"as provided in subsection (c).\"  But if the Court of Appeals were right that subsection (c)(2)'s prohibition on release applies only to those arrested pursuant to subsection (c)(1), there would have been no need to specify that such aliens are exempt from subsection (a)'s release provision.  This shows that it is possible for those arrested under subsection (a) to face mandatory detention under subsection (c).  We draw a similar inference from the fact that subsection (c)(2), for its part, does not limit mandatory detention to those arrested \"pursuant to\" subsection (c)(1) or \"under authority created by\" subsection (c)(1)--but to anyone so much as \"described in\" subsection (c)(1).  This choice of words marks a contrast with Congress's reference--in the immediately preceding subsection--to actions by the Secretary that are \"authorized under\" subsection (a).  See \u00a71226(b).  Cf. 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73262(b) (referring to \"a person arrested under subsection (a)\" (emphasis added)).  These textual cues indicate that even if an alien was not arrested under authority bestowed by subsection (c)(1), he may face mandatory detention under subsection (c)(2).\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But even if the Court of Appeals were right to reject this reading, the result below would be wrong.  To see why, assume with the Court of Appeals that only someone arrested under authority created by \u00a71226(c)(1)--rather than the more general \u00a71226(a)--may be detained without a bond hearing.  And assume that subsection (c)(1) requires immediate arrest.  Even then, the Secretary's failure to abide by this time limit would not cut off her power to arrest under subsection (c)(1).  That is so because, as we have held time and again, an official's crucial duties are better carried out late than never.  See Sylvain v. Attorney General of U. S., 714 F.\u00a03d 150, 158 (CA3 2013) (collecting cases).  Or more precisely, a statutory rule that officials \"\u00a0'shall' act within a specified time\" does not by itself \"preclud[e] action later.\"  Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U.\u00a0S. 149, 158 (2003).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Especially relevant here is our decision in United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U.\u00a0S. 711 (1990).  There we held that \"a provision that a detention hearing 'shall be held immediately upon the [detainee's] first appearance before the judicial officer' did not bar detention after a tardy hearing.\"  Barnhart, 537 U.\u00a0S., at 159 (quoting Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 714).  In that case, we refused to \"bestow upon the defendant a windfall\" and \"visit upon the Government and the citizens a severe penalty by mandating release of possibly dangerous defendants every time some deviation from the [statutory] strictures .\u00a0.\u00a0. occur[red].\"  Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 720.  Instead, we gave effect to the principle that \"\u00a0'if a statute does not specify a consequence for noncompliance with statutory timing provisions, the federal courts will not in the ordinary course impose their own coercive sanction.'\u00a0\"  Barnhart, 537 U.\u00a0S., at 159 (quoting United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U.\u00a0S. 43, 63 (1993)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This principle for interpreting time limits on statutory mandates was a fixture of the legal backdrop when Congress enacted \u00a71226(c).  Cf. Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U.\u00a0S. 202, 209 (2003) (relying on the \"legal backdrop\" against which \"Congress legislated\" to clarify what Congress enacted).  Indeed, we have held of a statute enacted just four years before \u00a71226(c) that because of our case law at the time--never since abrogated--Congress was \"presumably aware that we do not readily infer congressional intent to limit an agency's power to get a mandatory job done merely from a specification to act by a certain time.\"  Barnhart, 537 U.\u00a0S., at 160 (relying on Brock v. Pierce County, 476 U.\u00a0S. 253 (1986)).  Here this principle entails that even if subsection (c)(1) were the sole source of authority to arrest aliens without granting them hearings, that authority would not evaporate just because officials had transgressed subsection (c)(1)'s command to arrest aliens immediately \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents object that the rule invoked in Montalvo-Murillo and related cases does not apply here.  In those cases, respondents argue, the governmental authority at issue would have disappeared entirely if time limits were enforced--whereas here the Secretary could still arrest aliens well after their release under the general language in \u00a71226(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the whole premise of respondents' argument is that if the Secretary could no longer act under \u00a71226(c), she would lose a specific power--the power to arrest and detain criminal aliens without a bond hearing.  If that is so, then as in other cases, accepting respondents' deadline-based argument would be inconsistent with \"the design and function of the statute.\"  Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 719.  From Congress's perspective, after all, it is irrelevant that the Secretary could go on detaining criminal aliens subject to a bond hearing.  Congress enacted mandatory detention precisely out of concern that such individualized hearings could not be trusted to reveal which \"deportable criminal aliens who are not detained\" might \"continue to engage in crime [or] fail to appear for their removal hearings.\"  Demore, 538 U.\u00a0S., at 513.  And having thus required the Secretary to impose mandatory detention without bond hearings immediately, for safety's sake, Congress could not have meant for judges to \"enforce\" this duty in case of delay by--of all things--forbidding its execution.  Cf. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 720 (\"The end of exacting compliance with the letter\" of the Bail Reform Act's requirement that a defendant receive a hearing immediately upon his first appearance before a judicial officer \"cannot justify the means of exposing the public to an increased likelihood of violent crimes by persons on bail, an evil the statute aims to prevent\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Especially hard to swallow is respondents' insistence that for an alien to be subject to mandatory detention under \u00a71226(c), the alien must be arrested on the day he walks out of jail (though respondents allow that it need not be at the jailhouse door--the \"parking lot\" or \"bus stop\" would do).  Tr. of Oral Arg. 44.  \"Assessing the situation in realistic and practical terms, it is inevitable that\" respondents' unsparing deadline will often be missed  for reasons beyond the Federal Government's control.  Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 720.  Cf. Regions Hospital v. Shalala, 522 U.\u00a0S. 448, 459, n.\u00a03 (1998) (\"The Secretary's failure to meet the deadline, a not uncommon occurrence when heavy loads are thrust on administrators, does not mean that [she] lacked power to act beyond it\").  To give just one example, state and local officials sometimes rebuff the Government's request that they give notice when a criminal alien will be released.  Indeed, over a span of less than three years (from January 2014 to September 2016), the Government recorded \"a total of 21,205 declined [requests] in 567 counties in 48 states including the District of Columbia.\"  ICE, Fiscal Year 2016 ICE Enf. and Removal Operations Rep. 9.  Nor was such local resistance unheard of when Congress enacted the language of \u00a71226(c) in 1996.  See S. Rep. No. 104-48, p.\u00a028 (1995).  Under these circumstances, it is hard to believe that Congress made the Secretary's mandatory-detention authority vanish at the stroke of midnight after an alien's release.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, the import of our case law is clear: Even if subsection (c) were the only font of authority to detain aliens without bond hearings, we could not read its \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released\" clause to defeat officials' duty to impose such mandatory detention when it comes to aliens who are arrested well after their release.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents protest that reading \u00a71226(c) in the manner set forth here would render key language superfluous, lead to anomalies, and violate the canon of constitutional avoidance.  We answer these objections in turn.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to respondents, the Government's reading of \u00a71226(c) flouts the interpretive canon against surplusage--the idea that \"every word and every provision is to be given effect [and that n]one should needlessly be given an interpretation that causes it to duplicate another provision or to have no consequence.\"  Scalia, Reading Law, at 174.  See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.\u00a0S. 759, 778 (1988) (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.) (citing the \"cardinal rule of statutory interpretation that no provision should be construed to be entirely redundant\").  Respondents' surplusage argument has two focal points.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, respondents claim that if they face mandatory detention even though they were arrested well after their release, then \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released\" adds nothing to paragraph (1).  In fact, however, it still has work to do.  For one thing, it clarifies when the duty to arrest is triggered: upon release from criminal custody, not before such release or after the completion of noncustodial portions of a criminal sentence (such as a term of \"parole, supervised release, or probation,\" as the paragraph goes on to emphasize).  Thus, paragraph (1) does not permit the Secretary to cut short an alien's state prison sentence in order to usher him more easily right into immigration detention--much as another provision prevents officials from actually removing an alien from the country \"until the alien is released from imprisonment.\"  8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71231(a)(4)(A).  And from the other end, as paragraph (1)'s language makes clear, the Secretary need not wait for the sentencing court's supervision over the alien to expire.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released\" clause also serves another purpose: exhorting the Secretary to act quickly.  And this point answers respondents' second surplusage claim: that the \"Transition Period Custody Rules\" enacted along with \u00a71226(c) would have been superfluous if \u00a71226(c) did not call for immediate arrests, since those rules authorized delays in \u00a71226(c)'s implementation while the Government expanded its capacities.  See Matter of Garvin-Noble, 21 I. & N. Dec. 672, 675 (BIA 1997).  This argument again confuses what the Secretary is obligated to do with the consequences that follow if the Secretary fails (for whatever reason) to fulfill that obligation.  The transition rules delayed the onset of the Secretary's obligation to begin making arrests as soon as covered aliens were released from criminal custody, and in that sense they were not superfluous.6  This is so even though, had the transition rules not been adopted, the Secretary's failure to make an arrest immediately upon a covered alien's release would not have exempted the alien from mandatory detention under \u00a71226(c).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals objected that the Government's reading of \u00a71226(c) would have the bizarre result that some aliens whom the Secretary need not arrest at all must nonetheless be detained without a hearing if they are arrested.  831 F. 3d, at 1201-1203.  This rather complicated argument, as we understand it, proceeds as follows.  Paragraph (2) requires the detention of aliens \"described in paragraph (1).\"  While most of the aliens described there have been convicted of a criminal offense, this need not be true of aliens captured by subparagraph (D) in particular--which covers, for example, aliens who are close relatives of terrorists and those who are believed likely to commit a terrorist act.  See \u00a71182(a)(3)(B)(i)(IX).  But if, as the Government maintains, any alien who falls under subparagraphs (A)-(D) is thereby ineligible for release from immigration custody, then the Secretary would be forbidden to release even these aliens who were never convicted or perhaps even charged with a crime, once she arrested them.  Yet she would be free not to arrest them to begin with (or so the Court of Appeals assumed), since she is obligated to arrest aliens \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released,\" and there was no prior custody for these aliens to be \"released\" from.  Therefore, the court concluded, the Government's position has the absurd implication that aliens who were never charged with a crime need not be arrested pending a removal determination, but if they are arrested, they must be detained and cannot be released on bond or parole.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We agree that it would be very strange for Congress to forbid the release of aliens who need not be arrested in the first place, but the fact is that the Government's reading (and ours) does not have that incongruous result.  The real anomalies here would flow instead from the Court of Appeals' interpretation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To begin with the latter point: Under the Court of Appeals' reading, the mandatory-detention scheme would be gentler on terrorists than it is on garden-variety offenders.  To see why, recall first that subparagraphs (A)-(C) cover aliens who are inadmissible or deportable based on the commission of certain criminal offenses, and there is no dispute that the statute authorizes their mandatory detention when they are released from criminal custody.  And the crimes covered by these subparagraphs include, for example, any drug offense by an adult punishable by more than one year of imprisonment, see \u00a7\u00a71182(a)(2), 1226(c)(1)(A), as well as a variety of tax offenses, see \u00a7\u00a71226(c)(1)(B), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii); Kawashima v. Holder, 565 U.\u00a0S. 478 (2012).  But notice that aliens who fall  within subparagraph (D), by contrast, may never have been arrested on criminal charges--which according to the court below would exempt them from mandatory detention.  Yet this subparagraph covers the very sort of aliens for which Congress was most likely to have wanted to require mandatory detention--including those who are representatives of a terrorist group and those whom the Government has reasonable grounds to believe are likely to engage in terrorist activities.  See \u00a7\u00a71182(a)(3)(B)(i)(III), (IV), 1226(c)(1)(D).7  Thus, by the Court of Appeals' logic, Congress chose to spare terrorist aliens from the rigors of mandatory detention--a mercy withheld from almost all drug offenders and tax cheats.  See Brief for National Immigrant Justice Center as Amicus Curiae 7-8.  That result would be incongruous.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Along similar lines, note that one \u00a71226(c)(1) predicate reaches aliens who necessarily escape conviction: those \"for whom immunity from criminal jurisdiction was exercised.\"  \u00a71182(a)(2)(E)(ii).  See \u00a71226(c)(1)(A).  And other predicates sweep in aliens whom there is no reason to expect police (as opposed to immigration officials) will have reason to arrest: e.g., the \"spouse or child of an  alien\" who recently engaged in terrorist activity.  \u00a71182(a)(3)(B)(i)(IX); see \u00a71226(c)(1)(D).  It would be pointless for Congress to have covered such aliens in subsections (c)(1)(A)-(D) if subsection (c)'s mandates applied only to those emerging from jail.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, contrary to the Court of Appeals' interpretation of the \"when released\" clause as limiting the class of aliens subject to mandatory detention, we read subsection (c)(1) to specify the timing of arrest (\"when the alien is released\") only for the vast majority of cases: those involving criminal aliens who were once in criminal custody.  The paragraph simply does not speak to the timeline for arresting the few who had no stint in jail.  (And why should it?  Presumably they--unlike those serving time--are to be detained as they come across the Government's radar and any relevant evidentiary standards are satisfied.8)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, we read the \"when released\" directive to apply when there is a release.  In other situations, it is simply not relevant.  It follows that both of subsection (c)'s mandates--for arrest and for release--apply to any alien linked with a predicate offense identified in subparagraphs (A)-(D), regardless of exactly when or even whether the alien was released from criminal custody.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, respondents perch their reading of \u00a71226(c)--unsteadily, as it turns out--on the canon of constitutional avoidance.  This canon provides that \"[w]hen 'a serious doubt' is raised about the constitutionality of an act of Congress, '.\u00a0.\u00a0. this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.'\u00a0\"  Jennings, 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (quoting Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.\u00a0S. 22, 62 (1932)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents say we should be uneasy about endorsing any reading of \u00a71226(c) that would mandate arrest and detention years after aliens' release from criminal custody--when many aliens will have developed strong ties to the country and a good chance of being allowed to stay if given a hearing.  At that point, respondents argue, mandatory detention may be insufficiently linked to public benefits like protecting others against crime and ensuring that aliens will appear at their removal proceedings.  In respondents' view, detention in that scenario would raise constitutional doubts under Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.\u00a0S. 678 (2001), which held that detention violates due process absent \"adequate procedural protections\" or \"special justification[s]\" sufficient to outweigh one's \"\u00a0'constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical restraint,'\u00a0\" id., at 690 (quoting Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.\u00a0S. 346, 356 (1997)).  Thus, respondents urge, we should adopt a reading of \u00a71226(c)--their reading--that avoids this result.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trouble with this argument is that constitutional avoidance \"\u00a0'comes into play only when, after the application of ordinary textual analysis, the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one construction.'\u00a0\"  Jennings, 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  The canon \"has no application\" absent \"ambiguity.\"  Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.\u00a0S. 40, 50 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).  See also Zadvydas, 533 U.\u00a0S., at 696 (\"Despite this constitutional problem, if Congress has made its intent in the statute clear, we must give effect to that intent\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Here the text of \u00a71226 cuts clearly against respondents' position, see Part III, supra, making constitutional avoidance irrelevant.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We emphasize that respondents' arguments here have all been statutory.  Even their constitutional concerns are offered as just another pillar in an argument for their preferred reading of the language of \u00a71226(c)--an idle pillar here because the statute is clear.  While respondents might have raised a head-on constitutional challenge to \u00a71226(c), they did not.  Our decision today on the meaning of that statutory provision does not foreclose as-applied challenges--that is, constitutional challenges to applications of the statute as we have now read it.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgments of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit are reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nKavanaugh, J., concurring\n\u2002586 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 16-1363\nKIRSTJEN M.

Under longstanding federal statutes, the Executive Branch may remove noncitizens from the United States when the noncitizens have been convicted of certain crimes, even when the crimes were committed many years ago.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case is also not about whether a noncitizen may be detained during removal proceedings or before removal.  Congress has expressly authorized the Executive Branch to detain noncitizens during their removal proceedings and before removal.  8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71226(a), (c), and 1231(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case is also not about how long a noncitizen may be detained during removal proceedings or before removal.  We have addressed that question in cases such as Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.\u00a0S. 678 (2001), Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.\u00a0S. 371 (2005), and Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case is also not about whether Congress may mandate that the Executive Branch detain noncitizens during removal proceedings or before removal, as opposed to merely giving the Executive Branch discretion to detain.  It is undisputed that Congress may mandate that the Executive Branch detain certain noncitizens during removal proceedings or before removal.  Congress has in fact mandated detention of certain noncitizens who have been in criminal custody and who, upon their release, would pose a danger to the community or risk of flight.  As relevant here, Congress has mandated detention \"when\" such noncitizens are \"released\" from criminal custody. 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71226(c)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sole question before us is narrow: whether, under \u00a71226, the Executive Branch's mandatory duty to detain a particular noncitizen when the noncitizen is released from criminal custody remains mandatory if the Executive Branch fails to immediately detain the noncitizen when the noncitizen is released from criminal custody--for example, if the Executive Branch fails to immediately detain the noncitizen because of resource constraints or because the Executive Branch cannot immediately locate and apprehend the individual in question.  No constitutional issue is presented.  The issue before us is entirely statutory and requires our interpretation of the strict 1996 illegal-immigration law passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton.  Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 3009-546.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It would be odd, in my view, if the Act (1) mandated detention of particular noncitizens because the noncitizens posed such a serious risk of danger or flight that they must be detained during their removal proceedings, but (2) nonetheless allowed the noncitizens to remain free during their removal proceedings if the Executive Branch failed to immediately detain them upon their release from criminal custody.  Not surprisingly, the Act does not require such an odd result.  On the contrary, the relevant text of the Act is relatively straightforward, as the Court explains.  Interpreting that text, the Court correctly holds that the Executive Branch's detention of the particular noncitizens here remained mandatory even though the Executive Branch did not immediately detain them.  I agree with the Court's careful statutory analysis, and I join the Court's opinion in full.\n\nOpinion of Thomas, J.\n\u2002586 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 16-1363\nKIRSTJEN M.

See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1-11).  By my count, Congress has erected at least three barriers to our review of the merits, and I also question whether Article III jurisdiction existed at the time of class certification.  Nonetheless, because the Court has held that we have jurisdiction in cases like these, and because I largely agree with the Court's resolution of the merits, I join all but Parts II and III-B-2 of the Court's opinion.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents consist of two classes of aliens who committed criminal offenses that require the Secretary of Homeland Security to detain them without a bond hearing under 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71226(c), but who were not detained immediately upon release from criminal custody.  Respondents argued that, by failing to immediately detain them, the Secretary lost the authority to deny them a bond hearing when they were rearrested.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first class action was brought in the Northern District of California and has three class representatives.  One of the plaintiffs, Mony Preap, received cancellation of removal and was not in immigration custody at the time of certification.  The other two, Eduardo Vega Padilla and Juan Lozano Magdaleno, had received bond hearings as required by a Ninth Circuit decision, Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.\u00a03d 1127, 1138 (2013); Padilla had been released, while Magdaleno was denied release.  The District Court certified a class of all aliens in California who are or will be subjected to mandatory detention under \u00a71226(c) and who were not or will not have been taken into custody by the Government immediately upon their release from criminal custody for a \u00a71226(c)(1) offense.  The court issued a preliminary injunction requiring the Government to provide all class members with bond hearings under \u00a71226(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second class action was brought in the Western District of Washington and also has three class representatives: Bassam Yusuf Khoury and Alvin Rodriguez Moya, who had been released on bond before class certification after their Rodriguez hearings, and Pablo Carrera Zavala, who was released before class certification because the Department of Homeland Security determined that he had not committed a predicate \u00a71226(c)(1) offense.  The District Court certified a class of all aliens in its judicial district who were not detained immediately upon their release from criminal custody but were subjected to mandatory detention under \u00a71226(c).  The court entered a declaratory judgment barring the Government from subjecting class members to detention under \u00a71226(c) unless it took the alien into custody immediately upon release.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At least three statutory provisions limit judicial review here, and I am skeptical whether the District Courts had Article III jurisdiction to certify the classes.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, \u00a71252(b)(9) bars judicial review of \"all questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States,\" except for review of \"a final order\" or other circumstances not present here.  These cases raise questions of law or fact arising from removal proceedings--\"[d]etention is necessarily a part of [the] deportation procedure\" that culminates in the removal of the alien, Carlson v. Landon, 342 U.\u00a0S. 524, 538 (1952)--and they do not come to us on review of final orders of removal.  Thus, for the reasons I set forth in Jennings, supra, at ___-___ (slip op., at 1-11), no court has jurisdiction over these class actions.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, \u00a71226(e) provides that \"[n]o court may set aside any action or decision by the [Secretary] under this section regarding the detention or release of any alien or the grant, revocation, or denial of bond or parole.\"  (Emphasis added.)  This provision \"unequivocally deprives federal courts of jurisdiction to set aside 'any action or decision' by the [Secretary]\" regarding detention, discretionary or otherwise.  Demore v. Kim, 538 U.\u00a0S. 510, 533 (2003) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see Jennings, supra, at ___, n.\u00a06 (slip op., at 11, n.\u00a06).  The Court once again reads this language as permitting judicial review for challenges to the \"statutory framework as a whole.\"  Ante, at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But the text of the statute contains no such exception.  Accordingly, I continue to think that no court has jurisdiction over these kinds of actions.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, \u00a71252(f)(1) deprives district courts of \"jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of [\u00a7\u00a71221-1232] other than with respect to the application of such provisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings under [\u00a7\u00a71221-1232] have been initiated.\"  The text of \u00a71252(f)(1) explicitly prohibits the classwide injunctive relief ordered by the Northern District of California in this instance, given that the class includes future, yet-to-be detained aliens against whom proceedings have not been initiated.  See Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.\u00a0S. 471, 481 (1999) (explaining that \u00a71252(f)(1) \"prohibits federal courts from granting classwide injunctive relief against the operation of \u00a7\u00a71221-1231\").  The District Court relied on Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.\u00a03d 1105 (CA9 2010), which held that this provision does not affect authority to enjoin alleged violations of the specified statutes because those claims do not \"seek to enjoin the operation of the immigration detention statutes, but to enjoin conduct .\u00a0.\u00a0. not authorized by the statutes.\"  Id., at 1120.  This reasoning is circular and unpersuasive.  Many claims seeking to enjoin or restrain the operation of the relevant statutes will allege that the Executive's action does not comply with the statutory grant of authority, but the text clearly bars jurisdiction to enter an injunction \"[r]egardless of the nature of the action or claim.\"  Although the Court avoids deciding whether \u00a71252(f)(1) prevented the District Court's injunction here, ante, at 8, I would hold that it did.\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, I harbor two concerns about whether the class actions were moot at the time of certification.  First, as the Court recognizes, class actions are ordinarily \"moot if no named class representative with an unexpired claim remain[s] at the time of class certification.\"  United States v. Sanchez-Gomez, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 4); ante, at 9.  At the time of class certification, all six of the named plaintiffs had received bond hearings or cancellation of removal.  As I understand the plaintiffs' arguments, that was the full relief that they sought: \"individualized bond hearings where they may attempt to prove that their release would not create a risk of flight or danger to the public.\"  Motion for Class Certification in Preap v. Beers, No. 4:13-cv-5754 (ND Cal.), Doc. 8, p.\u00a08; see Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief in Preap, supra, Doc. 1, p.\u00a03 (seeking \"immediate individualized bond hearings\"); First Amended Class Action Complaint in Khoury v. Asher, No. 2:13-cv-1367 (WD Wash.), Doc. 19, p.\u00a013 (requesting relief of \"individualized bond hearings to all Plaintiffs\").  The Court concludes that some of the named plaintiffs still faced the threat of rearrest and mandatory detention at the time of class certification because the bond hearings that they received were provided as part of a preliminary injunction in a separate case that was later dissolved.  But whether the plaintiffs actually faced that threat has not been addressed by the parties, and I question whether this future contingency was sufficiently imminent to support Article III jurisdiction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the threat of rearrest and mandatory detention was too speculative to support jurisdiction, I disagree with the Court that our jurisdiction would be saved by our precedent on transitory claims.  Ante, at 9-10.  We have held that a court has Article III jurisdiction to certify a class action when the named plaintiffs' claims have become moot if the claim is \"so inherently transitory that the trial court will not have even enough time to rule on a motion for class certification before the proposed representative's individual interest expires.\"  United States Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty, 445 U.\u00a0S. 388, 399 (1980).  The \"inherently transitory\" exception is measured from the time that the complaint is filed to the court's ruling on the motion for class certification.  See Genesis HealthCare Corp. v. Symczyk, 569 U.\u00a0S. 66, 75-77 (2013).  In other words, the named plaintiff's standing in a class action need not exist throughout the lifecycle of the entire lawsuit.  Here, Members of the Court have recognized that aliens are held, on average, for one year, and sometimes longer.  See Jennings, 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Breyer, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3) (noting that detention for aliens is \"often lengthy,\" sometimes lasting years).  I am not persuaded that the plaintiffs' claims are so \"inherently transitory\" as to preclude a ruling on class certification, especially since both District Courts certified the classes here within a year of the filing of the complaints.  Cf. County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.\u00a0S. 44, 47, 52 (1991) (finding jurisdiction over a class action that challenged a county's failure to provide \"prompt\" probable-cause hearings within the 48-hour window for arraignments, as required by state law).\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because three statutes deprive courts of jurisdiction over respondents' claims, I would have vacated the judgments below and remanded with instructions to dismiss the cases for lack of jurisdiction.  But because the Court has held otherwise and I agree with the Court's disposition of the merits, I concur in all but Parts II and III-B-2 of its opinion.\n\nBreyer, J., dissenting\n\u2002586 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 16-1363\nKIRSTJEN M.

It requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to take those aliens into custody \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released\" from prison and to hold them without a bail hearing until Government authorities decide whether to deport them.  The question is whether this provision limits the class of persons in the \"no-bail-hearing\" category to only those aliens who were taken into custody \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released\" from prison, or whether it also places in that \"no-bail-hearing\" category those aliens who were taken into custody years or decades after their release from prison.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The critical statutory language is contained in paragraph (2) of this provision.  That paragraph says (with one exception not relevant here) that \"an alien described in paragraph (1)\" must be held without a bail hearing.  Here we must decide what these words mean.  Do the words \"an alien described in paragraph (1)\" refer only to those aliens whom the Secretary, following paragraph (1)'s instructions, has \"take[n] into custody .\u00a0.\u00a0. when the alien is released\" from, say, state or federal prison?  Or do these words refer instead to all aliens who have ever committed one of the offenses listed in paragraph (1), regardless of when these aliens were \"released\" from prison?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For present purposes, I accept the Court's holding in Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018), that paragraph (2) forbids bail hearings for aliens \"described in paragraph (1).\"  But see id., at ___ (Breyer, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2) (interpreting paragraph (2) as not forbidding bail hearings, as the Constitution likely requires them); id., at ___ (majority opinion) (slip op., at 29) (declining to reach constitutional question).  Here, however, the Court goes much further.  The majority concludes that paragraph (2) forbids bail hearings for aliens regardless of whether they are taken into custody \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released\" from prison.  Under the majority's view, the statute forbids bail hearings even for aliens whom the Secretary has detained years or decades after their release from prison.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The language of the statute will not bear the broad interpretation the majority now adopts.  Rather, the ordinary meaning of the statute's language, the statute's structure, and relevant canons of interpretation all argue convincingly to the contrary.  I respectfully dissent.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The relevant statute, 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71226, is entitled \"Apprehension and detention of aliens.\"  See Appendix A, infra.  Its first subsection, subsection (a), is entitled \"Arrest, detention, and release.\"  Subsection (a) sets forth the background rule.  It gives the Secretary of Homeland Security (formerly the Attorney General) the authority to \"arres[t] and detai[n]\" an \"alien .\u00a0.\u00a0. pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States.\"  \u00a71226(a).  See ante, at 3, n.\u00a02. It adds that the Secretary \"may release the alien\" on \"bond\" or \"conditional parole.\"  \u00a71226(a)(2).  Federal regulations provide that a person detained under this subsection must receive a bail hearing.  8 CFR \u00a7\u00a7236.1(d)(1), 1236.1(d)(1) (2018).  With respect to release, however, subsection (a) adds the words \"[e]xcept as provided in subsection (c).\"  8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71226(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The subsection containing the exception to which (a) refers--namely, subsection (c)--is entitled \"Detention of criminal aliens.\"  It consists of two paragraphs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph (1), entitled \"Custody,\" says that the Secretary \"shall take into custody any alien who\" is \"inadmissible\" or \"deportable\" (by reason of having committed certain offenses or having ties to terrorism) \"when the alien is released,\" presumably from local, state, or federal criminal custody.  \u00a71226(c)(1) (emphasis added).  Because the relevant offenses are listed in four subparagraphs headed by the letters \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C,\" and \"D,\" I shall refer to the relevant aliens as \"ABCD\" aliens.  Thus, for present purposes, paragraph (1) says that the Secretary \"shall take into custody any\" ABCD alien \"when the alien is released\" from criminal custody.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paragraph (2), entitled \"Release,\" says that the Secretary \"may release an alien described in paragraph (1) only if\" the alien falls within a special category--not relevant here--related to witness protection.  \u00a71226(c)(2) (emphasis added).  We held last Term in Jennings that paragraph (2) forbids a bail hearing for \"an alien described in paragraph (1)\" unless the witness protection exception applies.  583 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (majority opinion) (slip op., at 20-22).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here we focus on the meaning of a key phrase in paragraph (2): \"an alien described in paragraph (1).\"  This is the phrase that identifies the aliens to whom paragraph (2) (and its \"no-bail-hearing\" requirement) applies.  Does paragraph (1) \"describ[e]\" all ABCD aliens, even those whom the Secretary has \"take[n] into custody\" many years after their release from prison?  Or does it \"describ[e]\" only those aliens whom the Secretary has \"take[n] into custody\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. when the alien [was] released\" from prison?\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The issue may sound technical.  But it is extremely important.  That is because the Government's reading of the statute--namely, that paragraph (2) forbids bail hearings for all ABCD aliens regardless of whether they were detained \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released\" from criminal custody--would significantly expand the Secretary's authority to deny bail hearings.  Under the Government's view, the aliens subject to detention without a bail hearing may have been released from criminal custody years earlier, and may have established families and put down roots in a community.  These aliens may then be detained for months, sometimes years, without the possibility of release; they may have been convicted of only minor crimes--for example, minor drug offenses, or crimes of \"moral turpitude\" such as illegally downloading music or possessing stolen bus transfers; and they sometimes may be innocent spouses or children of a suspect person.  Moreover, for a high percentage of them, it will turn out after months of custody that they will not be removed from the country because they are eligible by statute to receive a form of relief from removal such as cancellation of removal.  These are not mere hypotheticals.  See Appendix B, infra.  Thus, in terms of potential consequences and basic American legal traditions, see infra, at 11-12, the question before us is not a \"narrow\" one, ante, at 2 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why would Congress have granted the Secretary such broad authority to deny bail hearings, especially when doing so would run contrary to basic American and  common-law traditions?  See Jennings, supra, at ___-___ (Breyer, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 8-10).  The answer is that Congress did not do so.  Ordinary tools of statutory interpretation demonstrate that the authority Congress granted to the Secretary is far more limited.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statute's language, its structure, and relevant canons of interpretation make clear that the Secretary cannot hold an alien without a bail hearing unless the alien is \"take[n] into custody .\u00a0.\u00a0. when the alien is released\" from criminal custody.  \u00a71226(c)(1).\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider the statute's language.  Paragraph (1) of subsection (c) provides that the Secretary \"shall take into custody\" any ABCD alien--that is, any alien who is \"inadmissible\" or \"deportable\" under the subparagraphs labeled \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C,\" and \"D\"--\"when the alien is released\" from, say, state or federal prison.  Ibid.  Paragraph (2), meanwhile, generally forbids a bail hearing for \"an alien described in paragraph (1).\"  \u00a71226(c)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The key phrase in paragraph (2) is \"an alien described in paragraph (1).\"  As a matter of ordinary meaning and usage, the words \"take into custody .\u00a0.\u00a0. when the alien is released\" in paragraph (1) form part of the description of the \"alien\": An \"alien described in paragraph (1)\" is an ABCD alien whom the Secretary has \"take[n] into custody\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. when the alien is released\" from prison.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority emphasizes a grammatical point--namely, that ordinarily only adjectives or adjectival phrases \"modify\" nouns.  Ante, at 12. But the statute does not use the word \"modify.\"  It uses the word \"described.\"  While the word \"describe\" will in some contexts refer only to the words that directly \"modify\" a noun, normally it has a broader meaning.  Compare American Heritage Dictionary 490 (5th ed. 2011) (to \"describe\" is to \"convey an idea or impression of\") and Webster's Third New International Dictionary 610 (1986) (to \"describe\" is to \"convey an image or notion of\") with P. Peters, The Cambridge Guide to English Usage 355 (2004) (defining a \"modifie[r]\" as a word that \"qualifies\" a noun).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The common rules of grammar make the broad scope of the word \"described\" obvious.  They demonstrate that a noun often is \"described\" by more than just the adjectives that modify it.  Consider the following sentence: \"The well-behaved child was taken by a generous couple to see Hamilton.\"  That sentence, written in the passive voice, describes the \"child\" not only as \"well-behaved\" but also as someone \"taken by a generous couple to see Hamilton.\"  The description of the child would not differ were we to write the sentence in the active voice: \"The generous couple took the well-behaved child to see Hamilton.\"  The action taken by the \"generous couple\" (\"took .\u00a0.\u00a0. to see Hamilton\") still \"describes\" the \"child,\" even though these words do not \"modify\" the word \"child.\"  That is because a person who has been subjected to an action can be described by that action no less than by an adjective.  See Peters, supra, at 386 (describing such a person as someone \"affected by the action\"); B. Garner, The Chicago Guide to Grammar, Usage, and Punctuation 452 (2016) (describing such a person as someone who \"is acted on by or receives the action\"); see also R. Huddleston & G. Pullum, The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language 1436 (2002) (noting the \"large-scale overlap\" between adjectives and certain verb forms).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An example illustrates how these principles apply to the statute at issue here.  Imagine the following cookbook recipe.  Instruction (1) says: \"(1) Remove the Angus steak from the grill when the steak is cooked to 120 degrees Fahrenheit.\"  Instruction (4) says: \"(4) Let the steak described in Instruction (1) rest for ten minutes and then serve it.\"  What would we say of a chef who grilled an Angus steak to 185 degrees Fahrenheit, served it, and then appealed to these instructions--particularly the word \"described\" in Instruction (4)--as a justification?  That he was not a good cook?  That he had an odd sense of humor?  Or simply that he did not understand the instructions?  The chef would have no good textual defense: The steak \"described in Instruction (1)\" is not just an \"Angus\" steak, but an \"Angus\" steak that must be \"remove[d] .\u00a0.\u00a0. when the steak is cooked to 120 degrees Fahrenheit.\"  By the same logic, the alien in paragraph (1) is \"described\" not only by the four clauses--A, B, C, and D--that directly modify the word \"alien,\" but also by the verb (\"shall take\") and that verb's modifier (\"when the alien is released\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority argues that \"the crucial point\" is that the phrase \"when the alien is released\" plays \"no role in identifying for the Secretary which aliens she must immediately arrest.\"  Ante, at 13.  That may be so.  But why is that a \"crucial point\" in the majority's favor?  After all, in the example above, the words \"[r]emove .\u00a0.\u00a0. from the grill when the steak is cooked to 120 degrees Fahrenheit\" do not tell our chef what kind of steak to cook in the first place.  (The word \"Angus\" does that.)  Even so, those words still \"describe\" the steak that must be served in Instruction (4).  Why?  Because by the time our chef gets to Instruction (4), the recipe contemplates that the action in Instruction (1) has been completed.  At that point, the \"steak described in Instruction (1)\" is a steak that has been cooked in the manner mandated by Instruction (1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same is true of the two paragraphs before us.  The key word \"described\" appears not in paragraph (1), but in paragraph (2).  Paragraph (2) refers back to the entirety of paragraph (1).  And because paragraph (2) is the release provision, it contemplates that the action mandated by paragraph (1)--namely, detention--has already occurred.  Thus, the function of the phrase \"an alien described in paragraph (1)\" is not to describe who must be detained, but instead to describe who must be denied bail.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, the language demonstrates that an alien is \"described in paragraph (1)\"--and therefore subject to paragraph (2)'s bar on bail hearings--only if the alien is \"take[n] into custody .\u00a0.\u00a0. when the alien is released.\"\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statute's structure and context support this reading of the phrase \"an alien described in paragraph (1).\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, \"Congress often drafts statutes with hierarchical schemes--section, subsection, paragraph, and on down the line.\"  NLRB v. SW General, Inc., 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 9).  Congress employed that structure \"to make precise cross-references\" throughout the immigration code.  Ibid.  As relevant here, in a different detention provision enacted alongside the provision at issue here, Congress said that the Government \"may release the alien only if the alien is an alien described in subparagraph (A)(ii) or (A)(iii).\"  Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), \u00a7303(b)(3)(B), 110 Stat. 3009-587.  Yet Congress did not make such a precise cross-reference in paragraph (2): It did not refer to \"an alien described in subparagraphs (A)-(D) of paragraph (1),\" as it could have--and would have--done had it intended the majority's narrow interpretation.  Instead, it referred to aliens \"described\" in the entirety of paragraph (1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We usually \"presume differences in language like this convey differences in meaning.\"  Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc., 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6).  The cross-reference to all of paragraph (1) reinforces that \"an alien described in paragraph (1)\" is not just an ABCD alien, but an ABCD alien whom (in the words of paragraph (1)) the Secretary \"take[s] into custody .\u00a0.\u00a0. when the alien is released\" from criminal confinement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, consider the structural similarity between subsections (a) and (c).  See Appendix A, infra.  The first sentence of subsection (a) sets forth a detention rule: An \"alien may be arrested and detained\" pending a decision on the alien's removal.  8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71226(a).  And the second sentence sets forth a release rule that allows for release on bond and parole.  Ibid.  Subsection (c) has a parallel structure.  The first sentence (namely, paragraph (1)) says that the Secretary must \"take into custody\" a subset of those aliens \"when the alien is released\" from criminal custody.  \u00a71226(c)(1).  And the second sentence (namely, paragraph (2)) sets forth the rule that \"an alien described in paragraph (1)\" generally may not be released.  \u00a71226(c)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is obvious that the second sentence of (a) applies only to those aliens who are detained following the rule in (a)'s first sentence.  Parallel structure suggests that the same is true in (c): The second sentence of (c) applies only to those detained following the rule in (c)'s first sentence.  Subsection (a)'s reference to (c) strengthens this structural inference: Subsection (a) says that its release rule applies \"[e]xcept as provided in subsection (c)\"--that is, except as provided in the whole of subsection (c), not simply paragraph (2) or the few lines the majority picks from (c)'s text.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the release rule in each subsection (the second sentence) applies only if the Secretary complies with the detention rule in that subsection (the first sentence).  In light of \"the parallel structures of these provisions,\" it would \"flou[t] the text\" to find that an alien is subject to (c)'s release rule, which forbids release, without also finding that the alien was detained in accordance with (c)'s detention rule, which requires the alien to be detained \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released.\"  Chan v. Korean Air Lines, Ltd., 490 U.\u00a0S. 122, 132 (1989).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority responds that subsections (a) and (c) do not \"establis[h] separate sources of arrest and release authority,\" and that (c) is merely \"a limit\" on the authority granted by (a).  Ante, at 15.  But even if (c) were treated as a \"limit\" on the authority granted by (a), the parallel structure of the statute would still point to the same conclusion: The Secretary must comply with the limit on detention in the first sentence of (c) in order to invoke the rule on release in the second sentence of (c).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, Congress' enactment of a special \"transition\" statute strengthens the point.  When Congress enacted subsection (c), it recognized that there might be \"insufficient detention space\" and \"personnel\" to carry out subsection (c)'s requirements.  IIRIRA, \u00a7303(b)(2), 110 Stat. 3009-586.  It therefore authorized the Government to delay implementation of subsection (c)--initially for one year, then for a second year.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the majority were correct that the \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released\" provision does not set a time limit on the Secretary's authority to deny bail hearings, then a special transition statute delaying implementation for one year would have been unnecessary.  To avoid overcrowding, the Government simply could have delayed arresting aliens for 1, 2, 5, or 10 years, as the majority believes it can do, and then deny them bail hearings.  What need for a 1-year transition period?  The majority responds that the transition statute still served a purpose: to \"dela[y] the onset of the Secretary's obligation to begin making arrests.\"  Ante, at 21.  But that just raises the question: Why would Congress have needed to \"dela[y] the onset of the Secretary's obligation\" if it thought that the Secretary could detain aliens without a bail hearing after a year-long delay?  The majority offers no good answer.  The transition statute therefore strongly suggests that Congress viewed the \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released\" provision as a constraint on the Secretary's authority to deny a bail hearing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The transition statute also supports this conclusion in another respect: It demonstrates that Congress anticipated that subsection (c) would apply only to aliens \"released\" from state or federal prison.  As noted, clauses A, B, C, and D in paragraph (1) cover some aliens who have never been in criminal custody.  Supra, at 4.  Even the majority acknowledges that it would be bizarre if these aliens could be detained without a bail hearing.  Ante, at 23. The transition statute confirms as much: It indicates that \"the provisions of [subsection (c)] shall apply to individuals released after\" the transition period concludes.  IIRIRA, \u00a7303(b)(2), 110 Stat. 3009-586 (emphasis added).  From this it follows that Congress saw paragraph (2) as forbidding bail hearings only for aliens who have been \"released.\"  That, however, can be true only if the \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released\" provision limits the class of aliens subject to paragraph (2)'s \"no-bail-hearing\" requirement.  The majority's contrary reading, under which paragraph (2) applies \"regardless of .\u00a0.\u00a0. whether the alien was released from criminal custody,\" ante, at 25, conflicts with how Congress itself described the scope of subsection (c) when it enacted the statute.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if statutory text and structure were not enough to resolve these cases, the Government's reading would fail for another reason.  A well-established canon of statutory interpretation provides that, \"if fairly possible,\" a statute must be construed \"so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional but also grave doubts upon that score.\"  United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U.\u00a0S. 394, 401 (1916).  See Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.\u00a0S. 568, 575 (1988) (using word \"serious\" instead of \"grave\").  The Government's reading of the statute, which the majority adopts, construes the statute in a way that creates serious constitutional problems.  That reading would give the Secretary authority to arrest and detain aliens years after they have committed a minor crime and then hold them without a bail hearing for months or years.  This possibility is not simply theoretical.  See Appendix B, infra.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Jennings, I explained why I believe the practice of indefinite detention without a bail hearing likely deprives a \"person\" of his or her \"liberty .\u00a0.\u00a0. without due process of law.\"  U.\u00a0S. Const., Amdt. 5.  See 583 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (dissenting opinion) (slip op., at 5).  This practice runs counter to \"those settled usages and modes of proceeding existing in the common and statute law of England, before the emigration of\" the Founders' \"ancestors.\"  Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 277 (1856).  It runs counter to practices well established at the time of the American Revolution.  Jennings, supra, at ___-___ (slip op., at 9-10).  And it runs counter to common sense: Why would the law grant a bail hearing to a person accused of murder but deny it to a person who many years before committed a crime perhaps no greater than possessing a stolen bus transfer?  See Appendix B, infra.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I explained much of the constitutional problem in my dissent in Jennings.  Rather than repeat what I wrote there, I refer the reader to that opinion.  See Jennings, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 1). I add only the obvious point that a bail hearing does not mean release on bail.  It simply permits the person held to demonstrate that, if released, he will neither run away nor pose a threat.  It is especially anomalous to take this opportunity away from an alien who committed a crime many years before and has since reformed, living productively in a community.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority's reading also creates other anomalies.  As I have said, by permitting the Secretary to hold aliens without a bail hearing even if they were not detained \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released,\" the majority's reading would allow the Secretary to hold indefinitely without bail those who have never been to prison and who received only a fine or probation as punishment.  Supra, at 4, 10-11. See, e.g., \u00a71226(c)(1)(A) (incorporating \u00a71182(a)(2), which covers controlled substance offenses for which the maximum penalty exceeds one year); Brief for Advancement Project et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 19, 24, 29 (describing examples).  That fact simply aggravates the constitutional problem.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that paragraph (2)'s prohibition on release applies only to an alien whom the Secretary \"take[s] into custody .\u00a0.\u00a0. when the alien is released\" from criminal custody, it also held that the phrase \"when the alien is released\" means that the Secretary must grant a bail hearing to any alien who is not \"\u00a0'immediately detained' when released from criminal custody.\"  Preap v. Johnson, 831 F.\u00a03d 1193, 1207 (CA9 2016).  I disagree with the Court of Appeals as to the meaning of the phrase \"when the alien is released.\"\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As an initial matter, the phrase \"when the alien is released\" imposes an enforceable statutory deadline.  I cannot agree with Justice Alito, who writes for a plurality of the Court on this point, that our cases holding certain statutory deadlines unenforceable are applicable here.  Ante, at 17.  See, e.g., Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U.\u00a0S. 149, 152 (2003) (holding that the Government's untimeliness did not bar it from taking action beyond the statutory deadline); United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U.\u00a0S. 711, 713-714 (1990) (holding that a provision requiring a detention hearing to \"\u00a0'be held immediately'\u00a0\" did not bar detention in the event of a late hearing); Brock v. Pierce County, 476 U.\u00a0S. 253, 266 (1986) (holding that the Government's failure to observe a 120-day statutory deadline did not deprive it of authority under the statute).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I disagree with the plurality on this point because our case law makes clear that a statutory deadline against the Government must be enforced at least in contexts where \"other part[s]\" of the relevant statutes indicate that the time limit must be enforced, Montalvo-Murillo, supra, at 717; see also Barnhart, supra, at 161, 163; Dolan v. United States, 560 U.\u00a0S. 605, 613 (2010); where the statute \"\u00a0'specif[ies] a consequence for noncompliance'\u00a0\" with the time limit, Barnhart, supra, at 159 (quoting United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U.\u00a0S. 43, 63 (1993)); or where the harms caused by the Government's delay are likely to be serious, see Dolan, supra, at 615-616; Montalvo-Murillo, supra, at 719-720.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, the special transition statute Congress enacted alongside subsection (c) makes clear that Congress expected that the mandate that an alien be detained \"when\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. released\" would be enforceable.  Congress neither wished for nor expected the Secretary to detain aliens more than a year after their release from criminal custody.  IIRIRA, \u00a7303(b)(2), 110 Stat. 3009-586.  Why else would Congress have enacted a statute permitting the Government, due to \"insufficient detention space and Immigration and Naturalization Service personnel,\" to delay implementation of the entirety of subsection (c) for one year?  Ibid.  As I have said, had Congress read the phrase \"when the alien is released\" as the plurality now reads it, the Government could have delayed implementation for as long as it liked without the need for any transition statute.  Supra, at 10. The transition statute demonstrates that Congress viewed the phrase \"when the alien is released\" as imposing a deadline.  Based on the transition statute, the Secretary may not delay detention under subsection (c) for longer than one year.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the statute does \"\u00a0'specify a consequence'\u00a0\" for the Secretary's failure to detain an alien \"when the alien is released.\"  Barnhart, supra, at 159 (quoting James Daniel Good, supra, at 63). In that case, subsection (c) will not apply, and the Secretary must fall back on subsection (a), the default detention and release provision.  Critically, subsection (a) does not guarantee release.  Rather, it leaves much to the Government's judgment: By regulation, aliens who are subject to subsection (a)'s default detention and release rules will simply receive a hearing at which they can attempt to demonstrate that, if released, they will not pose a risk of flight or a threat to the community.  8 CFR \u00a7\u00a7236.1(d)(1), 1236.1(d)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, I have already mentioned the many harms that could befall aliens whom the Secretary does not detain \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released.\"  They range from long periods of detention, to detention years or even decades after the alien's release from criminal custody, to the risk of splitting up families that are long established in a community.  Supra, at 4.  Thus, unlike some of our prior cases, the harm from a missed deadline hardly can be described as \"insignificant.\"  Montalvo-Murillo, supra, at 719.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plurality objects that \"Congress could not have meant for judges to 'enforce'\u00a0\" the mandatory detention requirement \"in case of delay by--of all things--forbidding its execution.\"  Ante, at 19.  But treating the \"when the alien is released\" clause as an enforceable limit does not prohibit the Secretary from detaining the aliens that subsection (c) requires her to detain.  Rather, the Secretary's failure to comply with the \"when the alien is released\" clause carries only one consequence: The Secretary cannot deny a bail hearing.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So what does the phrase \"when the alien is released\" mean?  The word \"when\" can, but does not always, mean \"[a]t the time that,\" American Heritage Dictionary, at 1971, or \"just after the moment that,\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary, at 2602.  But the word only \"[s]ometimes impl[ies] suddenness.\"  20 Oxford English Dictionary 209 (2d ed. 1989).  It often admits of at least some temporal delay.  A child who is told to \"mow the lawn, please, when you get home from school\" likely does not have to mow the lawn the second she comes into the house.  She can do a few other things first.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mindful of \"the greater immigration-related expertise of the Executive Branch\" and \"the serious administrative needs and concerns inherent in the necessarily extensive [Government] efforts to enforce this complex statute,\" I would interpret the word \"when\" in the same manner as we interpreted other parts of this statute in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.\u00a0S. 678, 700 (2001).  The words \"when the alien is released\" require the Secretary to detain aliens under subsection (c) within a reasonable time after their release from criminal custody--presumptively no more than six months.  If the Secretary does not do so, she must grant a bail hearing.  This presumptive 6-month limit is consistent with how long the Government can detain certain aliens while they are awaiting removal from the country.  Id., at 682, 701 (interpreting a different provision, \u00a71231(a)(6)).  To insist upon similar treatment in this context would give the Government sufficient time to detain aliens following their release from local, state, or federal criminal custody.  It would also ensure that the Government does not fall outside the 1-year maximum dictated by the transition statute.  See supra, at 10, 14.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To reiterate: The question before us is not \"narrow.\"  Ante, at 2 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). See supra, at 4.  That is because we cannot interpret the words of this specific statute without also considering basic promises that America's legal system has long made to all persons.  In deciphering the intent of the Congress that wrote this statute, we must decide--in the face of what is, at worst, linguistic ambiguity--whether Congress intended that persons who have long since paid their debt to society would be deprived of their liberty for months or years without the possibility of bail.  We cannot decide that question without bearing in mind basic American legal values: the Government's duty not to deprive any \"person\" of \"liberty\" without \"due process of law,\" U.\u00a0S. Const., Amdt. 5; the Nation's original commitment to protect the \"unalienable\" right to \"Liberty\"; and, less abstractly and more directly, the longstanding right of virtually all persons to receive a bail hearing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would have thought that Congress meant to adhere to these values and did not intend to allow the Government to apprehend persons years after their release from prison and hold them indefinitely without a bail hearing.  In my view, the Court should interpret the words of this statute to reflect Congress' likely intent, an intent that is consistent with our basic values.  To speak more technically, I believe that aliens are subject to paragraph (2)'s bar on release only if they are detained \"when .\u00a0.\u00a0. released\" from criminal custody.  To speak less technically, I fear that the Court's contrary interpretation will work serious harm to the principles for which American law has long stood.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.\nAPPENDIXES\nA\n8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71226.  \"Apprehension and detention of aliens\n\"(a) Arrest, detention, and release\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"On a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an alien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States.

See, e.g., 6 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7202(3), 251, 271(b), 542 note, 557; 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71103(a)(1) and (g), 1551 note.\nFootnote 3\u00a0The full text of \u00a71226(c) is set out infra, at 10-11.\nFootnote 4\u00a0Nevertheless, such cases appear to be rare.  See Straker v. Jones, 986 F. Supp. 2d 345, 357, n.\u00a08 (SDNY 2013) (citing Gomez v. Napolitano, 2012 U.\u00a0S. App. LEXIS 27076 (CA2, June 5, 2012)).  But see Alafyouny v. Chertoff, 2006 WL 1581959, *3, *24 (ND Tex., May 19, 2006) (an alien was subject to mandatory detention based on a determination that the alien had solicited funds for a terrorist group).\nFootnote 5\u00a0For this reason, it is irrelevant that (as the dissent notes, see post, at 8) paragraph (2) applies to aliens described in \"paragraph (1)\" and not \"subparagraphs (A)-(D).\"  These two phrases denote the same category, so nothing can be gleaned from Congress's choice of one over the other.   \nFootnote 6\u00a0The dissent asks why Congress would have felt the need to provide for a delay if it thought that either way, the Secretary would get to deny a hearing to aliens arrested well after release.  Post, at 10; see also post, at 13-14.  The answer is that Congress does not draft legislation in the expectation that the Executive will blow through the deadlines it sets.  That is why Congress specifies any deadlines for executive duties at all; and here it explains why Congress furthermore provided that the deadline it set for this particular duty (to arrest criminal aliens upon their release) would not take effect right away.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In fact, if the dissent's argument from the transition rules were sound--i.e., if textual evidence that Congress expects the Executive to meet a deadline (once it officially takes effect) were proof that Congress wanted the deadline enforced by courts--then every case involving an express statutory deadline would be one in which Congress intended for courts to enforce the deadline.  But this would include, by definition, all of the loss-of-authority cases we discussed above, see Part III-B-2, supra--a long line of precedent that the dissent does not question.\nFootnote 7\u00a0In Alafyouny, 2006 WL 1581959, for example, an alien subject to mandatory detention had not been charged with any crime.  Rather, in a hearing to consider his application for adjustment of status, an immigration judge found that the alien had engaged in terrorism-related activity identified in \u00a71182(a)(3)(B)(iv)(IV)(cc), which qualified him for mandatory detention under \u00a71226(c)(1)(D).  Id., at *3, *24.\nFootnote 8\u00a0See n.\u00a07, supra.  Detainees who deny that they satisfy any \u00a71226(c) predicate may challenge their mandatory detention in a Joseph hearing.

BARTLETT(2019)\nNo. 17-1174\nArgued: November 26, 2018Decided: May 28, 2019\n\n\nRespondent Russell Bartlett was arrested by police officers Luis Nieves and Bryce Weight for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest during \"Arctic Man,\" a raucous winter sports festival held in a remote part of Alaska.  According to Sergeant Nieves, he was speaking with a group of attendees when a seemingly intoxicated Bartlett started shouting at them not to talk to the police.  When Nieves approached him, Bartlett began yelling at the officer to leave.  Rather than escalate the situation, Nieves left.  Bartlett disputes that account, claiming that he was not drunk at that time and did not yell at Nieves.  Minutes later, Trooper Weight says, Bartlett approached him in an aggressive manner while he was questioning a minor, stood between Weight and the teenager, and yelled with slurred speech that Weight should not speak with the minor.  When Bartlett stepped toward Weight, the officer pushed him back.  Nieves saw the confrontation and initiated an arrest.  When Bartlett was slow to comply, the officers forced him to the ground.  Bartlett denies being aggressive and claims that he was slow to comply because of a back injury.  After he was handcuffed, Bartlett claims that Nieves said \"bet you wish you would have talked to me now.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bartlett sued under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, claiming that the officers violated his First Amendment rights by arresting him in retaliation for his speech--i.e., his initial refusal to speak with Nieves and his intervention in Weight's discussion with the minor.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the officers, holding that the existence of probable cause to arrest Bartlett precluded his claim.  The Ninth Circuit reversed.  It held that probable cause does not defeat a retaliatory arrest claim and concluded that Bartlett's affidavit about what Nieves allegedly said after the arrest could enable Bartlett to prove that the officers' desire to chill his speech was a but-for cause of the arrest.\nHeld:\u00a0Because there was probable cause to arrest Bartlett, his retaliatory arrest claim fails as a matter of law.  Pp.\u00a04-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0To prevail on a claim such as Bartlett's, the plaintiff must show not only that the official acted with a retaliatory motive and that the plaintiff was injured, but also that the motive was a \"but-for\" cause of the injury.  Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.\u00a0S. 250, 259-260.  Establishing that causal connection may be straightforward in some cases, see, e.g., Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.\u00a0S. 274, but other times it is not so simple.  In retaliatory prosecution cases, for example, the causal inquiry is particularly complex because the official alleged to have the retaliatory motive does not carry out the retaliatory action himself.  Instead, the decision to bring charges is made by a prosecutor--who is generally immune from suit and whose decisions receive a presumption of regularity.  To account for that \"problem of causation,\" plaintiffs in retaliatory prosecution cases must prove as a threshold matter that the decision to press charges was objectively unreasonable because it was not supported by probable cause.  Hartman, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 263.  Pp.\u00a05-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Because First Amendment retaliatory arrest claims involve causal complexities akin to those identified in Hartman--see, e.g., Reichle v. Howards, 566 U.\u00a0S. 658; Lozman v. Riviera Beach, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___--the same no-probable-cause requirement generally should apply.  The causal inquiry is complex because protected speech is  often a \"wholly legitimate consideration\" for officers when deciding whether to make an arrest.  Reichle, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 668.  In addition, \"evidence of the presence or absence of probable cause for the arrest will be available in virtually every retaliatory arrest case.\"  Ibid.  Its absence will generally provide weighty evidence that the officers' animus caused the arrest, whereas its presence will suggest the opposite.  While retaliatory arrest cases do not implicate the presumption of prosecutorial regularity or necessarily involve multiple government actors, the ultimate problem remains the same: For both claims, it is particularly difficult to determine whether the adverse government action was caused by the officers' malice or by the plaintiff's potentially criminal conduct.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bartlett's proposed approach disregards the causal complexity involved in these cases and dismisses the need for any threshold objective showing, moving directly to consideration of the officers' subjective intent.  In the Fourth Amendment context, however, this Court has \"almost uniformly rejected invitations to probe [officers'] subjective intent,\" Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.\u00a0S. 731, 737.  A purely subjective approach would undermine that precedent, would \"dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible, in the unflinching discharge of their duties,\" Gregoire v. Biddle, 177 F.\u00a02d 579, 581, would compromise evenhanded application of the law by making the constitutionality of an arrest \"vary from place to place and from time to time\" depending on the personal motives of individual officers, Devenpeck v. Alford, 543 U.\u00a0S. 146, 154, and would encourage officers to minimize communication during arrests to avoid having their words scrutinized for hints of improper motive.  Pp.\u00a08-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0When defining the contours of a \u00a71983 claim, this Court looks to \"common-law principles that were well settled at the time of its enactment.\"  Kalina v. Fletcher, 522 U.\u00a0S. 118, 123.  In 1871, when \u00a71983 was enacted, there was no common law tort for retaliatory arrest based on protected speech.  Turning to the \"closest analog[s],\" Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.\u00a0S. 477, 484, both false imprisonment and malicious prosecution suggest the same result: The presence of probable cause should generally defeat a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim.  Pp.\u00a012-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0Because States today permit warrantless misdemeanor arrests for minor criminal offenses in a wide range of situations--whereas such arrests were privileged only in limited circumstances when \u00a71983 was adopted--a narrow qualification is warranted for circumstances where officers have probable cause to make arrests, but typically exercise their discretion not to do so.  An unyielding requirement to show the absence of probable cause in such cases could pose \"a risk that some police officers may exploit the arrest power as a means of suppressing speech.\"  Lozman, 585pp U.\u00a0S., at ___.  Thus, the no-probable-cause requirement should not apply when a plaintiff presents objective evidence that he was arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged in the same sort of protected speech had not been.  Cf. United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.\u00a0S. 456, 465.  Because this inquiry is objective, the statements and motivations of the particular arresting officer are irrelevant at this stage.  After making the required showing, the plaintiff's claim may proceed in the same manner as claims where the plaintiff has met the threshold showing of the absence of probable cause.

NIEVES, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v.RUSSELL P. BARTLETT\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\n[May 28, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent Russell Bartlett sued petitioners--two police officers--alleging that they retaliated against him for his protected First Amendment speech by arresting him for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.  The officers had probable cause to arrest Bartlett, and we now decide whether that fact defeats Bartlett's First Amendment claim as a matter of law.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bartlett was arrested during \"Arctic Man,\" a weeklong winter sports festival held in the remote Hoodoo Mountains near Paxson, Alaska.  Paxson is a small community that normally consists of a few dozen residents.  But once a year, upwards of 10,000 people descend on the area for Arctic Man, an event known for both extreme sports and extreme alcohol consumption.  The mainstays are high-speed ski and snowmobile races, bonfires, and parties.  During that week, the Arctic Man campground briefly becomes one of the largest and most raucous cities in Alaska.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The event poses special challenges for law enforcement.  Snowmobiles, alcohol, and freezing temperatures do not always mix well, and officers spend much of the week responding to snowmobile crashes, breaking up fights, and policing underage drinking.  Given the remote location of the event, Alaska flies in additional officers from around the State to provide support.  Still, the number of police remains limited.  Even during the busiest periods of the event, only six to eight officers are on patrol at a time.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the last night of Arctic Man 2014, Sergeant Luis Nieves and Trooper Bryce Weight arrested Bartlett.  The parties dispute certain details about the arrest but agree on the general course of events, some of which were captured on video by a local news reporter.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At around 1:30 a.m., Sergeant Nieves and Bartlett first crossed paths.  Nieves was asking some partygoers to move their beer keg inside their RV because minors had been making off with alcohol.  According to Nieves, Bartlett began belligerently yelling to the RV owners that they should not speak with the police.  Nieves approached Bartlett to explain the situation, but Bartlett was highly intoxicated and yelled at him to leave.  Rather than escalate the situation, Nieves left.  Bartlett disputes that account.  According to Bartlett, he was not drunk at that time and never yelled at Nieves.  He claims it was Nieves who became aggressive when Bartlett refused to speak with him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several minutes later, Bartlett saw Trooper Weight asking a minor whether he and his underage friends had been drinking.  According to Weight, Bartlett approached in an aggressive manner, stood between Weight and the teenager, and yelled with slurred speech that Weight should not speak with the minor.  Weight claims that Bartlett then stepped very close to him in a combative way, so Weight pushed him back.  Sergeant Nieves saw the confrontation and rushed over, arriving right after Weight pushed Bartlett.  Nieves immediately initiated an arrest, and when Bartlett was slow to comply with his orders, the officers forced him to the ground and threatened to tase him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Again, Bartlett tells a different story.  He denies being aggressive, and claims that he stood close to Weight only in an effort to speak over the loud background music.  And he was slow to comply with Nieves's orders, not because he was resisting arrest, but because he did not want to aggravate a back injury.  After Bartlett was handcuffed, he claims that Nieves said: \"[B]et you wish you would have talked to me now.\"  712 Fed. Appx. 613, 616 (CA9 2017).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The officers took Bartlett to a holding tent, where he was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.  He had sustained no injuries during the episode and was released a few hours later.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State ultimately dismissed the criminal charges against Bartlett, and Bartlett then sued the officers under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, which provides a cause of action for state deprivations of federal rights.  As relevant here, he claimed that the officers violated his First Amendment rights by arresting him in retaliation for his speech.  The protected speech, according to Bartlett, was his refusal to speak with Nieves earlier in the evening and his intervention in Weight's discussion with the underage partygoer.  The officers responded that they arrested Bartlett because he interfered with an investigation and initiated a physical confrontation with Weight.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the officers.  The court determined that the officers had probable cause to arrest Bartlett and held that the existence of probable cause precluded Bartlett's First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit disagreed.  712 Fed. Appx. 613.  Relying on its prior decision in Ford v. Yakima, 706 F.\u00a03d 1188 (2013), the court held that a plaintiff can prevail on a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim even in the face of probable cause for the arrest.  According to the Ninth Circuit, Bartlett needed to show only (1) that the officers' conduct would \"chill a person of ordinary firmness from future First Amendment activity,\" and (2) that he had advanced evidence that would \"enable him ultimately to prove that the officers' desire to chill his speech was a but-for cause\" of the arrest.  712 Fed. Appx., at 616 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The court concluded that Bartlett had satisfied both requirements: A retaliatory arrest is sufficiently chilling, and Bartlett had presented enough evidence that his speech was a but-for cause of the arrest.  The only causal evidence relied on by the court was Bartlett's affidavit alleging that Sergeant Nieves said \"bet you wish you would have talked to me now.\"  If that allegation were true, the court reasoned, a jury might conclude that the officers arrested Bartlett in retaliation for his statements earlier that night.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The officers petitioned for review in this Court, and we granted certiorari.  585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are asked to resolve whether probable cause to make an arrest defeats a claim that the arrest was in retaliation for speech protected by the First Amendment.  We have considered this issue twice in recent years.  On the first occasion, we ultimately left the question unanswered because we decided the case on the alternative ground of qualified immunity.  See Reichle v. Howards, 566 U.\u00a0S. 658 (2012).  We took up the question again last Term in Lozman v. Riviera Beach, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).  Lozman involved unusual circumstances in which the plaintiff was arrested pursuant to an alleged \"official municipal policy\" of retaliation.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  Because those facts were \"far afield from the typical retaliatory arrest claim,\" we reserved judgment on the broader question presented and limited our holding to arrests that result from official policies of retaliation.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  In such cases, we held, probable cause does not categorically bar a plaintiff from suing the municipality.  Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 11-12).  We now take up the question once again, this time in a more representative case.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"[A]s a general matter the First Amendment prohibits government officials from subjecting an individual to retaliatory actions\" for engaging in protected speech.  Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.\u00a0S. 250, 256 (2006).  If an official takes adverse action against someone based on that forbidden motive, and \"non-retaliatory grounds are in fact insufficient to provoke the adverse consequences,\" the injured person may generally seek relief by bringing a First Amendment claim.  Ibid. (citing Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.\u00a0S. 574, 593 (1998); Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.\u00a0S. 274, 283-284 (1977)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To prevail on such a claim, a plaintiff must establish a \"causal connection\" between the government defendant's \"retaliatory animus\" and the plaintiff's \"subsequent injury.\"  Hartman, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 259.  It is not enough to show that an official acted with a retaliatory motive and that the plaintiff was injured--the motive must cause the injury.  Specifically, it must be a \"but-for\" cause, meaning that the adverse action against the plaintiff would not have been taken absent the retaliatory motive.  Id., at 260 (recognizing that although it \"may be dishonorable to act with an unconstitutional motive,\" an official's \"action colored by some degree of bad motive does not amount to a constitutional tort if that action would have been taken anyway\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, in Mt. Healthy, a teacher claimed that a school district refused to rehire him in retaliation for his protected speech.  We held that even if the teacher's \"protected conduct played a part, substantial or otherwise, in [the] decision not to rehire,\" he was not entitled to reinstatement \"if the same decision would have been reached\" absent his protected speech.  429 U.\u00a0S., at 285.  Regardless of the motives of the school district, we concluded that the First Amendment \"principle at stake is sufficiently vindicated if such an employee is placed in no worse a position than if he had not engaged in the [protected speech].\"  Id., at 285-286.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For a number of retaliation claims, establishing the causal connection between a defendant's animus and a plaintiff's injury is straightforward.  Indeed, some of our cases in the public employment context \"have simply taken the evidence of the motive and the discharge as sufficient for a circumstantial demonstration that the one caused the other,\" shifting the burden to the defendant to show he would have taken the challenged action even without the impermissible motive.  Hartman, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 260 (citing Mt. Healthy, 429 U.\u00a0S., at 287; Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.\u00a0S. 252, 270, n. 21 (1977)).  But the consideration of causation is not so straightforward in other types of retaliation cases.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Hartman, for example, we addressed retaliatory prosecution cases, where \"proving the link between the defendant's retaliatory animus and the plaintiff's injury .\u00a0.\u00a0. 'is usually more complex than it is in other retaliation cases.'\u00a0\"  Lozman, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (quoting Hartman, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 261).  Unlike most retaliation cases, in retaliatory prosecution cases the official with the malicious motive does not carry out the retaliatory action himself--the decision to bring charges is instead made by a prosecutor, who is generally immune from suit and whose decisions receive a presumption of regularity.  Lozman, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 8-9).  Thus, even when an officer's animus is clear, it does not necessarily show that the officer \"induced the action of a prosecutor who would not have pressed charges otherwise.\"  Hartman, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 263.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To account for this \"problem of causation\" in retaliatory prosecution claims, Hartman adopted the requirement that plaintiffs plead and prove the absence of probable cause for the underlying criminal charge.  Ibid.; see id., at 265-266.  As Hartman explained, that showing provides a \"distinct body of highly valuable circumstantial evidence\" that is \"apt to prove or disprove\" whether retaliatory animus actually caused the injury: \"Demonstrating that there was no probable cause for the underlying criminal charge will tend to reinforce the retaliation evidence and show that retaliation was the but-for basis for instigating the prosecution, while establishing the existence of probable cause will suggest that prosecution would have occurred even without a retaliatory motive.\"  Id., at 261.  Requiring plaintiffs to plead and prove the absence of probable cause made sense, we reasoned, because the existence of probable cause will be at issue in \"practically all\" retaliatory prosecution cases, has \"high probative force,\" and thus \"can be made mandatory with little or no added cost.\"  Id., at 265.  Moreover, imposing that burden on plaintiffs was necessary to suspend the presumption of regularity underlying the prosecutor's charging decision--a presumption we \"do not lightly discard.\"  Id., at 263; see also id., at 265.  Thus, Hartman requires plaintiffs in retaliatory prosecution cases to show more than the subjective animus of an officer and a subsequent injury; plaintiffs must also prove as a threshold matter that the decision to press charges was objectively unreasonable because it was not supported by probable cause.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Officers Nieves and Weight argue that the same no-probable-cause requirement should apply to First Amendment retaliatory arrest claims.  Their primary contention is that retaliatory arrest claims involve causal complexities akin to those we identified in Hartman, and thus warrant the same requirement that plaintiffs plead and prove the absence of probable cause.  Brief for Petitioners 20-30.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a general matter, we agree.  As we recognized in Reichle and reaffirmed in Lozman, retaliatory arrest claims face some of the same challenges we identified in Hartman: Like retaliatory prosecution cases, \"retaliatory arrest cases also present a tenuous causal connection between the defendant's alleged animus and the plaintiff's injury.\"  Reichle, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 668.  The causal inquiry is complex because protected speech is often a \"wholly legitimate consideration\" for officers when deciding whether to make an arrest.  Ibid.; Lozman, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  Officers frequently must make \"split-second judgments\" when deciding whether to arrest, and the content and manner of a suspect's speech may convey vital information--for example, if he is \"ready to cooperate\" or  rather \"present[s] a continuing threat.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (citing District of Columbia v. Wesby, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 10) (\"suspect's untruthful and evasive answers to police questioning could support probable cause\")).  Indeed, that kind of assessment happened in this case.  The officers testified that they perceived Bartlett to be a threat based on a combination of the content and tone of his speech, his combative posture, and his apparent intoxication.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, \"[l]ike retaliatory prosecution cases, evidence of the presence or absence of probable cause for the arrest will be available in virtually every retaliatory arrest case.\"  Reichle, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 668.  And because probable cause speaks to the objective reasonableness of an arrest, see Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.\u00a0S. 731, 736 (2011), its absence will--as in retaliatory prosecution cases--generally provide weighty evidence that the officer's animus caused the arrest, whereas the presence of probable cause will suggest the opposite.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, Reichle and Lozman also recognized that the two claims give rise to complex causal inquiries for somewhat different reasons.  Unlike retaliatory prosecution cases, retaliatory arrest cases do not implicate the presumption of prosecutorial regularity or necessarily involve multiple government actors (although this case did).  Reichle, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 668-669; Lozman, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  But regardless of the source of the causal complexity, the ultimate problem remains the same.  For both claims, it is particularly difficult to determine whether the adverse government action was caused by the officer's malice or the plaintiff's potentially criminal conduct.  See id., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (referring to \"the  complexity of proving (or disproving) causation\" in retaliatory arrest cases).  Because of the \"close relationship\" between the two claims, Reichle, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 667, their related causal challenge should lead to the same solution: The plaintiff pressing a retaliatory arrest claim must plead and prove the absence of probable cause for the arrest.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bartlett, in defending the decision below, argues that the \"causation in retaliatory-arrest cases is not inherently complex\" because the \"factfinder simply must determine whether the officer intended to punish the plaintiff for the plaintiff's protected speech.\"  Brief for Respondent 36-37; see also post, at 5 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).  That approach fails to account for the fact that protected speech is often a legitimate consideration when deciding whether to make an arrest, and disregards the resulting causal complexity previously recognized by this Court.  See Reichle, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 668; Lozman, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bartlett's approach dismisses the need for any threshold showing, moving directly to consideration of the subjective intent of the officers.  In the Fourth Amendment context, however, \"we have almost uniformly rejected invitations to probe subjective intent.\"  al-Kidd, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 737; see also Kentucky v. King, 563 U.\u00a0S. 452, 464 (2011) (\"Legal tests based on reasonableness are generally objective, and this Court has long taken the view that evenhanded law enforcement is best achieved by the application of objective standards of conduct, rather than standards that depend upon the subjective state of mind of the officer.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Police officers conduct approximately 29,000 arrests every day--a dangerous task that requires making quick decisions in \"circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.\"  Graham v. Connor, 490 U.\u00a0S. 386, 397 (1989).  To ensure that officers may go about their work without undue apprehension of being sued, we generally review their conduct under objective standards of reasonableness.  See Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U.\u00a0S. 318, 351, and n. 22 (2001); Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.\u00a0S. 800, 814-819 (1982).  Thus, when reviewing an arrest, we ask \"whether the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify [the challenged] action,\" and if so, conclude \"that action was reasonable whatever the subjective intent motivating the relevant officials.\"  al-Kidd, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 736 (internal quotation marks omitted).  A particular officer's state of mind is simply \"irrelevant,\" and it provides \"no basis for invalidating an arrest.\"  Devenpeck v. Alford, 543 U.\u00a0S. 146, 153, 155 (2004).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bartlett's purely subjective approach would undermine that precedent by allowing even doubtful retaliatory arrest suits to proceed based solely on allegations about an arresting officer's mental state.  See Lozman, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  Because a state of mind is \"easy to allege and hard to disprove,\" Crawford-El, 523 U.\u00a0S., at 585, a subjective inquiry would threaten to set off \"broad-ranging discovery\" in which \"there often is no clear end to the relevant evidence,\" Harlow, 457 U.\u00a0S., at 817.  As a result, policing certain events like an unruly protest would pose overwhelming litigation risks.  Any inartful turn of phrase or perceived slight during a legitimate arrest could land an officer in years of litigation.  Bartlett's standard would thus \"dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible, in the unflinching discharge of their duties.\"  Gregoire v. Biddle, 177 F.\u00a02d 579, 581 (CA2 1949) (Learned Hand, C.\u00a0J.).  It would also compromise evenhanded application of the law by making the constitutionality of an arrest \"vary from place to place and from time to time\" depending on the personal motives of individual officers.  Devenpeck, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 154.  Yet another \"predictable consequence\" of such a rule is that officers would simply minimize their communication during arrests to avoid having their words scrutinized for hints of improper motive--a result that would leave everyone worse off.  Id., at 155.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adopting Hartman's no-probable-cause rule in this closely related context addresses those familiar concerns.  Absent such a showing, a retaliatory arrest claim fails.  But if the plaintiff establishes the absence of probable cause, \"then the Mt. Healthy test governs: The plaintiff must show that the retaliation was a substantial or motivating factor behind the [arrest], and, if that showing is made, the defendant can prevail only by showing that the [arrest] would have been initiated without respect to retaliation.\"  Lozman, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (citing Hartman, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 265-266).1\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our conclusion is confirmed by the common law approach to similar tort claims.  When defining the contours of a claim under \u00a71983, we look to \"common-law principles that were well settled at the time of its enactment.\"  Ka- lina v. Fletcher, 522 U.\u00a0S. 118, 123 (1997); Manuel v. Joliet, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 12) (common law principles \"guide\" the definition of claims under \u00a71983).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the parties acknowledge, when \u00a71983 was enacted in 1871, there was no common law tort for retaliatory arrest based on protected speech.  See Brief for Petitioners 43; Brief for Respondent 20.  We therefore turn to the common law torts that provide the \"closest analogy\" to retaliatory arrest claims.  Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.\u00a0S. 477, 484 (1994).  The parties dispute whether the better analog is false imprisonment or malicious prosecution.  At common law, false imprisonment arose from a \"detention without legal process,\" whereas malicious prosecution was marked \"by wrongful institution of legal process.\"  Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.\u00a0S. 384, 389-390 (2007).2  Here, both claims suggest the same result: The presence of probable cause should generally defeat a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim.  See generally Lozman, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 4-6) (Thomas, J., dissenting).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Malicious prosecution required the plaintiff to show that the criminal charge against him \"was unfounded, and that it was made without reasonable or probable cause, and that the defendant in making or instigating it was actuated by malice.\"  Wheeler v. Nesbitt, 24 How. 544, 549-550 (1861); see also Restatement of Torts \u00a7653 (1938).  It has long been \"settled law\" that malicious prosecution requires proving \"the want of probable cause,\" and Bartlett does not argue otherwise.  Brown v. Selfridge, 224 U.\u00a0S. 189, 191 (1912); see also Wheeler, 24 How., at 550 (noting that \"[w]ant of reasonable and probable cause\" is an \"element in the action for a malicious criminal prosecution\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For claims of false imprisonment, the presence of probable cause was generally a complete defense for peace officers.  See T. Cooley, Law of Torts 175 (1880); 1 F. Hilliard, The Law of Torts or Private Wrongs 207-208, and n. (a) (1859).  In such cases, arresting officers were protected from liability if the arrest was \"privileged.\"  At common law, peace officers were privileged to make warrantless arrests based on probable cause of the commission of a felony or certain misdemeanors.  See Restatement of Torts \u00a7\u00a7118, 119, 121 (1934); see also Cooley, Law of Torts, at 175-176 (stating that peace officers who make arrests based on probable cause \"will be excused, even though it appear afterwards that in fact no felony had been committed\"); see generally Atwater, 532 U.\u00a0S., at 340-345 (reviewing the history of warrantless arrests for misdemeanors).  Although the exact scope of the privilege varied somewhat depending on the jurisdiction, the consistent rule was that officers were not liable for arrests they were privileged to make based on probable cause.\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although probable cause should generally defeat a retaliatory arrest claim, a narrow qualification is warranted for circumstances where officers have probable cause to make arrests, but typically exercise their discretion not to do so.  In such cases, an unyielding requirement to show the absence of probable cause could pose \"a risk that some police officers may exploit the arrest power as a means of suppressing speech.\"  Lozman, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When \u00a71983 was adopted, officers were generally privileged to make warrantless arrests for misdemeanors only in limited circumstances.  See Restatement of Torts \u00a7121, Comments e, h, at 262-263.  Today, however, \"statutes in all 50 States and the District of Columbia permit warrantless misdemeanor arrests\" in a much wider range of situations--often whenever officers have probable cause for \"even a very minor criminal offense.\"  Atwater, 532 U.\u00a0S., at 344-345, 354; see id., at 355-360 (listing state  statutes).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, at many intersections, jaywalking is endemic but rarely results in arrest.  If an individual who has been vocally complaining about police conduct is arrested for jaywalking at such an intersection, it would seem insufficiently protective of First Amendment rights to dismiss the individual's retaliatory arrest claim on the ground that there was undoubted probable cause for the arrest.  In such a case, because probable cause does little to prove or disprove the causal connection between animus and injury, applying Hartman's rule would come at the expense of Hartman's logic.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For those reasons, we conclude that the no-probable-cause requirement should not apply when a plaintiff presents objective evidence that he was arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged in the same sort of protected speech had not been.  Cf. United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.\u00a0S. 456, 465 (1996).  That showing addresses Hartman's causal concern by helping to establish that \"non-retaliatory grounds [we]re in fact insufficient to provoke the adverse consequences.\"  547 U.\u00a0S., at 256.  And like a probable cause analysis, it provides an objective inquiry that avoids the significant problems that would arise from reviewing police conduct under a purely subjective standard.  Because this inquiry is objective, the statements and motivations of the particular arresting officer are \"irrelevant\" at this stage.  Devenpeck, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 153.  After making the required showing, the plaintiff's claim may proceed in the same manner as claims where the plaintiff has met the threshold showing of the absence of probable cause.  See Lozman, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of the foregoing, Bartlett's retaliation claim cannot survive summary judgment.  As an initial matter, the record contains insufficient evidence of retaliation on the part of Trooper Weight.  The only evidence of retaliatory animus identified by the Ninth Circuit was Bartlett's affidavit stating that Sergeant Nieves said \"bet you wish you would have talked to me now.\"  712 Fed. Appx., at 616.  But that allegation about Nieves says nothing about what motivated Weight, who had no knowledge of Bartlett's prior run-in with Nieves.  Cf. Lozman, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (plaintiff \"likely could not have maintained a retaliation claim against the arresting officer\" when there was \"no showing that the officer had any knowledge of [the plaintiff's] prior speech\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, Bartlett's claim against both officers cannot succeed because they had probable cause to arrest him.  As the Court of Appeals explained:\n\"When Sergeant Nieves initiated Bartlett's arrest, he knew that Bartlett had been drinking, and he observed Bartlett speaking in a loud voice and standing close to Trooper Weight.  He also saw Trooper Weight push Bartlett back.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [T]he test is whether the information the officer had at the time of making the arrest gave rise to probable cause.  We agree with the district court that it did; a reasonable officer in Sergeant Nieves's position could have concluded that Bartlett stood close to Trooper Weight and spoke loudly in order to challenge him, provoking Trooper  Weight to push him back.\"  712 Fed. Appx., at 615 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because there was probable cause to arrest Bartlett, his retaliatory arrest claim fails as a matter of law.  Accordingly, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nOpinion of Thomas, J.\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1174\nLUIS A. NIEVES, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v. RUSSELL P. BARTLETT\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\n[May 28, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983 was enacted, \"the common law recognized probable cause as an important element for ensuring that arrest-based torts did not unduly interfere with the objectives of law enforcement.\"  Lozman v. Riviera Beach, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 6).  Applying that principle resolves this case: \"[P]laintiffs bringing a First Amendment retaliatory-arrest claim under \u00a71983 should have to plead and prove a lack of probable cause.\"  Ibid.  The Court acknowledges as much, ante, at 12-13, and I join the portions of the Court's opinion adopting that rule.1  I do not join Part II-D, however, because I do not agree that \"a narrow qualification is warranted for circumstances where officers have probable cause to make arrests, but typically exercise their discretion not to do so.\"  Ante, at 13-14.  That qualification has no basis in either the common law or our First Amendment precedents.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court explains, \"[w]hen defining the contours of a claim under \u00a71983, we look to 'common-law principles that were well settled at the time of its enactment.'\u00a0\"  Ante, at 12.  Because no common-law tort for retaliatory arrest in violation of the freedom of speech existed when \u00a71983 was enacted, we \"look to the common-law torts that 'provid[e] the closest analogy' to this claim.\"  Lozman, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 4).  Here, those torts are false imprisonment, malicious arrest, and malicious prosecution.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The existence of probable cause generally excused an officer from liability for these three torts, without regard to the treatment of similarly situated individuals.  For instance, a constable who made an arrest \"on reasonable grounds of belief\" that a felony had been committed was \"excused\" from liability for false imprisonment.  T. Cooley, Law of Torts 175 (1879) (Cooley); Lozman, supra, at ___-___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 4-5). And the absence of probable cause was central to both malicious arrest and malicious prosecution.  Cooley 180-181; Lozman, supra, at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 5).  As the Court puts it, \"the consistent rule was that officers were not liable for arrests they were privileged to make based on probable cause.\"  Ante, at 13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rather than adhere to this rule, the majority carves out an exception to the no-probable-cause requirement for plaintiffs who \"presen[t] objective evidence\" that they were \"arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged in the same sort of protected speech had not been.\"  Ante, at 14.  The common law provides no support for this exception.  Indeed, the majority cites not a single common-law case that supports imposing liability based on an officer's treatment of similarly situated individuals.  The majority instead suggests that its exception responds to the fact that States today \"\u00a0'permit warrantless misdemeanor arrests'\u00a0\" for many \"\u00a0'minor criminal offense[s],'\u00a0\" whereas \"[w]hen \u00a71983 was adopted, officers were generally privileged to make warrantless arrests for misdemeanors only in limited circumstances.\"  Ibid.  But discomfort with the number of warrantless arrests that are privileged today is an issue for state legislatures, not a license for this Court to fashion an exception to a previously \"consistent rule.\"  Ante, at 13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority's exception is also untethered from our First Amendment precedents.  In Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.\u00a0S. 250 (2006), we expressly declined to create any exceptions to the rule that a plaintiff alleging retaliatory prosecution in violation of the First Amendment must plead and prove the absence of probable cause.  See id., at 264-266, and n.\u00a010.  The majority today imports its \"qualification\" from our jurisprudence on selective-prosecution claims.  Ante, at 14, 15 (citing United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.\u00a0S. 456, 465 (1996)).  But \"[t]he requirements for a selective-prosecution claim draw on 'ordinary equal protection standards,'\u00a0\" not the First Amendment.  Id., at 465.  That jurisprudence therefore is not relevant here.  Cf. Whren v. United States, 517 U.\u00a0S. 806, 813 (1996) (\"[T]he constitutional basis for objecting to intentionally discriminatory application of laws is the Equal Protection Clause .\u00a0.\u00a0. \").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With no guidance from the common law or relevant precedents, the majority crafts its exception as a matter of policy.  But this \"narrow\" qualification threatens to derail our retaliation jurisprudence in several ways.  For one, although the majority's stated concern is with \"\u00a0'warrantless misdemeanor arrests'\u00a0\" for \"\u00a0'very minor'\u00a0\" offenses like \"jaywalking,\" ante, at 14, its exception apparently applies to all offenses, including serious felonies.  This overbroad exception thus is likely to encourage protracted litigation about which individuals are \"similarly situated,\" ibid., while doing little to vindicate First Amendment rights.  Moreover, the majority's rule risks chilling law enforcement officers from making arrests for fear of liability, thus flouting the reasoning behind the emphasis on probable cause in arrest-based torts at common law.  Lozman, supra, at ___-___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 4-5).  In short, the majority's exception lacks the support of history, precedent, and sound policy.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The requirement that plaintiffs bringing First Amendment retaliatory-arrest claims plead and prove the absence of probable cause is supported by the common law and our First Amendment precedents.  The majority's new exception has no basis in either.  Accordingly, I join all but Part II-D of the majority opinion.\n\nOpinion of Gorsuch, J.\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1174\nLUIS A. NIEVES, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v. RUSSELL P. BARTLETT\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\n[May 28, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No one agrees who started the trouble at the 2014 Alaska Arctic Man Festival, but everyone agrees two troopers ended it by arresting Russell Bartlett for harassing one of them.  And it's that arrest that led to this lawsuit.  Mr. Bartlett alleges that the real reason the troopers arrested him had nothing to do with harassment and everything to do with his decision to exercise his First Amendment free speech rights by voicing his opinions to the troopers.  Mr. Bartlett contends that the officers' retaliation against his First Amendment protected speech entitles him to damages under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983.  For their part, the troopers insist that the fact they had probable cause to arrest Mr. Bartlett for some crime, or really any crime, should be enough to shield them from liability.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties approach their dispute from some common ground.  Both sides accept that an officer violates the First Amendment when he arrests an individual in retaliation for his protected speech.  They seem to agree, too, that the presence of probable cause does not undo that violation or erase its significance.  And for good reason.  History shows that governments sometimes seek to regulate our lives finely, acutely, thoroughly, and exhaustively.  In our own time and place, criminal laws have grown so exuberantly and come to cover so much previously innocent conduct that almost anyone can be arrested for something.  If the state could use these laws not for their intended purposes but to silence those who voice unpopular ideas, little would be left of our First Amendment liberties, and little would separate us from the tyrannies of the past or the malignant fiefdoms of our own age.  The freedom to speak without risking arrest is \"one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation.\"  Houston v. Hill, 482 U.\u00a0S. 451, 463 (1987).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So if probable cause can't erase a First Amendment violation, the question becomes whether its presence at least forecloses a civil claim for damages as a statutory matter under \u00a71983.  But look at that statute as long as you like and you will find no reference to the presence or absence of probable cause as a precondition or defense to any suit.  Instead, the statute imposes liability on anyone who, under color of state law, subjects another person \"to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution.\"  Maybe it would be good policy to graft a no-probable-cause requirement onto the statute, as the officers insist; or maybe not.  Either way, that's an appeal better directed to Congress than to this Court.  Our job isn't to write or revise legislative policy but to apply it faithfully.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Admittedly, though, that's not quite the end of the statutory story.  Courts often assume that Congress adopts statutes against the backdrop of the common law.  And, for this reason, we generally read \u00a71983's terms \"in harmony with general principles of tort immunities and defenses\" that existed at the time of the statute's adoption.  Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.\u00a0S. 409, 418 (1976).  As the officers before us are quick to point out, too, law enforcement agents who made a lawful arrest at the time of \u00a71983's adoption couldn't be held liable at common law for the tort of false arrest or false imprisonment.  Of course, at common law a police officer often needed a warrant to execute a lawful arrest.  But today warrantless arrests are often both authorized by state law and permitted by the Constitution (as this Court has interpreted it), so long as the officer possesses probable cause to believe a crime has been committed.  And, given this development, you might wonder if the presence of probable cause should be enough to foreclose any First Amendment claim arising out of an arrest.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But that much doesn't follow.  As the officers' own reasoning exposes, the point of the common law tort of false arrest or false imprisonment was to remedy arrests and imprisonments effected without lawful authority.  See Director General of Railroads v. Kastenbaum, 263 U.\u00a0S. 25, 27 (1923); accord, Brief for United States as Amicus Cu- riae 9.  So maybe probable cause should be enough today to defeat claims for false arrest or false imprisonment, given that arrests today are usually legally authorized if supported by probable cause.  But that doesn't mean probable cause is also enough to defeat a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim.  The point of this kind of claim isn't to guard against officers who lack lawful authority to make an arrest.  Rather, it's to guard against officers who abuse their authority by making an otherwise lawful arrest for an unconstitutional reason.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here's another way to look at it.  The common law tort of false arrest translates more or less into a Fourth Amendment claim.  That's because our precedent considers a warrantless arrest unsupported by probable cause--the sort that gave rise to a false arrest claim at common law--to be an unreasonable seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  See Manuel v. Joliet, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 10).  But the First Amendment operates independently of the Fourth and provides different protections.  It seeks not to ensure lawful authority to arrest but to protect the freedom of speech.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here's a way to test the point, too.  Everyone accepts that a detention based on race, even one otherwise authorized by law, violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.  In Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.\u00a0S. 356 (1886), for example, San Francisco jailed many Chinese immigrants for operating laundries without permits but took no action against white persons guilty of the same infraction.  Even if probable cause existed to believe the Chinese immigrants had broken a valid law--even if they had in fact violated the law--this Court held that the city's discriminatory enforcement violated the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id., at 373-374; see also Whren v. United States, 517 U.\u00a0S. 806, 813 (1996).  Following our lead, the courts of appeals have recognized that \u00a71983 plaintiffs alleging racially selective arrests in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment don't have to show a lack of probable cause, even though they might have to show a lack of probable cause to establish a violation of the Fourth Amendment: \"[S]imply because a practice passes muster under the Fourth Amendment (arrest based on probable cause) does not mean that unequal treatment with respect to that practice is consistent with equal protection.\"  Hedgepeth v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Auth., 386 F.\u00a03d 1148, 1156 (CADC 2004); see also Gibson v. Superintendent of N.\u00a0J. Dept. of Law and Public Safety-Div. of State Police, 411 F.\u00a03d 427, 440 (CA3 2005); Marshall v. Columbia Lea Regional Hospital, 345 F.\u00a03d 1157, 1166 (CA10 2003); Vakilian v. Shaw, 335 F.\u00a03d 509, 521 (CA6 2003); Johnson v. Crooks, 326 F.\u00a03d 995, 999-1000 (CA8 2003); Holland v. Portland, 102 F.\u00a03d 6, 11 (CA1 1996).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I can think of no sound reason why the same shouldn't hold true here.  Like a Fourteenth Amendment selective arrest claim, a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim serves a different purpose than a Fourth Amendment unreasonable arrest claim, and that purpose does not depend on the presence or absence of probable cause.  We thus have no legitimate basis for engrafting a no-probable-cause requirement onto a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But while it would be a mistake to think the absence of probable cause is an essential element of a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim under \u00a71983--or that the presence of probable cause is an absolute defense to such a claim--I acknowledge that it may also be a mistake to assume probable cause is entirely irrelevant to the analysis.  It seems to me that probable cause to arrest could still bear on the claim's viability in at least two ways that warrant further exploration in future cases.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, consider causation.  To show an arrest violated the First Amendment, everyone agrees a plaintiff must prove the officer would not have arrested him but for his protected speech.  And if the only offense for which probable cause to arrest existed was a minor infraction of the sort that wouldn't normally trigger an arrest in the circumstances--or if the officer couldn't identify a crime for which probable cause existed until well after the arrest--then causation might be a question for the jury.  By contrast, if the officer had probable cause at the time of the arrest to think the plaintiff committed a serious crime of the sort that would nearly always trigger an arrest regardless of speech, then (absent extraordinary circumstances) it's hard to see how a reasonable jury might find that the plaintiff's speech caused the arrest.  In cases like that, it would seem that officers often will be entitled to dismissal on the pleadings or summary judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the name of causation concerns, the officers ask us to go further still and hold that a plaintiff can never prove protected speech caused his arrest without first showing that the officers lacked probable cause to make an arrest.  But that absolute rule doesn't wash with common experience.  No one doubts that officers regularly choose against making arrests, especially for minor crimes, even when they possess probable cause.  So the presence of probable cause does not necessarily negate the possibility that an arrest was caused by unlawful First Amendment  retaliation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If logic doesn't support their argument, the officers reply, at least precedent does.  They point to Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.\u00a0S. 250 (2006), where the plaintiff alleged that a law enforcement officer retaliated against him for his speech by convincing a prosecutor to bring criminal charges against him.  This Court held the claim presented a \"distinct problem of causation\" that could be overcome only with proof that the prosecutor lacked probable cause for the charges.  Id., at 263.  And as a matter of precedent, the officers argue, what was true there should hold true here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Hartman does not demand nearly as much of us as the officers suggest.  Hartman justified its rule by explaining that the \"causal connection required\" in that case wasn't just between the officer's retaliatory intent and his own injurious action.  Instead, it was between the officer's intent and the injurious action of the prosecutor, whose charging decision was subject to a \"presumption of regularity.\"  Id., at 262-263.  In that particular context, Hartman said, proof that the prosecutor lacked probable cause was necessary to \"bridge the gap between the [officer's] motive and the prosecutor's action.\"  Id., at 263.  But Hartman made equally clear that its reasoning did not extend to \"ordinary retaliation claims, where the government agent allegedly harboring the animus is also the individual allegedly taking the adverse action.\"  Id., at 259-260.  And that describes a retaliatory arrest claim like Mr. Bartlett's to a tee.  So while probable cause may wind up defeating causation in some retaliatory arrest cases, nothing in our precedent (let alone logic) suggests that causation is always unprovable just because the officer had probable cause to arrest.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, our precedent suggests the possibility that probable cause may play a role in light of the separation of powers and federalism.  In United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.\u00a0S. 456 (1996), a plaintiff alleged that he was prosecuted because of his race.  This Court responded by acknowledging that racially selective prosecutions can violate the Equal Protection Clause even when the prosecutor possesses probable cause to believe a crime has been committed.  But because the decision whether to institute criminal charges is one our Constitution vests in state and federal executive officials, not judges, this Court also held that, to respect the separation of powers and federalism, a plaintiff must present \"\u00a0'clear evidence'\u00a0\" of discrimination when a federal or state official possesses probable cause to support his prosecution.  Id., at 465.  Explaining the content of the clear evidence requirement, this Court indicated that a plaintiff generally must produce evidence that the prosecutor failed to charge other similarly situated persons.  At the same time, however, the Court also suggested that equally clear evidence in the form of \"\u00a0'direct admissions by prosecutors of discriminatory purpose'\u00a0\" might be enough to allow a claim to proceed.  Id., at 469, n.\u00a03 (alterations omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though this case involves a retaliatory arrest claim rather than a selective prosecution claim, it's at least an open question whether the concerns that drove this Court's decision in Armstrong may be in play here.  No one before us argues that Armstrong was wrongly decided.  And the Court today seems to indicate that something like Armstrong's standard might govern a retaliatory arrest claim when probable cause exists to support an arrest.  See ante, at 14 (citing Armstrong).  Some courts of appeals, too, have already applied Armstrong to claims alleging selective arrest under the Fourteenth Amendment.  See, e.g., United States v. Mason, 774 F.\u00a03d 824, 829-830 (CA4 2014); United States v. Alcaraz-Arellano, 441 F.\u00a03d 1252, 1264 (CA10 2006); Johnson, 326 F.\u00a03d, at 1000.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, enough questions remain about Armstrong's potential application that I hesitate to speak definitively about it today.  Some courts of appeals have argued that Armstrong should not extend, at least without qualification, beyond prosecutorial decisions to arrests by police.  These courts have suggested that the presumptions of regularity and immunity that usually attach to official prosecutorial decisions do not apply equally in the less formal setting of police arrests.  They've reasoned, too, that comparative data about similarly situated individuals may be less readily available for arrests than for prosecutorial decisions, and that other kinds of evidence--such as an officer's questions and comments to the defendant--may be equally if not more probative in the arrest context.  See, e.g., United States v. Sellers, 906 F.\u00a03d 848, 856 (CA9 2018); United States v. Washington, 869 F.\u00a03d 193, 219 (CA3 2017); United States v. Davis, 793 F.\u00a03d 712, 720-721 (CA7 2015); Marshall, 345 F.\u00a03d, at 1168.  Importantly, we did not grant certiorari to resolve exactly how Armstrong might apply to retaliatory arrest claims.  Nor did the briefing before us explore the competing arguments in this circuit split.  And given all this, I believe it would be rash for us to do more at this point than acknowledge the possibility of Armstrong's application.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dissenting, Justice Sotomayor reads the majority opinion as adopting a rigid rule (more rigid, in fact, than Armstrong's) that First Amendment retaliatory arrest plaintiffs who can't prove the absence of probable cause must produce \"comparison-based evidence\" in every case.  Post, at 4.  But I do not understand the majority as going that far.  The only citation the majority offers in support of its new standard is Armstrong, which expressly left open the possibility that other kinds of evidence, such as admissions, might be enough to allow a claim to proceed.  Given that, I retain hope that lower courts will apply today's decision \"commonsensically,\" post, at 12, and with sensitivity to the competing arguments about whether and how Armstrong might apply in the arrest setting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For today, I believe it is enough to resolve the question on which we did grant certiorari--whether \"probable cause defeats .\u00a0.\u00a0. a First Amendment retaliatory-arrest claim under \u00a71983.\"  Pet. for Cert. i.  I would hold, as the majority does, that the absence of probable cause is not an absolute requirement of such a claim and its presence is not an absolute defense.  At the same time, I would also acknowledge that this does not mean the presence of probable cause is categorically irrelevant: It may bear on causation, and it may play a role under Armstrong.  But rather than attempt to sort out precisely when and how probable cause plays a role in First Amendment claims, I would reserve decision on those questions until they are properly presented to this Court and we can address them with the benefit of full adversarial testing.\n\nOpinion of Ginsburg, J.\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1174\nLUIS A. NIEVES, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v. RUSSELL P. BARTLETT\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\n[May 28, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Ginsburg, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Arrest authority, as several decisions indicate, can be abused to disrupt the exercise of First Amendment speech and press rights.  See, e.g., Lacey v. Maricopa County, 693 F.\u00a03d 896, 907-910 (CA9 2012) (en banc) (newspaper publishers alleged they were arrested in nighttime raid after publishing story on law enforcement's investigation of the newspaper); Roper v. New York, 2017 WL 2483813, *1 (SDNY, June 7, 2017) (photographers documenting Black Lives Matter protest alleged they were arrested for standing in street and failing to use crosswalk; sidewalks and crosswalks were blocked by police); Morse v. San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Dist. (BART), 2014 WL 572352, *1-*7 (ND Cal., Feb. 11, 2014) (only journalist arrested at protest was journalist critical of Bay Area Rapid Transit Police).  Given the array of laws proscribing, e.g., breach of the peace, disorderly conduct, obstructing public ways, failure to comply with a peace officer's instruction, and loitering, police may justify an arrest as based on probable cause when the arrest was in fact prompted by a retaliatory motive.  If failure to show lack of probable cause defeats an action under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, only entirely baseless arrests will be checked.  I remain of the view that the Court's decision in Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.\u00a0S. 274 (1977), strikes the right balance: The plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that unconstitutional animus was a motivating factor for an adverse action; the burden then shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that, even without any impetus to retaliate, the defendant would have taken the action complained of.  See Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.\u00a0S. 250, 266-267 (2006) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, I would reverse the Ninth Circuit's judgment as to Trooper Weight.  As the Court points out, the record is bereft of evidence of retaliation on Weight's part.  See ante, at 15.  As to Sergeant Nieves, there is some evidence of animus in Nieves' statement, \"bet you wish you would have talked to me now,\" App. 376, but perhaps not enough to survive summary judgment.  Cf. Higginbotham v. Sylvester, 741 Fed. Appx. 28, 31 (CA2 2018) (\"[A] reasonable factfinder could not find that [the plaintiff's] exercise of his First Amendment right .\u00a0.\u00a0. was the 'but-for' cause of his arrest.\").  In any event, I would not use this thin case to state a rule that will leave press members and others exercising First Amendment rights with little protection against police suppression of their speech.\n\nSotomayor, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1174\nLUIS A. NIEVES, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v. RUSSELL P. BARTLETT\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\n[May 28, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to decide whether probable cause alone always suffices to defeat a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983.  The Court answers that question \"no\"--a correct and sensible bottom line on which eight Justices agree.  There is no basis in \u00a71983 or in the Constitution to withhold a remedy for an arrest that violated the First Amendment solely because the officer could point to probable cause that some offense, no matter how trivial or obviously pretextual, has  occurred.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, a slimmer majority of the Court chooses not to stop there.  The majority instead announces a different rule: that a showing of probable cause will defeat a \u00a71983 First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim unless the person arrested happens to be able to show that \"otherwise similarly situated individuals\" whose speech differed were not arrested.  Ante, at 14.  The Court barely attempts to explain where in the First Amendment or \u00a71983 it finds any grounding for that rule, which risks letting flagrant violations go unremedied.  Because the correct approach would be simply to apply the well-established, carefully calibrated standards that govern First Amendment retaliation claims in other contexts, I respectfully dissent.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As Justice Gorsuch explains, the issue here is not whether an arrest motivated by protected speech may violate the First Amendment despite probable cause for the arrest; the question is under what circumstances \u00a71983 permits a remedy for such a violation.  See ante, at 1-2 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).  From that common starting point, Justice Gorsuch and I travel far down the same path.  I agree that neither the text nor the common-law backdrop of \u00a71983 supports imposing on First Amendment retaliatory arrest claims a probable-cause requirement that we would not impose in other contexts.  See ante, at 2-4.  I agree that Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.\u00a0S. 250 (2006), turned on concerns specific to malicious prosecution, and that its automatic probable-cause bar therefore does not extend to claims like this one.  See ante, at 6.  And I agree that--while probable cause has undeniable evidentiary significance to the underlying question of what motivated an arrest--some arrests are demonstrably retaliation for protected speech, notwithstanding probable cause of some coincidental infraction.  See ante, at 5-6; see also ante, at 1 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  Plaintiffs should have a meaningful opportunity to prove such claims when they arise.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I follow this logic to its natural conclusion: Courts should evaluate retaliatory arrest claims in the same manner as they would other First Amendment retaliation claims.  Accord, ante, at 1-2 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).  The standard framework for distinguishing legitimate exercises of governmental authority from those intended to chill protected speech is well established.  See Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.\u00a0S. 274, 287 (1977).  The plaintiff must first establish that constitutionally protected conduct was a \"\u00a0'substantial'\u00a0\" or \"\u00a0'motivating'\u00a0\" factor in the challenged governmental action (here, an arrest).  Ibid.  If the plaintiff can make that threshold showing, the question becomes whether the governmental actor (here, the arresting officer) can show that the same decision would have been made regardless of the protected conduct.  Ibid.  If not, the governmental actor is liable.  Ibid.  In other words, if retaliatory animus was not a \"but-for cause\" of an arrest, a suit seeking to hold the arresting officer liable will fail \"for lack of causal connection between unconstitutional motive and resulting harm.\"  Hartman, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 260; see also Lozman v. Riviera Beach, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 7).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This timeworn standard is by no means easily satisfied.  Even in cases where there is \"proof of some retaliatory animus,\" Hartman, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 260, if evidence of retaliatory motive is weak, or evidence of nonretaliatory motive is strong, but-for causation will generally be lacking.  That is why probable cause to believe that someone was a serial killer would defeat any First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim--even if, say, there were evidence that the officers also detested the suspect's political beliefs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With sufficient evidence of retaliatory motive and sufficiently weak evidence of probable cause, however, Mt. Healthy is surmountable.  Its orderly framework thus \"protects against the invasion of constitutional rights\" while burdening legitimate exercises of governmental authority only so far as is \"necessary to the assurance of those rights.\"  Mt. Healthy, 429 U.\u00a0S., at 287; see ante, at 1-2 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.) (Mt. Healthy \"strikes the right balance\").\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regrettably, the Court casts aside the Mt. Healthy standard for many arrests.  It instead announces that courts should look beyond the presence of probable cause only when (in its view) the evidence of a constitutional violation is \"objective\" enough to warrant further inquiry--namely, when a plaintiff can muster evidence \"that he was arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged in the same sort of protected speech had not been.\"  Ante, at 14.  Plaintiffs who would rely on other evidence to prove a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim appear to be out of luck, even if they could offer other, unassailable proof of an officer's unconstitutional \"statements and motivations.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To give partial credit where due: The Court sensibly rejects the absolute probable-cause bar urged by petitioners and embraced by Justice Thomas, see ante, at 1 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and its contrary rule will at least allow the First Amendment to operate in some cases where it is sorely needed.  The majority's reasons for imposing a probable-cause bar in some cases but not others, however, do not withstand scrutiny.  And by arbitrarily insisting upon comparison-based evidence, the majority's rule fences out First Amendment violations for which redress is equally if not more \"warranted,\" ante, at 13, leaving the public exposed potentially to flagrant abuses.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's rationale for the rule it ultimately adopts is hard to discern and, once unearthed, not persuasive.  Much of its opinion is spent analogizing to Hartman and to common-law privileges.  See ante, at 8-9, 12-13.  For the reasons Justice Gorsuch explains, that reasoning is not sound.  See ante, at 2-4, 6.  Those authorities, in any event, do not support the novel rule the Court imposes.  What remains is the majority's practical concern about applying normal First Amendment standards in this context, as well as a handful of inapposite cases involving different constitutional rights.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the practical side, the majority worries that because discerning the connection between an arrest and a retaliatory motive may involve \"causal complexities,\" ante, at 8; some plaintiffs who raise dubious challenges to lawful arrests may evade early dismissal under Mt. Healthy, see ante, at 10-11.  Our precedents do not permit an interpretation of \u00a71983 to rest on such \"a freewheeling policy choice,\" Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.\u00a0S. 335, 342 (1986), and  in any event the majority's concerns do not withstand scrutiny.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the majority's concern that establishing a causal link to retaliatory animus will sometimes be complex: That is true of most unconstitutional motive claims, yet we generally trust that courts are up to the task of managing them.  See Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.\u00a0S. 574, 597-601 (1998).  And the Mt. Healthy standard accounts for the delicacy of such inquiries with its but-for causation requirement, calibrated to balance governmental interests with individual rights.  See 429 U.\u00a0S., at 287.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the risk of litigating dubious claims, the Court pays too high a price to avoid what may well be a marginal inconvenience.  Prevailing First Amendment standards have long governed retaliatory arrest cases in the Ninth Circuit, and experience there suggests that trials in these cases are rare--the parties point to only a handful of cases that have reached trial in more than a decade.  See Brief for Petitioners 36-39 (identifying four examples); Brief for Respondent 42-49 (discussing those and other Ninth Circuit cases).1  Even accepting that, every so often, a police officer who made a legitimate arrest might have to explain that arrest to a jury, that is insufficient reason to curtail the First Amendment.  No legal standard bats a thousand, and district courts already possess helpful tools to minimize the burdens of litigation in cases alleging constitutionally improper motives.  See Crawford-El, 523 U.\u00a0S., at 597-601. In addition, the burden of a (presumably indemnified2) officer facing trial pales in comparison to the importance of guarding core First Amendment activity against the clear potential for abuse that accompanies the arrest power.  See Lozman, 585 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12); Part II-B-2, infra.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, and more fundamentally, even if the majority's practical concerns were valid, they would not justify the Court's mix-and-match approach to constitutional law.  The Court relies heavily on Devenpeck v. Alford, 543 U.\u00a0S. 146, 153-154 (2004), which held that an arresting officer's state of mind does not matter for purposes of determining whether a Fourth Amendment seizure was supported by probable cause.  From this Fourth Amendment holding, the Court extrapolates that First Amendment plaintiffs must show a lack of probable cause (or satisfy its new comparison-based workaround) before their retaliation claims can proceed.  See ante, at 11, 14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This analogy is misguided, and the Court has rightly disavowed it before.  In Whren v. United States, 517 U.\u00a0S. 806 (1996), the Court explained that while \"[s]ubjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis,\" that does not make evidence of an officer's \"actual motivations\" any less relevant to claims of \"selective enforcement\" under the Equal Protection Clause.  Id., at 813; accord, ante, at 4 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.).  First Amendment retaliation claims and equal protection claims are indistinguishable for these purposes; both inherently require inquiry into \"an official's motive.\" Crawford-El, 523 U.\u00a0S., at 585.  Thus, even if the \"[s]ubjective intent of the arresting officer .\u00a0.\u00a0. is simply no basis for invalidating an arrest\" under the Fourth Amendment, Devenpeck, 543 U. S., at 154-155, when it comes to First Amendment freedom of speech, \"the government's reason\" is often \"what counts,\" see Heffernan v. City of Paterson, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6).  Far from supporting the novel burden the Court imposes on First Amendment retaliatory arrest plaintiffs, then, the analogy on which the majority's analysis depends is an unfounded exercise in hybridizing two different constitutional protections.  The result is a Frankenstein-like constitutional tort that may do more harm than good.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Were it simply an unorthodox solution to an illusory problem, the standard announced today would be benign.  But by rejecting direct evidence of unconstitutional motives in favor of more convoluted comparative proof, the majority's standard proposes to ration First Amendment protection in an illogical manner.  And those arbitrary legal results in turn will breed opportunities for the rare ill-intentioned officer to violate the First Amendment without consequence--and, in some cases, openly and unabashedly.  These are costs the Court should not  tolerate.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The basic error of the Court's new rule is that it arbitrarily fetishizes one specific type of motive evidence--treatment of comparators--at the expense of other modes of proof.3  In particular, the majority goes out of its way to forswear reliance on an officer's own \"statements,\" ante, at 15, even though such direct admissions may often be the best available evidence of unconstitutional motive.  As a result, the Court's standard in some cases will have the strange effect of requiring courts to blind themselves to smoking-gun evidence while simultaneously insisting upon an inferential sort of proof that, though potentially powerful, can be prohibitively difficult to obtain.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's decision to cast aside evidence of the arresting officer's own statements is puzzling.  See ibid.  In other contexts, when the ultimate question is why a decisionmaker took a particular action, the Court considers the decisionmaker's own statements (favorable or not) to be highly relevant evidence.  See, e.g., Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Comm'n, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2018) (slip op., at 13-14); Cooper v. Harris, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2017) (slip op., at 10-12); Foster v. Chatman, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2016) (slip op., at 10-25); Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.\u00a0S. 520, 540-542 (1993); Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.\u00a0S. 252, 270 (1977).  There is no reason to treat the same sort of evidence so differently here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the majority is worried that statements, like the mental states they evince, can be \"\u00a0'easy to allege and hard to disprove.'\u00a0\"  Ante, at 11 (quoting Crawford-El, 523 U.\u00a0S., at 585).  Such concerns, whatever their merits, are insufficient reason \"to change the burden of proof for an entire category of claims.\"  Id., at 594.  Besides, more than ever before, an audiovisual record of key events is now often obtainable.  Many police departments, for example, equip their officers with body-worn cameras.4  Smartphones that become video cameras with the flick of a thumb are ubiquitous, creating still more potential records.5  In this very case, a local news crew captured some of the relevant events on video, and the officers were wearing audio recorders (though neither had turned his on). The majority appears ready to forsake this body of  probative evidence, even though it has the potential to narrow factual disputes and avert trials.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead, the majority suggests that comparison-based evidence is the sole gateway through the probable-cause barrier that it otherwise erects.  Such evidence can be prohibitively difficult to come by in other selective-enforcement contexts, and it may be even harder for retaliatory arrest plaintiffs to muster.6  After all, while records of arrests and prosecutions can be hard to obtain, it will be harder still to identify arrests that never happened.  And unlike race, gender, or other protected characteristics, speech is not typically sorted into statistical buckets that are susceptible of ready categorization and comparison.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The threshold exercise prescribed today--comparing and contrasting a plaintiff's protected speech and allegedly illegal actions with the speech and behavior of others  who could have been arrested but were not--is likely to prove vexing in most cases.  I suspect that those who can navigate this requirement predominantly will be arrestees singled out at protests or other large public gatherings, where a robust pool of potential comparators happens to be within earshot, eyeshot, or camera-shot.  See, e.g., Mam v. Fullerton, 2013 WL 951401, *5 (CD Cal., Mar. 12, 2013) (denying summary judgment to an arresting officer where \"the only difference between [the plaintiff] and those near him [in a crowd] was the cell phone being used to record\").  While some who fit that bill undoubtedly need the protection, see, e.g., Brief for National Press Photographers Association et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 9-15 (collecting examples of journalists arrested during public protests or gatherings), it is hard to see why those plaintiffs are the only ones deserving of a \u00a71983 remedy.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Put into practice, the majority's approach will yield arbitrary results and shield willful misconduct from accountability.  As one example, suppose police respond to reports of a man prowling a front porch.  The man says that he is a locked-out homeowner; the police want ID.  The man alleges profiling; the officers insist they are just doing their jobs.  Tempers flare.  A passerby, stepping into a next-door neighbor's yard for a clearer view of the confrontation, pulls out a cell phone camera and begins streaming video of the encounter to her social media followers.  One of the officers notices and orders the passerby to stop recording.  When the passerby persists, the officer places the passerby under arrest for trespassing.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Will this citizen journalist have an opportunity to prove that the arrest violated her First Amendment rights?  Under the majority's test, the answer seems to turn on how many other curious bystanders she can identify who were not arrested in a situation like hers.  If she was one of a crowd to enter the neighbor's yard that night, she can sue using her readily available comparator neighbors.  But if she was keeping a lonely vigil, she is out of luck (unless she can find some other pool of comparable individuals).   And the video of the officer demanding she stop recording moments before the arrest?  Irrelevant, apparently.  What sense does that make?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Worse, because the majority disclaims reliance on \"statements and motivations\" for its threshold inquiry, ante, at 15, it risks licensing even clear-cut abuses.  Imagine that a reporter is investigating corruption in a police unit.  An officer from that unit follows the reporter until the reporter exceeds the speed limit by five miles per hour, then delivers a steep ticket and an explicit message: \"Until you find something else to write about, there will be many more where this came from.\"  Cf. Torries v. Hebert, 111 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 806, 812 (WD La. 2000) (describing allegations that a sheriff arrested proprietors of a local business and \"threatened to arrest them again if they continued to play [rap] music\").  If even such objectively probative evidence is irrelevant, \u00a71983 will provide no redress for such flagrant conduct.  Meanwhile, the majority's embrace of the Devenpeck rule suggests that a particularly brazen officer could arrest on transparently speech-based grounds and check the statute books later for a potential justification.  See 543 U.\u00a0S., at 153 (holding that probable cause need not be for an \"offense actually invoked at the time of  arrest\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do not mean to overstate the clarity of today's holding.  What exactly the Court means by \"objective evidence,\" \"otherwise similarly situated,\" and \"the same sort of protected speech\" is far from clear.  See ante, at 14.7  I hope that courts approach this new standard commonsensically.  It is hard to see what point is served by requiring a journalist arrested for jaywalking to point to specific other jaywalkers who got a free pass, for example, if statistics or common sense confirm that jaywalking arrests are extremely rare.  Otherwise, there will be little daylight between the comparison-based standard the Court adopts and the absolute bar it ostensibly rejects.8\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch, alert to the illogic of the majority's position, instead contemplates borrowing a requirement to adduce \"clear evidence\" of prohibited purpose from our cases concerning equal-protection-based selective-prosecution claims.  See ante, at 7-8 (citing United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.\u00a0S. 456 (1996)).9  This suggestion, though perhaps an improvement over the majority's approach, would nevertheless take a doctrine applying (1) equal protection principles (2) in a criminal proceeding to (3) charging decisions by prosecutors, see id., at 458-459, 464-465, and ask it also to govern the application of (1) First Amendment principles (2) in a suit for civil damages challenging (3) arrests by police officers.  Justice Gorsuch commendably reserves judgment on a proposal not yet subjected to adversarial testing, so I too refrain from speaking too definitively.  But I do note that we rejected a very similar rule in Crawford-El.  See 523 U.\u00a0S., at 594 (rejecting a \"clear and convincing\" standard for \"constitutional claims that require proof of improper intent\").  And whatever the merits of the Armstrong rule as currently applied in other contexts, there are good reasons--unexplored by the parties here--to hesitate before extending it.10\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the foregoing reasons, I agree with Justice Ginsburg that the tried-and-true Mt. Healthy approach remains the correct one.  And because petitioners have not asked us to revisit the Court of Appeals' application of the governing standard, I would affirm.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The power to constrain a person's liberty is delegated to law enforcement officers by the public in a sacred trust.  The First Amendment stands as a bulwark of that trust, erected by people who knew from personal experience the dangers of abuse that follow from investing anyone with such awesome power.  Cf. Whitney v. California, 274 U.\u00a0S. 357, 375-376 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring).  Because the majority shortchanges that hard-earned wisdom in the name of marginal convenience, I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Justice Sotomayor would have us extend Mt. Healthy and rely on that \"tried and true\" approach as the exclusive standard in the retaliatory arrest context.  See post, at 1-5, 14 (dissenting opinion).  But not even respondent Bartlett argues for such a rule.  And since our decisions in Hartman and Reichle, no court of appeals has applied that approach in retaliatory arrest cases of this sort.  Justice Sotomayor criticizes the Court for spending \"[m]uch of its opinion .\u00a0.\u00a0. analogizing to Hartman,\" post, at 4, but of course Hartman is our precedent most directly on point.  To the extent retaliatory arrest cases raise concerns distinct from that precedent, we have departed from Hartman to afford greater First Amendment protection.  See infra, at 13-15.\nFootnote 2\u00a0For our purposes, we need not distinguish between the torts of false imprisonment and false arrest, which are \"virtually synonymous.\"  35 C.\u00a0J.\u00a0S., False Imprisonment \u00a72, p. 522 (2009); see also Wallace, 549 U.\u00a0S., at 388-389.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Because no party questions whether \u00a71983 claims for retaliatory arrests under the First Amendment are actionable, I assume that \u00a71983 permits such claims.  See Lozman v. Riviera Beach, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2018) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3, n.\u00a02).\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The majority implies that the Ninth Circuit does not apply Mt. Healthy.  Ante, at 12, n.\u00a01 (\"since .\u00a0.\u00a0. Hartman and Reichle, no court of appeals has applied [the Mt. Healthy] approach\").  That is not readily apparent.  Because Hartman's no-probable-cause requirement does not apply to retaliatory police action in the Ninth Circuit, such claims are handled as \"\u00a0'ordinary' retaliation claim[s],\" Skoog v. County of Clackamas, 469 F.\u00a03d 1221, 1234 (2006), which in the Ninth Circuit (as elsewhere) means that retaliatory motive must be the \"but-for cause of the defendant's action,\" id., at 1232.  That but-for causation requirement for retaliation claims derives from Mt. Healthy.  See Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.\u00a0S. 250, 260 (2006); Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.\u00a0S. 574, 593 (1998); see also Lacey v. Maricopa County, 693 F.\u00a03d 896, 916-917 (CA9 2012) (en banc) (retaliatory arrest plaintiff must show that deterrence of speech \"was a substantial or motivating factor\" and also \"ultimately\" be able to show \"\u00a0'but-for causation'\u00a0\" (quoting Hartman's discussion of Mt. Healthy)).\nIn any event, the majority's criticism is a red herring.  There is  nothing novel about applying Mt. Healthy in the retaliatory arrest context.  E.g., Lozman v. Riviera Beach, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2018) (slip op., at 12-13).

Armstrong, 34 Am. Crim. L.\u00a0Rev. 1071, 1102-1106 (1997) (discussing examples).\nFootnote 7\u00a0It is also unclear what the majority means when it says that because its threshold \"inquiry is objective, the statements and motivations of the particular arresting officer are 'irrelevant.'\u00a0\"  Ante, at 15.  That could conceivably be read to mean that all statements are irrelevant, even objectively probative statements describing events in the world--e.g., \"I am arresting the libertarians, but not the nonlibertarian protesters who were also trespassing.\"  The facts asserted therein--that libertarians were arrested, nonlibertarians were not, and all were similarly trespassing--are precisely the kind of objective evidence the Court seeks.  Similarly, routine police reports--on which the majority surely must intend for plaintiffs to rely--are generally authored by, and thus \"statements of,\" arresting officers.  More likely, then, the majority means only that statements describing the officer's internal thought processes are irrelevant (e.g., \"I hate libertarians\").  But many statements will fall somewhere in between (e.g., \"I'm only arresting you because I hate libertarians\").  It is hard to see how workable lines can be drawn here.\nFootnote 8\u00a0That could be the unintended result if courts interpret their new task too rigidly.  Given the significant evidentiary challenges plaintiffs may face, the best assumption is that the Court intends courts to afford some latitude, especially at the outset of a case.  That could mean relying on common experience to assess the most self-evidently minor infractions (such as the Court's jaywalking example); allowing plaintiffs to rely on rough comparisons or inexact statistical evidence where laboratory-like controls cannot realistically be expected; and permitting discovery into potential comparator evidence where a complaint raises a strong inference of unconstitutional motive.  For similar reasons, I assume the Court intends courts to permit plaintiffs to draw from a broad universe of potential comparators.  And because the test is \"objective,\" ante, at 15, plaintiffs presumably can look beyond the practices of the specific officer or officers who arrested them, to see how other officers handle comparable infractions.\nFootnote 9\u00a0To whatever extent the Court's opinion also seeks kinship with Armstrong, see ante, at 14, I note that Armstrong expressly reserved the question whether comparator evidence alone can provide sufficiently clear evidence of discrimination or whether \"\u00a0'direct admissions .\u00a0.\u00a0. of discriminatory purpose'\u00a0\" might also suffice.  517 U.\u00a0S., at 469, n.\u00a03.  The Court should have followed that example here.\nFootnote 10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, Justice Gorsuch suggests that a potential Armstrong-like rule might be supported by a concern for \"separation of powers and federalism.\"  Ante, at 7.  While those values are undoubtedly important, they have no apparent interpretive role to play here. Section 1983 exercises Congress' Fourteenth Amendment power to enforce the Constitution against those who wield state authority, \"whether they act in accordance with their authority or misuse it.\"  Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.\u00a0S. 167, 172 (1961).  It is an emphatic \"extension of federal power\" into state affairs, id., at 182, one that by its plain terms covers all traditional state prerogatives--including the power to arrest--when wielded to violate federal constitutional rights.  Abuses of the arrest power thus are unquestionably among the unconstitutional acts \"under color of\" state law against which \u00a71983 operates.

LAMBERT(2019)\nNo. 17-1094\nArgued: November 27, 2018Decided: February 26, 2019\n\n\nRespondent Troy Lambert filed a class action in federal court alleging that petitioner Nutraceutical Corporation's marketing of a dietary supplement ran afoul of California consumer-protection law.  On February 20, 2015, the District Court ordered the class decertified.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f), Lambert had 14 days from that point to ask the Court of Appeals for permission to appeal the order.  Instead, he filed a motion for reconsideration on March 12, which the District Court denied on June 24.  Fourteen days later, Lambert petitioned the Court of Appeals for permission to appeal the decertification order.  Nutraceutical objected that Lambert's petition was untimely because it was filed far more than 14 days from the February 20 decertification order.  The Ninth Circuit held, however, that Rule 23(f)'s deadline should be tolled under the circumstances because Lambert had \"acted diligently.\"  On the merits, the court reversed the decertification order.\nHeld:\u00a0Rule 23(f) is not subject to equitable tolling.  Pp.\u00a03-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Rule 23(f) is properly classified as a nonjurisdictional claim-processing rule, but that does not render it malleable in every respect.  Whether a rule precludes equitable tolling turns not on its jurisdictional character but rather on whether its text leaves room for such flexibility.  See Carlisle v. United States, 517 U.\u00a0S. 416, 421.  Here, the governing rules speak directly to the issue of Rule 23(f)'s flexibility and make clear that its deadline is not subject to equitable tolling.  While Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 2 authorizes a court of appeals for good cause to \"suspend any provision .\u00a0.\u00a0. in a particular case,\" it does so with a caveat: \"except as otherwise provided in Rule 26(b).\"  Rule 26(b), which generally authorizes extensions of time, in turn includes the carveout that a court of appeals \"may not extend the time to file .\u00a0.\u00a0. a petition for permission to appeal\"--the precise type of filing at issue here.  The Rules thus express a clear intent to compel rigorous enforcement of Rule 23(f)'s deadline, even where good cause for equitable tolling might otherwise exist.  Precedent confirms this understanding.  See Carlisle, 517 U.\u00a0S. 416, and United States v. Robinson, 361 U.\u00a0S. 220.  Pp.\u00a03-6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Lambert's counterarguments do not withstand scrutiny.  Lambert argues that Rule 26(b)'s prohibition on extending the time to file a petition for permission to appeal should be understood to foreclose only formal extensions granted ex ante and to leave courts free to excuse late filings on equitable grounds after the fact.  But this Court has already rejected an indistinguishable argument concerning Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(b) in Robinson, and Lambert offers no sound basis for reading Rule 26(b) differently.  Further, the 1998 Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 23(f) speak to a court of appeals' discretion to decide whether a particular certification decision warrants review in an interlocutory posture, not to its determination whether a petition is timely.  Finally, Lambert notes that every Court of Appeals to have considered the question would accept a Rule 23(f) petition filed within 14 days of the resolution of a motion for reconsideration that was itself filed within 14 days of the original order.  Although his own reconsideration motion was not filed until after the initial 14 days had run, he cites the lower courts' handling of such cases as evidence that Rule 23(f) is amenable to tolling.  However, a timely motion for reconsideration affects the antecedent issue of when the 14-day limit begins to run, not the availability of tolling.  See United States v. Ibarra, 502 U.\u00a0S. 1, 4, n.\u00a02.  Pp.\u00a06-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0On remand, the Court of Appeals can address other preserved arguments about whether Lambert's Rule 23(f) petition was timely even without resort to tolling.

Rule Civ. Proc.\u00a023(f).  This case poses the question whether a court of appeals may forgive on equitable tolling grounds a failure to adhere to that deadline when the opposing party objects that the appeal was untimely.  The applicable rules of procedure make clear that the answer is no.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In March 2013, respondent Troy Lambert sued petitioner Nutraceutical Corporation in federal court, alleging that its marketing of a dietary supplement ran afoul of California consumer-protection law.  The District Court for the Central District of California initially permitted Lambert to litigate on behalf of a class of similarly situated consumers.  On February 20, 2015, however, the District Court revisited that decision and ordered the class decertified.  From that point, Lambert had 14 days to ask the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for permission to appeal the order.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(f).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead of filing a petition for permission to appeal, Lambert informed the District Court at a status conference on March 2 (10 days after the decertification order) that he would \"want to file a motion for reconsideration\" in the near future.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 74.  The court told Lambert to file any such motion \"no later than\" March 12.  Id., at 76.  Neither Lambert nor the District Court mentioned the possibility of an appeal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lambert filed his motion for reconsideration, in compliance with the District Court's schedule, on March 12 (20 days after the decertification order).  The District Court denied the motion on June 24, 2015.  Fourteen days later, on July 8, Lambert petitioned the Court of Appeals for permission to appeal the decertification order.  Nutraceutical's response argued that Lambert's petition was untimely because more than four months had elapsed since the District Court's February 20 order decertifying the class, far more than the 14 days that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) allows.  App. 41.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding the petition's apparent untimeliness, the Court of Appeals \"deem[ed] Lambert's petition timely\" because, in its view, the Rule 23(f) deadline should be \"tolled\" under the circumstances.  870 F.\u00a03d 1170, 1176 (CA9 2017).  The Court of Appeals reasoned that Rule 23(f\u00a0)'s time limit is \"non-jurisdictional, and that equitable remedies softening the deadline are therefore generally available.\"  Ibid.  Tolling was warranted, the court concluded, because Lambert \"informed the [District Court] orally of his intention to seek reconsideration\" within Rule 23(f)'s 14-day window, complied with the District Court's March 12 deadline, and \"otherwise acted diligently.\"  Id., at 1179.  On the merits, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court abused its discretion in decertifying the class.  Id., at 1182-1184.  It reversed the decertification order.  Id., at 1184.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accepting Lambert's petition, the Court of Appeals   \n\"recognize[d] that other circuits would likely not toll the Rule 23(f) deadline in Lambert's case.\"1 Id., at 1179.  We granted certiorari.  585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Lambert filed his petition, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) authorized courts of appeals to \"permit an appeal from an order granting or denying class-action certification .\u00a0.\u00a0. if a petition for permission to appeal is filed .\u00a0.\u00a0. within 14 days after the order is entered.\"2  The Court of Appeals held that Rule 23(f)'s time limitation is nonjurisdictional and thus, necessarily, subject to equitable tolling.  While we agree that Rule 23(f) is nonjurisdictional, we conclude that it is not subject to equitable tolling.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because Rule 23(f)'s time limitation is found in a procedural rule, not a statute, it is properly classified as a nonjurisdictional claim-processing rule.  See Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Servs. of Chicago, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 8).3  It therefore can be waived or forfeited by an opposing party.  See Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.\u00a0S. 443, 456 (2004).  The mere fact that a time limit lacks jurisdictional force, however, does not render it malleable in every respect.  Though subject to waiver and forfeiture, some claim-processing rules are \"mandatory\"--that is, they are \"\u00a0'unalterable'\u00a0\" if properly raised by an opposing party.  Manrique v. United States, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 4) (quoting Eberhart v. United States, 546 U.\u00a0S. 12, 15 (2005) (per curiam)); see also Kontrick, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 456.  Rules in this mandatory camp are not susceptible of the equitable approach that the Court of Appeals applied here.  Cf. Manrique, 581 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (\"By definition, mandatory claim-processing rules .\u00a0.\u00a0. are not subject to harmless-error analysis\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whether a rule precludes equitable tolling turns not on its jurisdictional character but rather on whether the text of the rule leaves room for such flexibility.  See Carlisle v. United States, 517 U.\u00a0S. 416, 421 (1996).  Where the pertinent rule or rules invoked show a clear intent to preclude tolling, courts are without authority to make exceptions merely because a litigant appears to have been diligent, reasonably mistaken, or otherwise deserving.  Ibid.; see Kontrick, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 458; United States v. Robinson, 361 U.\u00a0S. 220, 229 (1960).  Courts may not disregard a properly raised procedural rule's plain import any more than they may a statute's.  See Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U.\u00a0S. 250, 255 (1988).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, the governing rules speak directly to the issue of Rule 23(f\u00a0)'s flexibility and make clear that its deadline is not subject to equitable tolling.  To begin with, Rule 23(f) itself conditions the possibility of an appeal on the filing of a petition \"within 14 days\" of \"an order granting or denying class-action certification.\"  Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 5(a)(2) likewise says that a petition for permission to appeal \"must be filed within the time specified.\"  To be sure, the simple fact that a deadline is phrased in an unqualified manner does not necessarily establish that tolling is unavailable.  See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 2 (allowing suspension of other Rules for \"good cause\"); Fed. Rule App. Proc. 26(b) (similar); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 45(b) (similar); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 6(b) (similar).  Here, however, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure single out Civil Rule 23(f) for inflexible treatment.  While Appellate Rule 2 authorizes a court of appeals for good cause to \"suspend any provision of these rules in a particular case,\" it does so with a conspicuous caveat: \"except as otherwise provided in Rule 26(b).\"  Appellate Rule 26(b), which generally authorizes extensions of time, in turn includes this express carveout: A court of appeals \"may not extend the time to file .\u00a0.\u00a0. a petition for permission to appeal.\"  Fed. Rule App. Proc. 26(b)(1).  In other words, Appellate Rule 26(b) says that the deadline for the precise type of filing at issue here may not be extended.  The Rules thus express a clear intent to compel rigorous enforcement of Rule 23(f\u00a0)'s deadline, even where good cause for equitable tolling might otherwise exist.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Precedent confirms this understanding.  Carlisle, 517 U.\u00a0S. 416, and Robinson, 361 U.\u00a0S. 220, both centered on Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(b), an extension-of-time provision that parallels Appellate Rule 26(b).  Carlisle addressed Rule 45(b)'s interaction with the time limit in Criminal Rule 29 for filing a postverdict motion for judgment of acquittal.  See 517 U.\u00a0S., at 419-423.  Rule 45(b), as it was then written, made clear that \"\u00a0'the court may not extend the time for taking any action'\u00a0\" under Rule 29, \"\u00a0'except to the extent and under the conditions'\u00a0\" stated therein.  Id., at 421.  Because the Court found the text's purpose to foreclose acceptance of untimely motions \"plain and unambiguous,\" the Court held that the District Court lacked that authority.  Ibid.  Likewise, in Robinson, the Court held that an earlier iteration of Rule 45(b) that said \"\u00a0'the court may not enlarge .\u00a0.\u00a0. the period for taking an appeal'\u00a0\" prohibited a court from accepting a notice of appeal that was untimely filed.  361 U.\u00a0S., at 224 (quoting Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 45(b)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because Rule 23(f) is not amenable to equitable tolling, the Court of Appeals erred in accepting Lambert's petition on those grounds.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lambert resists the foregoing conclusion on a variety of grounds.  None withstands scrutiny.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Most pertinently, Lambert argues that the above-mentioned Rules are less emphatic than they first appear.  Rule 26(b)'s general grant of authority to relax time limits, he notes, refers both to \"extend[ing]\" the time to file a petition for permission to appeal and \"permit[ting]\" a petition to be filed after the deadline.  See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 26(b) (\"For good cause, the court may extend the time prescribed by these rules .\u00a0.\u00a0. to perform any act, or may permit an act to be done after that time expires\"  (emphasis added)).  Rule 26(b)(1) then prohibits courts only from \"extend[ing] the time to file,\" while making no further mention of \"permit[ting] an act to be done after that time expires.\"  In Lambert's view, Rule 26(b)(1)'s prohibition on \"extend[ing] the time to file\" a petition for permission to appeal therefore should be understood to foreclose only formal extensions granted ex ante, and to leave courts free to excuse late filings on equitable grounds after the fact.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whatever we would make of this contention were we writing on a blank slate, this Court has already rejected an indistinguishable argument in Robinson.  There, Rule 45(b) generally authorized both \"\u00a0'enlarg[ing]'\u00a0\" a filing period and \"\u00a0'permit[ting] the act to be done after [its] expiration,'\u00a0\" then specifically forbade \"\u00a0'enlarg[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0. the period for taking an appeal.'\u00a0\"  361 U.\u00a0S., at 223.  The lower court had accepted a late filing on the ground that to do so \"would not be to 'enlarge' the period for taking an appeal, but rather would be only to 'permit the act to be done' after the expiration of the specified period.\"  Ibid.; see also id., at 230 (Black and Douglas, JJ., dissenting).  This Court reversed, explaining that acceptance of the late filing did, in fact, \"enlarge\" the relevant filing period.  Id., at 224.  Lambert offers no sound basis for reading Rule 26(b) differently, and none is apparent.  Cf. Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U.\u00a0S. 312, 315 (1988) (\"Permitting courts to exercise jurisdiction over unnamed parties after the time for filing a notice of appeal has passed is equivalent to permitting courts to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal\").4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Likewise unavailing is Lambert's reliance on the 1998 Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 23(f), which say that a petition \"may be granted or denied on the basis of any consideration that the court of appeals finds persuasive.\"  Advisory Committee's Notes on 1998 Amendments to Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. App., p. 815; see also Microsoft Corp. v. Baker, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2017) (slip op., at 6-8).  That comment, however, speaks to a court of appeals' discretion to decide whether a particular certification decision warrants review in an interlocutory posture, not its determination whether a petition is timely.  If anything, the comment serves as a reminder that interlocutory appeal is an exception to the general rule that appellate review must await final judgment--which is fully consistent with a conclusion that Rule 23(f)'s time limit is purposefully unforgiving.  See Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.\u00a0S. 100, 106 (2009) (\"The justification for immediate appeal must .\u00a0.\u00a0. be sufficiently strong to overcome the usual benefits of deferring appeal until litigation concludes\"); cf. Baker, 582 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op.,  at 6) (describing Rule 23(f) as \"the product of careful calibration\").5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, Lambert notes that every Court of Appeals to have considered the question would accept a Rule 23(f) petition filed within 14 days of the resolution of a motion for reconsideration that was itself filed within 14 days of the original order.  See 870 F.\u00a03d, at 1177-1178, n.\u00a03 (collecting cases).  Although Lambert's own reconsideration motion was not filed until after the initial 14 days had run,6 he cites the lower courts' handling of such cases as evidence that Rule 23(f) is indeed amenable to tolling.  He further suggests that there is no basis for relaxing the 14-day limit in one situation but not the other.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lambert's argument relies on a mistaken premise.  A timely motion for reconsideration filed within a window to appeal does not toll anything; it \"renders an otherwise final decision of a district court not final\" for purposes of appeal.  United States v. Ibarra, 502 U.\u00a0S. 1, 6 (1991) (per curiam).  In other words, it affects the antecedent issue of when the 14-day limit begins to run, not the availability of tolling.  See id., at 4, n.\u00a02 (noting that this practice is not \"a matter of tolling\").7\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lambert devotes much of his merits brief to arguing the distinct question whether his Rule 23(f) petition was timely even without resort to tolling.  First, he argues that, even if his motion for reconsideration was not filed within 14 days of the decertification order, it was filed within the time allowed (either by the Federal Rules or by the District Court at the March 2 hearing).  The timeliness of that motion, Lambert contends,  \"cause[d] the time to appeal to run from the disposition of the reconsideration motion, not from the original order.\"  Brief for Respondent 8; see id., at 9-18.  Alternatively, he argues that the District Court's order denying reconsideration was itself \"an order granting or denying class-action certification\" under Rule 23(f\u00a0).  Id., at 8-9, 19-20.  The Court of Appeals did not rule on these alternative grounds, which are beyond the scope of the question presented.  Mindful of our role, we will not offer the first word.  See United States v. Stitt, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 9); Pacific Bell Telephone Co. v. linkLine Communications, Inc., 555 U.\u00a0S. 438, 457 (2009).  If the Court of Appeals concludes that these arguments have been preserved, it can address them in the first instance on remand.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The relevant Rules of Civil and Appellate Procedure clearly foreclose the flexible tolling approach on which the Court of Appeals relied to deem Lambert's petition timely.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0See Nucor Corp. v.

Those earlier statements did not necessarily signify that the rules at issue were formally \"jurisdictional\" as we use that term today.\nFootnote 4\u00a0Lambert's other textual arguments center on rules addressed to appeals as of right.  See Brief for Respondent 9-12, 17-18, 36-38 (discussing, e.g., Fed. Rules App. Proc. 3 and 4).  As noted above, Rules 5 and 26 specifically address petitions for permission to appeal from nonfinal orders such as the one at issue here.  Lambert's attempts to reason by implication from other, inapposite Rules therefore bear little weight.  See Manrique v. United States, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2017) (slip op., at 6-7).\nFootnote 5\u00a0Lambert also argues that interpreting Rule 23(f\u00a0) flexibly would be consistent with the Rules' generally equitable approach.  Brief for Respondent 21--27.  But that simply fails to engage with the dispositive point here: Any such background preference for flexibility has been overcome by the clear text of the relevant rules.  See, e.g., Young v. United States, 535 U.\u00a0S. 43, 49 (2002).\nFootnote 6\u00a0Lambert argues that his counsel's statements 10 days after the District Court's decertification order constituted an oral motion for reconsideration, but the transcript belies any such claim.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 71 (requesting only \"leave to file\"); id., at 74 (informing the District Court that Lambert \"will want to file\" a reconsideration motion).\nFootnote 7\u00a0We therefore have no occasion to address the effect of a motion for reconsideration filed within the 14-day window.  Moreover, because nothing the District Court did misled Lambert about the appeal filing deadline, see supra, at 1-2, we similarly have no occasion to address  the question whether his motion would be timely if that had occurred.  See Carlisle v. United States, 517 U.\u00a0S. 416, 428 (1996); id., at 435-436 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (discussing Thompson v. INS, 375 U.\u00a0S. 384, 386-387 (1964) (per curiam), and Harris Truck Lines, Inc. v. Cherry Meat Packers, Inc., 371 U.\u00a0S. 215, 216-217 (1962) (per curiam)).  We also have no occasion to address whether an insurmountable impediment to filing timely might compel a different result.  Cf. Fed. Rule App. Proc. 26(a)(3) (addressing computation of time when \"the clerk's office is inaccessible\").\n\n\n","47":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOBDUSKEY v. MCCARTHY &AMP; HOLTHUS LLP (2019)\nNo. 17-1307\nArgued: January 7, 2019Decided: March 20, 2019\n\n\nLaw firm McCarthy & Holthus LLP was hired to carry out a nonjudicial foreclosure on a Colorado home owned by petitioner Dennis Obduskey.  McCarthy sent Obduskey correspondence related to the foreclosure.  Obduskey responded with a letter invoking a federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA or Act) provision, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71692g(b), which provides that if a consumer disputes the amount of a debt, a \"debt collector\" must \"cease collection\" until it \"obtains verification of the debt\" and mails a copy to the debtor.  Instead, McCarthy initiated a nonjudicial foreclosure action.  Obduskey sued, alleging that McCarthy failed to comply with the FDCPA's verification procedure.  The District Court dismissed on the ground that McCarthy was not a \"debt collector\" within the meaning of the FDCPA, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\u00a0A business engaged in no more than nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings is not a \"debt collector\" under the FDCPA, except for the limited purpose of \u00a71692f(6).  Pp.\u00a06-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The FDCPA regulates \"'debt collector[s].'\"  \u00a71692a(6).  Relevant here, the definition of debt collector has two parts.  The Act first sets out the primary definition of the term \"debt collector\":  a \"\u00a0'debt collector,'\u00a0\" it says, is \"any person .\u00a0.\u00a0. in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts.\"  Ibid.  The Act then sets forth the limited-purpose definition, which states that \"[f]or the purpose of section 1692f(6) .\u00a0.\u00a0. [the] term [debt collector] also includes any person .\u00a0.\u00a0. in any business the principal purpose of which is the enforcement of security interests.\"  It is undisputed that McCarthy is, by virtue of its role enforcing security interests, at least subject to the specific prohibitions contained in \u00a71692f(6).  But only if McCarthy falls within the primary definition's scope do the Act's other provisions, including those at issue here, apply.  Pp.\u00a06-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Three considerations lead to the conclusion that McCarthy is not subject to the Act's main coverage.  First, and most decisive, is the text of the Act itself.  The limited purpose definition says that \"[f]or the purpose of section 1692f(6)\" a debt collector \"also includes\" a business, like McCarthy, \"the principal purpose of which is the enforcement of security interests.\"  \u00a71692a(6) (emphasis added).  This phrase, particularly the word \"also,\" strongly suggests that security-interest enforcers do not fall within the scope of the primary definition.  If they did, the limited purpose definition would be superfluous.  By contrast, under a reading that gives effect to every word of the limited-purpose definition, the FDCPA's debt-collector-related prohibitions (with the exception of \u00a71692f(6)) do not apply to those who, like McCarthy, are engaged in no more than security-interest enforcement.  Second, Congress may well have chosen to treat security-interest enforcement differently from ordinary debt collection in  order to avoid conflicts with state nonjudicial foreclosure schemes.  Third, this Court's reading is supported by legislative history, which suggests that the Act's present language was the product of a compromise between competing versions of the bill, one which would have totally excluded security-interest enforcement from the Act, and another which would have treated it like ordinary debt collection.  Pp.\u00a07-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Obduskey's counterarguments are unconvincing.  First, he suggests that the limited-purpose definition is not superfluous because it was meant to cover \"repo men\"--a category of security-interest enforcers who he says would not otherwise fall within the primary definition of \"debt collector.\"  The limited-purpose definition, however, speaks broadly of \"the enforcement of security interests,\" \u00a71692a(6), not \"the enforcement of security interests in personal property.\"  Second, Obduskey claims that the Act's venue provision, \u00a71692i(a), which covers legal actions brought by \"debt collectors\" to enforce interests in real property, only makes sense if those who enforce security interests in real property are debt collectors subject to all prohibitions and requirements that come with that designation.  The venue provision, however, does nothing to alter the definition of a debt collector.  Third, Obduskey argues that McCarthy engaged in more than security-interest enforcement by sending notices that any ordinary homeowner would understand as an attempt to collect a debt.  Here, however, the notices sent by McCarthy were antecedent steps required under state law to enforce a security interest, and the Act's (partial) exclusion of \"the enforcement of security interests\" must also exclude the legal means required to do so.  Finally, Obduskey fears that this Court's decision will permit creditors and their agents to engage in a host of abusive practices forbidden by the Act.  But the Court must enforce the statute that Congress enacted, and Congress is free expand the FDCPA's reach if it wishes.

This definition, however, goes on to say that \"[f]or the purpose of section 1692f(6)\" (a separate provision of the Act), \"[the] term [debt collector] also includes any person .\u00a0.\u00a0. in any business the principal purpose of which is the enforcement of security interests.\"\u00a0 Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question before us concerns this last sentence.  Does it mean that one principally involved in \"the enforcement of security interests\" is not a debt collector (except \"[f\u00a0]or the purpose of section 1692f(6)\")?  If so, numerous other provisions of the Act do not apply.  Or does it simply reinforce the fact that those principally involved in the enforcement of security interests are subject to \u00a71692f(6) in addition to the Act's other provisions?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In our view, the last sentence does (with its \u00a71692f(6) exception) place those whose \"principal purpose .\u00a0.\u00a0. is the enforcement of security interests\" outside the scope of the  primary \"debt collector\" definition, \u00a71692a(6), where the business is engaged in no more than the kind of security-interest enforcement at issue here--nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a person buys a home, he or she usually borrows money from a lending institution, such as a bank.  The resulting debt is backed up by a \"mortgage\"--a security interest in the property designed to protect the creditor's investment.  Restatement (Third) of Property: Mortgages \u00a71.1 (1996) (Restatement).  (In some States, this security interest is known as a \"deed of trust,\" though for present purposes the difference is immaterial.  See generally ibid.)  The loan likely requires the homeowner to make monthly payments.  And if the homeowner defaults, the mortgage entitles the creditor to pursue foreclosure, which is \"the process in which property securing a mortgage is sold to pay off the loan balance due.\"  2 B. Dunaway, Law of Distressed Real Estate \u00a715:1 (2018) (Dunaway).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every State provides some form of judicial foreclosure: a legal action initiated by a creditor in which a court supervises sale of the property and distribution of the proceeds.  Id., \u00a716:1.  These procedures offer various protections for homeowners, such as the right to notice and to protest the amount a creditor says is owed.  Id., \u00a7\u00a716:17, 16:20; Restatement \u00a78.2.  And in the event that the foreclosure sale does not yield the full amount due, a creditor pursuing a judicial foreclosure may sometimes obtain a deficiency judgment, that is, a judgment against the homeowner for the unpaid balance of a debt.  National Consumer Law Center (NCLC), Foreclosures and Mortgage Servicing \u00a7\u00a712.3.1-2 (5th ed. 2014).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About half the States also provide for what is known as nonjudicial foreclosure, where notice to the parties and sale of the property occur outside court supervision.  2 Dunaway \u00a717:1.  Under Colorado's form of nonjudicial foreclosure, at issue here, a creditor (or more likely its agent) must first mail the homeowner certain preliminary information, including the telephone number for the Colorado foreclosure hotline.  Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a738-38-102.5(2) (2018).  Thirty days later, the creditor may file a \"notice of election and demand\" with a state official called a \"public trustee.\"  \u00a738-38-101.  The public trustee records this notice and mails a copy, alongside other materials, to the homeowner.  \u00a7\u00a738-38-102, 38-38-103.  These materials give the homeowner information about the balance of the loan, the homeowner's right to cure the default, and the time and place of the foreclosure sale.  \u00a7\u00a738-38-101(4), 38-38-103.  Assuming the debtor does not cure the default or declare bankruptcy, the creditor may then seek an order from a state court authorizing the sale.  Colo. Rule Civ. Proc. 120 (2018); see Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a738-38-105.  (Given this measure of court involvement, Colorado's \"nonjudicial\" foreclosure process is something of a hybrid, though no party claims these features transform Colorado's nonjudicial scheme into a judicial one.)  In court, the homeowner may contest the creditor's right to sell the property, and a hearing will be held to determine whether the sale should go forward.  Colo. Rules Civ. Proc. 120(c), (d).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the court gives its approval, the public trustee may then sell the property at a public auction, though a homeowner may avoid a sale altogether by curing the default up until noon on the day before.  Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a738-38-110, 38-38-104(VI)(b).  If the sale goes forward and the house sells for more than the amount owed, any profits go first to lienholders and then to the homeowner.  \u00a738-38-111.  If the house sells for less than what is owed, the creditor cannot hold the homeowner liable for the balance due unless it files a separate action in court and obtains a deficiency judgment.  See \u00a738-38-106(6); Bank of America v. Kosovich, 878 P. 2d 65, 66 (Colo. App. 1994).  Other States likewise prevent creditors from obtaining deficiency judgments in nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings.  Restatement \u00a78.2.  And in some States, pursuing nonjudicial foreclosure bars or curtails a creditor's ability to obtain a deficiency judgment altogether.  NCLC, Foreclosures and Mortgage Servicing \u00a712.3.2.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2007, petitioner Dennis Obduskey bought a home in Colorado with a $329,940 loan secured by the property.  About two years later, Obduskey defaulted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2014, Wells Fargo Bank, N.\u00a0A., hired a law firm, McCarthy & Holthus LLP, the respondent here, to act as its agent in carrying out a nonjudicial foreclosure.  According to the complaint, McCarthy first mailed Obduskey a letter that said it had been \"instructed to commence foreclosure\" against the property, disclosed the amount outstanding on the loan, and identified the creditor, Wells Fargo.  App. 37-38; see id., at 23.  The letter purported to provide notice \"[p]ursuant to, and in compliance with,\" both the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and Colorado law.  Id., at 37.  (The parties seem not to dispute that this and other correspondence from McCarthy was required under state law.  Because that is a question of Colorado law not briefed by the parties before us nor passed on by the courts below, we proceed along the same assumption.)  Obduskey responded with a letter invoking \u00a71692g(b) of the FDCPA, which provides that if a consumer disputes the amount of a debt, a \"debt collector\" must \"cease collection\" until it \"obtains verification of the debt\" and mails a copy to the debtor.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet, Obduskey alleges, McCarthy neither ceased collecting on the debt nor provided verification.  App. 22-23.  Instead, the firm initiated a nonjudicial foreclosure action by filing a notice of election and demand with the county public trustee.  Ibid.; see id., at 39-41.  The notice stated the amount due and advised that the public trustee would \"sell [the] property for the purpose of paying the indebtedness.\"  Id., at 40.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Obduskey then filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that the firm had violated the FDCPA by, among other things, failing to comply with the verification procedure.  Id., at 29.  The District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that the law firm was not a \"debt collector\" within the meaning of the Act, so the relevant Act requirements did not apply.  Obduskey v. Wells Fargo, 2016 WL 4091174, *3 (D Colo., July 19, 2016).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the dismissal, concluding that the \"mere act of enforcing a security interest through a non-judicial foreclosure proceeding does not fall under\" the Act.  Obduskey v. Wells Fargo, 879 F.\u00a03d 1216, 1223 (2018).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Obduskey then petitioned for certiorari.  In light of different views among the Circuits about application of the FDCPA to nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings, we granted the petition.  Compare ibid. and Vien-Phuong Thi Ho v. ReconTrust Co., NA, 858 F.\u00a03d 568, 573 (CA9 2016) (holding that an entity whose only role is the enforcement of security interests is not a debt collector under the Act), with Kaymark v. Bank of America, N.\u00a0A., 783 F.\u00a03d 168, 179 (CA3 2015) (holding that such an entity is a debt collector for the purpose of all the Act's requirements), Glazer v. Chase Home Fin. LLC, 704 F.\u00a03d 453, 461 (CA6 2013) (same), and Wilson v. Draper & Goldberg, P.\u00a0L.\u00a0L.\u00a0C., 443 F.\u00a03d 373, 376 (CA4 2006) (same).\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The FDCPA's definitional section, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71692a, defines a \"debt\" as:\n\"any obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money arising out of a transaction in which the money, property, insurance, or services which are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\"  \u00a71692a(5) (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Act then sets out the definition of the term \"debt collector.\"  \u00a71692a(6).  The first sentence of the relevant paragraph, which we shall call the primary definition, says that the term \"debt collector\":\n\"means any person .\u00a0.\u00a0. in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or asserted to be owed or due another.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The third sentence, however, provides what we shall call the limited-purpose definition:\n\"For the purpose of section 1692f(6) [the] term [debt collector] also includes any person .\u00a0.\u00a0. in any business the principal purpose of which is the enforcement of security interests.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The subsection to which the limited-purpose definition refers, \u00a71692f(6), prohibits a \"debt collector\" from:\n\"Taking or threatening to take any nonjudicial action to effect dispossession or disablement of property if--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(A) there is no present right to possession of the property .\u00a0.\u00a0. ;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(B) there is no present intention to take possession of the property; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(C) the property is exempt by law from such dispossession or disablement.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rest of the Act imposes myriad other requirements on debt collectors.  For example, debt collectors may not use or threaten violence, or make repetitive annoying phone calls.  \u00a71692d.  Nor can debt collectors make false, deceptive, or misleading representations in connection with a debt, like misstating a debt's \"character, amount, or legal status.\"  \u00a71692e.  And, as we have mentioned, if a consumer disputes the amount of a debt, a debt collector must \"cease collection\" until it \"obtains verification of the debt\" and mails a copy to the debtor.  \u00a71692g(b).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No one here disputes that McCarthy is, by virtue of its role enforcing security interests, at least subject to the specific prohibitions contained in \u00a71692f(6).  The question is whether other provisions of the Act apply.  And they do if, but only if, McCarthy falls within the scope of the Act's primary definition of \"debt collector.\"\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Three considerations lead us to conclude that McCarthy is not subject to the main coverage of the Act.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, and most decisive, is the text of the Act itself.  As a preliminary matter, we concede that if the FDCPA contained only the primary definition, a business engaged in nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings would qualify as a debt collector for all purposes.  We have explained that a home loan is an obligation to pay money, and the purpose of a mortgage is to secure that obligation.  See supra, at 2.  Foreclosure, in turn, is \"the process in which property securing a mortgage is sold to pay off the loan balance due.\"  2 Dunaway \u00a715:1.  In other words, foreclosure is a means of collecting a debt.  And a business pursuing nonjudicial foreclosures would, under the capacious language of the Act's primary definition, be one that \"regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts.\"  \u00a71692a(6).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that, as McCarthy points out, nonjudicial foreclosure does not seek \"a payment of money from the debtor\" but rather from sale of the property itself.  Brief for Respondent 17 (emphasis added).  But nothing in the primary definition requires that payment on a debt come \"from a debtor.\"  The statute speaks simply of the \"collection of any debts .\u00a0.\u00a0. owed or due.\"  \u00a71692a(6).  Moreover, the provision sweeps in both \"direc[t]\" and \"indirec[t]\" debt collection.  Ibid.  So, even if nonjudicial foreclosure were not a direct attempt to collect a debt, because it aims to collect on a consumer's obligation by way of enforcing a security interest, it would be an indirect attempt to collect a debt.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Act does not, however, contain only the primary definition.  And the limited-purpose definition poses a serious, indeed an insurmountable, obstacle to subjecting McCarthy to the main coverage of the Act.  It says that \"[f]or the purpose of section 1692f(6)\" a debt collector \"also includes\" a business, like McCarthy, \"the principal purpose of which is the enforcement of security interests.\"  \u00a71692a(6) (emphasis added).  This phrase, particularly the word \"also,\" strongly suggests that one who does no more than enforce security interests does not fall within the scope of the general definition.  Otherwise why add this sentence at all?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is logically, but not practically, possible that Congress simply wanted to emphasize that the definition of \"debt collector\" includes those engaged in the enforcement of security interests.  But why then would Congress have used the word \"also\"?  And if security-interest enforcers are covered by the primary definition, why would Congress have needed to say anything special about \u00a71692f(6)?  After all, \u00a71692f(6), just like all the provisions applicable to debt collectors, would have already applied to those who enforce security interests.  The reference to \u00a71692f(6) would on this view be superfluous, and we \"generally presum[e] that statutes do not contain surplusage.\"  Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548 U.\u00a0S. 291, 299, n.\u00a01 (2006).  By contrast, giving effect to every word of the limited-purpose definition narrows the primary definition, so that the debt-collector-related prohibitions of the FDCPA (with the exception of \u00a71692f(6)) do not apply to those who, like McCarthy, are engaged in no more than security-interest enforcement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, we think Congress may well have chosen to treat security-interest enforcement differently from ordinary debt collection in order to avoid conflicts with state nonjudicial foreclosure schemes.  As Colorado's law makes clear, supra, at 3-4, state nonjudicial foreclosure laws provide various protections designed to prevent sharp collection practices and to protect homeowners, see 2 Dunaway \u00a717:1.  And some features of these laws are in tension with aspects of the Act.  For example, the FDCPA broadly limits debt collectors from communicating with third parties \"in connection with the collection of any debt.\"  \u00a71692c(b).  If this rule were applied to nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings, then advertising a foreclosure sale--an essential element of such schemes--might run afoul of the FDCPA.  Given that a core purpose of publicizing a sale is to attract bidders, ensure that the sale price is fair, and thereby protect the borrower from further liability, the result would hardly benefit debtors.  See 2 Dunaway \u00a717:4.  To be sure, it may be possible to resolve these conflicts without great harm to either the Act or state foreclosure schemes.  See Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U.\u00a0S. 291, 296-297 (1995) (observing that the FDCPA's protections may contain certain \"implici[t] exception[s]\").  But it is also possible, in light of the language it employed, that Congress wanted to avoid the risk of such conflicts altogether.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, for those of us who use legislative history to help interpret statutes, the history of the FDCPA supports our reading.  When drafting the bill, Congress considered a version that would have subjected security-interest enforcers to the full coverage of the Act.  That version defined a debt collector as \"any person who engages in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debt or enforcement of security interests.\"  S. 918, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7803(f\u00a0) (1977) (emphasis added).  A different version of the bill, however, would have totally excluded from the Act's coverage \"any person who enforces or attempts to enforce a security interest in real or personal property.\"  S. 1130, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7802(8)(E) (1977).  Given these conflicting proposals, the Act's present language has all the earmarks of a compromise: The prohibitions contained in \u00a71692f(6) will cover security-interest enforcers, while the other \"debt collector\" provisions of the Act will not.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These considerations convince us that, but for \u00a71692f(6), those who engage in only nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings are not debt collectors within the meaning of the Act.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Obduskey makes several arguments to the contrary.  But, on balance, we do not find them determinative.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, Obduskey acknowledges that unless the limited-purpose definition is superfluous, it must make some kind of security-interest enforcer a \"debt collector\" who would not otherwise fall within the primary definition.  Reply Brief 11-13.  But, according to Obduskey, \"repo men\"--those who seize automobiles and other personal property in response to nonpayment--fit the bill.  See Black's Law Dictionary 1493 (10th ed. 2014) (explaining that \"repo\" is short for \"repossession,\" which means \"retaking property; esp., a seller's retaking of goods sold on credit when the buyer has failed to pay for them\").  This is so, he says, because repossession often entails only \"limited communication\" with the debtor, as when the repo man sneaks up and \"tows a car in the middle of the night.\"  Brief for Petitioner 25-26, and n.\u00a013.  And because, according to Obduskey, the language of \u00a71692f(6), which forbids \"[t]aking or threatening to take any nonjudicial action to effect dispossession or disablement of property,\" applies more naturally to the seizure of personal property than to nonjudicial foreclosure.  (Emphasis added.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But we do not see why that is so.  The limited-purpose provision speaks broadly of \"the enforcement of security interests,\" \u00a71692a(6), not \"the enforcement of security interests in personal property\"; if Congress meant to cover only the repo man, it could have said so.  Moreover, Obduskey's theory fails to save the limited-purpose definition from superfluity.  As we have just discussed, supra, at 7-8, if the Act contained only the primary definition, enforcement of a security interest would at least be an indirect collection of a debt.  The same may well be true of repo activity, a form of security-interest enforcement, as the point of repossessing property that secures a debt is to collect some or all of the value of the defaulted debt.  And while Obduskey argues that the language of \u00a71692f(6) fits more comfortably with repossession of personal property than nonjudicial foreclosure, we think it at least plausible that \"threatening\" to foreclose on a consumer's home without having legal entitlement to do so is the kind of \"nonjudicial action\" without \"present right to possession\" prohibited by that section.  \u00a71692f(6)(A).  (We need not, however, here decide precisely what conduct runs afoul of \u00a71692f(6).)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are also unmoved by Obduskey's argument that repossession would not fall under the primary definition because it generally involves only limited communication with the debtor.  For one thing, while some of the FDCPA's substantive protections apply where there has been a \"communicat[ion]\" with a consumer, see, e.g., \u00a71692c, the primary definition of debt collector turns on the \"collection of .\u00a0.\u00a0. debts,\" without express reference to communication, \u00a71692a(6).  For another, while Obduskey imagines a silent repo man striking in the dead of night, state law often requires communication with a debtor during the repossession process, such as notifying a consumer of a sale.  NCLC, Repossessions \u00a710.4 (9th ed. 2017).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, Obduskey points to the Act's venue provision, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71692i(a), which states that \"[a]ny debt collector who brings any legal action on a debt against any consumer shall .\u00a0.\u00a0. in the case of an action to enforce an interest in real property securing the consumer's obligation, bring such action only in a judicial district\" where the \"property is located.\"  (Emphasis added.)  This provision, he says, makes clear that a person who judicially enforces a real-property-related security interest is a debt collector; hence, a person who nonjudicially enforces such an interest must also be a debt collector.  Indeed, he adds, this subsection \"only makes sense\" if those who enforce security interests in real property are debt collectors subject to all prohibitions and requirements that come with that designation.  Brief for Petitioner 21.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This argument, however, makes too much of too little.  To begin with, the venue section has no direct application in this case, for here we consider nonjudicial foreclosure.  And whether those who judicially enforce mortgages fall within the scope of the primary definition is a question we can leave for another day.  See 879 F.\u00a03d, at 1221-1222 (noting that the availability of a deficiency judgment is a potentially relevant distinction between judicial and nonjudicial foreclosures).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More to the point, the venue provision does nothing to alter the definition of a debt collector.  Rather, it applies whenever a \"debt collector\" brings a \"legal action .\u00a0.\u00a0. to enforce an interest in real property.\"  \u00a71692i(a)(1).  In other words, the provision anticipates that a debt collector can bring a judicial action respecting real property, but it nowhere says that an entity is a debt collector because it brings such an action.  Obduskey suggests that under our interpretation this provision will capture a null set.  We think not.  A business that qualifies as a debt collector based on other activities (say, because it \"regularly collects or attempts to collect\" unsecured credit card debts, \u00a71692a(6)) would have to comply with the venue provision if it also filed \"an action to enforce an interest in real property,\" \u00a71692i(a)(1).  Here, however, the only basis alleged for concluding that McCarthy is a debt collector under the Act is its role in nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, Obduskey argues that even if \"simply enforcing a security interest\" falls outside the primary definition, McCarthy engaged in more than security-interest enforcement by sending notices that any ordinary homeowner would understand as an attempt to collect a debt backed up by the threat of foreclosure.  Brief for Petitioner 15-16; see Reply Brief 13.  We do not doubt the gravity of a letter informing a homeowner that she may lose her home unless she pays her outstanding debts.  But here we assume that the notices sent by McCarthy were antecedent steps required under state law to enforce a security interest.  See supra, at 4.  Indeed, every nonjudicial foreclosure scheme of which we are aware involves notices to the homeowner.  See 2 Dunaway \u00a717:4 (describing state procedures concerning notice of sale).  And because he who wills the ends must will the necessary means, we think the Act's (partial) exclusion of \"the enforcement of security interests\" must also exclude the legal means required to do so.  This is not to suggest that pursuing nonjudicial foreclosure is a license to engage in abusive debt collection practices like repetitive nighttime phone calls; enforcing a security interest does not grant an actor blanket immunity from the Act.  But given that we here confront only steps required by state law, we need not consider what other conduct (related to, but not required for, enforcement of a security interest) might transform a security-interest enforcer into a debt collector subject to the main coverage of the Act.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, Obduskey fears that our decision will open a loophole, permitting creditors and their agents to engage in a host of abusive practices forbidden by the Act.  States, however, can and do guard against such practices, for example, by requiring notices, review by state officials such as the public trustee, and limited court supervision.  See supra, at 3-4, 9.  Congress may think these state protections adequate, or it may choose to expand the reach of the FDCPA.  Regardless, for the reasons we have given, we believe that the statute exempts entities engaged in no more than the \"enforcement of security interests\" from the lion's share of its prohibitions.  And we must enforce the statute that Congress enacted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\nAffirmed.\n\nSotomayor, J., concurring\n\u2002586 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1307\nDENNIS OBDUSKEY, PETITIONER v. McCARTHY & HOLTHUS LLP\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit\n[March 20, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor, concurring.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I join the Court's opinion, which makes a coherent whole of a thorny section of statutory text.  I write separately to make two observations: First, this is a close case, and today's opinion does not prevent Congress from clarifying this statute if we have gotten it wrong.  Second, as the Court makes clear, \"enforcing a security interest does not grant an actor blanket immunity from the\" mandates of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71692 et\u00a0seq.  See ante, at 13-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case turns on two sentences that, put together, read in relevant part:\n\"[1] The term 'debt collector' means any person .\u00a0.\u00a0. in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [2] For the purpose of section 1692f(6) of this title, such term also includes any person .\u00a0.\u00a0. in any business the principal purpose of which is the enforcement of security interests.\"  \u00a71692a(6).\nAs the Court recognizes, if the first sentence were the only text before us, nonjudicial foreclosure plainly would qualify as debt collection--after all, foreclosure itself \"is a means of collecting a debt,\" ante, at 7, whether \"directly or indirectly,\" \u00a71692a(6).  That may be because a house can be sold--thus satisfying the debt with the proceeds--but it may also be because the initiation of a foreclosure itself sends a clear message: \"[P]ay up or lose your house.\"  Brief for Petitioner 17; see Alaska Trustee, LLC v. Ambridge, 372 P.\u00a03d 207, 217-218 (Alaska 2016); Glazer v. Chase Home Finance LLC, 704 F.\u00a03d 453, 461 (CA6 2013).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The problem for Obduskey's reading, as the Court explains, is the second sentence, which then becomes superfluous if all security-interest enforcement is already covered by sentence one.  See ante, at 8-9.  To be clear, there is a reasonable argument that the second sentence covers security-interest enforcers who are not already covered by the first sentence: Under this argument, those additional security-interest enforcers are \"people who engage in the business of repossessing property, whose business does not primarily involve communicating with debtors in an effort to secure payment of debts,\" Piper v. Portnoff Law Assoc., Ltd., 396 F.\u00a03d 227, 236 (CA3 2005); see also Alaska Trustee, 372 P.\u00a03d, at 219-220; Glazer, 704 F.\u00a03d, at 463-464, such as \"the repo man [who] sneaks up and 'tows a car in the middle of the night,'\u00a0\" ante, at 11.  But, as the Court explains, that reading does not resolve the surplusage problem, because even such repossession agencies engage in a means of collecting debts \"indirectly\"--which means that they are similarly situated to entities pursuing nonjudicial foreclosures after all.  See ante, at 10-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All the same, this is too close a case for me to feel certain that Congress recognized that this complex statute would be interpreted the way that the Court does today.  While States do regulate nonjudicial foreclosures, see ante, at 9, the extent and method of those protections can vary widely, and the FDCPA was enacted not only \"to eliminate abusive debt collection practices\" but also \"to promote consistent State action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses,\" \u00a71692(e); see also \u00a71692n (pre-empting inconsistent state laws while exempting state consumer protections that are \"greater than the protection provided by [the FDCPA]\").  Today's opinion leaves Congress free to make clear that the FDCPA fully encompasses entities pursuing nonjudicial foreclosures and regulates security-interest enforcers like repossession agencies in only the more limited way addressed in \u00a71692f(6).  That too would be consistent with the FDCPA's broad, consumer-protective purposes.  See \u00a71692(e).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Separately, I note that the Court's opinion recognizes that the question before us involves \"no more than the kind of security interest enforcement at issue here,\" ante, at 2, which means an entity that takes \"only steps required by state law,\" ante, at 14.  The Court rightly notes, therefore, that nothing in today's opinion is \"to suggest that pursuing nonjudicial foreclosure is a license to engage in abusive debt collection practices like repetitive nighttime phone calls; enforcing a security interest does not grant an actor blanket immunity from the Act.\"  Ante, at 13-14.  Indeed, in addition to the unnecessary and abusive practices that the Court notes, I would see as a different case one in which the defendant went around frightening homeowners with the threat of foreclosure without showing any meaningful intention of ever actually following through.  There would be a question, in such a case, whether such an entity was in fact a \"business the principal purpose of which is the enforcement of security interests,\" see \u00a71692a(6), or whether it was simply using that label as a stalking horse for something else.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the Court rightly cabins its holding to the kinds of good-faith actions presented here and because we are bound to apply Congress' statutes as best we can understand them, I concur in the Court's opinion.\n\n\n\n","48":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPARKER DRILLING MANAGEMENT SERVICES, LTD. v. NEWTON(2019)\nNo. 18-389\nArgued: April 16, 2019Decided: June 10, 2019\n\n\nRespondent Brian Newton worked for petitioner Parker Drilling Management Services on drilling platforms off the California coast.  Newton was paid for his time on duty but not for his time on standby, during which he could not leave the platform.  Newton filed a class action in state court, alleging, as relevant here, that California's minimum-wage and overtime laws required Parker to compensate him for his standby time.  Parker removed the action to Federal District Court.  The parties agreed that Parker's platforms were subject to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), which provides that all law on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) is federal law, administered by federal officials; denies States any interest in or jurisdiction over the OCS; and deems the adjacent State's laws to be federal law only \"[t]o the extent that they are applicable and not inconsistent with\" other federal law, 43 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71333(a)(2)(A).  The District Court concluded that the state laws relevant here should not be applied as federal law on the OCS because the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), a comprehensive federal wage-and-hour scheme, left no significant gap in federal law for state law to fill.  It thus granted Parker judgment on the pleadings.  The Ninth Circuit vacated and remanded.  It held that state law is \"applicable\" under the OCSLA if it pertains to the subject matter at issue, a standard satisfied by California wage-and-hour laws.  It also held that those state laws were not \"inconsistent\" with federal law because they were not incompatible with the federal scheme.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0Where federal law addresses the relevant issue, state law is not adopted as surrogate federal law on the OCS.

Louisiana, 339 U.\u00a0S. 699, 705, Congress enacted the Submerged Lands Act, which ceded certain offshore lands to the coastal States, and passed the OCSLA, which affirmed the Federal Government's exclusive control over the OCS.  Pp.\u00a03-4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Newton argues that state law is \"applicable\" on the OCS whenever it pertains to the subject matter at issue and that it is \"inconsistent\" only if it would be pre-empted under ordinary pre-emption principles.  Parker counters that state law is not \"applicable\" absent a gap in federal law that needs to be filled and that state law can be \"inconsistent\" with federal law even if it is possible to satisfy both sets of laws.  Parker's approach is more persuasive.  This Court reads the statute's words \"\u00a0'in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.'\u00a0\"  Roberts v. Sea-Land Services, Inc., 566 U.\u00a0S. 93, 101.  The Court's pre-OCSLA decisions made clear that federal law controlled the OCS in every respect, and the OCSLA reaffirmed that role.  Taken together, the OCSLA's provisions convincingly show that state laws can be \"applicable and not inconsistent\" with federal law under \u00a71333(a)(2)(A) only if federal law does not address the relevant issue.  The OCSLA makes apparent \"that federal law is 'exclusive' .\u00a0.\u00a0. and that state law is adopted only as surrogate federal law.\"  Rodrigue v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 395 U.\u00a0S. 352, 357.  It borrows only certain state laws, which are then declared to be federal law and administered by federal officials.  It would thus make little sense to treat the OCS as a mere extension of the adjacent State, where state law applies unless it conflicts with federal law.  That type of pre-emption analysis applies only where overlapping, dual state and federal jurisdiction makes it necessary to decide which law takes precedence.  But federal law is the only law on the OCS and there is no overlapping state and federal jurisdiction, so the reference to \"not inconsistent\" state laws presents only the question whether federal law has already addressed the relevant issue.  If so, state law on the issue is inapplicable.  Pp.\u00a05-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0This interpretation is supported by several other considerations.

United States, 573 U.\u00a0S. 351, 358.

The OCSLA treats the OCS as \"an upland federal enclave.\"  Rodrigue,  supra, at 366.  Generally, when an area in a State becomes a federal enclave, \"only the [state] law in effect at the time of the transfer of jurisdiction continues in force\" as surrogate federal law, James Stewart & Co. v. Sadrakula, 309 U.\u00a0S. 94, 100, provided that the state law does not conflict with \"federal policy,\" Paul v. United States, 371 U.\u00a0S. 245, 269.  Going forward, state law presumptively does not apply to the enclave.  See Sadrakula, supra, at 100.  As originally enacted, the OCSLA both treated the OCS as a federal enclave and adopted only the \"applicable and not inconsistent\" laws of the adjacent State in effect as of the Act's effective date.  This suggests that, like the general enclave rule, the OCSLA sought to make all OCS law federal yet also \"provide a sufficiently detailed legal framework to govern life\" on the OCS.  Shell Oil Co. v. Iowa Dept. of Revenue, 488 U.\u00a0S. 19, 27.  Providing a sufficient legal structure to accomplish that purpose eliminated the need to adopt new state laws.  The OCSLA's text and context thus suggest that state law is not adopted to govern the OCS where federal law is on point.  The later amendment of the OCSLA to adopt state law on an ongoing basis confirms the connection between the OCSLA and the federal enclave model.

In Rodrigue, supra, at 352-353; Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U.\u00a0S. 97; and Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453 U.\u00a0S. 473, the Court viewed the OCSLA as adopting state law to fill in federal-law gaps.  Pp.\u00a011-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Under the proper standard, some of Newton's present claims can be resolved, though others have not been analyzed by the Ninth Circuit.  Some claims are premised on the adoption of California law requiring payment for all standby time.  Because federal law already addresses this issue, California law does not provide the rule of decision on the OCS.  To the extent Newton's OCS-based claims rely on that law, they necessarily fail.  Likewise, to the extent his OCS-based claims rely on the adoption of California's minimum wage, the FLSA already provides for a minimum wage, so the state minimum wage is not adopted as federal law and does not apply on the OCS.

Under the OCSLA, all law on the OCS is federal law, administered by federal officials.  The OCSLA denies States any interest in or jurisdiction over the OCS, and it deems the adjacent State's laws to be federal law \"[t]o the extent that they are applicable and not inconsistent with\" other federal law.  \u00a71333(a)(2)(A).  The question before us is how to determine which state laws meet this requirement and therefore should be adopted as federal law.  Applying familiar tools of statutory interpretation, we hold that where federal law addresses the relevant issue, state law is not adopted as surrogate federal law on the OCS.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent Brian Newton worked for petitioner Parker Drilling Management Services on drilling platforms off the coast of California.  Newton's 14-day shifts involved 12 hours per day on duty and 12 hours per day on standby, during which he could not leave the platform.  He was paid well above the California and federal minimum wages for his time on duty, but he was not paid for his standby time.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Newton filed a class action in California state court alleging violations of several California wage-and-hour laws and related state-law claims.  Among other things, Newton claimed that California's minimum-wage and overtime laws required Parker to compensate him for the time he spent on standby.  Parker removed the action to Federal District Court.  The parties agreed that Parker's platforms were subject to the OCSLA.  Their disagreement centered on whether the relevant California laws were \"applicable and not inconsistent\" with existing federal law and thus deemed to be the applicable federal law under the OCSLA.  \u00a71333(a)(2)(A).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court applied Fifth Circuit precedent providing that under the OCSLA, \"state law only applies to the extent it is necessary 'to fill a significant void or gap' in federal law.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 51 (quoting Continental Oil Co. v. London Steam-Ship Owners' Mut. Ins. Assn., 417 F.\u00a02d 1030, 1036 (1969)).  It determined that the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7201 et seq., constitutes a comprehensive federal wage-and-hour scheme and thus left no significant gap for state law to fill.  Because all of Newton's claims relied on state law, the court granted Parker judgment on the pleadings.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit vacated and remanded.  It first held that state law is \"\u00a0'applicable'\u00a0\" under the OCSLA whenever it \"pertain[s] to the subject matter at hand.\"  881 F.\u00a03d 1078, 1090, amended and reh'g en banc denied, 888 F.\u00a03d 1085 (2018).  The court found that California wage-and-hour laws satisfied this standard and turned to \"the determinative question in Newton's case\": \"whether California wage and hour laws are 'inconsistent with' existing federal law.\"  881 F.\u00a03d, at 1093.  According to the Ninth Circuit, state laws are \"inconsistent\" with federal law under the OCSLA only \"if they are mutually incompatible, incongruous, [or] inharmonious.\"  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Applying that standard, the court determined that no inconsistency exists between the FLSA and California wage-and-hour law because the FLSA saving clause \"explicitly permits more protective state wage and hour laws.\"  Id., at 1097 (citing 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7218(a)).  Given the disagreement between the Fifth and Ninth Circuits, we granted certiorari.  586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before the OCSLA, coastal States and the Federal Government disputed who had the right to lease submerged lands on the continental shelf.  Some coastal States even asserted jurisdiction all the way to the outer edge of the shelf.  See Shell Oil Co. v. Iowa Dept. of Revenue, 488 U.\u00a0S. 19, 26 (1988).  The disputes eventually reached this Court, which held in a series of decisions that the Federal Government has exclusive jurisdiction over the entire continental shelf.  See United States v. California, 332 U.\u00a0S. 19, 38-39 (1947); United States v. Louisiana, 339 U.\u00a0S. 699, 705 (1950); United States v. Texas, 339 U.\u00a0S. 707, 717-718 (1950).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After these decisions, Congress divided jurisdiction over the shelf.  In 1953, Congress enacted the Submerged Lands Act, 67 Stat. 29, 43 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71301 et seq., which ceded to the coastal States offshore lands within a specified distance of their coasts.  A few months later, Congress passed the OCSLA, which affirmed that the Federal Government exercised exclusive control over the OCS, defined as \"all submerged lands\" beyond the lands reserved to the States up to the edge of the United States' jurisdiction and control.  \u00a71331(a).  Specifically, the OCSLA declares that \"the subsoil and seabed of the [OCS] appertain to the United States and are subject to its jurisdiction, control, and power of disposition.\"  \u00a71332(1).  The OCSLA then sets forth \"detailed provisions for the exercise of exclusive jurisdiction in the area and for the leasing and development of the resources of the seabed.\"  United States v. Maine, 420 U.\u00a0S. 515, 527 (1975); see \u00a7\u00a71334-1354.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of primary relevance here, the OCSLA defines the body of law that governs the OCS.  First, in \u00a71333(a)(1), the OCSLA extends \"[t]he Constitution and laws and civil and political jurisdiction of the United States\" to the OCS.  Section 1333(a)(1) provides that federal law applies \"to the same extent as if the [OCS] were an area of exclusive Federal jurisdiction located within a State.\"  Then, \u00a71333(a)(2)(A) provides:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"To the extent that they are applicable and not inconsistent with this subchapter or with other Federal laws and regulations of the Secretary now in effect or hereafter adopted, the civil and criminal laws of each adjacent State, now in effect or hereafter adopted, amended, or repealed are declared to be the law of the United States for that portion of the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf, and artificial islands and fixed structures erected thereon, which would be within the area of the State if its boundaries were extended seaward to the outer margin of the outer Continental Shelf .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"\nSection 1333(a)(2)(A) also states that \"[a]ll of such applicable laws shall be administered and enforced by the appropriate officers and courts of the United States.\"  Finally, \u00a71333(a)(3) emphasizes that \"[t]he provisions of this section for adoption of State law as the law of the United States shall never be interpreted as a basis for claiming any interest in or jurisdiction on behalf of any State for any purpose over\" the OCS.\nIII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question in this case is how to interpret the OCSLA's command that state laws be adopted as federal law on the OCS \"[t]o the extent that they are applicable and not inconsistent\" with other federal law.  \u00a71333(a)(2)(A).  Echoing the Ninth Circuit, Newton argues that state law is \"applicable\" on the OCS whenever it pertains to the subject matter at issue.  Newton further argues that state law is only \"inconsistent\" with federal law if it is incompatible with the federal scheme.  In essence, Newton's argument is that state law is \"inconsistent\" only if it would be pre-empted under our ordinary pre-emption principles.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Parker, on the other hand, argues that state law is not \"applicable\" on the OCS in the absence of a gap in federal law that needs to be filled.  Moreover, Parker argues that state law can be \"inconsistent\" with federal law even if it is possible for a party to satisfy both sets of laws.  Specifically, Parker contends that, although the FLSA normally accommodates more protective state wage-and-hour laws, such laws are inconsistent with the FLSA when adopting state law as surrogate federal law because federal law would then contain two different standards.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although this is a close question of statutory interpretation, on the whole we find Parker's approach more persuasive because \"\u00a0'the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.'\u00a0\"  Roberts v. Sea-Land Services, Inc., 566 U.\u00a0S. 93, 101 (2012).  That rule is particularly relevant here, as the terms \"applicable\" and \"not inconsistent\" are susceptible of interpretations that would deprive one term or the other of meaning.  If Newton is right that \"applicable\" merely means relevant to the subject matter, then the word adds nothing to the statute, for an irrelevant law would never be \"applicable\" in that sense.  Cf. Ransom v. FIA Card Services, N.\u00a0A., 562 U.\u00a0S. 61, 70 (2011) (declining to interpret the word \"applicable\" in such a way that Congress \"could have omitted the term .\u00a0.\u00a0. altogether\").  And if Parker is right that \"applicable\" means \"necessary to fill a gap in federal law,\" it is hard to imagine circumstances in which \"not inconsistent\" would add anything to the statute, for a state law would rarely be inconsistent with a federal law that leaves a gap that needs to be filled.  Moreover, when the OCSLA was enacted, the term \"inconsistent\" could mean either \"incompatible,\" as Newton contends, or merely \"inharmonious,\" as Parker argues.  Webster's New International Dictionary 1259 (2d ed. 1953); see also Funk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary 1245 (1957) (\"logically discrepant\" or \"disagreeing\" and \"discordant\"); The New Century Dictionary 811 (1953) (\"self-contradictory\" or \"at variance\"); 5 Oxford English Dictionary 173 (1933) (\"incongruous\" or \"not agreeing in substance, spirit, or form\").  In short, the two terms standing alone do not resolve the question before us.  Particularly given their indeterminacy in isolation, the terms should be read together and interpreted in light of the entire statute.  See Star Athletica, L.\u00a0L.\u00a0C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc., 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6) (\"\u00a0'[I]nterpretation of a phrase of uncertain reach is not confined to a single sentence when the text of the whole statute gives instruction as to its meaning'\u00a0\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our pre-OCSLA decisions made clear that the Federal Government controlled the OCS in every respect, and the OCSLA reaffirmed the central role of federal law on the OCS.  See supra, at 3-4.  As discussed, the OCSLA gives the Federal Government complete \"jurisdiction, control, and power of disposition\" over the OCS, while giving the States no \"interest in or jurisdiction\" over it.  \u00a7\u00a71332(1), 1333(a)(3).  The statute applies federal law to the OCS \"to the same extent as if the [OCS] were an area of exclusive Federal jurisdiction located within a State.\"  \u00a71333(a)(1).  Accordingly, the only law on the OCS is federal law, and state laws are adopted as federal law only \"[t]o the extent that they are applicable and not inconsistent with\" federal law.  \u00a71333(a)(2)(A).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taken together, these provisions convince us that state laws can be \"applicable and not inconsistent\" with federal law under \u00a71333(a)(2)(A) only if federal law does not address the relevant issue.  As we have said before, the OCSLA makes apparent \"that federal law is 'exclusive' in its regulation of [the OCS], and that state law is adopted only as surrogate federal law.\"  Rodrigue v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 395 U.\u00a0S. 352, 357 (1969).  The OCSLA extends all federal law to the OCS, and instead of also extending state law writ large, it borrows only certain state laws.  These laws, in turn, are declared to be federal law and are administered by federal officials.  Given the primacy of federal law on the OCS and the limited role of state law, it would make little sense to treat the OCS as a mere extension of the adjacent State, where state law applies unless it conflicts with federal law.  See PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, 564 U.\u00a0S. 604, 617-618 (2011).  That type of pre-emption analysis is applicable only where the overlapping, dual jurisdiction of the Federal and State Governments makes it necessary to decide which law takes precedence.  But the OCS is not, and never was, part of a State, so state law has never applied of its own force.  Because federal law is the only law on the OCS, and there has never been overlapping state and federal jurisdiction there, the statute's reference to \"not inconsistent\" state laws does not present the ordinary question in pre-emption cases--i.e., whether a conflict exists between federal and state law.  Instead, the question is whether federal law has already addressed the relevant issue; if so, state law addressing the same issue would necessarily be inconsistent with existing federal law and cannot be adopted as surrogate federal law.  Put another way, to the extent federal law applies to a particular issue, state law is inapplicable.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apart from \u00a71333(a)(2)'s place in the overall statutory scheme, several other considerations support our interpretation, which accords with the standard long applied by the Fifth Circuit, see Continental Oil, 417 F.\u00a02d, at 1036-1037.  First, if Newton were correct that the choice-of-law question on the OCS is the same as it would be in an adjacent State, much of the OCSLA would be unnecessary.  Second, our interpretation is consistent with the federal-enclave model--a model that the OCSLA expressly invokes--and the historical development of the statute.  And third, the Court's precedents have treated the OCSLA in accord with our interpretation.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Newton's interpretation, state law would apply unless pre-empted by federal law, meaning that the OCS would be treated essentially the same as the adjacent State.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 49.  But that interpretation would render much of the OCSLA unnecessary.  For example, the statute would not have needed to adopt state law as federal law or say that federal law applies on the OCS as if it \"were an area of exclusive Federal jurisdiction located within a State.\"  \u00a7\u00a71333(a)(1)-(2).  It could have simply defined which State's law applied on the OCS and given federal officials and courts the authority to enforce the law.  And the statute would not have needed to limit state laws on the OCS to those \"applicable and not inconsistent\" with federal law (as Newton understands those words), for irrelevant laws never apply and federal law is always \"supreme,\" U.\u00a0S. Const., Art.\u00a0VI, cl. 2.  Newton's interpretation deprives much of the statute of any import, violating the \"\u00a0'cardinal principle' of interpretation that courts 'must give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.'\u00a0\"  Loughrin v. United States, 573 U.\u00a0S. 351, 358 (2014).\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further support for our interpretation comes from the statute's treatment of the OCS as \"an area of exclusive Federal jurisdiction located within a State\"--i.e., as \"an upland federal enclave.\"  \u00a71333(a)(1); Rodrigue, supra, at 366.  It is a commonplace of statutory interpretation that \"Congress legislates against the backdrop of existing law.\"  McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.\u00a0S. 383, 398, n.\u00a03 (2013).  Generally, when an area in a State becomes a federal enclave, \"only the [state] law in effect at the time of the transfer of jurisdiction continues in force\" as surrogate federal law.  James Stewart & Co. v. Sadrakula, 309 U.\u00a0S. 94, 100 (1940).  Existing state law typically does not continue in force, however, to the extent it conflicts with \"federal policy.\"  Paul v. United States, 371 U.\u00a0S. 245, 269 (1963); see Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. McGlinn, 114 U.\u00a0S. 542, 547 (1885).  And going forward, state law presumptively does not apply to the enclave.  See Sadrakula, supra, at 100; see also Paul, supra, at 268; Pacific Coast Dairy, Inc. v. Department of Agriculture of Cal., 318 U.\u00a0S. 285, 294 (1943).  This approach ensures \"that no area however small will be without a developed legal system for private rights,\" while simultaneously retaining the primacy of federal law and requiring future statutory changes to be made by Congress.  Sadrakula, supra, at 100; United States v. Tax Comm'n of Miss., 412 U.\u00a0S. 363, 370, n.\u00a012 (1973).1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The original version of the OCSLA both treated the OCS as a federal enclave and adopted only the \"applicable and not inconsistent\" laws of the adjacent State that were in effect as of the effective date of the Act.  43 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71333(a)(2) (1970 ed.); see \u00a71333(a)(1) (1970 ed.) (deeming the OCS \"an area of exclusive Federal jurisdiction located within a State\").  This textual connection between the OCSLA and the federal enclave model suggests that, like the generally applicable enclave rule, the OCSLA sought to make all OCS law federal yet also \"provide a sufficiently detailed legal framework to govern life\" on the OCS.  Shell Oil, 488 U.\u00a0S., at 27.  Once that framework was established, federal law (including previously adopted state law) provided a sufficient legal structure to accomplish that purpose, eliminating the need to adopt new state laws.  The federal-state balance in a typical federal enclave is quite different than in a State, and that difference is all the more striking on the OCS, which was never under state control.  The text and context of the OCSLA therefore suggest that state law is not adopted to govern the OCS where federal law is on point.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although Congress later amended the OCSLA to adopt state law on an ongoing basis, this amendment only confirms the connection between the OCSLA and the federal enclave model.  Beginning in 1825, when \"federal statutory law punished only a few crimes committed on federal enclaves,\" Congress enacted several Assimilative Crimes Acts (ACAs) that \"borrow[ed] state law to fill gaps in the federal criminal law\" on enclaves.  Lewis v. United States, 523 U.\u00a0S. 155, 160 (1998); see 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a713(a) (criminalizing \"any act or omission which, although not made punishable by any enactment of Congress, would be punishable if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the\" relevant State or territory).  Mirroring the general enclave rule discussed above, the first ACA was limited to state laws in existence when the Act was passed.  United States v. Sharpnack, 355 U.\u00a0S. 286, 291 (1958).  Because of this limitation, the initial ACA \"gradually lost much of its effectiveness in maintaining current conformity with state criminal laws,\" and Congress eventually provided for the adoption of the state laws in effect at the time of the crime.  Id., at 291-292.  After this Court upheld this ongoing adoption of state criminal law against a nondelegation challenge, see id., at 294, Congress amended the OCSLA to borrow state laws \"\u00a0'in effect or hereafter adopted, amended, or repealed.'\u00a0\"  \u00a719(f), 88 Stat. 2146.  At the same time, Congress left unchanged the features of the OCSLA that we have emphasized above--i.e., that the only law on the OCS is federal, and that state law is adopted only when it is \"applicable and not inconsistent\" with existing federal law.  Thus, we do not understand the statutory amendment to alter our conclusion.  If anything, this history reinforces that the OCS should be treated as an exclusive federal enclave, not an extension of a State, and that the OCSLA, like the ACAs, does not adopt state law \"where there is no gap to fill.\"  Lewis, supra, at 163.\n3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, our interpretation accords with the Court's precedents construing the OCSLA.  We first interpreted the OCSLA's choice-of-law provision in Rodrigue v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., where we considered whether suits brought by the families of men killed on OCS drilling rigs could proceed under only the federal Death on the High Seas Act or also under state law.  395 U.\u00a0S., at 352-353.  We emphasized that under the OCSLA, the body of law applicable to the OCS \"was to be federal law of the United States, applying state law only as federal law and then only when not inconsistent with applicable federal law.\"  Id., at 355-356.  We explained that \"federal law, because of its limited function in a federal system, might be inadequate to cope with the full range of potential legal problems,\" and that the OCSLA \"supplemented gaps in the federal law with state law through the 'adoption of State law as the law of the United States.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 357 (quoting \u00a71333(a)(3)).  We reiterated that the statutory language makes it \"evident\" \"that federal law is 'exclusive'\u00a0\" on the OCS and that \"state law could be used to fill federal voids.\"  Id., at 357-358.  After concluding that the Death on the High Seas Act did not apply to accidents on the OCS and thus left a gap related to wrongful deaths, we held that state law provided the rule of decision.  We explained that \"the inapplicability of the [federal Act] removes any obstacle to the application of state law by incorporation as federal law through\" the OCSLA.  Id.,  at 366.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two years later, in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U.\u00a0S. 97 (1971), the Court again viewed the OCSLA as adopting state law to fill in federal-law gaps.  In Huson, the question was whether federal admiralty law or a state statute governed a tort action arising from an injury that occurred on the OCS.  Id., at 98-99.  Describing Rodrigue's analysis, we explained that where \"there exists a substantial 'gap' in federal law,\" \"state law remedies are not 'inconsistent' with applicable federal law.\"  404 U.\u00a0S., at 101. We highlighted that \"state law was needed\" as surrogate federal law because federal law alone did not provide \"\u00a0'a complete body of law,'\u00a0\" which is why \"Congress specified that a comprehensive body of state law should be adopted by the federal courts in the absence of existing federal law.\"  Id., at 103-104.  In other words, the OCSLA \"made clear provision for filling in the 'gaps' in federal law.\"  Id., at 104.  And because Congress had decided not to apply federal admiralty law on the OCS, leaving a gap on the relevant issue, we held that it was appropriate to \"absor[b]\" the state law as federal law.  Id., at 104, 109.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453 U.\u00a0S. 473 (1981), we once again emphasized that \"[a]ll law applicable to the [OCS] is federal law\" and that the \"OCSLA borrows the 'applicable and not inconsistent' laws of the adjacent States\" \"to fill the substantial 'gaps' in the coverage of federal law.\"  Id., at 480.  We noted that under the OCSLA, the Federal Government \"retain[ed] exclusive .\u00a0.\u00a0. control of the administration of the [OCS],\" and that state law is incorporated \"to fill gaps in federal law.\"  Id., at 479-480, n.\u00a07.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These precedents confirm our understanding of the OCSLA.  Although none decided the precise question before us, much of our prior discussion of the OCSLA would make little sense if the statute essentially treated the OCS as an extension of the adjacent State.  In Rodrigue, for example, there was no question that the state law at issue pertained to the subject matter or that the relevant federal law expressly preserved state laws regulating the same subject.  See 395 U.\u00a0S., at 355; 46 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7767 (1964 ed.).  Under Newton's interpretation, that should have ended the case.  Yet the Court instead analyzed at length whether the federal law extended to the OCS.  See 395 U.\u00a0S., at 359-366.  It would be odd for our decisions to focus so closely on the gap-filling role of state law under the OCSLA if, as Newton argues, the existence of a federal-law gap is irrelevant.  Our consistent understanding of the OCSLA remains: All law on the OCS is federal, and state law serves a supporting role, to be adopted only where there is a gap in federal law's  coverage.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, the standard we adopt today is supported by the statute's text, structure, and history, as well as our precedents.  Under that standard, if a federal law addresses the issue at hand, then state law is not adopted as federal law on the OCS.2\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying this standard, some of Newton's present claims are readily resolvable.  For instance, some of his claims are premised on the adoption of California law requiring payment for all time that Newton spent on standby.  See Mendiola v. CPS Security Solutions, Inc., 60 Cal. 4th 833, 842, 340 P.\u00a03d 355, 361 (2015); Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \u00a7510(a) (West 2011).  But federal law already addresses this issue.  See 29 CFR \u00a7785.23 (2018) (\"An employee who resides on his employer's premises on a permanent basis or for extended periods of time is not considered as working all the time he is on the premises\"); see also 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7207(a).  Therefore, this California law does not provide the rule of decision on the OCS, and to the extent Newton's OCS-based claims rely on that law, they necessarily fail.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Likewise, to the extent Newton's OCS-based claims rely on the adoption of the California minimum wage (currently $12), Cal. Lab. Code Ann. \u00a71182.12(b) (West Supp. 2019), the FLSA already provides for a minimum wage, 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7206(a)(1), so the California minimum wage does not apply.  Newton points out that the FLSA sets a minimum wage of \"not less than .\u00a0.\u00a0. $7.25 an hour,\" ibid. (emphasis added), and does not \"excuse noncompliance with any Federal or State law .\u00a0.\u00a0. establishing a [higher] minimum wage,\" \u00a7218.  But whatever the import of these provisions in an ordinary pre-emption case, they do not help Newton here, for the question under the OCSLA is whether federal law addresses the minimum wage on the OCS.  It does.  Therefore, the California minimum wage is not adopted as federal law and does not apply on the OCS.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Newton's other claims were not analyzed by the Court of Appeals, and the parties have provided little briefing on those claims.  Moreover, the Court of Appeals held that Newton should be given leave to amend his complaint.  Because we cannot finally resolve whether Parker was entitled to judgment on the pleadings, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0These general rules \"may be qualified in accordance with agreements reached by the respective governments.\"  Sadrakula, 309 U.\u00a0S., at 99; see also Paul, 371 U.\u00a0S., at 268 (\"[A] State may not legislate with respect to a federal enclave unless it reserved the right to do so when it gave its consent to the purchase by the United States\").\nFootnote 2\u00a0Of course, it is conceivable that state law might be \"inconsistent\" with federal law for purposes of \u00a71333(a)(2) even absent an on-point federal law.  For example, federal law might contain a deliberate gap, making state law inconsistent with the federal scheme.  Or, state law might be inconsistent with a federal law addressing a different issue.

In this case, the relevant Texas policy allows a Christian or Muslim inmate to have a state-employed Christian or Muslim religious adviser present either in the execution room or in the adjacent viewing room.  But inmates of other religious denominations--for example, Buddhist inmates such as Murphy--who want their religious adviser to be present can have the religious adviser present only in the viewing room and not in the execution room itself for their executions.  In my view, the Constitution prohibits such denominational discrimination.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In an equal-treatment case of this kind, the government ordinarily has its choice of remedy, so long as the remedy ensures equal treatment going forward.  See Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U.\u00a0S. 7, 17-18 (1975).  For this kind of claim, there would be at least two possible equal-treatment remedies available to the State going forward: (1) allow all inmates to have a religious adviser of their religion in the execution room; or (2) allow inmates to have a religious adviser, including any state-employed chaplain, only in the viewing room, not the execution room.  A State may choose a remedy in which it would allow religious advisers only into the viewing room and not the execution room because there are operational and security issues associated with an execution by lethal injection.  Things can go wrong and sometimes do go wrong in executions, as they can go wrong and sometimes do go wrong in medical procedures.  States therefore have a strong interest in tightly controlling access to an execution room in order to ensure that the execution occurs without any complications, distractions, or disruptions.  The solution to that concern would be to allow religious advisers only into the viewing room.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, the choice of remedy going forward is up to the State.

BRYAN COLLIER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENTOF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, et\u00a0al.\non application for stay\nNo. 18A985.\u2003Decided May 13, 2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Statement of Justice Kavanaugh, with whom The Chief Justice joins, respecting grant of application for stay.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of Justice Alito's opinion dissenting from the Court's March 28 order, I write to respectfully add two points.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. On March 28, the Court stayed Murphy's execution.  Murphy is Buddhist and wanted a Buddhist minister in the execution room.  Under Texas' policy at the time, inmates who were Christian or Muslim could have ministers of their religions in the execution room.  But inmates such as Murphy who were of other religions could have ministers of their religions only in the adjacent viewing room and not in the execution room.  That discriminatory state policy violated the Constitution's guarantee of religious equality.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On April 2, five days after the Court granted a stay, Texas changed its unconstitutional policy, and it did so effective immediately.  Texas now allows all religious ministers only in the viewing room and not in the execution room.  The new policy solves the equal-treatment constitutional issue.  And because States have a compelling interest in controlling access to the execution room, as detailed in the affidavit of the director of the Texas Correctional Institutions Division and as indicated in the prior concurring opinion in this case, the new Texas policy likely passes muster under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 114 Stat. 803, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000cc et\u00a0seq., and the Free Exercise Clause.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Put simply, this Court's stay facilitated the prompt resolution of a significant religious equality problem with the State's execution protocol and should alleviate any future litigation delays or disruptions that otherwise might have occurred as a result of the State's prior discriminatory policy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. I greatly respect Justice Alito's position that the Court nonetheless should have denied Murphy's stay application as untimely, although I ultimately disagree.  In saying that the Court should have denied a stay in this case, Justice Alito points in part to the execution earlier this year of Domineque Ray in Alabama, where this Court did not approve a stay.  But several significant differences between the two cases demonstrate why a stay was warranted in Murphy's case but not in Ray's case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, unlike Murphy, Ray did not raise an equal-treatment claim.  Ray raised an Establishment Clause claim to have the State's Christian chaplain removed from the execution room.  The State of Alabama then agreed to remove the Christian chaplain, thereby mooting that claim.  Notably, in the District Court, Ray expressly agreed that his Establishment Clause claim would be moot if the State removed the Christian chaplain from the execution room, as the State subsequently agreed to do.  Ray also raised a RLUIPA claim to have his Muslim religious minister in the execution room and not just in the viewing room.  As noted above, however, the State has a compelling interest in controlling access to the execution room, which means that an inmate likely cannot prevail on a RLUIPA or free exercise claim to have a religious minister in the execution room, as opposed to the viewing room.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, in granting Ray a stay, the Eleventh Circuit relied on an equal-treatment theory, on the idea that the State's policy discriminated against non-Christian inmates.  But Ray did not raise an equal-treatment argument in the District Court or the Eleventh Circuit.  The Eleventh Circuit came up with the equal-treatment argument on its own, as the State correctly pointed out when the case later came to this Court.  Amended Emergency Motion and Application to Vacate Stay of Execution in Dunn v. Ray, O.\u00a0T. 2018, No. 18A815, pp.\u00a010-11, 17.  Given that Ray did not raise an equal-treatment argument, the Eleventh Circuit's stay of Ray's execution on that basis was incorrect.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For present purposes, the bottom line is that Ray did not raise an equal-treatment claim.  Murphy did.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, in response to the Eleventh Circuit's stay in Ray's case, Alabama indicated to this Court that an equal-treatment problem, if there were one, would typically be remedied by removing ministers of all religions from the execution room (as Texas has now done).  Id., at 17.  That remedy would of course have done nothing for Ray, who wanted his religious minister in the execution room.  That presumably explains why Ray raised a RLUIPA claim, but did not raise an equal-treatment claim.  And that further explains why it was incorrect for the Eleventh Circuit to stay Ray's execution on the basis of an argument (the equal-treatment theory) that was not raised by Ray and that, even if successful, would not have afforded Ray the relief he sought of having his religious minister in the execution room.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, unlike Ray, Murphy made his request to the State of Texas a full month before his scheduled execution.  Yet the State never responded to Murphy's request to have any Buddhist minister in the execution room.  The timing of Murphy's request, when combined with the State's foot-dragging in response and the ease with which the State could have promptly responded and addressed this discrete issue, was relevant to the assessment of the equities for purposes of the stay.  See Hill v. McDonough, 547 U.\u00a0S. 573, 584 (2006).  As we have now seen, moreover, it took Texas only five days to change its discriminatory policy after a stay was granted.  Texas' prompt response in the wake of the stay further underscores that Murphy's request was made in plenty of time for Texas to fix its discriminatory policy before Murphy's scheduled execution.  Moreover, unlike Alabama in Ray's case, Texas did not indicate to this Court whether it would remedy any unconstitutional discrimination by allowing all ministers into the execution room or by keeping all ministers out.  (After this Court granted the stay, the State of Texas chose the latter option.)\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, this Court's stay in Murphy's case was appropriate, and the stay facilitated a prompt fix to the religious equality problem in Texas' execution protocol.  That said, both the facts and the religious equality claim in Murphy's case were highly unusual.  I fully agree with Justice Alito that counsel for inmates facing execution would be well advised to raise any potentially meritorious claims in a timely manner, as this Court has repeatedly emphasized.  See generally Gomez v. United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 503 U.\u00a0S. 653, 654 (1992) (per curiam).\n\nAlito, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nPATRICK HENRY MURPHY v. BRYAN COLLIER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, et\u00a0al.\non application for stay\nNo. 18A985.\u2003Decided May 13, 2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch join, dissenting from grant of application for stay.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Patrick H. Murphy, who was convicted and sentenced to death in 2003, was scheduled to be executed at 7 p.m. on March 28.  Murphy's attorneys waited until March 26 before filing this suit in Federal District Court.  The complaint they filed challenges a feature of the Texas execution protocol that has been in place and on the public record since 2012.  The complaint claims that the Texas protocol violates the First Amendment and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 114 Stat. 803, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000cc et\u00a0seq., insofar as it permits only a prison chaplain and not any outside cleric to be present in the room where executions are carried out.  Murphy is a Buddhist, and none of the more than 100 Texas prison chaplains is a Buddhist priest.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In carefully reasoned opinions based squarely on precedents of this Court, both the District Court and the Court of Appeals rejected Murphy's request for a stay of execution due to his dilatory litigation tactics, see 919 F.\u00a03d 913, 916 (CA5 2019); 2019 WL 1369001, *1 (SD Tex., Mar. 26, 2019).  Then, on the afternoon of March 28, only hours before his execution was scheduled to occur, Murphy asked this Court to block his execution.  And despite his inexcusable delay in raising his claims, the Court granted Murphy's request.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not agree with the decision of the Court when it was made.  Because inexcusably late stay applications present a recurring and important problem and because religious liberty claims like Murphy's may come before the Court in future cases, I write now to explain why, in my judgment, the Court's decision in this case was seriously wrong.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2000, while serving a 55-year sentence for aggravated sexual assault, Murphy and six other inmates executed a well-planned, coordinated, and violent escape from a Texas prison.  About two weeks later, on Christmas Eve, the group robbed a sporting goods store and killed Irving, Texas, police officer Aubrey Hawkins when he arrived at the scene.  The escapees shot Hawkins 11 times, dragged him from his vehicle, drove over him, and dragged his body for some distance.  Six of the seven were eventually captured, convicted of capital murder, and sentenced to death.  See Murphy v. Davis, 737 Fed. Appx. 693, 696-697 (CA5 2018); Murphy v. State, 2006 WL 1096924, *1, *4 (Tex. Crim. App., Apr. 26, 2006).  Murphy was convicted and sentenced in 2003, and his direct appeal ended in 2007.  Murphy v. Texas, 549 U.\u00a0S. 1119 (2007).  During the next 11 years, he unsuccessfully pursued postconviction relief in state and federal court.  See Murphy v. Davis, 737 Fed. Appx., at 695, 699, 709.  In November 2018, the State obtained a death warrant setting Murphy's execution for March 28, 2019.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By this time, Murphy had become a Pure Land Buddhist.  According to his papers, he converted nearly a decade ago and has been visited by a Buddhist priest, Rev. Hui-Yong Shih, for the past six years.1  In 2012, Texas made publicly available its policy regarding the presence of a member of the clergy in the room where an execution by lethal injection is carried out.  Under that policy, any of the prison system's chaplains, but no other cleric, may enter this room.  Texas has more than 100 chaplains, who are either employees of or under contract with the prison system.  These chaplains include Christians, Muslims, Jews, and practitioners of a Native American religion, but no Buddhist priest.  The inadequate record compiled in this case does not explain the reason for this omission.  It does not tell us how many Texas prisoners are Buddhists, whether any Texas prisoners ever requested a Buddhist chaplain, whether Texas made any effort to recruit such a chaplain, or whether any Buddhist priest is willing to do whatever is needed to serve as a chaplain.  Nor do we know anything about the vetting of potential chaplains, any general training that chaplains receive, and any special orientation provided to a chaplain who accompanies a prisoner during the process of execution.  And we also do not know what a chaplain is permitted to do during an execution or whether there are specific restrictions on movements or sounds that might interfere with the work of those carrying out an execution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On February 28, 2019, about three months after Murphy's execution date was set, his attorneys wrote to the general counsel of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and inquired whether Rev. Shih would be permitted to enter the execution room with their client, and on March 5, the department responded that only a chaplain is permitted in the room.  Two days later, Murphy's attorney responded and said that he believed Murphy would be satisfied with a Buddhist chaplain but that he assumed none of Texas's chaplains were Buddhists.  Texas did not respond and Murphy's attorneys never renewed their inquiry.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After receiving Texas's response, Murphy's attorneys waited 15 days--until March 20--before challenging this decision in state court.  The state court rejected the claim as untimely late in the evening of March 25, see In re Murphy, No. WR-63,549-02 (Tex. Crim. App., Mar. 26, 2019), p.\u00a03, and on March 26, Murphy's lawyers filed this lawsuit in federal court.  They asked the District Court to grant a stay of execution, but the District Court refused, citing the well-established rule that a stay of execution is an equitable remedy that should not be granted to an applicant who engages in inexcusably dilatory litigation tactics.  2019 WL 1369001, *1, *5.  On March 27, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit likewise refused to grant a stay, holding that the District Court had not abused its discretion in denying that relief.  See 919 F.\u00a03d, at 916.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On March 28, at about 1 p.m.--six hours before the scheduled time of Murphy's execution--his attorneys brought his religious liberty claims to this Court.  They filed, among other things, an application for a stay of execution pending the filing of a petition for a writ of certiorari.2  At about 4 p.m., Texas filed a response, and shortly after 9 p.m., more than two hours after the time scheduled for Murphy's execution, the Court issued an order staying Murphy's execution unless the State allowed Rev. Shih \"or a Buddhist reverend of the State's choosing\" to accompany Murphy during the execution.  Ante, p. ___.  Murphy's death warrant was set to expire at midnight on March 28, and Texas announced that Murphy's execution would not proceed.  Under Texas law, a new death warrant may be issued, but such a warrant may not set a date less than 90 days in the future.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 43.141(c) (Vernon 2018).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"[A] stay of execution is an equitable remedy.  It is not available as a matter of right, and equity must be sensitive to the State's strong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments without undue interference from the federal courts.\"  Hill v. McDonough, 547 U.\u00a0S. 573, 584 (2006).  An applicant for a stay of execution must satisfy all the traditional stay factors and therefore must show that there is \"a reasonable probability that four Justices will consider the issue sufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari,\" that there is \"a fair prospect that a majority of the Court will vote to reverse the judgment below,\" and, in a close case, that the equities favor the granting of relief.  Hollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U.\u00a0S. 183, 190 (2010) (per curiam).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A court must also apply \"a strong equitable presumption against the grant of a stay where a claim could have been brought at such a time as to allow consideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay.\"  Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.\u00a0S. 637, 650 (2004); see also Gomez v. United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 503 U.\u00a0S. 653, 654 (1992) (per curiam) (noting that the \"last-minute nature of an application\" or an applicant's \"attempt at manipulation\" of the judicial process may be grounds for denial of a stay).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, in granting a stay in this case, the Court must have concluded that there is a reasonable probability that we will grant review of the question whether the District Court abused its discretion in finding that Murphy's delay in raising his religious liberty claims disentitled him to the equitable remedy of a stay.  We do not generally grant review of such factbound questions.  See this Court's Rule 10.  But in death penalty matters, it appears, ordinary procedural rules do not apply, see Madison v. Alabama, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (Alito, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2).  And in light of the dissent in Dunn v. Ray, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019)--about which I will say more later--I do not contest the Court's prediction about the probability of certiorari (as opposed to its propriety).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The likelihood of review, however, is not enough to justify a stay, so the Court's decision must also mean that, in its view, there is a significant likelihood that Murphy will succeed in showing that the District Court abused its discretion.  And that I do contest.  It is established that \"[a] court may consider the last-minute nature of an application to stay execution in deciding whether to grant equitable relief,\" Gomez, supra, at 654, and the District Court's decision--and the Fifth Circuit's affirmance--cannot reasonably be thought to represent anything other than the careful and measured consideration of that matter.  It is particularly remarkable to conclude that the District Court abused its discretion by ruling exactly as we had less than two months earlier.  Compare 2019 WL 1369001, *3 (relying on Gomez to deny untimely stay application), with Dunn v. Ray, supra, at ___ (same).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By granting a stay in this case, the Court disregards the \"strong equitable presumption\" against the grant of such relief when the applicant unreasonably delayed in raising the underlying claims.  This presumption deserves greater respect because it serves many important interests.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, it honors a State's strong interest in the timely enforcement of valid judgments of its courts.  See In re Blodgett, 502 U.\u00a0S. 236, 239 (1992) (per curiam).  In this case, direct review of the judgment ended more than a decade ago.  Moreover, if a State is pressured to modify a rule adopted for security reasons, the State has a legitimate claim to be given sufficient time to consider whether acceptable modifications are possible.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, eleventh-hour stay requests can impair valid interests of the federal courts.  When courts do not have adequate time to consider a claim, the decisionmaking process may be compromised.  And last-minute applications may disrupt other important work.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, the hasty decisionmaking resulting from late applications may harm the interests of applicants with potentially meritorious claims.  Attorneys do not serve such clients well by unduly delaying the filing of claims that hold a real prospect of relief.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the cancellation of a scheduled execution only hours before (or even after) it is scheduled to take place may inflict further emotional trauma on the family and friends of the murder victim and the affected community.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, Murphy cannot overcome the presumption against last-minute applications.  As I will explain, see Part III, infra, his religious liberty claims are dependent on the resolution of fact-intensive questions that simply cannot be decided without adequate proceedings and findings at the trial level.  Those questions cannot be properly resolved in a matter of hours on a woefully deficient record.  But that is precisely what Murphy asked of the lower courts and this Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As of at least 2013, Murphy and his attorneys knew or had reason to know everything necessary to assert the claim that the First Amendment and RLUIPA entitled him to have Rev. Shih at his side during his execution.  By that date, Murphy had converted to Pure Land Buddhism, had begun to see Rev. Shih, and should have been aware of the Texas policy now at issue.  Had Murphy begun to pursue his claims at that time, they could have been properly adjudicated long ago.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if Murphy is not held responsible for failing to act in 2013 or shortly thereafter, he and his attorneys certainly should have been spurred to action when, in November of last year, his execution date was set.  Instead, his lawyers waited three months before writing to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.  How can that be justified?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, after receiving word on March 5 that Texas would adhere to its long-established policy, the attorneys waited three more weeks before filing suit.  While they blame Texas's failure to respond to their second e-mail for their delay, that is simply untenable.  If they could not act without further communication from Texas, why did they fail to follow up with the State?  Why did the attorneys decide they could file on March 20 in state court without further response from Texas but not before?  What justified that delay?  And why didn't the attorneys file in federal court at the same time?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the time they got around to filing in federal court, it was March 26, two days before the scheduled execution date.  And by the time they filed in this Court, the scheduled execution time and the time when the death warrant would expire were only hours away.  If the tactics of Murphy's attorneys in this case are not inexcusably dilatory, it is hard to know what the concept means.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court receives an application to stay virtually every execution; these applications are almost all filed on or shortly before the scheduled execution date; and in the great majority of cases, no good reason for the late filing is apparent.  By countenancing the dilatory litigation in this case, the Court, I fear, will encourage this damaging practice.3\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I strongly disagree with the decision to grant a stay in this case, I recognize that Murphy, like Ray, raises serious questions under both the First Amendment and RLUIPA.  Murphy argues, among other things, that Texas's policy of admitting only authorized chaplains illegally discriminates on the basis of religion.  That is the argument embraced by both the concurrence in this case and the dissent in Ray.  Both of those opinions seem to see this religious discrimination claim as one that is easily resolved under our Establishment Clause precedents, but that is simply not so.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both opinions invoke precedents involving the constitutional rights of persons who are not incarcerated, see Ray, 586 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2); ante, at 1, and there is no question that, if Murphy were not in prison, Texas could not tell him that the only cleric he could have at his side in the moments before death is one who is approved by the State.  But this Court's precedents hold that imprisonment necessarily imposes limitations on a prisoner's constitutional rights.  See Turner v. Safley, 482 U.\u00a0S. 78, 90 (1987); O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.\u00a0S. 342, 348-350 (1987).  Under those cases, it is not enough for a prisoner to assert a claim that would succeed in the outside world.  Instead, we must consider the following four factors: (1) whether a prison rule bears a \"valid, rational connection to a legitimate governmental interest\"; (2) \"whether alternative means are open to inmates to exercise the asserted right\"; (3) \"what impact an accommodation of the right would have on guards, inmates, and prison resources\"; and (4) \"whether there are ready alternatives to the regulation.\"  Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.\u00a0S. 126, 132 (2003) (quoting Turner, supra, at 89-91; internal quotation marks omitted).  Neither the Ray dissent nor the concurrence in this case even mentions these precedents.  Indeed, the Ray dissent is based on strict scrutiny, 586 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2), even though Turner specifically and emphatically rejected the use of that test in prisoner cases, 482 U.\u00a0S., at 89.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the flimsy record now before us, I would not presume to apply the Turner factors to Murphy's First Amendment claims, but there can be no doubt that Turner presents a serious obstacle.  Here, Texas argues that it must be able to regulate the members of the clergy who are allowed in the execution room in order to ensure that these individuals do not intentionally or unintentionally engage in any conduct that might interfere with an execution.  Murphy responds that Texas has failed to show that this is a real concern in his case because Rev. Shih has visited him in prison without incident and because Texas had sufficient time to do whatever additional vetting and training it thinks is needed.  But on the present record, we cannot tell whether this is true.  Visiting a living prisoner is not the same as watching from a short distance and chanting while a lethal injection is administered.  And Texas may have an interest that goes beyond interference with Murphy's execution, namely, that allowing members of the clergy and spiritual advisers other than official chaplains to enter the execution room would set an unworkable precedent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specifically, Texas may be concerned that if it admits any cleric other than an official chaplain, every prisoner will insist on the presence of whichever outside cleric he prefers.  Although the Court's order in this case permitted Texas to proceed with Murphy's execution if any Buddhist priest was allowed in the execution room, such a limited accommodation would not be acceptable in the outside world.  There, Texas surely could not successfully defend a policy of admitting to the side of a dying patient only a state-approved cleric.  Texas could not force a dying Baptist to settle for a Catholic priest; it could not tell an Orthodox Jew that only a Reform rabbi would be allowed at his side; it could not force a Shi'ite to accept a Sunni imam; and so forth.  I am aware of no single authoritative tally of the number of religions and denominations that exist in the United States, but the number is certainly very large.  And of course, even within a particular religion or denomination, all clerics are not fungible.  Moreover, I assume that, in the world outside prison walls, a State could not discriminate between clerics and any other person whose presence a dying patient might want at his side for spiritual or emotional support.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In permitting Murphy's execution to go forward provided that some Buddhist priest was allowed in the execution room, the Court may perhaps be understood to have concluded that a prison need not afford a prisoner facing execution the same array of choices that he would enjoy in the outside world.  But if that is the Court's reasoning, what it shows is that the prison setting justifies important adjustments in the rules that apply outside prison walls.  Determining just how far those adjustments may go is a sensitive question requiring an understanding of many factual questions that cannot be adequately decided on the thin record before us.4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So far, I have discussed the prospects of Murphy's Establishment Clause claim, but even if that claim cannot succeed, he might still prevail under RLUIPA, which was enacted by Congress to provide greater protection for religious liberty than do this Court's First Amendment precedents.  To prevail under RLUIPA, Murphy would have to show at the outset that excluding Rev. Shih would impose a substantial burden on his exercise of religion.  See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000cc-1(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have not addressed whether, under RLUIPA or its cousin, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 107 Stat. 1488, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000bb et\u00a0seq., which contains an identical threshold requirement, \u00a72000bb-1(b), there is a difference between a State's interference with a religious practice that is compelled and a religious practice that is merely preferred.  In past cases, we have assessed regulations that compel an activity that a practitioner's faith prohibits.  See, e.g., Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.\u00a0S. 682, 725-726 (2014); Holt v. Hobbs, 574 U.\u00a0S. 352 (2015).  And, while some Members of this Court have been reluctant to find that even a law compelling individuals to engage in conduct condemned by their faith imposes a substantial burden, see Hobby Lobby, 573 U.\u00a0S., at 758-760 (Ginsburg, J., joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., dissenting) (arguing that it is not a substantial burden to require Christian-owned businesses to facilitate the acquisition of abortifacients), a majority of this Court has held that it is not for us to determine the religious importance or rationality of the affected belief or practice.  See id., at 723-726.  Similarly, it may be that RLUIPA and RFRA do not allow a court to undertake for itself the determination of which religious practices are sufficiently mandatory or central to warrant protection, as both protect \"any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.\"  \u00a72000cc-5(7)(A) (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this does not answer what results when the State offers a prisoner an alternative practice that, in terms of religious significance, is indistinguishable from the prohibited practice.  Persons of many faiths may desire the support of a cleric in the moments before death, but not every religion would draw a distinction between a meeting with a clergyman shortly before death and one precisely at the moment of death.  Murphy's situation, however, may be different because he believes that he will be reborn in the Pure Land only if he succeeds in remaining focused on Buddha while dying and that the chants of a Buddhist priest will help him in this endeavor.  See Pet. for Prohibition in In re Murphy, No. 18-8615, pp. 12-17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I will assume for present purposes that a policy like Texas's imposes a substantial burden on any prisoner who seeks the presence of a cleric other than one of the official chaplains, but that does not necessarily mean that the prisoner's RLUIPA claim would prevail.  The State claims that its policy furthers its compelling interest in security and that the policy is narrowly tailored to serve that interest, see Brief in Opposition 20-23, 29, and in deciding whether its policy can be sustained on that basis, we would face unresolved factual questions that are similar to those discussed above.  The RLUIPA standard, \u00a72000cc-1(a)(2), to be sure, would be more favorable to the prisoner, but the nature of the underlying issues would be similar.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The claims raised by Murphy and Ray are important and may ultimately be held to have merit.  But they are not simple, and they require a careful consideration of the legitimate interests of both prisoners and prisons.  See Holt v. Hobbs, supra.  Prisoners should bring such claims well before their scheduled executions so that the courts can adjudicate them in the way that the claims require and deserve and so that States are afforded sufficient time to make any necessary modifications to their execution protocols.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, however, Murphy egregiously delayed in raising his claims.  By countenancing such tactics, the Court invites abuse.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, Murphy's stay application, like Ray's, should have been denied.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1*\u00a0Under all the circumstances of this case, I conclude that Murphy made his request to the State in a sufficiently timely manner, one month before the scheduled execution.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0See Pet. for Prohibition in In\u00a0re Murphy, No. 18-8615, pp.\u00a012-13.\nFootnote 2\u00a0They also filed a petition for a writ of prohibition and an application for a stay pending the consideration of that petition.\nFootnote 3 In my judgment, the tactics in this case are just as unjustified as those that led the Court to vacate a stay of execution a few weeks ago in Dunn v. Ray, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019).  In that case, Ray, a Muslim, objected to Alabama's refusal to allow an imam to be present in the execution room.  Ray filed suit in Federal District Court 10 days before his execution date.  The District Court refused to issue a stay of execution, holding, among other things, that the application was untimely, Ray v. Dunn, 2019 WL 418105, *1 (MD Ala., Feb. 1, 2019), but on February 6, the Eleventh Circuit granted a stay on the ground that Alabama's policy of allowing only its official chaplain, a Christian minister, to enter the execution room likely violated the Establishment Clause.  Ray v. Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections, 915 F.\u00a03d 689, 695-701, 703 (2019).  The State asked us to vacate this stay, and we did so based on Ray's delay in raising his religious liberty claims.  See Ray, 586 U.\u00a0S., at ___.  In both Ray and this case, the Court was presented at the last minute with claims that raised complicated issues that cannot be adequately decided with hasty briefing and an inadequate record.\nFootnote 4\u00a0I have discussed the constitutional claim set out in the concurrence in this case and in the Ray dissent, namely, an Establishment Clause claim based on discrimination among religions.  But Murphy also asserts Free Exercise Clause and RLUIPA claims, which, as he frames them, do not depend on disparate treatment of different religions or denominations.  If States respond to the decision on Murphy's stay application by banning all clerics from the execution room, that may obviate any conflict with the Establishment Clause, but a prisoner might still press free exercise claims.  A claim under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment would have to contend with both Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U.\u00a0S. 872 (1990), and Turner.  Under RLUIPA, such a claim would present issues similar to those discussed below.  See infra, at 12-13.\n\n\n","51":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPDR NETWORK, LLC, ET AL. v. CARLTON &AMP; HARRIS CHIROPRACTIC, INC.(2019)\nNo. 17-1705\nArgued: March 25, 2019Decided: June 20, 2019\n\n\nPetitioners (collectively PDR) produce the Physicians' Desk Reference, which compiles information about the uses and side effects of various prescription drugs.  PDR sent health care providers faxes stating that they could reserve a free copy of a new e-book version of the Reference on PDR's website.  Respondent Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, a fax recipient, brought a putative class action in Federal District Court, claiming that PDR's fax was an \"unsolicited advertisement\" prohibited by the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (Telephone Act).  47 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7227(b)(1)(C).  The District Court dismissed the case, concluding that PDR's fax was not an \"unsolicited advertisement\" under the Telephone Act.  The Fourth Circuit vacated the District Court's judgment.  Based on the Administrative Orders Review Act (Hobbs Act), which provides that courts of appeals have \"exclusive jurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in part), or to determine the validity of\" certain \"final orders of the Federal Communication Commission,\" 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72342(1), the Court of Appeals held that the District Court was required to adopt the interpretation of \"unsolicited advertisement\" set forth in a 2006 FCC Order.  Because the Court of Appeals found that the 2006 Order interpreted the term \"unsolicited advertisement\" to \"include any offer of a free good or service,\" the Court of Appeals concluded that the facts as alleged demonstrated that PDR's fax was an unsolicited advertisement.  883 F. 3d 459, 467.\nHeld:\u00a0The extent to which the 2006 FCC Order binds the lower courts may depend on the resolution of two preliminary sets of questions that were not aired before the Court of Appeals.  First, is the Order the equivalent of a \"legislative rule,\" which is \"\u00a0'issued by an agency pursuant to statutory authority'\u00a0\" and has the \"\u00a0'force and effect of law'\u00a0\"?  Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.\u00a0S. 281, 302-303.  Or is it the equivalent of an \"interpretive rule,\" which simply \"\u00a0'advis[es] the public of the agency's construction of the statutes and rules which it administers'\u00a0\" and lacks \"\u00a0'the force and effect of law'\u00a0\"?  Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.\u00a0S. 92, ___.  If the Order is the equivalent of an \"interpretive rule,\" it may not be binding on a district court, and a district court therefore may not be required to adhere to it.  Second, did PDR have a \"prior\" and \"adequate\" opportunity to seek judicial review of the Order?  5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7703.  If the Hobbs Act's exclusive-review provision, which requires certain challenges to FCC orders to be brought in a court of appeals \"within 60 days after\" the entry of the order in question, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72344, did not afford PDR a \"prior\" and \"adequate\" opportunity for judicial review, it may be that the Administrative Procedure Act permits PDR to challenge the Order's validity in this enforcement proceeding.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for that court to consider these preliminary issues, as well as any other related issues that may arise in the course of resolving this case.

CARLTON & HARRIS CHIROPRACTIC, INC.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit\n[June 20, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case concerns two federal statutes, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (Telephone Act) and the Administrative Orders Review Act (Hobbs Act).  The first statute generally makes it unlawful for any person to send an \"unsolicited advertisement\" by fax.  47 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7227(b)(1)(C).  The second statute provides that the federal courts of appeals have \"exclusive jurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in part), or to determine the validity of\" certain \"final orders of the Federal Communication Commission.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72342(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2006, the FCC issued an Order stating that the term \"unsolicited advertisement\" in the Telephone Act includes certain faxes that \"promote goods or services even at no cost,\" including \"free magazine subscriptions\" and \"catalogs.\"  21 FCC Rcd. 3787, 3814.  The question here is whether the Hobbs Act's vesting of \"exclusive jurisdiction\" in the courts of appeals to \"enjoin, set aside, suspend,\" or \"determine the validity\" of FCC \"final orders\" means that a district court must adopt, and consequently follow, the FCC's Order interpreting the term \"unsolicited advertisement\" as including certain faxes that promote \"free\" goods.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have found it difficult to answer this question, for the answer may depend upon the resolution of two preliminary issues.  We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case so that the Court of Appeals can consider these preliminary issues.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners (PDR Network, PDR Distribution, and PDR Equity, collectively referred to here as PDR) produce the Physicians' Desk Reference, a publication that compiles information about the uses and side effects of various prescription drugs.  PDR makes money by charging pharmaceutical companies that wish to include their drugs in the Reference, and it distributes the Reference to health care providers for free.  In 2013, PDR announced that it would publish a new e-book version of the Reference.  It advertised the e-book to health care providers by sending faxes stating that providers could reserve a free copy on PDR's website.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of the fax recipients was respondent Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, a health care practice in West Virginia.  It brought this putative class action against PDR in Federal District Court, claiming that PDR's fax violated the Telephone Act.  Carlton & Harris sought statutory damages on behalf of itself and other members of the class.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to Carlton & Harris, PDR's fax was an \"unsolicited advertisement\" prohibited by the Telephone Act.  47 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7227(b)(1)(C).  The Act defines \"unsolicited advertisement\" as \"any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property, goods, or services which is transmitted to any person without that person's prior express invitation or permission.\"  \u00a7227(a)(5).  This provision says nothing about goods offered for free, but it does give the FCC authority to \"prescribe regulations to implement\" the statute.  \u00a7227(b)(2).  And, as we have said, the FCC's 2006 Order provides that fax messages that\n\"promote goods or services even at no cost, such as free magazine subscriptions, catalogs, or free consultations or seminars, are unsolicited advertisements under the [Telephone Act's] definition. .\u00a0.\u00a0. '[F]ree' publications are often part of an overall marketing campaign to sell property, goods, or services.\"  21 FCC Rcd., at 3814.\nThe Order also indicates, however, that faxes \"that contain only information, such as industry news articles, legislative updates, or employee benefit information, would not be prohibited.\"  Ibid.  The Order then sets forth \"factors\" the FCC \"will consider\" when determining whether \"an informational communication\" that contains advertising material is an \"unsolicited advertisement.\"  Id., at 3814, n. 187.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court found in PDR's favor and dismissed the case.  It concluded that PDR's fax was not an \"unsolicited advertisement\" under the Telephone Act.  2016 WL 5799301 (SD W. Va., Sept. 30, 2016).  The court did recognize that the FCC's Order might be read to indicate the contrary.  Id., at *3. And it also recognized that the Hobbs Act gives appellate courts, not district courts, \"exclusive jurisdiction\" to \"determine the validity of\" certain FCC \"final orders.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72342(1).  Nonetheless, the District Court concluded that neither party had challenged the Order's validity.  2016 WL 5799301, *3. And it held that even if the Order is presumed valid, a district court is not bound to follow the FCC interpretation announced in the Order.  Id., at *4.  In any event, the District Court also noted that a \"careful reading\" of the Order showed that PDR's fax was not an \"unsolicited advertisement\" even under the FCC's interpretation of that term.  Ibid. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Carlton & Harris appealed to the Fourth Circuit, which vacated the District Court's judgment.  883 F. 3d 459 (2018).  The Court of Appeals held that \"the jurisdictional command\" of the Hobbs Act--that is, the word \"exclusive\"--\"requires a district court to apply FCC interpretations\" of the Telephone Act.  Id., at 466.  Thus, the District Court should have adopted the interpretation of \"unsolicited advertisement\" set forth in the 2006 Order.  Ibid.  And because the Order interpreted the term \"advertisement\" to \"include any offer of a free good or service,\" id., at 467, the facts as alleged demonstrated that PDR's fax was an unsolicited advertisement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PDR filed a petition for certiorari.  We granted certiorari to consider \"[w]hether the Hobbs Act required the district court in this case to accept the FCC's legal interpretation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.\"  586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Hobbs Act says that an appropriate court of appeals has \"exclusive jurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in part), or to determine the validity of . . . final orders of the Federal Communication Commission made reviewable by section 402(a) of title 47.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72342(1); see 47 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7402(a) (making reviewable certain \"orde[rs] of the Commission under\" the Communications Act, of which the Telephone Act is part).  It further provides that \"[a]ny party aggrieved\" may bring such a challenge in the court of appeals \"within 60 days after\" the entry of the FCC order in question.  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72344.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, we are asked to decide whether the Hobbs Act's commitment of \"exclusive jurisdiction\" to the courts of appeals requires a district court in a private enforcement suit like this one to follow the FCC's 2006 Order interpreting the Telephone Act.  The parties in this case did not dispute below that the Order is a \"final order\" that falls within the scope of the Hobbs Act.  883 F. 3d, at 464, n. 1.  And we assume without deciding that the Order is such a \"final order.\"  Even so, the extent to which the Order binds the lower courts may depend on the resolution of two preliminary sets of questions that were not aired before the Court of Appeals.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, what is the legal nature of the 2006 FCC Order?  In particular, is it the equivalent of a \"legislative rule,\" which is \"\u00a0'issued by an agency pursuant to statutory authority'\u00a0\" and has the \"\u00a0'force and effect of law'\u00a0\"?  Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.\u00a0S. 281, 302-303 (1979) (quoting Batterton v. Francis, 432 U.\u00a0S. 416, 425, n. 9 (1977)).  Or is it instead the equivalent of an \"interpretive rule,\" which simply \"\u00a0'advis[es] the public of the agency's construction of the statutes and rules which it administers'\u00a0\" and lacks \"\u00a0'the force and effect of law'\u00a0\"?  Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.\u00a0S. 92, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 3) (quoting Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital, 514 U.\u00a0S. 87, 99 (1995)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the relevant portion of the 2006 Order is the equivalent of an \"interpretive rule,\" it may not be binding on a district court, and a district court therefore may not be required to adhere to it.  That may be so regardless of whether a court of appeals could have \"determin[ed]\" during the 60-day review period that the Order is \"vali[d]\" and consequently could have decided not to \"enjoin, set aside, [or] suspend\" it.  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72342.  And that may be so no matter what degree of weight the district court ultimately gives the FCC's interpretation of the statute under Chevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.\u00a0S. 837 (1984).  We say \"may\" because we do not definitively resolve these issues here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, and in any event, did PDR have a \"prior\" and \"adequate\" opportunity to seek judicial review of the Order?  5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7703.  The Administrative Procedure Act provides that \"agency action is subject to judicial review in civil or criminal proceedings for judicial enforcement\" except \"to the extent that [a] prior, adequate, and exclusive opportunity for judicial review is provided by law.\"  Ibid. (emphasis added).  We believe it important to determine whether the Hobbs Act's exclusive-review provision, which requires certain challenges to FCC final orders to be brought in a court of appeals \"within 60 days after\" the entry of the order in question, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72344, afforded PDR a \"prior\" and \"adequate\" opportunity for judicial review of the Order.  If the answer is \"no,\" it may be that the Administrative Procedure Act permits PDR to challenge the validity of the Order in this enforcement proceeding even if the Order is deemed a \"legislative\" rule rather than an \"interpretive\" rule.  We again say \"may\" because we do not definitively decide this issue here.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we have said many times before, we are a court of \"review,\" not of \"first view.\"  Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.\u00a0S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005).  Because the Court of Appeals has not yet addressed the preliminary issues we have described, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case so that the Court of Appeals may consider these preliminary issues, as well as any other related issues that may arise in the course of resolving this case.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nThomas, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002588 U. S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1705\nPDR NETWORK, LLC, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v. CARLTON & HARRIS CHIROPRACTIC, INC.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit\n[June 20, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, concurring in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons explained by Justice Kavanaugh, the Court of Appeals misinterpreted the Hobbs Act.  I write separately to address a more fundamental problem with that court's holding: It rests on a mistaken--and possibly unconstitutional--understanding of the relationship between federal statutes and the agency orders interpreting them.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The opinion below assumes that an executive agency's interpretation of a statute it administers serves as an authoritative gloss on the statutory text unless timely challenged.  But for that assumption, the Hobbs Act would have no role to play in this case.  This suit is a dispute between private parties, and petitioners did not ask the District Court to \"enjoin, set aside, suspend,\" or \"determine the validity of\" any order of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72342(1).  Indeed, they did not even initiate this suit.  They simply argued that the fax at issue here was not an \"unsolicited advertisement\" and thus did not violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA), as respondent contended.  See 47 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7227(a)(5), (b)(1)(C).  The District Court agreed, but the Fourth Circuit reversed, explaining that the FCC had adopted an order interpreting the term \"unsolicited advertisement\" and that, under the Hobbs Act, only the Courts of Appeals had jurisdiction to \"determine the validity of\" such orders.  \u00a72342; see 883 F.\u00a03d 459, 464 (2018).  According to the decision below, the Hobbs Act \"precluded the district court from even reaching\" the question of the TCPA's meaning because \"a district court simply cannot reach [that] question without 'rubbing up against the Hobbs Act's jurisdictional bar.'\u00a0\"  Ibid. (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As Justice Kavanaugh explains, the Fourth Circuit was incorrect.  Interpreting a statute does not \"determine the validity\" of an agency order interpreting or implementing the statute.  See post, at 11-13 (opinion concurring in judgment).1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A contrary view would arguably render the Hobbs Act unconstitutional.  If the Act truly \"precluded the district court from even reaching\" the text of the TCPA and instead required courts to treat \"FCC interpretations of the TCPA\" as authoritative, 883 F.\u00a03d, at 464, then the Act would trench upon Article III's vesting of the \"judicial Power\" in the courts.  As I have explained elsewhere, \"the judicial power, as originally understood, requires a court to exercise its independent judgment in interpreting and expounding upon the laws.\"  Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.\u00a0S. 92, ___ (2015) (opinion concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 8).  That duty necessarily entails identifying and applying the governing law.  Insofar as the Hobbs Act purports to prevent courts from applying the governing statute to a case or controversy within its jurisdiction, the Act conflicts with the \"province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\"  Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803).  And to the extent the Hobbs Act requires courts to \"give the 'force of law' to agency pronouncements on matters of private conduct\" without regard to the text of the governing statute, the Act would be unconstitutional for the additional reason that it would \"permit a body other than Congress\" to exercise the legislative power, in violation of Article I.  Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3).  At a minimum, our constitutional-avoidance precedents would militate against the Fourth Circuit's view of the Hobbs Act.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decision below rested on the assumption that Congress can constitutionally require federal courts to treat agency orders as controlling law, without regard to the text of the governing statute.  A similar assumption underlies our precedents requiring judicial deference to certain agency interpretations.  See Chevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.\u00a0S. 837 (1984).  This case proves the error of that assumption and emphasizes the need to reconsider it.\n\nKavanaugh, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002588 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1705\nPDR NETWORK, LLC, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v. CARLTON & HARRIS CHIROPRACTIC, INC.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit\n[June 20, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kavanaugh, with whom Justice Thomas, Justice Alito, and Justice Gorsuch join, concurring in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0May defendants in civil enforcement actions under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act contest the Federal Communications Commission's interpretation of the Act?  The Fourth Circuit concluded that the answer is no, meaning that a district court in an enforcement action is required to adhere to the FCC's interpretation of the Act, no matter how wrong the FCC's interpretation might be.  I disagree with the Fourth Circuit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, prohibits unsolicited commercial faxes.  The TCPA creates a private right of action so that the recipients of unsolicited commercial faxes can sue the senders.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Plaintiff Carlton sued PDR in Federal District Court, claiming that PDR sent an unsolicited commercial fax to Carlton in violation of the TCPA.  In pursuing its TCPA claim, Carlton relied on the FCC's interpretation of the TCPA.  In 2006, the FCC had opined that the TCPA proscribes unsolicited faxes that promote goods and services, even at no cost.  In this litigation, PDR argued that the FCC's \"even at no cost\" interpretation is wrong (at least if taken literally) and that the District Court therefore should not follow the FCC's interpretation when interpreting the TCPA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Hobbs Act provides for facial, pre-enforcement review of FCC orders.  To obtain such review, a party must file a petition for review in a court of appeals within 60 days of the entry of the order, a period that expired back in 2006 for this FCC order.  In Carlton's view, which is supported here by the Federal Government, the Hobbs Act's provision for facial, pre-enforcement review implicitly bars district courts from reviewing agency interpretations in subsequent enforcement actions.  According to Carlton, PDR therefore may not argue in this enforcement action that the FCC's interpretation of the TCPA is incorrect.  The Fourth Circuit agreed with Carlton.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to decide whether the Hobbs Act required the District Court in this case to accept the FCC's legal interpretation of the TCPA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ruling narrowly, the Court does not answer the question presented.  The Court instead vacates the judgment of the Fourth Circuit and remands the case for analysis of two \"preliminary issues,\" which, depending on how they are resolved, could eliminate the need for an answer in this case to the broader question we granted certiorari to decide.  Ante, at 6.  Under the Court's holding, if the court on remand concludes that the FCC's order was an interpretive rule (as opposed to a legislative rule) and not subject to the Hobbs Act in the first place, then PDR will be able to argue to the District Court that the FCC's interpretation of the TCPA is wrong.  Or if the court on remand concludes that the opportunity back in 2006 for pre-enforcement review in a court of appeals was not \"adequate\" for PDR to obtain judicial review, then PDR likewise will be able to argue to the District Court that the FCC's interpretation of the TCPA is wrong.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the court on remand does not reach either of those two conclusions, however, then that court will have to tackle the question that we granted certiorari to decide.  I agree with the Court that we should vacate the judgment of the Fourth Circuit, but I would decide the question that we granted certiorari to decide.  I would conclude that the Hobbs Act does not bar a defendant in an enforcement action from arguing that the agency's interpretation of the statute is wrong.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My analysis of that question is straightforward: The general rule of administrative law is that in an enforcement action, a defendant may argue that an agency's interpretation of a statute is wrong, at least unless Congress has expressly precluded the defendant from advancing such an argument.  The Hobbs Act does not expressly preclude judicial review of an agency's statutory interpretation in an enforcement action.  Therefore, in this enforcement action, PDR may argue to the District Court that the FCC's interpretation of the TCPA is wrong.  The District Court is not bound by the FCC's interpretation  of the TCPA.  Rather, the District Court should interpret the TCPA under usual principles of statutory interpretation, affording appropriate respect to the agency's interpretation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The analysis set forth in this separate opinion remains available to the court on remand (if it needs to reach the question after answering the preliminary issues identified by this Court), and it remains available to other courts in the future.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Passed by Congress and signed by President Truman in 1950, the Hobbs Act provides in relevant part: \"The court of appeals .\u00a0.\u00a0. has exclusive jurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in part), or to determine the validity of .\u00a0.\u00a0. all final orders of the Federal Communication Commission made reviewable by section 402(a) of title 47.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72342.  Under the Hobbs Act, when the FCC issues certain regulations, any \"party aggrieved\" has 60 days to \"file a petition to review the order in the court of appeals.\"  \u00a72344.  If more than one petition for review is filed, the petitions are consolidated in a single court of appeals.  \u00a72112(a)(3).1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The point of the Hobbs Act is to force parties who want to challenge agency orders via facial, pre-enforcement challenges to do so promptly and to do so in a court of appeals.  The pre-enforcement review process established by the Act avoids the delays and uncertainty that otherwise would result from multiple pre-enforcement proceedings being filed and decided over time in multiple district courts and courts of appeals.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If no one files a facial, pre-enforcement challenge to an agency order, or if a court of appeals upholds the agency's interpretation, then a party who later wants to engage in proscribed activity and disagrees with the agency's interpretation faces a difficult decision.  The party must take the risk of engaging in the activity and then arguing against the agency's legal interpretation as a defendant in an enforcement action.  The question for us is whether the Hobbs Act bars defendants in those enforcement actions from arguing that the agency incorrectly interpreted the statute.  The answer is that the Act does not bar defendants from raising such an argument.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two categories of statutes allow for facial, pre-enforcement review of agency orders.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Statutes in the first category authorize facial, pre-enforcement judicial review and expressly preclude judicial review in subsequent enforcement actions.  The Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), and the Clean Air Act are examples.  The Clean Water Act provides for facial, pre-enforcement review of certain agency actions in a court of appeals and requires parties to seek review within 120 days.  See 33 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71369(b)(1).  The Act expressly states that those agency orders \"shall not be subject to judicial review in any civil or criminal proceeding for enforcement.\"  \u00a71369(b)(2).  CERCLA provides for parties to seek pre-enforcement review of any covered regulation in the D.\u00a0C. Circuit within 90 days.  See 42 U. S. C. \u00a79613(a).  Like the Clean Water Act, CERCLA expressly states that those agency orders \"shall not be subject to judicial review in any civil or criminal proceeding for enforcement.\"  Ibid.  Similarly, the Clean Air Act provides for parties to file pre-enforcement petitions for review in the D.\u00a0C. Circuit within 60 days.  See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77607(b)(1).  The Clean Air Act, too, expressly states that those agency orders \"shall not be subject to judicial review in civil or criminal proceedings for enforcement.\"  \u00a77607(b)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Statutes in the second category authorize facial, pre-enforcement judicial review, but are silent on the question whether a party may argue against the agency's legal interpretation in subsequent enforcement proceedings.  The Hobbs Act is an example, as are statutes that provide for review of certain Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Labor orders and rules.  See 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a778y(a)(1), (3), (b)(1), (3); 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7655(f).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For that second category--the statutes that are silent about review in subsequent enforcement actions--there must be a default rule that applies absent statutory language to the contrary.  The question is whether the proper default rule is (1) to preclude review by the district court of whether the agency interpretation is correct or (2) to allow review by the district court of whether the agency interpretation is correct.  In my view, elementary principles of administrative law establish that the proper default rule is to allow review by the district court of whether the agency interpretation is correct.  In those enforcement actions, the defendant may argue that the agency's interpretation is wrong.  And the district courts are not bound by the agency's interpretation.  District courts must determine the meaning of the statute under the usual principles of statutory interpretation, affording appropriate respect to the agency's interpretation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To begin with, the \"Administrative Procedure Act creates a basic presumption of judicial review for one suffering legal wrong because of agency action.\"  Weyerhaeuser Co. v. United States Fish and Wildlife Serv., 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 11) (quotation altered).  Unless \"there is persuasive reason to believe\" that Congress intended to preclude judicial review, the Court will not preclude review.  Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U.\u00a0S. 667, 670 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistent with that strong presumption of judicial review, a party traditionally has been able to raise an as-applied challenge to an agency's interpretation of a statute in an enforcement proceeding.  Indeed, in 1947, the year after the Administrative Procedure Act was enacted, the Attorney General's Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act stated: \"There are many situations in which the invalidity of agency action may be set up as a defense in enforcement proceedings.\"  Dept. of Justice, Attorney General's Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 100 (1947).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, this Court's decision in Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.\u00a0S. 136 (1967) (Abbott Labs), revolutionized administrative law by also allowing facial, pre-enforcement challenges to agency orders, absent statutory preclusion of such pre-enforcement review.  Id., at 139-141.  But Abbott Labs did not eliminate as-applied review in enforcement actions.  Indeed, doing so would have thwarted a key aim of the decision, which was to expand the opportunities for judicial review by allowing both facial, pre-enforcement challenges and as-applied challenges to agency action.  The Abbott Labs Court pointed out that only those parties who were part of the pre-enforcement suit would be \"bound by the decree.\"  Id., at 154.2  The Court did not suggest that other parties would be precluded from arguing against the legality of the agency order in enforcement actions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The strong presumption of judicial review, the tradition of allowing defendants in enforcement actions to argue that the agency's interpretation is wrong, and this Court's landmark decision in Abbott Labs all suggest the proper default rule: to allow review by the district court of whether the agency interpretation is correct.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further supporting that default rule is the fact that Congress knows how to explicitly preclude judicial review in enforcement proceedings.  As noted above, the Clean Water Act, CERCLA, and the Clean Air Act all expressly preclude judicial review of agency statutory interpretations in subsequent enforcement actions.  The fact that Congress has expressly precluded judicial review in those statutes suggests that Congress' silence in the Hobbs Act should not be read to preclude judicial review--in other words, should not be read to bar defendants in enforcement actions from arguing that the agency's interpretation of the statute is incorrect.  See Russello v. United States, 464 U.\u00a0S. 16, 21-26 (1983).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7703, further confirms that the appropriate default rule is to allow judicial review.  Section 703 provides: \"Except to the extent that prior, adequate, and exclusive opportunity for judicial review is provided by law, agency action is subject to judicial review in civil or criminal proceedings for judicial enforcement.\"  The Government acknowledges that \u00a7703 \"establishes a general rule that, when a defendant's liability depends in part on the propriety of an agency action, that action ordinarily can be challenged in a civil or criminal enforcement suit.\"  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24.  Unlike the Clean Water Act, CERCLA, and the Clean Air Act, moreover, the Hobbs Act does not provide that facial, pre-enforcement review is (in \u00a7703 terms) the \"exclusive opportunity\" for judicial review for purposes of \u00a7703.  More on that point later.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court's precedents interpreting analogous statutes lend additional support for the default rule of allowing review of the agency's interpretation in the district court enforcement action.  For example, certain Department of Labor orders promulgating occupational safety and health standards are directly reviewable in the courts of appeals.  See 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7655(f).  In enforcement proceedings, this Court has routinely considered defendants' arguments that the Administration's interpretation of a statute is incorrect.  See Whirlpool Corp. v. Marshall, 445 U.\u00a0S. 1, 4, 7-8, 11 (1980).  Likewise, certain SEC orders are directly reviewable in a court of appeals.  See 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a778y(a)(1), (3), (b)(1), (3).  In enforcement proceedings, this Court again has routinely considered defendants' arguments that the SEC's interpretation of a statute is incorrect.  See United States v. O'Hagan, 521 U.\u00a0S. 642, 666-676 (1997); Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.\u00a0S. 185, 212-214 (1976).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The practical consequences likewise support a default rule of allowing review.  Denying judicial review of an agency's interpretation of the statute in enforcement actions can be grossly inefficient and unfair.  It would be wholly impractical--and a huge waste of resources--to expect and require every potentially affected party to bring pre-enforcement Hobbs Act challenges against every agency order that might possibly affect them in the future.  After all, as Justice Powell stated in a similar context, it \"is totally unrealistic to assume that more than a fraction of the persons and entities affected by a regulation--especially small contractors scattered across the country--would have knowledge of its promulgation or familiarity with or access to the Federal Register.\"  Adamo Wrecking Co. v. United States, 434 U.\u00a0S. 275, 290 (1978) (concurring opinion).  On some occasions, the entities against whom an enforcement action is brought may not even have existed back when an agency order was issued.  In short, it is unfair to expect potentially affected parties to predict the future.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of that unfairness, Congress traditionally takes the extraordinary step of barring as-applied review in enforcement proceedings only in those statutory schemes where the regulated parties are likely to be well aware of any agency rules and to have both the incentive and the capacity to challenge those rules immediately.  The Clean Water Act, CERCLA, and the Clean Air Act generally fit that description.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, the Hobbs Act covers a wide variety of federal agency orders where potentially affected parties may not always have the incentive and the capacity to immediately challenge the orders.  Consider the Department of Housing and Urban Development rules or Department of Agriculture rules that are covered by the Hobbs Act, for example.  If a party affected by a HUD rule or Department of Agriculture rule is subject to a later enforcement action, is the party precluded from arguing that the rule misinterprets the applicable statute?  That would be extraordinary. Requiring all those potentially affected parties to bring a facial, pre-enforcement challenge within 60 days or otherwise forfeit their right to challenge an agency's interpretation of a statute borders on the absurd.  That is no doubt why Congress rarely does so.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, that unfairness raises a serious constitutional issue.  Barring defendants in as-applied enforcement actions from raising arguments about the reach and authority of agency rules enforced against them raises significant questions under the Due Process Clause.  In Adamo Wrecking, Justice Powell concurred to say that the  preclusion-of-review provision of the Clean Air Act raises constitutional issues that \"merited serious consideration.\"  Id., at 289. The D.\u00a0C. Circuit likewise has stated that provisions of that sort raise a \"substantial due process question.\"  Chrysler Corp. v. EPA, 600 F.\u00a02d 904, 913 (1979). We can avoid some of those due process concerns by adhering to a default rule of permitting judicial review of agency legal interpretations in enforcement actions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All of those considerations taken together lead to a very simple principle: When Congress intends to eliminate as-applied judicial review of agency interpretation of statutes in enforcement actions, Congress can, must, and does speak clearly.  We cannot presume that Congress silently intended to preclude judicial review of agency interpretations of statutes in enforcement actions.  Rather, the default rule is to allow defendants in enforcement actions to argue that the agency's interpretation of the statute is wrong, unless Congress expressly provides otherwise.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike the Clean Water Act, CERCLA, and the Clean Air Act, the Hobbs Act does not expressly preclude review in enforcement actions.  Supporting respondent Carlton's position here, the Government offers four arguments that the Hobbs Act should nonetheless be interpreted to bar district court review of an agency's interpretation in an enforcement proceeding.  None is persuasive.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Hobbs Act provides that the court of appeals in a facial, pre-enforcement challenge has \"exclusive jurisdiction\" to \"enjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in part), or to determine the validity\" of the agency order.  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72342.  All agree that this \"exclusive jurisdiction\" language means, at a minimum, that an aggrieved party may not bring a facial, pre-enforcement action either (1) in a district court or (2) more than 60 days after entry of the order.  The Government contends that the Hobbs Act's reference to \"exclusive jurisdiction\" accomplishes more than that, however.  The Government argues that the Act's reference to \"exclusive jurisdiction\" also bars judicial review of the agency's interpretation in subsequent enforcement proceedings.  The Government's argument would mean that the district court in an enforcement proceeding is required to follow the agency's interpretation when deciding the case, no matter how wrong the agency's interpretation might be.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first problem for the Government is that, unlike the Clean Water Act, CERCLA, and the Clean Air Act, the Hobbs Act does not expressly preclude as-applied judicial review of an agency interpretation in subsequent enforcement proceedings.  Unlike those other Acts, the Hobbs Act does not say that agency orders \"shall not be subject to judicial review in any civil or criminal proceeding for enforcement.\"  33 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71369(b)(2). \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the Government seizes on the Hobbs Act's \"exclusive jurisdiction\" language.  So the question is this: The exclusive jurisdiction specified by the Hobbs Act is \"exclusive jurisdiction\" to do what?  The Act says \"exclusive jurisdiction\" to \"enjoin, set aside, suspend,\" or \"determine the validity\" of the order.  Those phrases afford the court of appeals exclusive jurisdiction to issue an injunction or declaratory judgment regarding the agency's order.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72349.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government argues that if the district court could disagree with the agency's interpretation in an enforcement proceeding, the district court would be \"determin[ing] the validity\" of the order in violation of the Hobbs Act's grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the court of appeals in the initial 60-day period.  That is incorrect.  In this context, a court \"determines the validity\" of the order only by entering a declaratory judgment that the order is valid or invalid.  Critically, if a district court in an enforcement action disagrees with the agency interpretation, the district court does not issue a declaratory judgment or an injunction against the agency.  Rather, the district court simply determines that the defendant is not liable under the correct interpretation of the statute.  In other words, in an enforcement action, a district court does not determine the validity of the agency order.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That conclusion becomes even more apparent when we consider what ensues from the action taken by the relevant court.  If the court of appeals in a facial, pre-enforcement action determines that the order is invalid and enjoins it, the agency can no longer enforce the order.  By contrast, if the district court disagrees with the agency's interpretation in an enforcement action, that ruling does not invalidate the order and has no effect on the agency's ability to enforce the order against others.  That contrast shows that the district court does not \"determine the validity\" of an order when the district court agrees or disagrees with the agency interpretation in an enforcement action.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That conclusion finds further support in analogous statutes.  As noted above, certain SEC orders and rules are subject to pre-enforcement review in a court of appeals.  See 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a778y(a)(1), (3), (b)(1), (3).  The court of appeals has \"exclusive\" jurisdiction to \"affirm or modify and enforce or to set aside the order in whole or in part\" or to \"affirm and enforce or to set aside the rule.\"  \u00a7\u00a778y(a)(3), (b)(3).  But despite the \"exclusive\" jurisdiction language, that provision has never been read to bar subsequent district court review of the SEC's interpretation of a statute in an enforcement proceeding.  See O'Hagan, 521 U. S., at 666-676; Ernst & Ernst, 425 U. S., at 212-214.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, the text of the Hobbs Act is best read to mean that PDR can argue that the agency's interpretation of the TCPA is wrong.  And the District Court can decide what the statute means under the usual principles of statutory interpretation, affording appropriate respect to the agency's interpretation.  By doing so, the District Court will not \"determine the validity\" of the agency order in violation of 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72342.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if the text of \u00a72342 is deemed ambiguous, ambiguity is not enough to deprive a party of judicial review of the agency's interpretation in an enforcement action.  To deprive a defendant such as PDR the opportunity to contest the agency's interpretation, Congress must expressly preclude review.  The Hobbs Act does not do so.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the Government contends that one of this Court's cases--Yakus v. United States, 321 U.\u00a0S. 414 (1944)--already interpreted a statute similar to the Hobbs Act to bar as-applied review in enforcement actions.  The Government incorrectly reads that decision.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Yakus, the Court considered whether the facial, pre-enforcement procedure prescribed by the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 for determining the validity of pricing orders barred as-applied review in enforcement actions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The defendants in Yakus had been tried and convicted of selling wholesale cuts of beef at prices exceeding the maximum price prescribed by regulation.  The defendants did not use the procedure established by the Emergency Price Control Act to raise a facial, pre-enforcement challenge to the price regulation.  But they did raise a challenge to the legality of the regulation as part of their defense to the criminal prosecution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 204(d) of the Emergency Price Control Act contained two key sentences.  The first sentence said that a specially created federal court had \"exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of any regulation or order.\"  56 Stat. 33 (emphasis added).  That first sentence is roughly akin to the language in the Hobbs Act.  The second sentence said: \"Except as provided in this section, no court, Federal, State, or Territorial, shall have jurisdiction or power to consider the validity of any such regulation, order, or price schedule.\"  Ibid. (emphasis added).  That second sentence is not replicated in the Hobbs Act, but is roughly akin to the preclusion of review provisions in the modern Clean Water Act, CERCLA, and Clean Air Act.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the Yakus Court, the first sentence of the Emergency Price Control Act, which gave a specific court exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of certain regulations, \"coupled with the provision\" that explicitly provided that no other court had jurisdiction to consider the validity of those same regulations, deprived the district court of power to consider the relevant price regulation.  Yakus, 321 U.\u00a0S., at 430 (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its use of the phrase \"coupled with,\" the Court made plain that those two sentences of the Emergency Price Control Act together barred district court review.  The first sentence alone was not enough.  Importantly, moreover, Yakus did not treat the second sentence of the Emergency Price Control Act as redundant of or as a restatement of the first.  On the contrary, the Court recognized that the two provisions accomplish separate objectives.  The first sentence gave a particular court exclusive jurisdiction to decide a facial, pre-enforcement challenge.  But the word \"exclusive\" did not on its own bar any subsequent review in as-applied enforcement actions.  If it had, then the second sentence of the Emergency Price Control Act would not have been necessary.  Yet the Act included the second sentence and, importantly, the Yakus Court then relied expressly on that second sentence as part of the basis for finding review precluded in subsequent enforcement  proceedings.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Six years after Yakus, Congress enacted the Hobbs Act. The Government here contends that Congress modeled the Hobbs Act on the Emergency Price Control Act.  But Congress did not incorporate both sentences of the relevant statutory language from the Emergency Price Control Act into the Hobbs Act.  In enacting the Hobbs Act, Congress incorporated something resembling the first sentence of the Emergency Price Control Act granting the court of appeals exclusive jurisdiction to entertain facial, pre-enforcement challenges to determine the validity of agency action.  But Congress did not incorporate the second sentence of the Emergency Price Control Act, which stated that no other court had jurisdiction even \"to consider\" those same agency orders.  In the Hobbs Act, in other words, Congress did not include the language from the Emergency Price Control Act that, as interpreted in Yakus, would have expressly communicated Congress' intent to preclude district courts from considering the validity of certain regulations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In relying on Yakus, the Government disregards that critical difference between the text of the Emergency Price Control Act and the text of the Hobbs Act.  Because the text of the Emergency Price Control Act differs significantly from the text of the Hobbs Act, the Government is incorrect that Yakus supports the Government's interpretation of the Hobbs Act.  Indeed, if anything, Yakus supports the contrary interpretation of the Hobbs Act because Yakus expressly rested its no-judicial-review conclusion in part on a sentence of the Emergency Price Control Act that Congress left out of the Hobbs Act.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One more point on Yakus: The Government's reliance on that decision is problematic for yet another reason.  Yakus was a wartime case, where the need for quick and definitive judicial rulings on the legality of agency orders was at its apex.  That wartime need renders Yakus, in Justice Powell's words, \"at least arguably distinguishable\" in civil enforcement proceedings.  Adamo Wrecking, 434 U.\u00a0S., at 290 (concurring opinion).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, as Yakus makes clear, the phrase \"exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity\" does not itself bar subsequent district court review of the agency's interpretation in enforcement proceedings.  And when we return to the Hobbs Act, the same conclusion holds: The phrase \"exclusive jurisdiction\" to \"determine the validity\" does  not bar subsequent district court review in enforcement proceedings.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, the Government suggests that as-applied review in district courts is not necessary because an affected party who did not bring a facial, pre-enforcement challenge can always petition the agency for reconsideration, reopening, a new rulemaking, a declaratory order, or the like, and then obtain judicial review of the agency's denial.  The Government's argument is wrong.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To begin with, if the Government supports judicial review after the initial Hobbs Act period, then why force review into that convoluted route rather than just supporting judicial review in an enforcement action?  The Government has no answer.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More fundamentally, the Government's promise of an alternative path of judicial review is empty.  The Government acknowledges that judicial review may not always be available under that route.  And even if judicial review is available, it may only be deferential judicial review of the agency's discretionary decision to decline to take new action, not judicial review of the agency's initial interpretation of the statute.  As a result, the Government's promise of an alternative path of judicial review is illusory and does not supply a basis for denying judicial review in district court enforcement actions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth, the Government suggests that it would be a practical problem for agencies if the Hobbs Act did not bar as-applied review of agency interpretations in enforcement actions.  That policy-laden argument cannot overcome the text of the statute and the traditional administrative law practice.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, the argument is unpersuasive even on its own terms.  If an agency order is upheld in a facial, pre-enforcement challenge, but then a district court and different court of appeals disagree with the agency's interpretation in a future as-applied challenge, that will create a circuit split on the interpretation of the law and likely trigger review in this Court.  The Government does not like that possibility.  The Government would prefer to choke off all litigation at the pass.  But circuit splits and this Court's review happen all the time with all kinds of federal laws.  There is no reason to think that Congress wanted to short-circuit that ordinary system of judicial review for the many agencies and multiplicity of agency orders encompassed by the Hobbs Act.  And there is certainly no basis to interpret a silent statute as achieving that extraordinary close-the-courthouse-door outcome.  To be sure, as it has done with the Clean Water Act, CERCLA, and the Clean Air Act, Congress can expressly preclude as-applied review in enforcement actions (subject to constitutional constraints).  But we should not lightly conclude that Congress wanted to simultaneously deny judicial review in enforcement actions; blindside defendants who would not necessarily have anticipated that they should have filed a facial, pre-enforcement challenge; insulate agencies from circuit splits; and render this Court's review of major agency orders less likely.  That would pack a lot of congressional punch into a few oblique words in the Hobbs Act.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the extent we consider practical considerations, moreover, they cut against the Government.  Under the Government's position, when the initial window for facial, pre-enforcement review closes, no one is able to argue in court that the regulation is inconsistent with the statute--no matter how wrong the agency's interpretation might be.  The effect is to transform the regulation into the equivalent of a statute.  In other words, the Government's argument means that the District Court would have to afford the agency not mere Skidmore deference or Chevron deference, but absolute deference.  Not Skidmore deference or Chevron deference, but PDR abdication. See Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.\u00a0S. 134 (1944); Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.\u00a0S. 837 (1984).\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, the Hobbs Act does not expressly preclude judicial review of agency legal interpretations in enforcement actions.  Therefore, the Hobbs Act does not bar PDR from arguing that the FCC's legal interpretation of the TCPA is incorrect.  The District Court is not bound by the FCC's interpretation.  In an as-applied enforcement action, the district court should interpret the statute as courts traditionally do under the usual principles of statutory interpretation, affording appropriate respect to the agency's interpretation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the Court's holding today, if the court on remand concludes that the FCC's order was not subject to the Hobbs Act in the first place, PDR will be able to argue that the FCC's interpretation of the TCPA is incorrect.  Or if the court concludes that pre-enforcement review was not adequate for PDR, then PDR likewise will be able to argue that the FCC's interpretation of the TCPA is incorrect.  If the court on remand reaches neither of those conclusions, however, then the court on remand will confront the question that we granted certiorari to decide and that is analyzed in this separate opinion.  For the reasons I have explained, I would conclude that PDR may argue that the FCC's interpretation of the TCPA is incorrect, and that the District Court is not required to accept the FCC's interpretation of the TCPA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully concur in the judgment.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1Contrary to the majority's suggestion, ante, at 5, it therefore makes no difference whether the FCC order at issue here is a legislative rule or an interpretive rule.  In any event, the order is clearly interpretive--it was \"\u00a0'issued by an agency to advise the public of the agency's construction of\u00a0'\u00a0\" the term \"unsolicited advertisement.\"  Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.\u00a0S. 92, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 3).\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The exclusive-jurisdiction provision of the Hobbs Act also governs review of certain actions of the Department of Agriculture, Department of Transportation, Federal Maritime Commission, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Surface Transportation Board, and Department of Housing and Urban Development.

UNITED STATES(2019)\nNo. 17-778\nArgued: April 24, 2019Decided: June 10, 2019\n\n\nWhen petitioner Jamar Quarles pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(1), he also appeared to qualify for enhanced sentencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act because he had at least three prior \"violent felony\" convictions, \u00a7924(e).  He claimed, however, that a 2002 Michigan conviction for third-degree home invasion did not qualify, even though \u00a7924(e) defines \"violent felony\" to include \"burglary,\" and the generic statutory term \"burglary\" means \"unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime,\" Taylor v. United States, 495 U.\u00a0S. 575, 599 (emphasis added).  Quarles argued that Michigan's third-degree home invasion statute--which applies when a person \"breaks and enters a dwelling or enters a dwelling without permission and, at any time while he or she is entering, present in, or exiting the dwelling, commits a misdemeanor,\" Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7750.110a(4)(a) (emphasis added)--swept too broadly.  Specifically, he claimed, it encompassed situations where the defendant forms the intent to commit a crime at any time while unlawfully remaining in a dwelling, while generic remaining-in burglary occurs only when the defendant has the intent to commit a crime at the exact moment when he or she first unlawfully remains in a building or structure.  The District Court rejected that argument, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0Generic remaining-in burglary occurs under \u00a7924(e) when the defendant forms the intent to commit a crime at any time while unlawfully remaining in a building or structure.  In ordinary usage, \"remaining-in\" refers to a continuous activity, and this Court has followed that ordinary meaning in analogous legal contexts, see, e.g., United States v. Cores, 356 U.\u00a0S. 405, 408.  Those contexts thus inform the interpretation of \"remaining-in\" burglary in \u00a7924(e): The common understanding of \"remaining in\" as a continuous event means that burglary occurs for purposes of \u00a7924(e) if the defendant forms the intent to commit a crime at any time during the continuous event of unlawfully remaining in a building or structure.  The intent to commit a crime must be contemporaneous with unlawful entry or remaining, but the defendant's intent is contemporaneous with the unlawful remaining so long as the defendant forms the intent at any time while unlawfully remaining.  That conclusion is supported by the body of state law as of 1986, when Congress enacted \u00a7924(e).  Quarles' narrow interpretation makes little sense in light of Congress' rationale for specifying burglary as a violent felony.  Congress \"singled out burglary\" because of its \"inherent potential for harm to persons,\" Taylor, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 588, and the possibility of a violent confrontation does not depend on the exact moment when the burglar forms the intent to commit a crime while unlawfully present in a building or structure.  Quarles' interpretation would also thwart the stated goals of the Armed Career Criminal Act by presumably eliminating many States' burglary statutes as predicate offenses under \u00a7924(e).  Pp.\u00a03-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0For the Court's purposes here, the Michigan home-invasion statute substantially corresponds to or is narrower than generic burglary.  The conclusion that generic remaining-in burglary occurs when the defendant forms the intent to commit a crime at any time while unlawfully remaining in a building or structure resolves this case.  When deciding whether a state law is broader than generic burglary, the state law's \"exact definition or label\" does not control.  Taylor, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 599.  So long as the state law in question \"substantially corresponds\" to (or is narrower than) generic burglary, the conviction qualifies.  Ibid.

UNITED STATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit\n[June 10, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 924(e) of Title 18, also known as the Armed Career Criminal Act, mandates a minimum 15-year prison sentence for a felon who unlawfully possesses a firearm and has three prior convictions for a \"serious drug offense\" or \"violent felony.\"  Section 924(e) defines \"violent felony\" to include \"burglary.\"  Under this Court's 1990 decision in Taylor v. United States, 495 U.\u00a0S. 575, the generic statutory term \"burglary\" means \"unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\"  Id., at 599 (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The exceedingly narrow question in this case concerns remaining-in burglary.  The question is whether remaining-in burglary (i) occurs only if a person has the intent to commit a crime at the exact moment when he or she first unlawfully remains in a building or structure, or (ii) more broadly, occurs when a person forms the intent to commit a crime at any time while unlawfully remaining in a building or structure.  For purposes of \u00a7924(e), we conclude that remaining-in burglary occurs when the defendant forms the intent to commit a crime at any time while unlawfully remaining in a building or structure.  We affirm the judgment of the U.\u00a0S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On August 24, 2013, police officers in Grand Rapids, Michigan, responded to a 911 call.  When the officers arrived at the scene, the caller, Chasity Warren, told the officers that she had just escaped from her boyfriend, Jamar Quarles.  Warren said that Quarles had threatened her at gunpoint and also hit her.  While the police officers were speaking with Warren, Quarles drove by.  The officers then arrested Quarles and later searched his house.  Inside they found a semiautomatic pistol.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quarles pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(1).  Quarles had at least three prior convictions that appeared to qualify as violent felonies under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e).  Those three convictions were: (1) a 2002 Michigan conviction for third-degree home invasion stemming from an attempt to chase down an ex-girlfriend who had sought refuge in a nearby apartment; (2) a 2004 Michigan conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon based on an incident where Quarles held a gun to the head of another ex-girlfriend and threatened to kill her; and (3) a 2008 Michigan conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon arising from an altercation with another man and that same ex-girlfriend in which Quarles shot at the man.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the sentencing proceedings for his federal felon-in-possession offense, Quarles argued that his 2002 Michigan conviction for third-degree home invasion did not qualify as a burglary under \u00a7924(e).  Under this Court's precedents, the District Court had to decide whether the Michigan statute under which Quarles was convicted in 2002 was broader than the generic definition of burglary set forth in Taylor (in which case the conviction would not qualify as a prior conviction under \u00a7924(e)) or, instead, whether the Michigan statute \"substantially correspond[ed]\" to or was narrower than the generic definition of burglary set forth in Taylor.  495 U.\u00a0S., at 602.  To reiterate, Taylor interpreted burglary under \u00a7924(e) to mean \"unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\"  Id., at 599 (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the Michigan law at issue here, a person commits third-degree home invasion if he or she \"breaks and enters a dwelling or enters a dwelling without permission and, at any time while he or she is entering, present in, or exiting the dwelling, commits a misdemeanor.\"  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7750.110a(4)(a) (West 2004) (emphasis added).  Quarles argued to the District Court that the Michigan third-degree home invasion statute swept too broadly to qualify as burglary under \u00a7924(e) because the Michigan statute encompassed situations where the defendant forms the intent to commit a crime at any time while unlawfully remaining in a dwelling, not at the exact moment when the defendant is first unlawfully present in a dwelling.  The District Court rejected that argument and sentenced Quarles to 17 years in prison.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed.  850 F. 3d 836, 840 (2017).  We granted certiorari in light of a Circuit split on the question of how to assess state remaining-in burglary statutes for purposes of \u00a7924(e). 586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2019).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 924(e) lists \"burglary\" as a qualifying predicate offense for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act.  But \u00a7924(e) does not define \"burglary.\"  The question here is how to define \"burglary\" under \u00a7924(e).  We do not write on a clean slate.  See Taylor, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 599.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At common law, burglary was confined to unlawful breaking and entering a dwelling at night with the intent to commit a felony.  See, e.g., 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 224 (1769).  But by the time Congress passed and President Reagan signed the current version of \u00a7924(e) in 1986, state burglary statutes had long since departed from the common-law formulation.  See Taylor, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 593-596.  In addition to casting off relics like the requirement that there be a breaking, or that the unlawful entry occur at night, a majority of States by 1986 prohibited unlawfully \"remaining in\" a building  or structure with intent to commit a crime.  Those  remaining-in statutes closed a loophole in some States' laws by extending burglary to cover situations where a person enters a structure lawfully but stays unlawfully--for example, by remaining in a store after closing time without permission to do so.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the 1990 Taylor decision, this Court interpreted the term \"burglary\" in \u00a7924(e) in accord with the more expansive understanding of burglary that had become common by 1986: \"We believe that Congress meant by 'burglary' the generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most States.\"  495 U.\u00a0S., at 598.  The Court concluded that generic burglary under \u00a7924(e) means \"unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\"  Id., at 599 (emphasis added).  A defendant's prior conviction under a state statute qualifies as a predicate burglary under \u00a7924(e) if the state statute--regardless of its \"exact definition or label\"--\"substantially corresponds\" to or is narrower than the generic definition of burglary.  Id., at 599, 602.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, we must determine the scope of generic remaining-in burglary under Taylor--in particular, the timing of the intent requirement.  Quarles argues that remaining-in burglary occurs only when the defendant has the intent to commit a crime at the exact moment when he or she first unlawfully remains in a building or structure.  The Government argues for a broader definition of  remaining-in burglary.  According to the Government, remaining-in burglary occurs when the defendant forms the intent to commit a crime at any time while unlawfully present in a building or structure.  We agree with the Government.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted, Taylor interpreted generic burglary under \u00a7924(e) to include remaining-in burglary.  Id., at 599.  In ordinary usage, \"remaining in\" refers to a continuous activity.  See United States v. Cores, 356 U.\u00a0S. 405, 408 (1958); see also Webster's New International Dictionary 2106 (2d ed. 1949); 8 Oxford English Dictionary 418 (1933).  This Court has followed that ordinary meaning in analogous legal contexts.  For example, when interpreting a federal criminal statute punishing any \"\u00a0'alien crewman who willfully remains in the United States in excess of the number of days allowed,'\u00a0\" the Court stated that \"the crucial word 'remains' permits no connotation other than continuing presence.\"  Cores, 356 U.\u00a0S., at 408.  The law of trespass likewise proscribes remaining on the land of another without permission.  In that context, the term \"remain\" refers to \"a continuing trespass for the entire time during which the actor wrongfully remains.\"  Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7158, Comment m, p. 280 (1965).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those interpretations of \"remaining in\" in analogous areas of the law inform our interpretation of \"remaining-in\" burglary in \u00a7924(e).  In particular, the common understanding of \"remaining in\" as a continuous event means that burglary occurs for purposes of \u00a7924(e) if the defendant forms the intent to commit a crime at any time during the continuous event of unlawfully remaining in a building or structure.  To put it in conventional criminal law terms: Because the actus reus is a continuous event, the mens rea matches the actus reus so long as the burglar forms the intent to commit a crime at any time while unlawfully present in the building or structure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quarles insists, however, that to constitute a burglary under \u00a7924(e), the intent to commit a crime must be contemporaneous with unlawful entry or remaining.  That is true.  But the defendant's intent is contemporaneous with the unlawful remaining so long as the defendant forms the intent at any time while unlawfully remaining.  Put simply, for burglary predicated on unlawful entry, the defendant must have the intent to commit a crime at the time of entry.  For burglary predicated on unlawful remaining, the defendant must have the intent to commit a crime at the time of remaining, which is any time during which the defendant unlawfully remains.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That conclusion is supported by the States' laws as of 1986 when Congress enacted \u00a7924(e).  As of 1986, a majority of States proscribed remaining-in burglary.  At that time, there was not much case law addressing the precise timing of the intent requirement for remaining-in burglary.  That is presumably because in most remaining-in burglaries, the defendant has the intent to commit a crime when he or she first unlawfully remains in a building or structure.  The timing issue arises only in the rarer cases where the defendant forms the intent to commit a crime only after unlawfully remaining in the building or structure for a while.  In any event, for present purposes, the important point is that all of the state appellate courts that had definitively addressed this issue as of 1986 had interpreted remaining-in burglary to occur when the defendant forms the intent to commit a crime at any time while unlawfully present in the building or structure.  See Gratton v. State, 456 So. 2d 865, 872 (Ala. Crim. App. 1984); State v. Embree, 130 Ariz. 64, 66, 633 P. 2d 1057, 1059 (App. 1981); Keith v. State, 138 Ga. App. 239, 225 S. E. 2d 719, 720 (1976); State v. Mogenson, 10 Kan. App. 2d 470, 472-476, 701 P. 2d 1339, 1343-1345 (1985); State v. Papineau, 53 Ore. App. 33, 38, 630 P. 2d 904, 906-907 (1981).1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Especially in light of the body of state law as of 1986, it is not likely that Congress intended generic burglary under \u00a7924(e) to include (i) a burglar who intends to commit a crime at the exact moment when he or she first unlawfully remains in a building or structure, but to exclude (ii) a burglar who forms the intent to commit a crime at any time while unlawfully remaining in a building or structure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, excluding that latter category of burglaries from generic burglary under \u00a7924(e) would make little sense in light of Congress' rationale for specifying burglary as a violent felony.  As the Court recognized in Taylor, Congress \"singled out burglary\" because of its \"inherent potential for harm to persons.\"  495 U.\u00a0S., at 588.  Burglary is dangerous because it \"creates the possibility of a violent confrontation between the offender and an occupant, caretaker, or some other person who comes to investigate.\"  Ibid.; see also United States v. Stitt, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 6).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to remaining-in burglary, the possibility of a violent confrontation does not depend on the exact moment when the burglar forms the intent to commit a crime while unlawfully present in a building or structure.  Once an intruder is both unlawfully present inside a building or structure and has the requisite intent to commit a crime, all of the reasons that led Congress to include burglary as a \u00a7924(e) predicate fully apply.  The dangers of remaining-in burglary are not tied to the esoteric question of precisely when the defendant forms the intent to commit a crime.  That point underscores that Congress, when enacting \u00a7924(e) in 1986, would not have understood the meaning of burglary to hinge on exactly when the defendant forms the intent to commit a crime while unlawfully present in a building or structure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, to interpret remaining-in burglary narrowly, as Quarles advocates, would thwart the stated goals of the Armed Career Criminal Act.  After all, most burglaries involve unlawful entry, not unlawful remaining in.  Yet if we were to narrowly interpret the remaining-in category of generic burglary so as to require that the defendant have the intent to commit a crime at the exact moment he or she first unlawfully remains, then many States' burglary statutes would be broader than generic burglary.  As a result, under our precedents, many States' burglary statutes would presumably be eliminated as predicate offenses under \u00a7924(e).  That result not only would defy common sense, but also would defeat Congress' stated objective of imposing enhanced punishment on armed career criminals who have three prior convictions for burglary or other violent felonies.  We should not lightly conclude that Congress enacted a self-defeating statute.  See, e.g., Stokeling v. United States, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 8); Taylor, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 594.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To sum up: The Armed Career Criminal Act does not define the term \"burglary.\"  In Taylor, the Court explained that \"Congress did not wish to specify an exact formulation that an offense must meet in order to count as 'burglary' for enhancement purposes.\"  Id., at 599.  And the Court recognized that the definitions of burglary \"vary\" among the States.  Id., at 598.  The Taylor Court therefore interpreted the generic term \"burglary\" in \u00a7924(e) in light of: the ordinary understanding of burglary as of 1986; the States' laws at that time; Congress' recognition of the dangers of burglary; and Congress' stated objective of imposing increased punishment on armed career criminals who had committed prior burglaries.  Looking at those sources, the Taylor Court interpreted generic burglary under \u00a7924(e) to encompass remaining-in burglary.  Looking at those same sources, we interpret remaining-in burglary under \u00a7924(e) to occur when the defendant forms the intent to commit a crime at any time while unlawfully present in a building or structure.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of our conclusion that generic remaining-in burglary occurs when the defendant forms the intent to commit a crime at any time while unlawfully remaining in a building or structure, Quarles' case is easily resolved.  The question in Quarles' case is whether the Michigan home-invasion statute under which he was convicted in 2002 is broader than generic burglary or, instead, \"substantially corresponds\" to or is narrower than generic burglary.  Id., at 602.  Regarding that inquiry, the Taylor Court cautioned courts against seizing on modest state-law deviations from the generic definition of burglary.  A state law's \"exact definition or label\" does not control.  Id., at 599.  As the Court stated in Taylor, so long as the state law in question \"substantially corresponds\" to (or is narrower than) generic burglary, the conviction qualifies under \u00a7924(e).  Id., at 602.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As stated above, generic remaining-in burglary occurs under \u00a7924(e) when the defendant forms the intent to commit a crime at any time while unlawfully remaining in a building or structure.  For the Court's purposes here, the Michigan statute substantially corresponds to or is narrower than generic burglary.2\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We affirm the judgment of the U.\u00a0S.

UNITED STATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit\n[June 10, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, concurring.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I join the opinion of the Court because it correctly applies our precedent requiring a \"categorical approach\" to the enumerated-offenses clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA).  I write separately to question this approach altogether.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case demonstrates the absurdity of applying the categorical approach to the enumerated-offenses clause.  The categorical approach relies on a comparison of the crime of conviction and a judicially created ideal of burglary.  But this ideal is starkly different from the reality  of petitioner's actual crime: Petitioner attempted to climb through an apartment window to attack his ex-girlfriend.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More importantly, there are strong reasons to suspect that the categorical approach described in Taylor v. United States, 495 U.\u00a0S. 575 (1990), is not compelled by  ACCA's text but was rather a misguided attempt to avoid Sixth Amendment problems.  See Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2018) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 21-23).  Under our precedent, any state burglary statute with a broader definition than the one adopted in Taylor is categorically excluded simply because other conduct might be swept in at the margins.  It is far from obvious that this is the best reading of the statute.  A jury could readily determine whether a particular conviction satisfied the federal definition of burglary or instead fell outside that definition.  See Ovalles v. United States, 905 F. 3d 1231, 1258-1260 (CA11 2018) (W. Pryor, J., concurring).  Moreover, allowing a jury to do so would end the unconstitutional judicial factfinding that occurs when applying the categorical approach. See, e.g., Dimaya, supra, at ___-___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 22-23); Mathis v. United States, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2); Descamps v. United States, 570 U.\u00a0S. 254, 280 (2013) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); James v. United States, 550 U.\u00a0S. 192, 231-232 (2007) (Thomas, J., dissenting); Shepard v. United States, 544 U.\u00a0S. 13, 26-28 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, addressing this issue would not help petitioner: He has not preserved a Sixth Amendment challenge.  Moreover, any reasonable jury reviewing the record here would have concluded that petitioner was convicted of burglary, so any error was harmless.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the categorical approach employed today is difficult to apply and can yield dramatically different sentences depending on where a burglary occurred, the Court should consider whether its approach is actually required in the first place for ACCA's enumerated-offenses clause.  With these observations, I join the opinion of the Court.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The consensus position has not changed.  Today, of the States that have addressed the question, at least 18 have adopted the \"at any time\" interpretation of remaining-in burglary, and only 3 appear to have adopted the narrower interpretation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of those 18 States, some have adopted the broader \"at any time\" interpretation by statute.  See Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a718-4-201(3) (2018); Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, \u00a7829(e) (2015); Haw. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7708-812.5 (2014); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7750.110a(4)(a) (West 2004); Minn.

And in addition to the five pre-1986 state-court decisions identified in the text above, at least five post-1986 state-court decisions have adopted the \"at any time\" interpretation of \"remaining in.\"  See Braddy v. State, 111 So. 3d 810, 844 (Fla. 2012) (per curiam); State v. Walker, 600 N. W. 2d 606, 609 (Iowa 1999); State v. DeNoyer, 541 N. W. 2d 725, 732 (S. D. 1995); State v. Rudolph, 970 P. 2d 1221, 1228-1229 (Utah 1998); State v. Allen, 127 Wash. App. 125, 135, 110 P. 3d 849, 853-855 (2005).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, three state courts appear to have adopted the narrower interpretation.  Shetters v. State, 751 P. 2d 31, 36, n. 2 (Alaska App. 1988); People v. Gaines, 74 N.\u00a0Y. 2d 358, 361-363, 546 N. E. 2d 913, 915-916 (1989); In re J. N. S., 258 Ore.

In any event, Quarles did not preserve that argument, and we do not address it.\n\n\n","53":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nREINALDO SANTOS  v.

HARRISON ET AL.(2019)\nNo. 16-1094\nArgued: November 7, 2018Decided: March 26, 2019\n\n\nThe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA) generally immunizes foreign states from suit in this country unless one of several enumerated exceptions to immunity applies.  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71604, 1605-1607.  If an exception applies, the FSIA provides subject-matter jurisdiction in federal district court, \u00a71330(a), and personal jurisdiction \"where service has been made under section 1608,\" \u00a71330(b).  Section 1608(a) provides four methods of serving civil process, including, as relevant here, service \"by any form of mail requiring a signed receipt, to be addressed and dispatched .\u00a0.\u00a0. to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of the foreign state concerned,\" \u00a71608(a)(3).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents, victims of the bombing of the USS Cole and their family members, sued the Republic of Sudan under the FSIA, alleging that Sudan provided material support to al Qaeda for the bombing.  The court clerk, at respondents' request, addressed the service packet to Sudan's Minister of Foreign Affairs at the Sudanese Embassy in the United States and later certified that a signed receipt had been returned.  After Sudan failed to appear in the litigation, the District Court entered a default judgment for respondents and subsequently issued three orders requiring banks to turn over Sudanese assets to pay the judgment.  Sudan challenged those orders, arguing that the judgment was invalid for lack of personal jurisdiction, because \u00a71608(a)(3) required that the service packet be sent to its foreign minister at his principal office in Sudan, not to the Sudanese Embassy in the United States.  The Second Circuit affirmed, reasoning that the statute was silent on where the mailing must be sent and that the method chosen was consistent with the statute's language and could be reasonably expected to result in delivery to the foreign minister.\nHeld:\u00a0Most naturally read, \u00a71608(a)(3) requires a mailing to be sent directly to the foreign minister's office in the foreign state.  Pp.\u00a05-17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0A letter or package is \"addressed\" to an intended recipient when his or her name and address are placed on the outside.  The noun \"address\" means \"a residence or place of business.\"  Webster's Third New International Dictionary 25.  A foreign nation's embassy in the United States is neither the residence nor the usual place of business of that nation's foreign minister.  Similarly, to \"dispatch\" a letter to an addressee connotes sending it directly.  It is also significant that service under \u00a71608(a)(3) requires a signed returned receipt to ensure delivery to the addressee.  Pp.\u00a05-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) Several related provisions in \u00a71608 support this reading.  Section 1608(b)(3)(B) contains similar \"addressed and dispatched\" language, but also says that service by its method is permissible \"if reasonably calculated to give actual notice.\"  Respondents' suggestion that \u00a71608(a)(3) embodies a similar standard runs up against well-settled principles of statutory interpretation.  See Department of Homeland Security v. MacLean, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, and Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U.\u00a0S. 825, 837.  Section 1608(b)(2) expressly allows service on an agent, specifies the particular individuals who are permitted to be served as agents of the recipient, and makes clear that service on the agent may occur in the United States.  Congress could have included similar terms in \u00a71608(a)(3) had it intended the provision to operate in this manner.  Section 1608(c) deems service to have occurred under all methods only when there is a strong basis for concluding that the service packet will very shortly thereafter come into the hands of a foreign official who will know what needs to be done.  Under \u00a71608(a)(3), that occurs when the person who receives it from the carrier signs for it.  Interpreting \u00a71608(a)(3) to require that a service packet be sent to a foreign minister's own office rather than to a mailroom employee in a foreign embassy better harmonizes the rules for determining when service occurs.  Pp.\u00a09-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0This reading of \u00a71608(a)(3) avoids potential tension with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.  If mailing a service packet to a foreign state's embassy in the United States were sufficient, then it would appear to be easier to serve the foreign state than to serve a person in that foreign state under Rule 4.  The natural reading of \u00a71608(a)(3) also avoids the potential international implications arising from the State Department's position that the Convention's principle of inviolability precludes serving a foreign state by mailing process to the foreign state's embassy in the United States.  Pp.\u00a013-15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0Respondents' remaining arguments are unavailing.  First, their suggestion that \u00a71608(a)(3) demands that service be sent \"to a location that is likely to have a direct line of communication to the foreign minister\" creates difficult line-drawing problems that counsel in favor of maintaining a clear, administrable rule.  Second, their claim that \u00a71608(a)(4)--which requires that process be sent to the Secretary of State in \"Washington, District of Columbia\"--shows that Congress did not intend \u00a71608(a)(3) to have a similar locational requirement is outweighed by the countervailing arguments already noted.  Finally, they contend that it would be unfair to throw out their judgment based on petitioner's highly technical and belatedly raised argument.  But in cases with sensitive diplomatic implications, the rule of law demands adherence to strict rules, even when the equities seem to point in the opposite direction.

Under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), a foreign state may be served by means of a mailing that is \"addressed and dispatched .\u00a0.\u00a0. to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of the foreign state concerned.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71608(a)(3).  The question now before us is whether this provision is satisfied when a service packet that names the foreign minister is mailed to the foreign state's embassy in the United States.  We hold that it is not.  Most naturally read, \u00a71608(a)(3) requires that a mailing be sent directly to the foreign minister's office in the minister's home country.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the FSIA, a foreign state is immune from the jurisdiction of courts in this country unless one of several enumerated exceptions to immunity applies.  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71604, 1605-1607.

Rule Civ. Proc. 4(j)(1).  In particular, it sets out in hierarchical order the following four methods by which \"[s]ervice .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be made.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71608(a).  The first method is by delivery of a copy of the summons and complaint \"in accordance with any special arrangement for service between the plaintiff and the foreign state or political subdivision.\"  \u00a71608(a)(1).  \"[I]f no special arrangement exists,\" service may be made by the second method, namely, delivery of a copy of the summons and complaint \"in accordance with an applicable international convention on service of judicial documents.\"  \u00a71608(a)(2).  If service is not possible under either of the first two methods, the third method, which is the one at issue in this case, may be used.  This method calls for\n\"sending a copy of the summons and complaint and a notice of suit, together with a translation of each into the official language of the foreign state, by any form of mail requiring a signed receipt, to be addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of the foreign state concerned.\"  \u00a71608(a)(3) (emphasis added).\nFinally, if service cannot be made within 30 days under \u00a71608(a)(3), service may be effected by sending the service packet \"by any form of mail requiring a signed receipt, to be addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the Secretary of State in Washington, District of Columbia,\" for transmittal \"through diplomatic channels to the foreign state.\"  \u00a71608(a)(4).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once served, a foreign state or political subdivision has 60 days to file a responsive pleading.  \u00a71608(d).  If the foreign state or political subdivision does not do this, it runs the risk of incurring a default judgment.  See \u00a71608(e).  A copy of any such default judgment must be \"sent to the foreign state or political subdivision in the [same] manner prescribed for service.\"  Ibid.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On October 12, 2000, the USS Cole, a United States Navy guided-missile destroyer, entered the harbor of Aden, Yemen, for what was intended to be a brief refueling stop.  While refueling was underway, a small boat drew along the side of the Cole, and the occupants of the boat detonated explosives that tore a hole in the side of the Cole.  Seventeen crewmembers were killed, and dozens more were injured.  Al Qaeda later claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents in this case are victims of the USS Cole bombing and their family members.  In 2010, respondents sued petitioner, the Republic of Sudan, alleging that Sudan had provided material support to al Qaeda for the bombing.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71605A(a)(1), (c).  Because respondents brought suit under the FSIA, they were required to serve Sudan with process under \u00a71608(a).  It is undisputed that service could not be made under \u00a71608(a)(1) or \u00a71608(a)(2), and respondents therefore turned to \u00a71608(a)(3).  At respondents' request, the clerk of the court sent the service packet, return receipt requested, to: \"Republic of Sudan, Deng Alor Koul, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Embassy of the Republic of Sudan, 2210 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20008.\"  App. 172.  The clerk certified that the service packet had been sent and, a few days later, certified that a signed receipt had been returned.1  After Sudan failed to appear in the litigation, the District Court for the District of Columbia held an evidentiary hearing and entered a $314 million default judgment against Sudan.  Again at respondents' request, the clerk of the court mailed a copy of the default judgment in the same manner that the clerk had previously used.  See \u00a71608(e).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With their default judgment in hand, respondents turned to the District Court for the Southern District of New York, where they sought to register the judgment and satisfy it through orders requiring several banks to turn over Sudanese assets.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71963 (providing for registration of judgments for enforcement in other districts).  Pursuant to \u00a71610(c), the District Court entered an order confirming that a sufficient period of time had elapsed following the entry and notice of the default judgment, and the court then issued three turnover orders.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point, Sudan made an appearance for the purpose of contesting jurisdiction.  It filed a notice of appeal from each of the three turnover orders and contended on appeal that the default judgment was invalid for lack of personal jurisdiction.  In particular, Sudan maintained that \u00a71608(a)(3) required that the service packet be sent to its foreign minister at his principal office in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, and not to the Sudanese Embassy in the United States.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected this argument and affirmed the orders of the District Court.  802 F.\u00a03d 399 (2015).  The Second Circuit reasoned that, although \u00a71608(a)(3) requires that a service packet be mailed \"to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of the foreign state concerned,\" the statute \"is silent as to a specific location where the mailing is to be addressed.\"  Id., at 404.  In light of this, the court concluded that \"the method chosen by plaintiffs--a mailing addressed to the minister of foreign affairs at the embassy--was consistent with the language of the statute and could reasonably be expected to result in delivery to the intended person.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sudan filed a petition for rehearing, and the United States filed an amicus curiae brief in support of Sudan's petition.  The panel ordered supplemental briefing and heard additional oral argument, but it once again affirmed, reiterating its view that \u00a71608(a)(3) \"does not specify that the mailing be sent to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs in the foreign country.\"  838 F.\u00a03d 86, 91 (CA2 2016).  The court thereafter denied Sudan's petition for rehearing en banc.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subsequent to the Second Circuit's decision, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held in a similar case that \u00a71608(a)(3) \"does not authorize delivery of service to a foreign state's embassy even if it correctly identifies the intended recipient as the head of the ministry of foreign affairs.\"  Kumar v. Republic of Sudan, 880 F.\u00a03d 144, 158 (2018), cert. pending, No. 17-1269.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict.  585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018)\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question before us concerns the meaning of \u00a71608(a)(3), and in interpreting that provision, \"[w]e begin 'where all such inquiries must begin: with the language of the statute itself.'\u00a0\"  Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. v. Novo Nordisk A\/S, 566 U.\u00a0S. 399, 412 (2012) (quoting United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U.\u00a0S. 235, 241 (1989)).  As noted, \u00a71608(a)(3) requires that service be sent \"by any form of mail requiring a signed receipt, to be addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of the foreign state concerned.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The most natural reading of this language is that service must be mailed directly to the foreign minister's office in the foreign state.  Although this is not, we grant, the only plausible reading of the statutory text, it is the most natural one.  See, e.g., United States v. Hohri, 482 U.\u00a0S. 64, 69-71 (1987) (choosing the \"more natural\" reading of a statute); ICC v. Texas, 479 U.\u00a0S. 450, 456-457 (1987) (same); see also Florida Dept. of Revenue v. Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 554 U.\u00a0S. 33, 41 (2008) (similar).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A key term in \u00a71608(a)(3) is the past participle \"addressed.\"  A letter or package is \"addressed\" to an intended recipient when his or her name and \"address\" is placed on the outside of the item to be sent.  And the noun \"address,\" in the sense relevant here, means \"the designation of a place (as a residence or place of business) where a person or organization may be found or communicated with.\"  Webster's Third New International Dictionary 25 (1971) (Webster's Third); see also Webster's Second New International Dictionary 30 (1957) (\"the name or description of a place of residence, business, etc., where a person may be found or communicated with\"); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 17 (1966) (\"the place or the name of the place where a person, organization, or the like is located or may be reached\"); American Heritage Dictionary 15 (1969) (\"[t]he location at which a particular organization or person may be found or reached\"); Oxford English Dictionary 106 (1933) (OED) (\"the name of the place to which any one's letters are directed\").  Since a foreign nation's embassy in the United States is neither the residence nor the usual place of business of that nation's foreign minister and is not a place where the minister can customarily be found, the most common understanding of the minister's \"address\" is inconsistent with the interpretation of \u00a71608(a)(3) adopted by the court below and advanced by respondents.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We acknowledge that there are circumstances in which a mailing may be \"addressed\" to the intended recipient at a place other than the individual's residence or usual place of business.  For example, if the person sending the mailing does not know the intended recipient's current home or business address, the sender might use the intended recipient's last known address in the hope that the mailing will be forwarded.  Or a sender might send a mailing to a third party who is thought to be in a position to ensure that the mailing is ultimately received by the intended recipient.  But in the great majority of cases, addressing a mailing to X means placing on the outside of the mailing both X's name and the address of X's residence or customary place of work.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 1608(a)(3)'s use of the term \"dispatched\" points in the same direction.  To \"dispatch\" a communication means \"to send [it] off or away (as to a special destination) with promptness or speed often as a matter of official business.\"  Webster's Third 653; see also OED 478 (\"To send off post-haste or with expedition or promptitude (a messenger, message, etc., having an express destination)\").  A person who wishes to \"dispatch\" a letter to X will generally send it directly to X at a place where X is customarily found.  The sender will not \"dispatch\" the letter in a roundabout way, such as by directing it to a third party who, it is hoped, will then send it on to the intended recipient.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few examples illustrate this point.  Suppose that a person is instructed to \"address\" a letter to the Attorney General of the United States and \"dispatch\" the letter (i.e., to \"send [it] off post-haste\") to the Attorney General.  The person giving these instructions would likely be disappointed and probably annoyed to learn that the letter had been sent to, let us say, the office of the United States Attorney for the District of Idaho.  And this would be so even though a U.\u00a0S. Attorney's office is part of the Department headed by the Attorney General and even though such an office would very probably forward the letter to the Attorney General's office in Washington.  Similarly, a person who instructs a subordinate to dispatch a letter to the CEO of a big corporation that owns retail outlets throughout the country would probably be irritated to learn that the letter had been mailed to one of those stores instead of corporate headquarters.  To \"dispatch\" a letter to an addressee connotes sending it directly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A similar understanding underlies the venerable \"mailbox rule.\"  As first-year law students learn in their course on contracts, there is a presumption that a mailed acceptance of an offer is deemed operative when \"dispatched\" if it is \"properly addressed.\"  Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 66, p. 161 (1979) (Restatement); Rosenthal v. Walker, 111 U.\u00a0S. 185, 193 (1884).  But no acceptance would be deemed properly addressed and dispatched if it lacked, and thus was not sent to, the offeror's address (or an address that the offeror held out as the place for receipt of an acceptance).  See Restatement \u00a7 66, Comment b.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is also significant that service under \u00a71608(a)(3) requires a signed returned receipt, a standard method for ensuring delivery to the addressee.  Cf. Black's Law Dictionary 1096 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"certified mail\" as \"[m]ail for which the sender requests proof of delivery in the form of a receipt signed by the addressee\").  We assume that certified mail sent to a foreign minister will generally be signed for by a subordinate, but the person who signs for the minister's certified mail in the foreign ministry itself presumably has authority to receive mail on the minister's behalf and has been instructed on how that mail is to be handled.  The same is much less likely to be true for an employee in the mailroom of an embassy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For all these reasons, we think that the most natural reading of \u00a71608(a)(3) is that the service packet must bear the foreign minister's name and customary address and that it be sent to the minister in a direct and expeditious way.  And the minister's customary office is the place where he or she generally works, not a farflung outpost that the minister may at most occasionally visit.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several related provisions in \u00a71608 support this reading.  See Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.\u00a0S. 803, 809 (1989) (\"It is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme\").\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One such provision is \u00a71608(b)(3)(B).  Section 1608(b) governs service on \"an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state.\"  And like \u00a71608(a)(3), \u00a71608(b)(3)(B) requires delivery of a service packet to the intended recipient \"by any form of mail requiring a signed receipt, to be addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court.\"  But \u00a71608(b)(3)(B), unlike \u00a71608(a)(3), contains prefatory language saying that service by this method is permissible \"if reasonably calculated to give actual notice.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents read \u00a71608(a)(3) as embodying a similar requirement.  See Brief for Respondents 34.  At oral argument, respondents' counsel stressed this point, arguing that respondents' interpretation of \u00a71608(a)(3) \"gives effect\" to the \"familiar\" due process standard articulated in Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.\u00a0S. 306 (1950), which is \"the notion that [service] must be reasonably calculated to give notice.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-38.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This argument runs up against two well-settled principles of statutory interpretation.  First, \"Congress generally acts intentionally when it uses particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another.\"  Department of Homeland Security v. MacLean, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 7).  Because Congress included the \"reasonably calculated to give actual notice\" language only in \u00a71608(b), and not in \u00a71608(a), we resist the suggestion to read that language into \u00a71608(a).  Second, \"we are hesitant to adopt an interpretation of a congressional enactment which renders superfluous another portion of that same law.\"  Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U.\u00a0S. 825, 837 (1988).  Here, respondents encounter a superfluity problem when they argue that the \"addressed and dispatched\" clause in \u00a71608(a)(3) gives effect to the Mullane due process standard.  They fail to account for the fact that \u00a71608(b)(3)(B) contains both the \"addressed and dispatched\" and \"reasonably calculated to give actual notice\" requirements.  If respondents were correct that \"addressed and dispatched\" means \"reasonably calculated to give notice,\" then the phrase \"reasonably calculated to give actual notice\" in \u00a71608(b)(3) would be superfluous.  Thus, as the dissent agrees, \u00a71608(a)(3) \"does not deem a foreign state properly served solely because the service method is reasonably calculated to provide actual notice.\"  Post, at 2 (opinion of Thomas, J.).\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 1608(b)(2) similarly supports our interpretation of  \u00a71608(a)(3).  Section 1608(b)(2) provides for delivery of a service packet to an officer or a managing or general agent of the agency or instrumentality of a foreign state or \"to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process in the United States.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This language is significant for three reasons.  First, it expressly allows service on an agent.  Second, it specifies the particular individuals who are permitted to be served as agents of the recipient.  Third, it makes clear that service on the agent may occur in the United States if an agent here falls within the provision's terms.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Congress had contemplated anything similar under \u00a71608(a)(3), there is no apparent reason why it would not have included in that provision terms similar to those in \u00a71608(b)(2).  Respondents would have us believe that Congress was content to have the courts read such terms into \u00a71608(a)(3).  In view of \u00a71608(b)(2), this seems unlikely.2  See also post, at 2 (\"Nor does the FSIA authorize service on a foreign state by utilizing an agent designated to receive process for the state\").\n3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 1608(c) further buttresses our reading of \u00a71608(a)(3).  Section 1608(c) sets out the rules for determining when service \"shall be deemed to have been made.\"  For the first three methods of service under \u00a71608(a), service is deemed to have occurred on the date indicated on \"the certification, signed and returned postal receipt, or other proof of service applicable to the method of service employed.\"  \u00a71608(c)(2).  The sole exception is service under \u00a71608(a)(4), which requires the Secretary of State to transmit a service packet to the foreign state through diplomatic channels.  Under this method, once the Secretary has transmitted the packet, the Secretary must send to the clerk of the court \"a certified copy of the diplomatic note indicating when the papers were transmitted.\"  \u00a71608(a)(4).  And when service is effected in this way, service is regarded as having occurred on the transmittal date shown on the certified copy of the diplomatic note.  \u00a71608(c)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under all these methods, service is deemed to have occurred only when there is a strong basis for concluding that the service packet will very shortly thereafter come into the hands of a foreign official who will know what needs to be done.  Under \u00a71608(a)(4), where service is transmitted by the Secretary of State through diplomatic channels, there is presumably good reason to believe that the service packet will quickly come to the attention of a high-level foreign official, and thus service is regarded as having been completed on the date of transmittal.  And under \u00a7\u00a71608(a)(1), (2), and (3), where service is deemed to have occurred on the date shown on a document signed by the person who received it from the carrier, Congress presumably thought that the individuals who signed for the service packet could be trusted to ensure that the service packet is handled properly and expeditiously.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is easy to see why Congress could take that view with respect to a person designated for the receipt of process in a \"special arrangement for service between the plaintiff and the foreign state or political subdivision,\" \u00a71608(a)(1), and a person so designated under \"an applicable international convention,\" \u00a71608(a)(2).  But what about \u00a71608(a)(3), the provision now before us?  Who is more comparable to those who sign for mail under \u00a7\u00a71608(a)(1) and (2)?  A person who works in the office of the foreign minister in the minister's home country and is authorized to receive and process the minister's mail?  Or a mailroom employee in a foreign embassy?  We think the answer is obvious, and therefore interpreting \u00a71608(a)(3) to require that a service packet be sent to a foreign minister's own office better harmonizes the rules for determining when service is deemed to have been made.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents seek to soften the blow of an untimely delivery to the minister by noting that the foreign state can try to vacate a default judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(c).  Brief for Respondents 27.  But that is a poor substitute for sure and timely receipt of service, since a foreign state would have to show \"good cause\" to vacate the judgment under that Rule.  Here, as with the previously mentioned provisions in \u00a71608, giving \u00a71608(a)(3) its ordinary meaning better harmonizes the various provisions in \u00a71608 and avoids the oddities that respondents' interpretation would create.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ordinary meaning of the \"addressed and dispatched\" requirement in \u00a71608(a)(3) also has the virtue of avoiding potential tension with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure first.  At the time of the FSIA's enactment, Rule 4(i), entitled \"Alternative provisions for service in a foreign-country,\" set out certain permissible methods of service on \"part[ies] in a foreign country.\"  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\u00a04(i)(1) (1976).  One such method was \"by any form of mail, requiring a signed receipt, to be addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the party to be served.\"  Rule 4(i)(1)(D) (emphasis added).  Rule 4(i)(2) further provided that \"proof of service\" pursuant to that method \"shall include a receipt signed by the addressee or other evidence of delivery to the addressee satisfactory to the court.\"  (Emphasis added.)  The current version of Rule 4 is similar.  See Rules 4(f\u00a0)(2)(C)(ii), 4(l)(2)(B).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The virtually identical methods of service outlined in Rule 4 and \u00a71608(a)(3) pose a problem for respondents' position: If mailing a service packet to a foreign state's embassy in the United States were sufficient for purposes of \u00a71608(a)(3), then it would appear to be easier to serve the foreign state than to serve a person in that foreign state.  This is so because a receipt signed by an embassy employee would not necessarily satisfy Rule 4 since such a receipt would not bear the signature of the foreign minister and might not constitute evidence that is sufficient to show that the service packet had actually been delivered to the minister.  It would be an odd state of affairs for a foreign state's inhabitants to enjoy more protections in federal courts than the foreign state itself, particularly given that the foreign state's immunity from suit is at stake.  The natural reading of \u00a71608(a)(3) avoids that oddity.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our interpretation of \u00a71608(a)(3) avoids concerns regarding the United States' obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.  We have previously noted that the State Department \"helped to draft the FSIA's language,\" and we therefore pay \"special attention\" to the Department's views on sovereign immunity.  Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela v. Helmerich & Payne Int'l Drilling Co., 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 9).  It is also \"well settled that the Executive Branch's interpretation of a treaty 'is entitled to great weight.'\u00a0\"  Abbott v. Abbott, 560 U.\u00a0S. 1, 15 (2010) (quoting Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagliano, 457 U.\u00a0S. 176, 185 (1982)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 22(1) of the Vienna Convention provides: \"The premises of the mission shall be inviolable.  The agents of the receiving State may not enter them, except with the consent of the head of the mission.\"  Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, Apr. 18, 1961, 23 U.\u00a0S. T. 3237, T. I. A. S. No. 7502.  Since at least 1974, the State Department has taken the position that Article 22(1)'s principle of inviolability precludes serving a foreign state by mailing process to the foreign state's embassy in the United States.  See Service of Legal Process by Mail on Foreign Governments in the United States, 71 Dept. State Bull. 458-459 (1974). In this case, the State Department has reiterated this view in amicus curiae briefs filed in this Court and in the Second Circuit.  The Government also informs us that United States embassies do not accept service of process when the United States is sued in a foreign court, and the Government expresses concern that accepting respondents' interpretation of \u00a71608 might imperil this practice.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25-26.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Contending that the State Department held a different view of Article 22(1) before 1974, respondents argue that the Department's interpretation of the Vienna Convention is wrong, but we need not decide this question. By giving \u00a71608(a)(3) its most natural reading, we avoid the potential international implications of a contrary interpretation.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents' remaining arguments do not alter our conclusion.  First, respondents contend that \u00a71608(a)(3) says nothing about where the service packet must be sent.  See Brief for Respondents 22 (\"the statute is silent as to the location where the service packet should be sent\").  But while it is true that \u00a71608(a)(3) does not expressly provide where service must be sent, it is common ground that this provision must implicitly impose some requirement.  Respondents acknowledge this when they argue that the provision demands that service be sent \"to a location that is likely to have a direct line of communication to the foreign minister.\"  Id., at 34; cf. post, at 6 (stating that sending a letter to a Washington-based embassy \"with a direct line of communication\" to the foreign minister seems as efficient as sending it to the minister's office in the foreign state).  The question, then, is precisely what \u00a71608(a)(3) implicitly requires.  Respondents assure us that a packet sent to \"an embassy plainly would qualify,\" while a packet sent to \"a tourism office plainly would not.\"  Brief for Respondents 34.  But if the test is whether \"a location .\u00a0.\u00a0. is likely to have a direct line of communication to the foreign minister,\" ibid., it is not at all clear why service could not be sent to places in the United States other than a foreign state's embassy.  Why not allow the packet to be sent, for example, to a consulate?  The residence of the foreign state's ambassador?  The foreign state's mission to the United Nations?  Would the answer depend on the size or presumed expertise of the staff at the delivery location?  The difficult line-drawing problems that flow from respondents' interpretation of \u00a71608(a)(3) counsel in favor of maintaining a clear, administrable rule: The service packet must be mailed directly to the foreign minister at the minister's office in the foreign state.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, respondents (and the dissent, see post, at 5-6) contrast the language of \u00a71608(a)(3) with that of \u00a71608(a)(4), which says that service by this method requires that process be sent to the Secretary of State in \"Washington, District of Columbia.\"  If Congress wanted to require that process under \u00a71608(a)(3) be sent to a foreign minister's office in the minister's home country, respondents ask, why didn't Congress use a formulation similar to that in \u00a71608(a)(4)?  This is respondents' strongest argument, and in the end, we see no entirely satisfactory response other than that \u00a71608(a) does not represent an example of perfect draftsmanship.  We grant that the argument based on the contrasting language in \u00a71608(a)(4) cuts in respondents' favor, but it is outweighed in our judgment by the countervailing arguments already noted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, respondents contend that it would be \"the height of unfairness to throw out [their] judgment\" based on the highly technical argument belatedly raised by petitioner.  See Brief for Respondents 35.  We understand respondents' exasperation and recognize that enforcing compliance with \u00a71608(a)(3) may seem like an empty formality in this particular case, which involves highly publicized litigation of which the Government of Sudan may have been aware prior to entry of default judgment.  But there are circumstances in which the rule of law demands adherence to strict requirements even when the equities of a particular case may seem to point in the opposite direction.  The service rules set out in \u00a71608(a)(3), which apply to a category of cases with sensitive diplomatic implications, clearly fall into this category.  Under those rules, all cases must be treated the same.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, as respondents' counsel acknowledged at oral argument, holding that Sudan was not properly served under \u00a71608(a)(3) is not the end of the road.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 56.  Respondents may attempt service once again under \u00a71608(a)(3), and if that attempt fails, they may turn to \u00a71608(a)(4).  When asked at argument to provide examples of any problems with service under \u00a71608(a)(4), respondents' counsel stated that he was unaware of any cases where such service failed.  Id., at 59-62.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We interpret \u00a71608(a)(3) as it is most naturally understood: A service packet must be addressed and dispatched to the foreign minister at the minister's office in the foreign state.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nThomas, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 16-1094\nREPUBLIC OF SUDAN, PETITIONER v. RICK HARRISON, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit\n[March 26, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court holds that service on a foreign state by certified mail under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) is defective unless the packet is \"addressed and dispatched to the foreign minister at the minister's office in the foreign state.\"  Ante, at 17 (emphasis added).  This bright-line rule may be attractive from a policy perspective, but the FSIA neither specifies nor precludes the use of any particular address.  Instead, the statute requires only that the packet be sent to a particular person--\"the head of the ministry of foreign affairs.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71608(a)(3).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the unique role that embassies play in facilitating communications between states, a foreign state's embassy in Washington, D. C., is, absent an indication to the contrary, a place where a U.\u00a0S. litigant can serve the state's foreign minister.  Because there is no evidence in this case suggesting that Sudan's Embassy declined the service packet addressed to its foreign minister--as it was free to do--I would hold that respondents complied with the FSIA when they addressed and dispatched a service packet to Sudan's Minister of Foreign Affairs at Sudan's Embassy in Washington, D. C.  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To serve a foreign state by certified mail under the FSIA, the service packet must be \"addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of the foreign state concerned.\"  Ibid.  In many respects, I approach this statutory text in the same way as the Court.  I have no quarrel with the majority's definitions of the relevant statutory terms, ante, at 6-7, and I agree that the FSIA does not deem a foreign state properly served solely because the service method is reasonably calculated to provide actual notice, ante, at 9-10, 15-16.  Nor does the FSIA authorize service on a foreign state by utilizing an agent designated to receive process for the state.  Ante, at 10-11.  At the same time, the FSIA stops short of requiring that the foreign minister personally receive or sign for the service packet:  As long as the service packet is \"addressed and dispatched .\u00a0.\u00a0. to\" the foreign minister, \u00a71608(a)(3), the minister's subordinates may accept the packet and act appropriately on his behalf.  Ante, at 8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, I agree with the majority that \u00a71608(a)(3) requires that the service packet be dispatched to an address for the foreign minister.  The relevant question, in my view, is whether a foreign state's embassy in the United States can serve as a place where the minister of foreign affairs may be reached by mail.  Unlike the majority, I conclude that it can.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A foreign state's embassy in Washington, D.\u00a0C., is generally a place where a U.\u00a0S. court can communicate by mail with the state's foreign minister.  Unless an embassy decides to decline packages containing judicial summonses--as it is free to do, both in individual cases or as a  broader policy--a service packet addressed and dispatched to a foreign minister at the address of its embassy in the United States satisfies \u00a71608(a)(3).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because embassies are \"responsible for state-to-state relationships,\" Malone, The Modern Diplomatic Mission, in The Oxford Handbook of Modern Diplomacy 124 (A. Cooper, J. Heine, & R. Thakur eds. 2013), an important function of an embassy or other \"diplomatic mission\" is to \"act as a permanent channel of communication between the sending state and the receiving state.\"  G. Berridge & A. James, A Dictionary of Diplomacy 73 (2d ed. 2003).  Embassies fulfill this function in numerous ways, including by using secure faxes, e-mails, or the \"diplomatic bag\" to transmit documents to the states they represent.  A. Aust, Handbook of International Law 122 (2d ed. 2010); see ibid. (the diplomatic bag is a mailbag or freight container containing diplomatic documents or articles intended for official use).  Thus, as one amicus brief aptly puts it, embassies \"have direct lines of communications with the home country, and a pipeline to route communications to the proper offices and officials.\"  Brief for Former U.\u00a0S. Counterterrorism Officials et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 29.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Numerous provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (VCDR) confirm this reality, Apr. 18, 1961, 23 U. S. T. 3227, T. I. A. S. No. 7502.  Under the VCDR, an embassy \"may employ all appropriate means\" of communicating with the state whose interests it represents, Art. 27(1), including \"modern means of communication such as (mobile) telecommunication, fax, and email,\" Wouters, Duquet, & Meuwissen, The Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations, in The Oxford Handbook of Modern Diplomacy, supra, at 523.  The VCDR provides substantial protections for the \"official correspondence of the mission\" and the diplomatic bag, which may include \"diplomatic documents or articles intended for official use.\"  Arts. 27(1)-(5); cf. Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, Arts. 3, 5(j), 35, Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U. S. T. 77, T. I. A. S. No. 6820 (recognizing that embassies may perform \"[c]onsular functions,\" such as \"transmitting judicial and extrajudicial documents,\" and affording protections to official communications).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The capability of an embassy to route service papers to the sending state is confirmed by the State Department regulation implementing \u00a71608(a)(4), which provides for service on the foreign state through diplomatic channels.  Under this regulation, the Department may deliver the service packet \"to the embassy of the foreign state in the District of Columbia\" \"[i]f the foreign state so requests or if otherwise appropriate.\"  22 CFR \u00a793.1(c)(2) (2018).  Although the service packet under \u00a71608(a)(4) need not be addressed and dispatched to the foreign minister, the regulation implementing it nevertheless demonstrates that embassies do in fact provide a channel of communication between the United States and foreign countries.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was against this backdrop that respondents requested that their service packet be \"addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of [Sudan],\" \u00a71608(a)(3), at the address of its embassy in Washington, D.\u00a0C.  Because an embassy serves as a channel through which the U.\u00a0S. Government can communicate with the sending state's minister of foreign affairs, this method of service complied with the ordinary meaning of \u00a71608(a)(3) on this record.  There is--and this is critical--no evidence in the record showing that Sudan's foreign minister could not be reached through the embassy.  As the majority acknowledges, the clerk received a signed return receipt and a shipping confirmation stating that the package had been delivered.  Ante, at 3.  Nothing on the receipt or confirmation indicated that the package could not be delivered to its addressee, and both the clerk and the District Judge determined that service had been properly effectuated.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, the FSIA does not impose a substantive obligation on the embassy to accept or transmit service of process directed to the attention of the foreign minister.  A foreign state and its embassy are free to reject some or all packets addressed to the attention of the foreign minister.  But, as detailed above, Sudan has pointed to nothing in the record suggesting that its embassy refused service, or that its embassy address was not a place at which its foreign minister could be reached.  On these facts, I would hold that the service packet was properly \"addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs.\"  \u00a71608(a)(3).\nIII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead of focusing on whether service at an embassy satisfies the FSIA, the Court articulates a bright-line rule: To comply with \u00a71608(a)(3), \"[a] service packet must be addressed and dispatched to the foreign minister at the minister's office in the foreign state.\"  Ante, at 17 (emphasis added).  Whatever virtues this rule possesses, the Court's interpretation is not the \"most natural reading\" of \u00a71608(a)(3), ante, at 6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court focuses on the foreign minister's \"customary office\" or \"place of work,\" ante, at 9, 7, but these terms appear nowhere in \u00a71608.  The FSIA requires that the service packet be \"addressed and dispatched\" to a particular person--\"the head of the ministry of foreign affairs.\"  \u00a71608(a)(3).  It does not further require that the package be addressed and dispatched to any particular place.  While I agree with the Court that sending the service packet to the foreign ministry is one way to satisfy \u00a71608(a)(3), that is different from saying that \u00a71608(a)(3) requires service exclusively at that location.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The absence of a textual foundation for the majority's rule is only accentuated when \u00a71608(a)(3) is compared to \u00a71608(a)(4), the adjacent paragraph governing service through diplomatic channels.  Under that provision, the service packet must be \"addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the Secretary of State in Washington, District of Columbia, to the attention of the Director of Special Consular Services.\"  \u00a71608(a)(4) (emphasis added); see 22 CFR \u00a793.1(c) (State Department regulation governing service under this provision).  Unlike \u00a71608(a)(3), this provision specifies both the person to be served and the location of service.  While not dispositive, the absence of a similar limitation in \u00a71608(a)(3) undermines the categorical rule adopted by the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court offers three additional arguments in support of its position, but none justifies its bright-line rule.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Court offers a series of hypotheticals to suggest that the term \"dispatched\" not only contemplates a prompt shipment, but also connotes sending the letter directly to a place where the person is likely to be physically located.  Ante, at 7-8.  In my opinion, these hypotheticals are inapt.  The unique role of an embassy in facilitating communications between sovereign governments does not have an analog in the hypotheticals offered by the majority.1  And to the extent the statute emphasizes speed and directness, as the majority suggests, dispatching a letter to a Washington-based embassy with a direct line of communication to the foreign minister--including the ability to communicate electronically--seems at least as efficient as dispatching the letter across the globe to a foreign country, particularly if that country has recently experienced armed conflict or political instability.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the Court notes that, under its rule, the effective date of service under \u00a71608(c) will be closer in time to when the service packet reaches a foreign official who knows how to respond to the summons.  Ante, at 11-12.  That contention assumes embassy employees are less capable of responding to a summons than foreign-ministry employees.  But even granting that premise, this argument falls short.  An embassy is capable of quickly transmitting a summons to the foreign minister, whether electronically, by diplomatic bag, or by some other means.  Any time lost in transmission is not significant enough to warrant the Court's departure from the text of the statute.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, the Court argues that allowing service at the embassy would make it easier to serve a foreign state than it is to serve a person in that foreign state under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4.  Ante, at 13-14.  I am not persuaded.  Under the FSIA, service by mail is not effective until \"the date of receipt indicated in the .\u00a0.\u00a0. signed and returned postal receipt.\"  \u00a71608(c)(2).  That is no more generous than practice under Rule 4, especially since the foreign minister need not accept service.  To the extent that embassies accept service of process directed to the foreign minister, it is that decision that eases the burden on the plaintiff, not \u00a71608(a)(3).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sudan also argues that allowing service by mail at an embassy would violate Article 22(1) of the VCDR.  The Court does not adopt Sudan's argument, stating only that its decision has \"the virtue of avoiding potential tension\" with the VCDR.  Ante, at 13.  But there is no tension between my reading of the FSIA and the VCDR.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 22(1) of the VCDR provides that the premises of the mission--that is, \"the buildings or parts of buildings and the land ancillary thereto .\u00a0.\u00a0. used for the purposes of the mission,\" Art. 1(i)--\"shall be inviolable.\"  The VCDR consistently uses the word \"inviolable\" to protect against physical intrusions and similar types of interference, not the jurisdiction of a court.  The concept of \"inviolability\" is used, for instance, to protect the mission's \"premises,\" Art.\u00a022(1); the \"archives and documents of the mission,\" Art. 24; the \"official correspondence of the mission,\" Art. 27(2); the \"private residence of a diplomatic agent,\" Art. 30(1); and the diplomatic agent's \"person,\" \"papers, correspondence, and,\" with certain exceptions, \"his property,\" Arts. 29, 30(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The provisions of the VCDR that protect against assertions of jurisdiction, by contrast, speak in terms of \"immunity.\"  Thus, in addition to physical inviolability, the premises of the mission (and \"other property thereon\") are separately \"immune from search, requisition, attachment or execution.\"  Art. 22(3).  And a diplomatic agent is separately \"immun[e] from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State\" and, generally, from \"its civil and administrative jurisdiction.\"  Art. 31(1).  Several provisions of the VCDR distinguish between \"immunity from jurisdiction, and inviolability.\"  Art. 38(1); see Arts. 31(1), (3).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the VCDR's consistent use of \"inviolability\" to protect against physical intrusions and interference, and \"immunity\" to protect against judicial authority, Article 22(1)'s protection of the mission premises is best understood as a protection against the former.  Thus, under the VCDR, the inviolability of the embassy's premises is not implicated by receipt of service papers to any greater degree than it is by receipt of other mail.  Cf. Reyes v. Al-Malki, [2017] UKSC 61, \u00b616 (holding that service via mail at the diplomatic residence--which is afforded the same level of protection as the mission premises under Article 30(1)--does not violate the VCDR).\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the method of service employed by respondents here complied with the FSIA, I would affirm the judgment of the Second Circuit.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Sudan questions whether respondents named the correct foreign minister and whether the Sudanese Embassy received the service packet.  Because we find the service deficient in any event, we assume for the sake of argument that the correct name was used and that the Embassy did receive the packet.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Notably, the idea of treating someone at a foreign state's embassy as an agent for purposes of service on the foreign state was not unfamiliar to Congress.  An earlier proposed version of the FSIA would have permitted service on a foreign state by sending the service packet \"to the ambassador or chief of mission of the foreign state.\"  See S. 566, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a71608, p.\u00a06 (1973).\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0To the extent the relationship between a U.\u00a0S. Attorney's office and the Attorney General is analogous, the majority correctly acknowledges that the office would \"very probably forward\" a letter directed to the attention of the Attorney General.  Ante, at 8.  The majority nevertheless believes that it would be improper or unusual to dispatch that letter to a local U.\u00a0S. Attorney's office.  I disagree.  It seems entirely likely that a person residing in the District of Idaho would dispatch a letter to the Attorney General through the U.\u00a0S. Attorney's office serving his District--even if it would be odd for a resident of the District of Columbia to use that Idaho address.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Even if there were, the FSIA postdates the VCDR and thus \"\u00a0'renders the treaty null'\u00a0\" \"\u00a0'to the extent of conflict.'\u00a0\"  Breard v. Greene, 523 U.\u00a0S. 371, 376 (1998) (per curiam) (quoting Reid v. Covert, 354 U.\u00a0S. 1, 18 (1957) (plurality opinion)).\n\n\n","55":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRETURN MAIL, INC. v. UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE ET AL.(2019)\nNo. 17-1594\nArgued: February 19, 2019Decided: June 10, 2019\n\n\nThe Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) of 2011 created the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a76(c), and established three types of administrative review proceedings before the Board that enable a \"person\" other than the patent owner to challenge the validity of a patent post-issuance: (1) \"inter partes review,\" \u00a7311; (2) \"post-grant review,\" \u00a7321; and (3) \"covered-business-method review\" (CBM review), note following \u00a7321.  After an adjudicatory proceeding, the Board either confirms the patent claims or cancels some or all of them, \u00a7\u00a7318(b), 328(b).  Any \"dissatisfied\" party may then seek judicial review in the Federal Circuit, \u00a7\u00a7319, 329.  In addition to AIA review proceedings, a patent can be reexamined either in federal court during a defense to an infringement suit, \u00a7282(b), or in an ex\u00a0parte reexamination by the Patent Office, \u00a7\u00a7301(a), 302(a).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Return Mail, Inc., owns a patent that claims a method for processing undeliverable mail.  The Postal Service subsequently introduced an enhanced address-change service to process undeliverable mail, which Return Mail asserted infringed its patent.  The Postal Service petitioned for ex\u00a0parte reexamination of the patent, but the Patent Office confirmed the patent's validity.  Return Mail then sued the Postal Service in the Court of Federal Claims, seeking compensation for the unauthorized use of its invention.  While that suit was pending, the Postal Service petitioned for CBM review.  The Patent Board concluded that the subject matter of Return Mail's claims was ineligible to be patented and thus canceled the claims underlying its patent.  The Federal Circuit affirmed, concluding, as relevant here, that the Government is a \"person\" eligible to petition for CBM review.\nHeld:\u00a0The Government is not a \"person\" capable of instituting the three AIA review proceedings.  Pp.\u00a06-18.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0In the absence of an express definition of the term \"person\" in the patent statutes, the Court applies a \"longstanding interpretive presumption that 'person' does not include the sovereign,\" and thus excludes a federal agency like the Postal Service.  Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.\u00a0S. 765, 780-781.  This presumption reflects \"common usage,\" United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U.\u00a0S. 258, 275, as well as an express directive from Congress in the Dictionary Act, 1 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71.  The Dictionary Act does not include the Federal Government among the persons listed in the definition of \"person\" that courts use \"[i]n determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the context indicates otherwise,\" \u00a71.  Contrary to the Postal Service's contention otherwise, this Court has, in several instances, applied the presumption against treating the Government as a statutory person even when, as here, doing so would exclude the Government or one of its agencies from accessing a benefit or favorable procedural device.  See, e.g., United States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U.\u00a0S. 600, 604-605, 614.  Thus, the Court here proceeds from the presumption that the Government is not a \"person\" authorized to initiate these proceedings absent an affirmative showing to the contrary.  Pp.\u00a07-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) The Postal Service must point to some indication in the AIA's text or context affirmatively showing that Congress intended to include the Government as a \"person,\" but its arguments are unpersuasive.  Pp.\u00a09-17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1)\u00a0The Postal Service first argues that the AIA's reference to a \"person\" in the context of post-issuance review proceedings must include the Government because other references to persons in the patent statutes appear to do so.  The consistent-usage principle--i.e., when Congress uses a word to mean one thing in one part of the statute, it will mean the same thing elsewhere in the statute--however, \"\u00a0'\u00a0readily yields to context,\u00a0'\u00a0\" especially when a statutory term is used throughout a statute and takes on \"distinct characters\" in distinct statutory provisions.  Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U.\u00a0S. 302, 320.  Here, where there are at least 18 references to \"person[s]\" in the Patent Act and the AIA, no clear trend is shown: Sometimes \"person\" plainly includes or excludes the Government, but sometimes, as here, it might be read either way.  The mere existence of some Government-inclusive references cannot make the \"affirmative showing,\" Stevens, 529 U.\u00a0S., at 781, required to overcome the presumption that the Government is not a \"person\" eligible to petition for AIA review proceedings.  Pp.\u00a09-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2)\u00a0The Postal Service next points to the Federal Government's longstanding history with the patent system, arguing that because federal officers have been able to apply for patents in the name of the United States since 1883, Congress must have intended to allow the Government access to AIA review proceedings.  But the Government's ability to obtain a patent does not speak to whether Congress meant for the Government to participate as a third-party challenger in AIA proceedings established only eight years ago.  Moreover, even assuming that the Government may petition for ex\u00a0parte reexamination of an issued patent, as a 1981 Patent Office Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP) indicates, an ex parte reexamination process is fundamentally different from an AIA review proceeding.  The former process is internal, and the party challenging the patent may not participate.  By contrast, adversarial, adjudicatory AIA review proceedings are between the \"person\" who petitioned for review and the patent owner; they include briefing, a hearing, discovery, and the presentation of evidence; and the losing party has appeal rights.  Congress may have had good reason to authorize the Government to initiate a hands-off ex\u00a0parte reexamination but not to become a party to the AIA's full-blown adversarial proceeding.  Nothing suggests that Congress had the 1981 MPEP statement about ex\u00a0parte reexamination in mind when it created the AIA review proceedings.  And because there is no \"settled\" meaning of the term \"person\" with respect to the newly established AIA review proceedings, see Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.\u00a0S. 624, 645, the MPEP does not justify putting aside the presumptive meaning of \"person.\"  Pp.\u00a013-15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(3)\u00a0Finally, the Postal Service argues that it must be a \"person\" who may petition for AIA review proceedings because, like other potential infringers, it is subject to civil liability and can assert a defense of patent invalidity.  It would thus be anomalous, the Postal Service posits, to deny it a benefit afforded to other infringers--namely, the ability to challenge a patent de\u00a0novo before the Patent Office, rather than only with clear and convincing evidence in defense to an infringement suit.  Federal agencies, however, face lower and more calculable risks than nongovernmental actors, so it is reasonable for Congress to have treated them differently.  Excluding federal agencies from AIA review proceedings also avoids the awkward situation of having a civilian patent owner defend the patentability of her invention in an adversarial, adjudicatory proceeding initiated by one federal agency and overseen by a different federal agency.

The question presented in this case is whether a federal agency is a \"person\" able to seek such review under the statute.  We conclude that it is not.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Constitution empowers Congress \"[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective .\u00a0.\u00a0. Discoveries.\"  Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8.  Pursuant to that authority, Congress established the United States Patent and Trademark Office (Patent Office) and tasked it with \"the granting and issuing of patents.\"  35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71, 2(a)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To obtain a patent, an inventor submits an application describing the proposed patent claims to the Patent Office.  See \u00a7\u00a7111(a)(1), 112.  A patent examiner then reviews the application and prior art (the information available to the public at the time of the application) to determine whether the claims satisfy the statutory requirements for patentability, including that the claimed invention is useful, novel, nonobvious, and contains eligible subject matter.  See \u00a7\u00a7101, 102, 103.  If the Patent Office accepts the claim and issues a patent, the patent owner generally obtains exclusive rights to the patented invention throughout the United States for 20 years.  \u00a7\u00a7154(a)(1), (2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After a patent issues, there are several avenues by which its validity can be revisited.  The first is through a defense in an infringement action.  Generally, one who intrudes upon a patent without authorization \"infringes the patent\" and becomes subject to civil suit in the federal district courts, where the patent owner may demand a jury trial and seek monetary damages and injunctive relief.  \u00a7\u00a7271(a), 281-284.  If, however, the Federal Government is the alleged patent infringer, the patent owner must sue the Government in the United States Court of Federal Claims and may recover only \"reasonable and entire compensation\" for the unauthorized use.  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71498(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once sued, an accused infringer can attempt to prove by clear and convincing evidence \"that the patent never should have issued in the first place.\"  Microsoft Corp. v. i4i L. P., 564 U.\u00a0S. 91, 96-97 (2011); see 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7282(b).  If a defendant succeeds in showing that the claimed invention falls short of one or more patentability requirements, the court may deem the patent invalid and absolve the defendant of liability.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Patent Office may also reconsider the validity of issued patents.  Since 1980, the Patent Act has empowered the Patent Office \"to reexamine--and perhaps cancel--a patent claim that it had previously allowed.\"  Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v. Lee, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 3).  This procedure is known as ex\u00a0parte reexamination.  \"Any person at any time\" may cite to the Patent Office certain prior art that may \"bea[r] on the patentability of any claim of a particular patent\"; and the person may additionally request that the Patent Office reexamine the claim on that basis.  35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7301(a), 302(a).  If the Patent Office concludes that the prior art raises \"a substantial new question of patentability,\" the agency may reexamine the patent and, if warranted, cancel the patent or some of its claims.  \u00a7\u00a7303(a), 304-307.  The Director of the Patent Office may also, on her \"own initiative,\" initiate such a proceeding.  \u00a7303(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1999 and 2002, Congress added an \"inter partes reexamination\" procedure, which similarly invited \"[a]ny person at any time\" to seek reexamination of a patent on the basis of prior art and allowed the challenger to participate in the administrative proceedings and any subsequent appeal.  See \u00a7311(a) (2000 ed.); \u00a7\u00a7314(a), (b) (2006 ed.); Cuozzo Speed Technologies, 579 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2011, Congress overhauled the patent system by enacting the America Invents Act (AIA), which created the Patent Trial and Appeal Board and phased out inter partes reexamination.  See 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a76; H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 112-98, pt. 1, pp.\u00a046-47.  In its stead, the AIA tasked the Board with overseeing three new types of post-issuance review proceedings.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the \"inter partes review\" provision permits \"a person\" other than the patent owner to petition for the review and cancellation of a patent on the grounds that the invention lacks novelty or nonobviousness in light of \"patents or printed publications\" existing at the time of the patent application.  \u00a7311.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the \"post-grant review\" provision permits \"a person who is not the owner of a patent\" to petition for review and cancellation of a patent on any ground of patentability.  \u00a7321; see \u00a7\u00a7282(b)(2), (b)(3).  Such proceedings must be brought within nine months of the patent's issuance.  \u00a7321.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, the \"covered-business-method review\" (CBM review) provision provides for changes to a patent that claims a method for performing data processing or other operations used in the practice or management of a financial product or service.  AIA \u00a7\u00a718(a)(1), (d)(1), 125 Stat. 329, note following 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7321, p.\u00a01442.  CBM review tracks the \"standards and procedures of\" post-grant review with two notable exceptions: CBM review is not limited to the nine months following issuance of a patent, and \"[a] person\" may file for CBM review only as a defense against a charge or suit for infringement.  \u00a718(a)(1)(B), 125 Stat. 330.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The AIA's three post-issuance review proceedings are adjudicatory in nature.  Review is conducted by a three-member panel of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a76(c), and the patent owner and challenger may seek discovery, file affidavits and other written memoranda, and request an oral hearing, see \u00a7\u00a7316, 326; AIA \u00a718(a)(1), 125 Stat. 329; Oil States Energy Services, LLC v. Greene's Energy Group, LLC, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2018) (slip op., at 3-4).  The petitioner has the burden of proving unpatentability by a preponderance of the evidence.  \u00a7\u00a7282, 316(e), 326(e).  The Board then either confirms the patent claims or cancels some or all of the claims.  \u00a7\u00a7318(b), 328(b).  Any party \"dissatisfied\" with the Board's final decision may seek judicial review in the Court of  \nAppeals for the Federal Circuit, \u00a7\u00a7319, 329; see \u00a7141(c), and the Director of the Patent Office may intervene, \u00a7143.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, in the post-AIA world, a patent can be reexamined either in federal court during a defense to an infringement action, in an ex\u00a0parte reexamination by the Patent Office, or in the suite of three post-issuance review proceedings before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board.  The central question in this case is whether the Federal Government can avail itself of the three post-issuance review proceedings, including CBM review.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Return Mail, Inc., owns U.\u00a0S. Patent No. 6,826,548 ('548 patent), which claims a method for processing mail that is undeliverable.  Beginning in 2003, the United States Postal Service allegedly began exploring the possibility of licensing Return Mail's invention for use in handling the country's undelivered mail.  But the parties never reached an agreement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2006, the Postal Service introduced an enhanced address-change service to process undeliverable mail.  Return Mail's representatives asserted that the new service infringed the '548 patent, and the company renewed its offer to license the claimed invention to the Postal Service.  In response, the Postal Service petitioned for ex\u00a0parte reexamination of the '548 patent.  The Patent Office canceled the original claims but issued several new ones, confirming the validity of the '548 patent.  Return Mail then sued the Postal Service in the Court of Federal Claims, seeking compensation for the Postal Service's unauthorized use of its invention, as reissued by the Patent Office.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the lawsuit was pending, the Postal Service again petitioned the Patent Office to review the '548 patent, this time seeking CBM review.  The Patent Board instituted review.  The Board agreed with the Postal Service that Return Mail's patent claims subject matter that was ineligible to be patented, and it canceled the claims underlying the '548 patent.  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed.  See 868 F.\u00a03d 1350 (2017).  As relevant here, the Federal Circuit held, over a dissent, that the Government is a \"person\" eligible to petition for CBM review.  Id., at 1366; see AIA \u00a718(a)(1)(B), 125 Stat. 330 (only a qualifying \"person\" may petition for CBM review).  The court then affirmed the Patent Board's decision on the merits, invalidating Return Mail's patent claims.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to determine whether a federal agency is a \"person\" capable of petitioning for post-issuance review under the AIA.2  586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The AIA provides that only \"a person\" other than the patent owner may file with the Office a petition to institute a post-grant review or inter partes review of an issued patent.  35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7311(a), 321(a).  The statute likewise provides that a \"person\" eligible to seek CBM review may not do so \"unless the person or the person's real party in interest or privy has been sued for infringement.\"  AIA \u00a718(a)(1)(B), 125 Stat. 330.  The question in this case is whether the Government is a \"person\" capable of instituting the three AIA review proceedings.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The patent statutes do not define the term \"person.\"  In  \nthe absence of an express statutory definition, the Court applies a \"longstanding interpretive presumption that 'person' does not include the sovereign,\" and thus excludes a federal agency like the Postal Service.  Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.\u00a0S. 765, 780-781 (2000); see United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U.\u00a0S. 258, 275 (1947); United States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U.\u00a0S. 600, 603-605 (1941); United States v. Fox, 94 U.\u00a0S. 315, 321 (1877).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This presumption reflects \"common usage.\"  Mine Workers, 330 U.\u00a0S., at 275.  It is also an express directive from Congress: The Dictionary Act has since 1947 provided the definition of \"\u00a0'person' \" that courts use \"[i]n determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the context indicates otherwise.\"  1 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71; see Rowland v. California Men's Colony, Unit II Men's Advisory Council, 506 U.\u00a0S. 194, 199-200 (1993).  The Act provides that the word \" 'person' .\u00a0.\u00a0. include[s] corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals.\"  \u00a71.  Notably absent from the list of \"person[s]\" is the Federal Government.  See Mine Workers, 330 U.\u00a0S., at 275 (reasoning that Congress' express inclusion of partnerships and corporations in \u00a71 implies that Congress did not intend to include the Government).  Thus, although the presumption is not a \"hard and fast rule of exclusion,\" Cooper, 312 U.\u00a0S., at 604-605, \"it may be disregarded only upon some affirmative showing of statutory intent to the contrary,\" Stevens, 529 U.\u00a0S., at 781.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Postal Service contends that the presumption is strongest where interpreting the word \"person\" to include the Government imposes liability on the Government, and is weakest where (as here) interpreting \"person\" in that way benefits the Government.  In support of this argument, the Postal Service points to a different interpretive canon: that Congress must unequivocally express any waiver of sovereign immunity for that waiver to be effective.  See FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.\u00a0S. 284, 290 (2012). That clear-statement rule inherently applies only when a party seeks to hold the Government liable for its actions; otherwise immunity is generally irrelevant.  In the Postal Service's view, the presumption against treating the Government as a statutory person works in tandem with the clear-statement rule regarding immunity, such that both apply only when a statute would subject the Government to liability.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our precedents teach otherwise.  In several instances, this Court has applied the presumption against treating the Government as a statutory person when there was no question of immunity, and doing so would instead exclude the Federal Government or one of its agencies from accessing a benefit or favorable procedural device.  In Cooper, 312 U.\u00a0S., at 604-605, 614, for example, the Court held that the Federal Government was not \"\u00a0'[a]ny person'\u00a0\" who could sue for treble damages under \u00a77 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.  Accord, International Primate Protection League v. Administrators of Tulane Ed. Fund, 500 U.\u00a0S. 72, 82-84 (1991) (concluding that the National Institutes of Health was not authorized to remove an action as a \"\u00a0'person acting under [a federal]' officer\" pursuant to 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71442(a)(1)); Davis v. Pringle, 268 U.\u00a0S. 315, 317-318 (1925) (reasoning that \"normal usages of speech\" indicated that the Government was not a \"person\" entitled to priority under the Bankruptcy Act); Fox, 94 U.\u00a0S., at 321 (holding that the Federal Government was not a \"\u00a0'person capable by law of holding real estate,'\u00a0\" absent \"an express definition to that effect\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, although the presumption against treating the Government as a statutory person is \"\u00a0'particularly applicable where it is claimed that Congress has subjected the [sovereign] to liability to which they had not been subject before,'\u00a0\" Stevens, 529 U.\u00a0S., at 781, it is hardly confined to such cases.  Here, too, we proceed from the presumption that the Government is not a \"person\" authorized to initiate these proceedings absent an affirmative showing to the contrary.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the presumption that a statutory reference to a \"person\" does not include the Government, the Postal Service must show that the AIA's context indicates otherwise.  Although the Postal Service need not cite to \"an express contrary definition,\" Rowland, 506 U.\u00a0S., at 200, it must point to some indication in the text or context of the statute that affirmatively shows Congress intended to include the Government.  See Cooper, 312 U.\u00a0S., at 605.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Postal Service makes three arguments for displacing the presumption.  First, the Postal Service argues that the statutory text and context offer sufficient evidence that the Government is a \"person\" with the power to petition for AIA review proceedings.  Second, the Postal Service contends that federal agencies' long history of participation in the patent system suggests that Congress intended for the Government to participate in AIA review proceedings as well.  Third, the Postal Service maintains that the statute must permit it to petition for AIA review because \u00a71498 subjects the Government to liability for infringement.  None delivers.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Postal Service first argues that the AIA's reference to a \"person\" in the context of post-issuance review proceedings must include the Government because other references to persons in the patent statutes appear to do so.  Indeed, it is often true that when Congress uses a word to mean one thing in one part of the statute, it will mean the same thing elsewhere in the statute.  See Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U.\u00a0S. 71, 86 (2006).  This principle, however, \"readily yields to context,\" especially when a statutory term is used throughout a statute and takes on \"distinct characters\" in distinct statutory provisions.  See Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U.\u00a0S. 302, 320 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).  That is the case here.  The Patent Act and the AIA refer to \"person[s]\" in at least 18 different places, and there is no clear trend: Sometimes \"person\" plainly includes the Government,3 sometimes it plainly excludes the Government,4 and sometimes--as here--it might be read either way.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Looking on the bright side, the Postal Service and the dissent, see post, at 2, focus on \u00a7207(a)(1), which authorizes \"[e]ach [f]ederal agency\" to \"apply for, obtain, and maintain patents or other forms of protection .\u00a0.\u00a0. on inventions in which the Federal Government owns a right, title, or interest.\"  It follows from \u00a7207(a)(1)'s express inclusion of  \nfederal agencies among those eligible to apply for patents that the statute's references to \"person[s]\" in the subsections governing the patent-application process and questions of patentability (\u00a7\u00a7102(a), 118, and 119) must also include federal agencies.5  In other words, the right described in \u00a7207(a)(1) provides a sufficient contextual clue that the word \"person\"--when used in the other provisions governing the application process \u00a7207(a)(1) makes available to federal agencies--includes the Government.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But \u00a7207(a)(1) provides no such clue as to the interpretation of the AIA review provisions because it implies nothing about what a federal agency may or may not do following the issuance of someone else's patent.  Conversely, reading the review provisions to exclude the Government has no bearing on a federal agency's right to obtain a patent under \u00a7207(a)(1).  An agency may still apply for and obtain patents whether or not it may petition for a review proceeding under the AIA seeking cancellation of a patent it does not own.  There is thus no reason to think that \"person\" must mean the same thing in these two different parts of the statute.  See Utility Air, 573 U.\u00a0S., at 320.6\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Postal Service cites other provisions that may refer to the Government--namely, the \"intervening rights\" provisions that offer certain protections for \"any person\" who is lawfully making or using an invention when the Patent Office modifies an existing patent claim in a way that deems the person's (previously lawful) use to be infringement.  See \u00a7\u00a7252, 307(b), 318(c), 328(c).  The Postal Service argues that the Government must be among those protected by these provisions and from there deduces that it must also be permitted to petition for AIA review proceedings because the review provisions and the intervening-rights provisions were all added to the Patent Act by the AIA at the same time.  See Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551 U.\u00a0S. 224, 232 (2007) (invoking the consistent-usage canon where the same term was used in related provisions enacted at the same time).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But regardless of whether the intervening-rights provisions apply to the Government (a separate interpretive question that we have no occasion to answer here), the Postal Service's chain of inferences overlooks a confounding link: The consistent-usage canon breaks down where Congress uses the same word in a statute in multiple conflicting ways.  As noted, that is the case here.  In the face of such inconsistency, the mere existence of some Government-inclusive references cannot make the \"affirmative showing,\" Stevens, 529 U.\u00a0S., at 781, required to overcome the presumption that Congress did not intend to include the Government among those \"person[s]\" eligible to petition for AIA review proceedings.7\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Postal Service next points to the Federal Government's longstanding history with the patent system.  It reminds us that federal officers have been able to apply for patents in the name of the United States since 1883, see Act of Mar. 3, 1883, 22 Stat. 625--which, in the Postal Service's view, suggests that Congress intended to allow the Government access to AIA review proceedings as well.  But, as already explained, the Government's ability to obtain a patent under \u00a7207(a)(1) does not speak to whether Congress meant for the Government to participate as a third-party challenger in AIA review proceedings.  As to those proceedings, there is no longstanding practice: The AIA was enacted just eight years ago.8\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More pertinently, the Postal Service and the dissent both note that the Patent Office since 1981 has treated federal agencies as \"persons\" who may cite prior art to the agency or request an ex\u00a0parte reexamination of an issued patent.  See post, at 5.  Recall that \u00a7301(a) provides that \"[a]ny person at any time may cite to the Office in writing .\u00a0.\u00a0. prior art .\u00a0.\u00a0. which that person believes to have a bearing on the patentability of any claim of a particular patent.\"  As memorialized in the Patent Office's Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP), the agency has understood \u00a7301's reference to \"any person\" to include \"governmental entit[ies].\"  Dept. of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office, MPEP \u00a7\u00a72203, 2212 (4th rev. ed., July 1981).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We might take account of this \"executive interpretation\"  \nif we were determining whether Congress meant to include the Government as a \"person\" for purposes of the ex\u00a0parte reexamination procedures themselves.  See, e.g., United States v. Hermanos y Compa\u00f1ia, 209 U.\u00a0S. 337, 339 (1908).  Here, however, the Patent Office's statement in the 1981 MPEP has no direct relevance.  Even assuming that the Government may petition for ex\u00a0parte reexamination, ex\u00a0parte reexamination is a fundamentally different process than an AIA post-issuance review proceeding.9  Both share the common purpose of allowing non-patent owners to bring questions of patent validity to the Patent Office's attention, but they do so in meaningfully different ways.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In an ex\u00a0parte reexamination, the third party sends information to the Patent Office that the party believes bears on the patent's validity, and the Patent Office decides whether to reexamine the patent.  If it decides to do so, the reexamination process is internal; the challenger is not permitted to participate in the Patent Office's process.  See 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7302, 303.  By contrast, the AIA post-issuance review proceedings are adversarial, adjudicatory proceedings between the \"person\" who petitioned for review and the patent owner: There is briefing, a hearing, discovery, and the presentation of evidence, and the losing party has appeal rights.  See supra, at 4-5.  Thus, there are good reasons Congress might have authorized the Government to initiate a hands-off ex\u00a0parte reexamination but not to become a party to a full-blown adversarial proceeding before the Patent Office and any subsequent  \nappeal.  After all, the Government is already in a unique position among alleged infringers given that 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71498 limits patent owners to bench trials before the Court of Federal Claims and monetary damages, whereas 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7271 permits patent owners to demand jury trials in the federal district courts and seek other types of relief.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, there is nothing to suggest that Congress had the 1981 MPEP statement in mind when it enacted the AIA.  It is true that this Court has often said, \"[w]hen administrative and judicial interpretations have settled the meaning of an existing statutory provision, repetition of the same language in a new statute indicates, as a general matter, the intent to incorporate its administrative and judicial interpretations as well.\"  Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.\u00a0S. 624, 645 (1998).  But there is no \"settled\" meaning of the term \"person\" with respect to the newly established AIA review proceedings.  Accordingly, the MPEP does not justify putting aside the presumptive meaning of \"person\" here.\n3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Postal Service argues that it must be a \"person\" who may petition for AIA review proceedings because, like other potential infringers, it is subject to civil liability and can assert a defense of patent invalidity.  See \u00a7\u00a7282(b)(2)-(3).  In the Postal Service's view, it is anomalous to deny it a benefit afforded to other infringers--the ability to challenge a patent de\u00a0novo before the Patent Office, rather than only as an infringement defense that must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.  See ibid.; Microsoft Corp., 564 U.\u00a0S., at 95 (holding that \u00a7282's presumption of validity in litigation imposes a clear and convincing evidence standard on defendants seeking to prove invalidity).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Postal Service overstates the asymmetry.  Agencies retain the ability under \u00a7282 to assert defenses to infringement.  Once sued, an agency may, like any other accused infringer, argue that the patent is invalid, and the agency faces the same burden of proof as a defendant in any other infringement suit.  The Postal Service lacks only the additional tool of petitioning for the initiation of an administrative proceeding before the Patent Office under the AIA, a process separate from defending an infringement suit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We see no oddity, however, in Congress' affording nongovernmental actors an expedient route that the Government does not also enjoy for heading off potential infringement suits.  Those other actors face greater and more uncertain risks if they misjudge their right to use technology that is subject to potentially invalid patents.  Most notably, \u00a71498 restricts a patent owner who sues the Government to her \"reasonable and entire compensation\" for the Government's infringing use; she cannot seek an injunction, demand a jury trial, or ask for punitive damages, all of which are available in infringement suits against nongovernmental actors under \u00a7271(e)(4).  Thus, although federal agencies remain subject to damages for impermissible uses, they do not face the threat of preliminary injunctive relief that could suddenly halt their use of a patented invention, and they enjoy a degree of certainty about the extent of their potential liability that ordinary accused infringers do not.  Because federal agencies face lower risks, it is reasonable for Congress to have treated them differently.10\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, excluding federal agencies from the AIA review proceedings avoids the awkward situation that might result from forcing a civilian patent owner (such as Return Mail) to defend the patentability of her invention in an adversarial, adjudicatory proceeding initiated by one federal agency (such as the Postal Service) and overseen by a different federal agency (the Patent Office).  We are therefore unpersuaded that the Government's exclusion from the AIA review proceedings is sufficiently anomalous to overcome the presumption that the Government is not a \"person\" under the Act.11\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the foregoing reasons, we hold that a federal agency is not a \"person\" who may petition for post-issuance re \nview under the AIA.  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nBreyer, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1594\nRETURN MAIL, INC., PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE, et al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit\n[June 10, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan join, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When A sues B for patent infringement, B may defend against the lawsuit by claiming that A's patent is invalid.  In court, B must prove the invalidity of A's patent by \"clear and convincing evidence.\"  Microsoft Corp. v. i4i L. P., 564 U.\u00a0S. 91, 95 (2011).  Congress, however, has also established a variety of administrative procedures that B may use to challenge the validity of A's patent.  Although some of the statutes setting forth these administrative procedures have existed for several decades, we consider here the three administrative procedures that Congress established in the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011.  See ante, at 3-5.  All three involve hearings before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, which is part of the Patent and Trademark Office.  And all three involve a lower burden of proof: B need only prove by a preponderance of the evidence that A's patent is invalid.  35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7316(e), 326(e); see America Invents Act, \u00a718(a)(1), 125 Stat. 329.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The America Invents Act states that all three administrative procedures may be invoked only by a \"person.\"  35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7311(a), 321(a); America Invents Act, \u00a718(a)(1)(B), 125 Stat. 330.  Here we must decide whether the Government falls within the scope of the word \"person.\"  Are federal agencies entitled to invoke these administrative procedures on the same terms as private parties?  In my view, the answer is \"yes.\"  For purposes of these statutes, Government agencies count as \"persons\" and so may invoke these procedures to challenge the validity of a patent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court reaches the opposite conclusion based on the interpretive presumption that the word \"person\" excludes the Government.  See ante, at 7.  This presumption, however, is \"no hard and fast rule of exclusion.\"  United States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U.\u00a0S. 600, 604-605 (1941).  We have long said that this presumption may be overcome when \"\u00a0'[t]he purpose, the subject matter, the context, the legislative history, [or] the executive interpretation .\u00a0.\u00a0. indicate an intent'\u00a0\" to include the Government.  International Primate Protection League v. Administrators of Tulane Ed. Fund, 500 U.\u00a0S. 72, 83 (1991) (quoting Cooper, supra, at 605).  And here these factors indicate that very intent.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The language of other related patent provisions strongly suggests that, in the administrative review statutes at issue here, the term \"person\" includes the Government.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Patent Act states that \"[e]ach Federal agency is authorized\" to \"apply for, obtain, and maintain patents or other forms of protection .\u00a0.\u00a0. on inventions in which the Federal Government owns a right, title, or interest.\"  35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7207(a)(1).  The Act then provides that a \"per- son\" shall be \"entitled to a patent\" if various \"[c]onditions for patentability\" have been met.  \u00a7102(a)(1) (emphasis added).  It authorizes a \"person to whom the inventor has assigned\" an invention to apply for a patent in some circumstances.  \u00a7118 (emphasis added).  And it generally allows \"any person\" who initially files a patent application in a foreign country to obtain in the United States the advantage of that earlier filing date.  \u00a7119 (emphasis added).  Because the Government is authorized to \"obtain\" patents, there is no dispute here that the word \"person\" in these patent-eligibility provisions must include the Government.  See ante, at 10-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now consider a few of the statutory provisions that help those accused of infringing a patent.  Suppose A obtains a patent in Year One, modifies this patent in Year Three, and then accuses B of infringing the patent as modified in Year Five.  What if B's conduct infringes the modified patent but did not infringe A's patent as it originally stood in Year One?  In these circumstances, Congress has provided that A generally cannot win an infringement suit against B.  The relevant statutes, known as the \"intervening rights\" provisions, state that B is entitled to a defense that his conduct did not violate the original, unmodified patent.  \u00a7\u00a7252, 307(b), 318(c), 328(c).  These statutes, several of which were enacted alongside the three administrative review procedures in the America Invents Act, provide that a \"person\" may take advantage of this defense.  Ibid. (emphasis added).  Again, as the parties all agree, the word \"person\" in these provisions includes the Government.  See Reply Brief 3; Lamson v. United States, 117 Fed. Cl. 755, 760 (2014) (noting that the Government may \"avail itself of any defense that is available to a private party in an infringement action\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority refers to several patent-related provisions that use the word \"person\" but that do not include the Government within the scope of that term.  See ante, at 10, and n.\u00a04. These provisions, however, concern details of administration that, almost by definition, could not involve an entity such as the Government.  The first provision cited by the majority says that administrative patent judges must be \"persons of competent legal knowledge and scientific ability.\"  \u00a76(a).  Patent judges are human beings, not governments or corporations or other artificial entities.  The second requires the Patent Office to keep confidential a referral to the Attorney General of possible fraud unless the Government charges \"a person\" with a related criminal offense.  \u00a7257(e).  Although the word \"person\" here could refer to a corporation, it cannot refer to the Government, for governments do not charge themselves with crimes.  The third concerns payment for the \"subsistence expenses and travel-related expenses\" of \"persons\" who attend certain programs relating to intellectual property law.  \u00a72(b)(11).  But governments as entities do not travel, attend events, or incur expenses for \"subsistence\" or \"lodging\"; only their employees do.  Ibid.  (The majority also refers to a fourth provision, which defines a \"joint research agreement\" as an agreement between \"2 or more persons or entities.\"  \u00a7100(h).  If the Government is not a \"person\" under this provision, it is only because the adjacent term \"entities\" already covers the Government.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact that the word \"person\" does not apply to the Government where that application is close to logically impossible proves nothing at all about the word's application here.  On the one hand, Congress has used the word \"person\" to refer to Government agencies when the statute concerns the criteria for obtaining patents, or when the statute concerns the availability of certain infringement defenses.  On the other, Congress has not used the word \"person\" to refer to Government agencies when doing so would be close to logically impossible, or where the context otherwise makes plain that the Government is not a \"person.\"  The provisions at issue here, which establish administrative procedures for the benefit of parties accused of infringement, are much closer to the former category than the latter.  It therefore makes little sense to presume that the word \"person\" excludes the Government, for the surrounding provisions point to the opposite conclusion.\nII   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statutes' purposes, as illuminated by the legislative history and longstanding executive interpretation, show even more clearly that Congress intended the term \"person\" to include the Government in this context.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress enacted the new administrative review procedures for two basic reasons.  First, Congress sought to \"improve the quality of patents\" and \"make the patent system more efficient\" by making it easier to challenge \"questionable patents.\"  H. R. Rep. No. 112-98, pt. 1, pp. 39, 48 (2011); see id., at 39 (noting the \"growing sense that questionable patents are too easily obtained and are too difficult to challenge\"); id., at 45 (explaining that pre-existing administrative procedures were \"less viable alternativ[es] to litigation .\u00a0.\u00a0. than Congress intended\").  Congress' goal of providing an easier way for parties to challenge \"questionable patents\" is implicated to the same extent whether the Government or a private party is the one accused of infringing an invalid patent.  That is perhaps why the Executive Branch has long indicated that Government agencies count as \"perso[ns]\" who are entitled to invoke the administrative review procedures that predate the America Invents Act.  See Dept. of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office, Manual of Patent Examining Procedure \u00a7\u00a72203, 2212 (4th rev. ed., Sept. 1982).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the statutes help maintain a robust patent system in another way: They allow B, a patent holder who might be sued for infringing A's (related) patent, to protect B's own patent by more easily proving the invalidity of A's patent.  Insofar as this objective underlies the statutes at issue here, it applies to the same extent whether B is a private person or a Government agency.  Indeed, the Patent Act explicitly states that the Government may \"maintain\" patents and \"undertake all other suitable and necessary steps to protect and administer rights to federally owned inventions on behalf of the Federal Government.\"  35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7207(a)(1), (3).  And the use of administrative procedures to \"protect\" a patented invention from claims of infringement (by clearing away conflicting pat-ents that cover the same or similar ground) would seem to be \"suitable and necessary\" whether a private person or a Government agency invokes these procedures.  Cf. Halo Electronics, Inc. v. Pulse Electronics, Inc., 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 14) (noting that a third-party patent covering part of an invention may be used to exact \"licensing fees\" from the inventor); Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. v. Roxane Laboratories, Inc., 903 F.\u00a03d 1310, 1337 (CA Fed. 2018) (explaining that a third-party patent covering part of an invention may be used to deter or curtail the inventor's use of the invention).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority responds that allowing a Government agency to invoke these administrative procedures would create an \"awkward situation,\" as one Government agency--namely, the Patent Office--would end up adjudicating the patent rights of another Government agency.  Ante, at 17.  But why is that \"awkward\"?  In the field of patent law, a Government agency facing a possible infringement suit has long been thought legally capable of invoking other forms of administrative review.  See Manual of Patent Examining Procedure \u00a7\u00a72203, 2212.  Moreover, the statutes before us presumably would permit a private party to invoke any of the three new procedures to challenge a Government patent.  In such cases, one Government agency, the Patent Office, would be asked to adjudicate the patent rights of another.  Thus, the situation the majority attempts to avoid is already baked into the cake.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority also says that because federal agencies \"do not face the threat of preliminary injunctive relief\" when they are sued for patent infringement, Congress could have reasonably concluded that it was not necessary for the Government to be able to use the administrative procedures at issue here.  Ante, at 16; see 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71498(a) (limiting the patentee to \"reasonable and entire compensation\" for infringement by the Government).  But patent infringement suits against the Government still threaten to impose large damages awards.  See, e.g., Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States, 31 Fed. Cl. 481, 488 (1994) (indicating that the value of the infringing technologies developed by the Government exceeded $3.5 billion); Pet. for Cert. in United States v. Hughes Aircraft Co., O. T. 1998, No. 98-871, p. 8 (noting that damages ultimately exceeded $100 million).  That fact can create a strong need for speedy resolution of a dispute over patent validity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When, for example, the Department of Homeland Security recently instituted a research initiative to equip cell phones with hazardous-materials sensors in order to mitigate the risk of terrorist attacks, it faced an infringement lawsuit that threatened to interfere with the project.  See Golden v. United States, 129 Fed. Cl. 630 (2016); Brief for Prof. Tejas N. Narechania as Amicus Curiae 9.  When the Federal Communications Commission tried to ensure that cell phones would be able to provide their current location automatically to 911 operators, the threat of infringement litigation delayed the deployment of technologies designed to comply with that requirement.  Narechania, Patent Conflicts, 103 Geo. L. J. 1483, 1498-1501 (2015).  And when Congress enacted statutes requiring the examination of electronic passports at airports, the Government faced the threat of an infringement suit because airlines could not \"comply with [their] legal obligations\" without engaging in activities that would allegedly infringe an existing patent.  IRIS Corp. v. Japan Air- lines Corp., 769 F.\u00a03d 1359, 1362 (CA Fed. 2014); see id., at 1363 (concluding that the Government may be sued based on the infringing activities of airlines).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I express no view on the merits of these actions.  I simply point out that infringement suits against the Government can threaten to injure Government interests even absent the threat of injunctive relief.  That fact runs counter to the majority's efforts to find an explanation for why Congress would have wanted to deny Government agencies the ability to invoke the speedier administrative procedures established by the America Invents Act.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That, in my view, is the basic question: Why?  Government agencies can apply for and obtain patents; they can maintain patents; they can sue other parties for infringing their patents; they can be sued for infringing patents held by private parties; they can invoke certain defenses to an infringement lawsuit on the same terms as private parties; they can invoke one of the pre-existing administrative procedures for challenging the validity of a private party's patents; and they can be forced to defend their own patents when a private party invokes one of the three procedures established by the America Invents Act.  Why, then, would Congress have declined to give federal agencies the power to invoke these same administrative procedures?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I see no good answer to that question.  Here, the statutes' \"purpos[es],\" the \"subject matter,\" the \"context,\" the \"legislative history,\" and the longstanding \"executive interpretation,\" together with the way in which related patent provisions use the term \"person,\" demonstrate that Congress meant for the word \"person\" to include Government agencies.  International Primate Protection League, 500 U.\u00a0S., at 83 (quoting Cooper, 312 U.\u00a0S., at 605).  I would affirm the Federal Circuit's similar conclusion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, with respect, I dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The CBM review program will stop accepting new claims in 2020.  See AIA \u00a718(a)(3)(A), 125 Stat. 330; 77 Fed. Reg. 48687 (2012).\nFootnote 2\u00a0The Federal Circuit rejected Return Mail's argument that the Postal Service cannot petition for CBM review for the independent reason that a suit against the Government under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71498 is not a suit for infringement.  868 F.\u00a03d 1350, 1366 (2017).  We denied Return Mail's petition for certiorari on this question and therefore have no occasion to resolve it in this case.  Accordingly, we assume that a \u00a71498 suit is one for infringement and refer to it as the same.\nFootnote 3\u00a0For example, the statute expressly includes the Government as a \"person\" in \u00a7296(a), which, as enacted, provided that States \"shall not be immune .\u00a0.\u00a0. from suit in Federal court by any person, including any governmental or nongovernmental entity, for infringement of a patent under section 271.\"  35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7296(a) (1988 ed., Supp. IV) (ruled unconstitutional by Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U.\u00a0S. 627, 630 (1999)).\nFootnote 4\u00a0For example, in \u00a76(a), the Patent Act provides that the administrative patent judges comprising the Board must be \"persons of competent legal knowledge and scientific ability.\"  Likewise, \u00a7257(e) requires the Patent Office Director to treat as confidential any referral to the Attorney General of suspected fraud in the patent process unless the United States charges \"a person\" with a criminal offense in connection with the fraud.  See also \u00a72(b)(11) (authorizing the Patent Office to cover the expenses of \"persons\" other than federal employees attending programs on intellectual-property protection); \u00a7100(h) (defining a \"\u00a0'joint research agreement'\u00a0\" as a written agreement between \"2 or more persons or entities\").  Some of these provisions (\u00a7\u00a72(b)(11), 6(a), and 100(h)) were enacted as part of the AIA, alongside the AIA review proceedings.  See 125 Stat. 285, 313, 335.\nFootnote 5\u00a0Section 102(a) provides that \"[a] person shall be entitled to a patent\" as long as the patent is novel.  Section 118 states that \"[a] person to whom the inventor has assigned\" an invention may file a patent application.  Section 119 discusses the effect of a patent application filed in a foreign country \"by any person\" on the patent-application process in the United States.\nFootnote 6\u00a0Likewise, we are not persuaded by the dissent's suggestion that \u00a7207(a)(3)--which authorizes federal agencies \"to protect and administer rights\" to federally owned inventions--provides a statutory basis for the Postal Service's initiation of AIA review proceedings.  See post, at 5-6.  The statute explains how a federal agency is to \"protect\" those rights: \"either directly or through contract,\" such as by \"acquiring rights for and administering royalties\" or \"licensing.\"  \u00a7207(a)(3).  The  AIA review proceedings, which a \"person\" may initiate regardless of ownership, do not fall clearly within the ambit of \u00a7207(a)(3).  \nFootnote 7\u00a0The dissent responds that we should set aside the statutory references to \"person[s]\" that naturally exclude the Government and instead count only those references that expressly or impliedly include the Government.  See post, at 3-4.  But the point of the canon the Postal  Service invokes is to ascertain the meaning of a statutory term from its consistent usage in other parts of the statute, not to pick sides among differing uses.\nFootnote 8\u00a0Moreover, for those of us who consider legislative history, there is none that suggests Congress considered whether the Federal Government or its agencies would have access to the AIA review proceedings.\nFootnote 9\u00a0As discussed above, see supra, at 2-4, ex\u00a0parte reexamination is not one of the three new proceedings added by the AIA, and therefore the question whether its reference to a \"person\" includes the Government is beyond the scope of the question presented.  Moreover, neither party contests that a federal agency may cite prior art to the Patent Office and ask for ex\u00a0parte reexamination.\nFootnote 10\u00a0If the Government were a \"person\" under the AIA, yet another anomaly might arise under the statute's estoppel provisions.  Those provisions generally preclude a party from relitigating issues in any subsequent proceedings in federal district court, before the International Trade Commission, and (for inter partes review and post-grant review) before the Patent Office.  See 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7315(e), 325(e); AIA  \u00a718(a)(1)(D), 125 Stat. 330.  Because infringement suits against the Government must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims--which is not named in the estoppel provisions--the Government might not be precluded by statute from relitigating claims raised before the Patent Office if it were able to institute post-issuance review under the AIA.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71498(a).  Although Return Mail cites this asymmetry in support of its interpretation, we need not rely on it, because Return Mail already prevails for the reasons given above.  At any rate, the practical effect of the estoppel provisions' potential inapplicability to the Government is uncertain given that this Court has not decided whether common-law estoppel applies in \u00a71498 suits.\nFootnote 11\u00a0Nor do we find persuasive the dissent's argument that the Postal Service should be allowed to petition for post-issuance review proceedings because its participation would further the purpose of the AIA: to provide a cost-effective and efficient alternative to litigation in the courts.  See post, at 5; H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 112-98, pt. 1, pp.\u00a047-48 (2001).  Statutes rarely embrace every possible measure that would further their general aims, and, absent other contextual indicators of Congress' intent to include the Government in a statutory provision referring to a \"person,\" the mere furtherance of the statute's broad purpose does not overcome the presumption in this case.

ORACLE USA, INC., ET AL.(2019)\nNo. 17-1625\nArgued: January 14, 2019Decided: March 4, 2019\n\n\nA jury awarded Oracle damages after finding that Rimini Street had infringed various Oracle copyrights.  After judgment, the District Court also awarded Oracle fees and costs, including $12.8 million for litigation expenses such as expert witnesses, e-discovery, and jury consulting.  In affirming the $12.8 million award, the Ninth Circuit acknowledged that it covered expenses not included within the six categories of costs that the general federal statute authorizing district courts to award costs, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920, provides may be awarded against a losing party.  The court  nonetheless held that the award was appropriate because the Copyright Act gives federal district courts discretion to award \"full costs\" to a party in copyright litigation, 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7505.\nHeld:\u00a0The term \"full costs\" in \u00a7505 of the Copyright Act means the costs specified in the general costs statute codified at \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.  Pp.\u00a03-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Sections 1821 and 1920 define what the term \"costs\" encompasses in subject-specific federal statutes such as \u00a7505.  Congress may authorize awards of expenses beyond the six categories specified in the general costs statute, but courts may not award litigation expenses that are not specified in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920 absent explicit authority.  This Court's precedents have consistently adhered to that approach.  See Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U.\u00a0S. 437; West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.\u00a0S. 83; Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548 U.\u00a0S. 291.  The Copyright Act does not explicitly authorize the award of litigation expenses beyond the six categories specified in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920, which do not authorize an award for expenses such as expert witness fees, e-discovery expenses, and jury consultant fees.  Pp.\u00a03-6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Oracle's counterarguments are not persuasive.  First, Oracle argues that the word \"full\" authorizes courts to award expenses beyond the costs specified in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.  The term \"full\" is an adjective that means the complete measure of the noun it modifies.  It does not, therefore, alter the meaning of the word \"costs\" in \u00a7505.  Rather, \"full costs\" are all the \"costs\" otherwise available under the relevant law.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, Oracle maintains that the term \"full costs\" in the Copyright Act is a historical term of art that encompasses more than the \"costs\" listed in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.  Oracle argues that Congress imported the meaning of the term \"full costs\" from the English copyright statutes into the Copyright Act in 1831.  It contends that the 1831 meaning of \"full costs\" allows the transfer of all expenses of litigation, beyond those specified in any costs schedule, and overrides anything that Congress enacted in the Fee Act of 1853 or any subsequent costs statute.  Courts need not, however, undertake extensive historical excavation to determine the meaning of costs statutes.  See Crawford Fitting Co., 482 U.\u00a0S., at 445.  In any event, Oracle has not shown that the phrase \"full costs\" had an established meaning in English or American law that covered more than the full amount of the costs listed in the applicable costs schedule.  Case law since 1831 also refutes Oracle's historical argument.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, Oracle advances a variety of surplusage arguments.  According to Oracle, after Congress made the costs award discretionary in 1976, district courts could award any amount of costs up to 100 percent, and so Rimini's reading of the word \"full\" now adds nothing to \"costs.\"  Because Congress would not have intended \"full\" to be surplusage, Oracle contends, Congress must have employed the term \"full\" to mean expenses beyond the costs specified in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.  But even if the term \"full\" lacked any continuing significance after 1976, the meaning of \"costs\" did not change.  Oracle's interpretation would also create its own redundancy problem by rendering the second sentence of \u00a7505--which covers attorney's fees--largely redundant because \u00a7505's first sentence presumably would already cover those fees.  Finally, Oracle's argument, even if correct, overstates the significance of statutory surplusage and redundancy.  See, e.g., Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U.\u00a0S. 371, 385.

In the general statute governing awards of costs, Congress has specified six categories of litigation expenses that qualify as \"costs.\"  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71821, 1920.  The question presented in this case is whether the Copyright Act's reference to \"full costs\" authorizes a court to award litigation expenses beyond the six categories of \"costs\" specified by Congress in the general costs statute.  The statutory text and our precedents establish that the answer is no.  The term \"full\" is a term of quantity or amount; it does not expand the categories or kinds of expenses that may be awarded as \"costs\" under the general costs statute.  In copyright cases, \u00a7505's authorization for the award of \"full costs\" therefore covers only the six categories specified in the general costs statute, codified at \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.  We reverse in relevant part the judgment of the U.\u00a0S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oracle develops and licenses software programs that manage data and operations for businesses and non-profit organizations.

In doing so, Rimini competes with Oracle's software maintenance services.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oracle sued Rimini and its CEO in Federal District Court in Nevada, asserting claims under the Copyright Act and various other federal and state laws.  Oracle alleged that Rimini, in the course of providing software support services to Oracle customers, copied Oracle's software without licensing it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A jury found that Rimini had infringed various Oracle copyrights and that both Rimini and its CEO had violated California and Nevada computer access statutes.  The jury awarded Oracle $35.6 million in damages for copyright infringement and $14.4 million in damages for violations of the state computer access statutes.  After judgment, the District Court ordered the defendants to pay Oracle an additional $28.5 million in attorney's fees and $4.95 million in costs; the Court of Appeals reduced the latter award to $3.4 million.  The District Court also ordered the defendants to pay Oracle $12.8 million for litigation expenses such as expert witnesses, e-discovery, and jury consulting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That $12.8 million award is the subject of the dispute in this case.  As relevant here, the U.\u00a0S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's $12.8 million award.  The Court of Appeals recognized that the general federal statute authorizing district courts to award costs, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920, lists only six categories of costs that may be awarded against the losing party.  And the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the $12.8 million award covered expenses not included within those six categories.  But the Court of Appeals, relying on Circuit precedent, held that the District Court's $12.8 million award for additional expenses was still appropriate because \u00a7505 permits the award of \"full costs,\" a term that the Ninth Circuit said was not confined to the six categories identified in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.  879 F.\u00a03d 948, 965\u2212966 (2018).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to resolve disagreement in the Courts of Appeals over whether the term \"full costs\" in \u00a7505 authorizes awards of expenses other than those costs identified in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.  585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).

Camex, Inc., 84 F.\u00a03d 292 (CA8 1996).\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress has enacted more than 200 subject-specific federal statutes that explicitly authorize the award of costs to prevailing parties in litigation.  The Copyright Act is one of those statutes.  That Act provides that a district court in a copyright case \"in its discretion may allow the recovery of full costs by or against any party other than the United States or an officer thereof.\"  17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7505.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the general \"costs\" statute, codified at \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920 of Title 28, Congress has specified six categories of litigation expenses that a federal court may award as \"costs,\"1 and Congress has detailed how to calculate the amount of certain costs.  Sections 1821 and 1920 in essence define what the term \"costs\" encompasses in the subject-specific federal statutes that provide for an award of costs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sections 1821 and 1920 create a default rule and establish a clear baseline against which Congress may legislate.  Consistent with that default rule, some federal statutes simply refer to \"costs.\"  In those cases, federal courts are limited to awarding the costs specified in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.  If, for particular kinds of cases, Congress wants to authorize awards of expenses beyond the six categories specified in the general costs statute, Congress may do so.  For example, some federal statutes go beyond \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920 to expressly provide for the award of expert witness fees or attorney's fees.  See West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.\u00a0S. 83, 89, n.\u00a04 (1991).  Indeed, the Copyright Act expressly provides for awards of attorney's fees as well as costs.  17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7505.  And the same Congress that enacted amendments to the Copyright Act in 1976 enacted several other statutes that expressly authorized awards of expert witness fees.  See Casey, 499 U.\u00a0S., at 88. But absent such express authority, courts may not award litigation expenses that are not specified in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our precedents have consistently adhered to that approach.  Three cases illustrate the point.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., the question was whether courts could award expert witness fees under Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Rule 54(d) authorizes an award of \"costs\" but does not expressly refer to expert witness fees.  482 U.\u00a0S. 437, 441 (1987).  In defining what expenses qualify as \"costs,\" \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920 likewise do not include expert witness fees.  We therefore held that the prevailing party could not obtain expert witness fees: When \"a prevailing party seeks reimbursement for fees paid to its own expert witnesses, a federal court is bound by the limit of \u00a71821(b), absent contract or explicit statutory authority to the contrary.\"  Id., at 439.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Casey, we interpreted 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71988, the federal statute authorizing an award of \"costs\" in civil rights litigation.  We described Crawford Fitting as holding that \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920 \"define the full extent of a federal court's power to shift litigation costs absent express statutory authority to go further.\"  499 U.\u00a0S., at 86.  In accord with Crawford Fitting, we concluded that \u00a71988 does not authorize awards of expert witness fees because \u00a71988 supplies no \"\u00a0'explicit statutory authority'\u00a0\" to award expert witness fees.  499 U.\u00a0S., at 87 (quoting Crawford Fitting, 482 U.\u00a0S., at 439).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, we considered the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which authorized an award of costs.  The question was whether that Act's reference to \"costs\" encompassed expert witness fees.  We again explained that \"costs\" is \"\u00a0'a term of art that generally does not include expert fees.'\u00a0\"  548 U.\u00a0S. 291, 297 (2006); see also Taniguchi v. Kan Pa- cific Saipan, Ltd., 566 U.\u00a0S. 560, 573 (2012).  We stated: \"[N]o statute will be construed as authorizing the taxation of witness fees as costs unless the statute 'refer[s] explicitly to witness fees.'\u00a0\"  Murphy, 548 U.\u00a0S., at 301 (quoting Crawford Fitting, 482 U.\u00a0S., at 445).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our cases, in sum, establish a clear rule: A statute awarding \"costs\" will not be construed as authorizing an award of litigation expenses beyond the six categories listed in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920, absent an explicit statutory instruction to that effect.  See Murphy, 548 U.\u00a0S., at 301 (requiring \"\u00a0'explici[t]'\u00a0\" authority); Casey, 499 U.\u00a0S., at 86 (requiring \"\u00a0'explicit'\u00a0\" authority); Crawford Fitting, 482 U.\u00a0S., at 439 (requiring \"explicit statutory authority\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, the Copyright Act does not explicitly authorize the award of litigation expenses beyond the six categories specified in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.  And \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920 in turn do not authorize an award for expenses such as expert witness fees, e-discovery expenses, and jury consultant fees, which were expenses encompassed by the District Court's $12.8 million award to Oracle here.  Rimini argues that the $12.8 million award therefore cannot stand.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To sustain its $12.8 million award, Oracle advances three substantial arguments.  But we ultimately do not find those arguments persuasive.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, although Oracle concedes that it would lose this case if the Copyright Act referred only to \"costs,\" Oracle stresses that the Copyright Act uses the word \"full\" before \"costs.\"  Oracle argues that the word \"full\" authorizes courts to award expenses beyond the costs specified in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.  We disagree.  \"Full\" is a term of quantity or amount.  It is an adjective that means the complete measure of the noun it modifies.  See American Heritage Dictionary 709 (5th ed. 2011); Oxford English Dictionary 247 (2d ed. 1989).  As we said earlier this Term: \"Adjectives modify nouns--they pick out a subset of a category that possesses a certain quality.\"  Weyerhaeuser Co. v. United States Fish and Wildlife Serv., 586 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 8).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The adjective \"full\" in \u00a7505 therefore does not alter the meaning of the word \"costs.\"  Rather, \"full costs\" are all the \"costs\" otherwise available under law.  The word \"full\" operates in the phrase \"full costs\" just as it operates in other common phrases: A \"full moon\" means the moon, not Mars.  A \"full breakfast\" means breakfast, not lunch.  A \"full season ticket plan\" means tickets, not hot dogs.  So too, the term \"full costs\" means costs, not other expenses.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dispute here, therefore, turns on the meaning of the word \"costs.\"  And as we have explained, the term \"costs\" refers to the costs generally available under the federal costs statute--\u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.  \"Full costs\" are all the costs generally available under that statute.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, Oracle maintains that the term \"full costs\" in the Copyright Act is a historical term of art that encompasses more than the \"costs\" listed in the relevant costs statute--here, \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.  We again disagree.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some general background: From 1789 to 1853, federal courts awarded costs and fees according to the relevant state law of the forum State.  See Crawford Fitting, 482 U.\u00a0S., at 439\u2212440; Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.\u00a0S. 240, 247\u2212250 (1975).  In 1853, Congress departed from that state-focused approach.  That year, Congress passed and President Fillmore signed a comprehensive federal statute establishing a federal schedule for the award of costs in federal court.  Crawford Fitting, 482 U.\u00a0S., at 440; 10 Stat. 161.  Known as the Fee Act of 1853, that 1853 statute has \"carried forward to today\" in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920 \"\u00a0'without any apparent intent to change the controlling rules.'\u00a0\"  Crawford Fitting, 482 U.\u00a0S., at 440.  As we have said, \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920 provide a comprehensive schedule of costs for proceedings in federal court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now some copyright law background: The term \"full [c]osts\" appeared in the first copyright statute in England, the Statute of Anne.  8 Anne c.19, \u00a78 (1710).  In the United States, the Federal Copyright Act of 1831 borrowed the phrasing of English copyright law and used the same term, \"full costs.\"  Act of Feb. 3, 1831, \u00a712, 4 Stat. 438-439.  That term has appeared in subsequent revisions of the Copyright Act, through the Act's most recent substantive alterations in 1976.  See Act of July 8, 1870, \u00a7108, 16 Stat. 215; Copyright Act of 1909, \u00a740, 35 Stat. 1084; Copyright Act of 1976, \u00a7505, 90 Stat. 2586.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oracle argues that English copyright statutes awarding \"full costs\" allowed the transfer of all expenses of litigation, beyond what was specified in any costs schedule.  According to Oracle, Congress necessarily imported that meaning of the term \"full costs\" into the Copyright Act in 1831.  And according to Oracle, that 1831 meaning overrides anything that Congress enacted in any costs statute in 1853 or later.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To begin with, our decision in Crawford Fitting explained that courts should not undertake extensive historical excavation to determine the meaning of costs statutes.  We said that \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920 apply regardless of when individual subject-specific costs statutes were enacted.  482 U.\u00a0S., at 445.  The Crawford Fitting principle eliminates the need for that kind of historical analysis and confirms that the Copyright Act's reference to \"full costs\" must be interpreted by reference to \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, Oracle's historical argument fails even on its own terms.  Oracle has not persuasively demonstrated that as of 1831, the phrase \"full costs\" had an established meaning in English or American law that covered more than the full amount of the costs listed in the applicable costs schedule.  On the contrary, the federal courts as of 1831 awarded costs in accord with the costs schedule of the relevant state law.  See id., at 439\u2212440; Alyeska Pipeline, 421 U.\u00a0S., at 250.  And state laws at the time tended to use the term \"full costs\" to refer to, among other things, full cost awards as distinguished from the half, double, or treble cost awards that were also commonly available under state law at the time.2  That usage accorded with the ordinary meaning of the term.  At the time, the word \"full\" conveyed the same meaning that it does today: \"Complete; entire; not defective or partial.\"  1 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 89 (1828); see also 1 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language 817 (1773) (\"Complete, such as that nothing further is desired or wanted; Complete without abatement; at the utmost degree\").  Full costs did not encompass expenses beyond those costs that otherwise could be awarded under the applicable state law.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The case law since 1831 also refutes Oracle's historical argument.  If Oracle's account of the history were correct, federal courts starting in 1831 presumably would have interpreted the term \"full costs\" in the Copyright Act to allow awards of litigation expenses that were not ordinarily available as costs under the applicable costs schedule.  But Rimini points out that none of the more than 800 available copyright decisions awarding costs from 1831 to 1976--that is, from the year the term \"full costs\" first appeared in the Copyright Act until the year that the Act was last significantly amended--awarded expenses other than those specified by the applicable state or federal law.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.  Oracle has not refuted Rimini's argument on that point.  Oracle cites no \u00a7505 cases where federal courts awarded expert witness fees or other litigation expenses of the kind at issue here until the Ninth Circuit's 2005 decision adopting the interpretation of \u00a7505 that the Ninth Circuit followed in this case.  See Twentieth Century Fox, 429 F.\u00a03d 869.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of the commonly understood meaning of the term \"full costs\" as of 1831 and the case law since 1831, Oracle's historical argument falls short.  The best interpretation is that the term \"full costs\" meant in 1831 what it means now: the full amount of the costs specified by the applicable costs schedule.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, Oracle advances a variety of surplusage arguments.  Oracle contends, for example, that the word \"full\" would be unnecessary surplusage if Rimini's argument were correct.  We disagree.  The award of costs in copyright cases was mandatory from 1831 to 1976.  See \u00a740, 35 Stat. 1084; \u00a712, 4 Stat. 438-439.  During that period, the term \"full\" fixed both a floor and a ceiling for the amount of \"costs\" that could be awarded.  In other words, the term \"full costs\" required an award of 100 percent of the costs available under the applicable costs schedule.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oracle says that even if that interpretation of \"full costs\" made sense before 1976, the meaning of the term \"full costs\" changed in 1976.  That year, Congress amended the Copyright Act to make the award of costs discretionary rather than mandatory.  See \u00a7505, 90 Stat. 2586.  According to Oracle, after Congress made the costs award discretionary, district courts could award any amount of costs up to 100 percent and so Rimini's reading of the word \"full\" now adds nothing to \"costs.\"  If we assume that Congress in 1976 did not intend \"full\" to be surplusage, Oracle argues that Congress must have employed the term \"full\" to mean expenses beyond the costs specified in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For several reasons, that argument does not persuade us.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To begin with, even if the term \"full\" lacked any continuing significance after 1976, the meaning of \"costs\" did not change.  The term \"costs\" still means those costs specified in \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.  It makes little sense to think that Congress in 1976, when it made the award of full costs discretionary rather than mandatory, silently expanded the kinds of expenses that a court may otherwise award as costs in copyright suits.3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, Oracle's interpretation would create its own redundancy problem by rendering the second sentence of \u00a7505 largely redundant.  That second sentence provides: \"Except as otherwise provided by this title, the court may also award a reasonable attorney's fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.\"  17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7505.  If Oracle were right that \"full costs\" covers all of a party's litigation expenditures, then the first sentence of \u00a7505 would presumably already cover attorney's fees and the second sentence would be largely unnecessary.  In order to avoid some redundancy, Oracle's interpretation would create other redundancy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, even if Oracle is correct that the term \"full\" has become unnecessary or redundant as a result of the 1976 amendment, Oracle overstates the significance of statutory surplusage or redundancy.  Redundancy is not a silver bullet.  We have recognized that some \"redundancy is 'hardly unusual' in statutes addressing costs.\"  Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U.\u00a0S. 371, 385 (2013).  If one possible interpretation of a statute would cause some redundancy and another interpretation would avoid redundancy, that difference in the two interpretations can supply a clue as to the better interpretation of a statute.  But only a clue.  Sometimes the better overall reading of the statute contains some redundancy.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Copyright Act authorizes federal district courts to award \"full costs\" to a party in copyright litigation.  That term means the costs specified in the general costs statute, \u00a7\u00a71821 and 1920.  We reverse in relevant part the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The six categories that a federal court may award as costs are:\n\"(1) Fees of the clerk and marshal;\n\"(2) Fees for printed or electronically recorded transcripts necessarily obtained for use in the case;\n\"(3) Fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses;\n\"(4) Fees for exemplification and the costs of making copies of any materials where the copies are necessarily obtained for use in the case;\n\"(5) Docket fees under section 1923 of this title;\n\"(6) Compensation of court appointed experts, compensation of interpreters, and salaries, fees, expenses, and costs of special interpretation services under section 1828 of this title.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71920.\nIn addition, \u00a71821 provides particular reimbursement rates for witnesses' \"[p]er diem and mileage\" expenses.\nFootnote 2\u00a0See, e.g., 1 Laws of Pa., ch. DCXLV, pp.\u00a0371, 373 (1810) (\"full costs\" and \"double costs\"); 2 Rev. Stat. N. Y., pt. III, ch. X, Tit. 1, \u00a7\u00a716, 25 (1836) (\"full,\" \"double,\" and \"treble\" costs); Rev. Stat. Mass., pt. III, Tit. VI, ch. 121, \u00a7\u00a74, 7, 8, 11, 18 (1836) (\"one quarter,\" \"full,\" \"double,\" and \"treble\" costs).\nFootnote 3\u00a0Rimini further suggests that \"full\" still has meaning after 1976 because the statute gives the district court discretion to award either full costs or no costs, unlike statutes that refer only to \"costs,\" which allow courts to award any amount of costs up to full costs.  In light of our disposition of the case, we need not and do not consider that argument.\n\n\n","57":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSMITH v. BERRYHILL, ACTING COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY(2019)\nNo. 17-1606\nArgued: March 18, 2019Decided: May 28, 2019\n\n\nThe Social Security Act permits judicial review of \"any final decision .\u00a0.\u00a0. after a hearing\" by the Social Security Administration (SSA).  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7405(g).  Claimants for, as relevant here, supplemental security income disability benefits under Title XVI of the Act must generally proceed through a four-step administrative process in order to obtain federal-court review: (1) seek an initial determination of eligibility; (2) seek reconsideration of that determination; (3) request a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ); and (4) seek review of the ALJ's decision by the SSA's Appeals Council.  See 20 CFR \u00a7416.1400.  A request for Appeals Council review generally must be made within 60 days of receiving the ALJ's ruling, \u00a7416.1468; if the claimant misses the deadline and cannot show good cause for doing so, the Appeals Council dismisses the request, \u00a7416.1471.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Ricky Lee Smith's claim for disability benefits under Title XVI was denied at the initial-determination stage, upon reconsideration, and on the merits after a hearing before an ALJ.  The Appeals Council later dismissed Smith's request for review as untimely.  Smith sought judicial review of the dismissal in a Federal District Court, which held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the suit.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed, maintaining that the Appeals Council's dismissal of an untimely petition is not a \"final decision\" subject to federal-court review.\nHeld:\u00a0An Appeals Council dismissal on timeliness grounds after a claimant has had an ALJ hearing on the merits qualifies as a \"final decision .\u00a0.\u00a0. made after a hearing\" for purposes of allowing judicial review under \u00a7405(g).  Pp.\u00a05-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The statute's text supports this reading.  In the first clause (\"any final decision\"), the phrase \"final decision\" clearly denotes some kind of terminal event, and Congress' use of \"any\" suggests an intent to use that term \"expansive[ly],\" Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.\u00a0S. 214, 218-219.  The Appeals Council's dismissal of Smith's claim fits that language: The SSA's regulations make it the final stage of review.  See 20 CFR \u00a7416.1472.  As for the second clause (\"made after a hearing\"), Smith obtained the kind of hearing that \u00a7405(g) most naturally suggests: an ALJ hearing on the merits.  This case differs from Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.\u00a0S. 99, where the Court found that the SSA's denial of a claimant's petition to reopen a prior denial of his claim for benefits--a second look that the agency had made available to claimants as a matter of grace--was not a final decision under \u00a7405(g).  Here, by contrast, the SSA's \"final decision\" is much more closely tethered to the relevant \"hearing.\"  A primary application for benefits may not be denied without an ALJ hearing (if requested), \u00a7405(b)(1), and a claimant's access to this first bite at the apple is a matter of legislative right rather than agency grace.  There is also no danger here of thwarting Congress' own deadline, where the only potential untimeliness concerns Smith's request for Appeals Council review, not his request for judicial review following the agency's ultimate determination.  Pp.\u00a06-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The statutory context also weighs in Smith's favor.  Appeals from SSA determinations are, by their nature, appeals from the action of a federal agency.  In the separate administrative-law context of Administrative Procedure Act (APA) review, an action is \"final\" if it both (1) \"mark[s] the 'consummation' of the agency's decisionmaking process\" and (2) is \"one by which 'rights or obligations have been determined,' or from which 'legal consequences will flow.'\u00a0\"  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.\u00a0S. 154, 177-178.  Both conditions are satisfied when a Social Security claimant has reached the final step of the SSA's four-step process and has had his request for review dismissed as untimely.  While the administrative-exhaustion requirement \"should be applied with regard for the particular administrative scheme at issue,\" Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.\u00a0S. 749, 765, the differences between the two Acts here suggest that Congress wanted more oversight by the courts rather than less under \u00a7405(g) and that \"Congress designed [the statute as a whole] to be 'unusually protective' of claimants,\" Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U.\u00a0S. 467, 480.  SSA is also a massive enterprise and mistakes will occur; Congress did not suggest that it intended for this claimant-protective statute to leave a claimant with no recourse to the courts if a mistake does happen.  Pp.\u00a09-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Smith's entitlement to judicial review is confirmed by \"the strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative action.\"  Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U.\u00a0S. 667, 670.  The heavy burden for rebutting this presumption is not met here.  Congress left it to the SSA to define the procedures that claimants like Smith must first pass through, but it has not suggested that it intended for the SSA to be the unreviewable arbiter of whether claimants have complied with those procedures.  Pp.\u00a010-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0The arguments of amicus in support of the judgment do not  alter this conclusion.  Amicus first argues that the phrase \"final decision .\u00a0.\u00a0. made after a hearing\" refers to a conclusive disposition, after exhaustion, of a benefits claim on the merits.  However, this Court's precedents do not support that reading; the Appeals Council's dismissal is not merely collateral but an end to a proceeding in which a substantial factual record has already been developed and on which considerable resources have already been expended; and Smith's case is distinct from Sanders.  Amicus also claims that permitting greater judicial review could risk a flood of litigation, given the large volume of claims handled by the SSA, but that result is unlikely, because the number of Appeals Council untimeliness dismissals is comparatively small, and because data from the Eleventh Circuit, which follows the interpretation adopted here, do not bear out amicus' warning.  Third, amicus flags related contexts that could be informed by this ruling, but those issues are not before the Court.  Finally, amicus argues that \u00a7405(g) is ambiguous and that the SSA's longstanding interpretation of its meaning--prior to a change of position in this case--is entitled to deference under Chevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.\u00a0S. 837, but this is not the kind of question on which courts defer to agencies.  Pp.\u00a011-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(e)\u00a0A reviewing court that disagrees with the procedural ground for the Appeals Council dismissal should in the ordinary case remand the case to allow the agency to address substantive issues in the first place.  While there would be jurisdiction for a court to reach the merits, this general rule comports with fundamental administrative-law principles and is confirmed by the Court's cases discussing exhaustion in the Social Security context, see City of New York, 476 U.\u00a0S., at 485.  Pp.\u00a014-16.\n880 F.\u00a03d 813, reversed and remanded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNOTICE:\u2002This opinion is subject to formal revision before publication in the preliminary print of the United States Reports.\u2003Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D.\u00a0C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.\nNo. 17-1606\nRICKY LEE SMITH, PETITIONER v.

Petitioner Ricky Lee Smith was denied Social Security benefits after a hearing by an administrative law judge (ALJ) and later had his appeal from that denial dismissed as untimely by the SSA's Appeals Council--the agency's final decisionmaker.  This case asks whether the Appeals Council's dismissal of Smith's claim is a \"final decision .\u00a0.\u00a0. made after a hearing\" so as to allow judicial review under \u00a7405(g).  We hold that it is.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress enacted the Social Security Act in 1935, responding to the crisis of the Great Depression.  49 Stat. 620; F. Bloch, Social Security Law and Practice 13 (2012).  In its early days, the program was administered by a body called the Social Security Board; that role has since passed on to the Board's successor, the SSA.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1939, Congress amended the Act, adding various provisions that--subject to changes not at issue here--continue to govern cases like this one.  See Social Security Act Amendments of 1939, ch. 666, 53 Stat. 1360.  First, Congress gave the agency \"full power and authority to make rules and regulations and to establish procedures .\u00a0.\u00a0. necessary or appropriate to carry out\" the Act.  \u00a7405(a).  Second, Congress directed the agency \"to make findings of fac[t] and decisions as to the rights of any individual applying for a payment\" and to provide all eligible claimants--that is, people seeking benefits--with an \"opportunity for a hearing with respect to such decision[s].\"  \u00a7405(b)(1).  Third, and most centrally, Congress provided for judicial review of \"any final decision of the [agency] made after a hearing.\"  \u00a7405(g).  At the same time, Congress made clear that review would be available only \"as herein provided\"--that is, only under the terms of \u00a7405(g).  \u00a7405(h); see Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.\u00a0S. 602, 614-615 (1984).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1940, the Social Security Board created the Appeals Council, giving it responsibility for overseeing and reviewing the decisions of the agency's hearing officers (who, today, are ALJs).2  Though the Appeals Council originally had just three members, its ranks have since swelled to include over 100 individuals serving as either judges or officers.3  The Appeals Council remains a creature of regulatory rather than statutory creation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, the Social Security Act provides disability benefits under two programs, known by their statutory headings as Title II and Title XVI.  See \u00a7401 et\u00a0seq. (Title II); \u00a71381 et\u00a0seq. (Title XVI).  Title II \"provides old-age, survivor, and disability benefits to insured individuals irrespective of financial need.\"  Bowen v. Galbreath, 485 U.\u00a0S. 74, 75 (1988).  Title XVI provides supplemental security income benefits \"to financially needy individuals who are aged, blind, or disabled regardless of their insured status.\"  Ibid.  The regulations that govern the two programs are, for today's purposes, equivalent.  See Sims v. Apfel, 530 U.\u00a0S. 103, 107, n.\u00a02 (2000).4  Likewise, \u00a7405(g) sets the terms of judicial review for each.  See \u00a71383(c)(3).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Modern-day claimants must generally proceed through a four-step process before they can obtain review from a federal court.  First, the claimant must seek an initial determination as to his eligibility.  Second, the claimant must seek reconsideration of the initial determination.  Third, the claimant must request a hearing, which is conducted by an ALJ.  Fourth, the claimant must seek review of the ALJ's decision by the Appeals Council.  See 20 CFR \u00a7416.1400.  If a claimant has proceeded through all four steps on the merits, all agree, \u00a7405(g) entitles him to judicial review in federal district court.5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tension in this case stems from the deadlines that SSA regulations impose for seeking each successive stage of review.  A party who seeks Appeals Council review, as relevant here, must file his request within 60 days of receiving the ALJ's ruling, unless he can show \"good cause for missing the deadline.\"  \u00a7416.1468.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Appeals Council's review is discretionary: It may deny even a timely request without issuing a decision.  See \u00a7416.1481.  If a claimant misses the deadline and cannot show good cause, however, the Appeals Council does not deny the request but rather dismisses it.  \u00a7416.1471.  Dismissals are \"binding and not subject to further review\" by the SSA.  \u00a7416.1472.  The question here is whether a dismissal for untimeliness, after the claimant has had an ALJ hearing, is a \"final decision .\u00a0.\u00a0. made after a hearing\" for purposes of allowing judicial review under \u00a7405(g).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Ricky Lee Smith applied for disability benefits under Title XVI in 2012.  Smith's claim was denied at the initial-determination stage and upon reconsideration.  Smith then requested an ALJ hearing, which the ALJ held in February 2014 before issuing a decision denying Smith's claim on the merits in March 2014.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties dispute what happened next.  Smith's attorney says that he sent a letter requesting Appeals Council review in April 2014, well within the 60-day deadline.  The SSA says that it has no record of receiving any such letter.  In late September 2014, Smith's attorney sent a copy of the letter that he assertedly had mailed in April.  The SSA, noting that it had no record of prior receipt, counted the date of the request as the day that it received the copy.  The Appeals Council accordingly determined that Smith's submission was untimely, concluded that Smith lacked good cause for missing the deadline, and dismissed Smith's request for review.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Smith sought judicial review of that dismissal in the U.\u00a0S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky.  The District Court held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear his suit.  The U.\u00a0S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, maintaining that \"an Appeals Council decision to refrain from considering an untimely petition for review is not a 'final decision' subject to judicial review in federal court.'\u00a0\"  Smith v. Commissioner of Social Security, 880 F.\u00a03d 813, 814 (2018).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Smith petitioned this Court for certiorari.  Responding to Smith's petition, the Government stated that while the Sixth Circuit's decision accorded with the SSA's longstanding position, the Government had \"reexamined the question and concluded that its prior position was incorrect.\"  Brief for Respondent on Pet. for Cert. 15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appeals.  586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).6  Because the Government agrees with Smith that the Appeals Council's dismissal meets \u00a7405(g)'s terms, we appointed Deepak Gupta as amicus curiae to defend the judgment below.  586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).  He has ably discharged his duties.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 405(g), as noted above, provides for judicial review of \"any final decision .\u00a0.\u00a0. made after a hearing.\"  This provision, the Court has explained, contains two separate elements: first, a \"jurisdictional\" requirement that claims be presented to the agency, and second, a \"waivable .\u00a0.\u00a0. requirement that the administrative remedies prescribed by the Secretary be exhausted.\"  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.\u00a0S. 319, 328 (1976).  This case involves the latter, nonjurisdictional element of administrative exhaustion.  While \u00a7405(g) delegates to the SSA the authority to dictate which steps are generally required, see Sims, 530 U.\u00a0S., at 106, exhaustion of those steps may not only be waived by the agency, see Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.\u00a0S. 749, 767 (1975), but also excused by the courts, see Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U.\u00a0S. 467, 484 (1986); Eldridge, 424 U.\u00a0S., at 330.7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question here is whether a dismissal by the Appeals Council on timeliness grounds after a claimant has received an ALJ hearing on the merits qualifies as a \"final decision .\u00a0.\u00a0. made after a hearing\" for purposes of allowing judicial review under \u00a7405(g).  In light of the text, the context, and the presumption in favor of the reviewability of agency action, we conclude that it does.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We begin with the text.  Taking the first clause (\"any final decision\") first, we note that the phrase \"final decision\" clearly denotes some kind of terminal event,8 and Congress' use of the word \"any\" suggests an intent to use that term \"expansive[ly],\" see Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.\u00a0S. 214, 218-219 (2008).  The Appeals Council's dismissal of Smith's claim fits that language: Under the SSA's own regulations, it was the final stage of review.  See 20 CFR \u00a7416.1472.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning to the second clause (\"made after a hearing\"), we note that this phrase has been the subject of some confusion over the years.  On the one hand, the statute elsewhere repeatedly uses the word \"hearing\" to signify an ALJ hearing,9 which suggests that, in the ordinary case, the phrase here too denotes an ALJ hearing.  See, e.g., IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U.\u00a0S. 21, 34 (2005) (noting \"the normal rule of statutory interpretation that identical words used in different parts of the same statute are generally presumed to have the same meaning\").  On the other hand, the Court's precedents make clear that an ALJ hearing is not an ironclad prerequisite for judicial review.  See, e.g., City of New York, 476 U.\u00a0S., at 484 (emphasizing the Court's \"\u00a0'intensely practical'\u00a0\" approach to the applicability of the exhaustion requirement and disapproving \"mechanical application\" of a set of factors).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is no need today to give \u00a7405(g) a definition for all seasons, because, in any event, this is a mine-run case and Smith obtained the kind of hearing that \u00a7405(g) most naturally suggests: an ALJ hearing on the merits.10  In other words, even giving \u00a7405(g) a relatively strict reading, Smith appears to satisfy its terms.11\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Smith cannot, however, satisfy \u00a7405(g)'s \"after a hearing\" requirement as a matter of mere chronology.12  In Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.\u00a0S. 99 (1977), the Court considered whether the SSA's denial of a claimant's petition to reopen a prior denial of his claim for benefits qualified as a final decision under \u00a7405(g).  Id., at 102-103, 107-109.  The Court concluded that it did not, reasoning that a petition to reopen was a matter of agency grace that could be denied without a hearing altogether and that allowing judicial review would thwart Congress' own deadline for seeking such review.  See id., at 108-109.  That the SSA's denial of the petition to reopen (1) was conclusive and (2) postdated an ALJ hearing did not, alone, bring it within the meaning of \u00a7405(g).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, by contrast, the SSA's \"final decision\" is much more closely tethered to the relevant \"hearing.\"  Unlike a petition to reopen, a primary application for benefits may not be denied without an ALJ hearing (assuming the claimant timely requests one, as Smith did).  \u00a7405(b)(1).  Moreover, the claimant's access to this first bite at the apple is indeed a matter of legislative right rather than agency grace.  See id., at 108. And, again unlike the situation in Sanders, there is no danger here of thwarting Congress' own deadline, given that the only potential untimeliness here concerns Smith's request for Appeals Council review--not his request for judicial review following the agency's ultimate determination.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statutory context weighs in Smith's favor as well.  Appeals from SSA determinations are, by their nature, appeals from the action of a federal agency, and in the separate administrative-law context of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), an action is \"final\" if it both (1) \"mark[s] the 'consummation' of the agency's decisionmaking process\" and (2) is \"one by which 'rights or obligations have been determined,' or from which 'legal consequences will flow.'\u00a0\"  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.\u00a0S. 154, 177-178 (1997).  Both conditions are satisfied when a Social Security claimant has reached the fourth and final step of the SSA's four-step process and has had his request for review dismissed as untimely.  It is consistent to treat the Appeals Council's dismissal of Smith's claim as a final decision as well.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be clear, \"the doctrine of administrative exhaustion should be applied with a regard for the particular administrative scheme at issue,\" Salfi, 422 U.\u00a0S., at 765, and we leave this axiom undisturbed today.  The Social Security Act and the APA are different statutes, and courts must remain sensitive to their differences.  See, e.g., Sullivan v. Hudson, 490 U.\u00a0S. 877, 885 (1989) (observing that \"[a]s provisions for judicial review of agency action go, \u00a7405(g) is somewhat unusual\" in that its \"detailed provisions .\u00a0.\u00a0. suggest a degree of direct interaction between a federal court and an administrative agency alien to\" APA review).  But at least some of these differences suggest that Congress wanted more oversight by the courts in this context rather than less, see ibid.,13 and the statute as a whole is one that \"Congress designed to be 'unusually protective' of claimants,\" City of New York, 476 U.\u00a0S., at 480.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We note further that the SSA is a massive enterprise,14 and mistakes will occur.  See Brief for National Organization of Social Security Claimants' Representatives as Amicus Curiae 13 (collecting examples).15  The four steps preceding judicial review, meanwhile, can drag on for years.16  While mistakes by the agency may be admirably rare, we do not presume that Congress intended for this claimant-protective statute, see City of New York, 476 U.\u00a0S., at 480, to leave a claimant without recourse to the courts when such a mistake does occur--least of all when the claimant may have already expended a significant amount of likely limited resources in a lengthy proceeding.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Smith's entitlement to judicial review is confirmed by \"the strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative action.\"  Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U.\u00a0S. 667, 670 (1986).  \"That presumption,\" of course, \"is rebuttable: It fails when a statute's language or structure demonstrates that Congress wanted an agency to police its own conduct.\"  Mach Mining, LLC v. EEOC, 575 U.\u00a0S. 480, ___-___ (2015) (slip op., at 4-5).  But the burden for rebutting it is \"\u00a0'heavy,'\u00a0\" id., at ___ (slip op., at 5), and that burden is not met here.  While Congress left it to the SSA to define the procedures that claimants like Smith must first pass through, see Sims, 530 U.\u00a0S., at 106, Congress has not suggested that it intended for the SSA to be the unreviewable arbiter of whether claimants have complied with those procedures.  Where, as here, a claimant has received a claim-ending timeliness determination from the agency's last-in-line decisionmaker after bringing his claim past the key procedural post (a hearing) mentioned in \u00a7405(g), there has been a \"final decision .\u00a0.\u00a0. made after a hearing\" under \u00a7405(g).17\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amicus' arguments to the contrary have aided our consideration of this case, but they have not dissuaded us from concluding that the Appeals Council's dismissal of Smith's claim satisfied \u00a7405(g).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amicus first argues that the phrase \"final decision .\u00a0.\u00a0. made after a hearing\" refers to a conclusive disposition, after exhaustion, of a benefits claim on the merits--that is, on a basis for which the Social Security Act entitles a claimant to a hearing.  This reading follows, amicus argues, from the Court's observations that \u00a7405(g) generally requires exhaustion, and moreover from Sanders' suggestion, see 430 U.\u00a0S., at 108, that review is not called for where a claimant loses on an agency-determined procedural ground that is divorced from the substantive matters for which a hearing is required.  Even if Smith did receive a hearing on the merits, amicus argues, the conclusive determination was not on that basis, and \"[i]t would be unnatural to read the statute as throwing open the gates to judicial review of any final decision, no matter how collateral,\" just because such a hearing occurred.  Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae 34.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We disagree.  First, as noted above, the Court's precedents do not make exhaustion a pure necessity, indicating instead that while the SSA is empowered to define the steps claimants must generally take, the SSA is not also the unreviewable arbiter of whether a claimant has sufficiently complied with those steps.  See supra, at 5-6, and n.\u00a07.  Second, the Appeals Council's dismissal is not merely collateral; such a dismissal calls an end to a proceeding in which a substantial factual record has already been developed and on which considerable resources have already been expended.  See supra, at 10, and n.\u00a016.  Accepting amicus' argument would mean that a claimant could make it to the end of the SSA's process and then have judicial review precluded simply because the Appeals Council stamped \"untimely\" on the request, even if that designation were patently inaccurate.  While there may be contexts in which the law is so unforgiving, this is not one.  See supra, at 9-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Smith's case, as noted above, is also distinct from Sanders.  See supra, at 8.  Sanders, after all, involved the SSA's denial of a petition for reopening--a second look that the agency had made available to claimants as a matter of grace.  See 430 U.\u00a0S., at 101-102, 107-108.  But Smith is not seeking a second look at an already-final denial; he argues that he was wrongly prevented from continuing to pursue his primary claim for benefits.  That primary claim, meanwhile, is indeed a matter of statutory entitlement.  See \u00a7405(b).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amicus also emphasizes that the SSA handles a large volume of claims, such that a decision providing for  greater judicial review could risk a flood of litigation.  That result seems unlikely for a few reasons.  First, the number of Appeals Council untimeliness dismissals is comparatively small--something on the order of 2,500 dismissals out of 160,000 dispositions per year.18  Second, the interpretation that Smith and the Government urge has been the law since 1983 in the Eleventh Circuit, and the data there do not bear out amicus' warning.  See Reply Brief for Respondent 14-15 (collecting statistics).  Third, while amicus flags related contexts that could be informed by today's ruling, see Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae 36-40, those issues are not before us.  We therefore do not address them other than to reinforce that such questions must be considered in the light of \"the particular administrative scheme at issue.\"  See Salfi, 422 U.\u00a0S., at 765.  Today's decision, therefore, hardly knocks loose a line of dominoes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, amicus argues that the meaning of \u00a7405(g) is ambiguous and that the SSA's longstanding interpretation of \u00a7405(g)--prior to its changed position during the pendency of this case--is entitled to deference under Chevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.\u00a0S. 837 (1984).  The Government and Smith maintain that the statute unambiguously supports the Government's new position, and Smith further asserts that deference is inappropriate where the Government itself has rejected the interpretation in question in its filings.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We need not decide whether the statute is unambiguous or what to do with the curious situation of an amicus curiae seeking deference for an interpretation that the Government's briefing rejects.  Chevron deference \"\u00a0'is premised on the theory that a statute's ambiguity constitutes an implicit delegation from Congress to the agency to fill in the statutory gaps.'\u00a0\"  King v. Burwell, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 8).  The scope of judicial review, meanwhile, is hardly the kind of question that the Court presumes that Congress implicitly delegated to an agency.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, roughly six years after Chevron was decided, the Court declined to give Chevron deference to the Secretary of Labor's interpretation of a federal statute that would have foreclosed private rights of action under certain circumstances.  See Adams Fruit Co. v. Barrett, 494 U.\u00a0S. 638, 649-650 (1990).  As the Court explained, Congress' having created \"a role for the Department of Labor in administering the statute\" did \"not empower the Secretary to regulate the scope of the judicial power vested by the statute.\"  Id., at 650.  Rather, \"[a]lthough agency determinations within the scope of delegated authority are entitled to deference, it is fundamental 'that an agency may not bootstrap itself into an area in which it has no jurisdiction.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  Here, too, while Congress has empowered the SSA to create a scheme of administrative exhaustion, see Sims, 530 U.\u00a0S., at 106, Congress did not delegate to the SSA the power to determine \"the scope of the judicial power vested by\" \u00a7405(g) or to determine conclusively when its dictates are satisfied.  Adams Fruit Co., 494 U.\u00a0S., at 650.  Consequently, having concluded that Smith and the Government have the better reading of \u00a7405(g), we need go no further.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although they agree that \u00a7405(g) permits judicial review of the Appeals Council's dismissal in this case, Smith and the Government disagree somewhat about the scope of review on remand.19  Smith argues that if a reviewing court disagrees with the procedural ground for dismissal, it can then proceed directly to the merits, while the Government argues that the proper step in such a case would be to remand.  We largely agree with the Government.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, there would be jurisdiction for a federal court to proceed to the merits in the way that Smith avers.  For one, as noted above, exhaustion itself is not a jurisdictional prerequisite.  See supra, at 5-6.  Moreover, \u00a7405(g) states that a reviewing \"court shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings and transcript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the Commissioner of Social Security, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing\"--a broad grant of authority that reflects the high \"degree of direct interaction between a federal court and an administrative agency\" envisioned by \u00a7405(g).  Hudson, 490 U.\u00a0S., at 885.  In short, there is no jurisdictional bar to a court's reaching the merits.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fundamental principles of administrative law, however, teach that a federal court generally goes astray if it decides a question that has been delegated to an agency if that agency has not first had a chance to address the question.  See, e.g., INS v. Orlando Ventura, 537 U.\u00a0S. 12, 16, 18 (2002) (per curiam); ICC v. Locomotive Engineers, 482 U.\u00a0S. 270, 283 (1987); cf. SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.\u00a0S. 80, 88 (1943) (\"For purposes of affirming no less than reversing its orders, an appellate court cannot intrude upon the domain which Congress has exclusively entrusted to an administrative agency\").  The Court's cases discussing exhaustion in the Social Security context confirm the prudence of applying this general principle here, where the agency's final decisionmaker has not had a chance to address the merits at all.20  See City of New York, 476 U.\u00a0S., at 485 (\"Because of the agency's expertise in administering its own regulations, the agency ordinarily should be given the opportunity to review application of those regulations to a particular factual context\"); Salfi, 422 U.\u00a0S., at 765 (explaining that exhaustion serves to \"preven[t] premature interference with agency processes\" and to give the agency \"an opportunity to correct its own errors,\" \"to afford the parties and the courts the benefit of its experience and expertise,\" and to produce \"a record which is adequate for judicial review\").  Accordingly, in an ordinary case, a court should restrict its review to the procedural ground that was the basis for the Appeals Council dismissal and (if necessary) allow the agency to address any residual substantive questions in the first instance.21\nV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hold that where the SSA's Appeals Council has dismissed a request for review as untimely after a claimant has obtained a hearing from an ALJ on the merits, that dismissal qualifies as a \"final decision .\u00a0.\u00a0. made after a hearing\" within the meaning of \u00a7405(g).  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0See Koch & Koplow, The Fourth Bite at the Apple: A Study of the Operation and Utility of the Social Security Administration's Appeals Council, 17 Fla.

Sanders, 430 U.\u00a0S. 99 (1977), can be read to cabin Eldridge and Salfi to only constitutional claims, the Court's subsequent decision in City of New York demonstrates that this understanding of \u00a7405(g) can extend to cases lacking Eldridge's and Salfi's constitutional character.  See City of New York, 476 U.\u00a0S., at 474-475, and n.\u00a05, 482-484; see also City of New York v. Heckler, 578 F.\u00a0Supp. 1109, 1124-1125 (EDNY 1984) (ruling that the agency's actions violated the Social Security Act and its own regulations and thus declining to reach the plaintiffs' constitutional argument).\nFootnote 8\u00a0See 5 Oxford English Dictionary 920 (2d ed. 1989) (Final: \"Marking the last stage of a process; leaving nothing to be looked for or expected; ultimate\"); 4 Oxford English Dictionary 222 (1933) (same); see also Webster's New World College Dictionary 542 (5th ed. 2016) (Final: \"leaving no further chance for action, discussion, or change; deciding; conclusive\"); Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 469 (11th ed. 2011) (Final: \"coming at the end: being the last in a series, process, or progress\").\nFootnote 9\u00a0See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7405(b)(1) (entitling claimants to a hearing on the merits); \u00a7405(b)(2) (discussing \"reconsideration\" of certain findings \"before any hearing under paragraph (1) on the issue of such entitlement\"); \u00a7405(g) (discussing factual findings and evidence resulting from such a \"hearing\"); \u00a7405(h) (discussing binding effect of decision \"after a hearing\"); see also \u00a7\u00a71383(c)(1)(A), (3) (similar).\nFootnote 10\u00a0We note as well that the \"hearing\" referred to in \u00a7405(g) cannot be a hearing before the Appeals Council.  Congress provided for a hearing in \u00a7405(b) and for judicial review \"after a hearing\" in \u00a7405(g) before the Appeals Council even existed.  See supra, at 2.  Moreover, the Appeals Council makes many decisions without a hearing--e.g., denying a petition for review without giving reasons--that are nevertheless plainly reviewable.  See 20 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 416.1400(a)(5), 416.1467, 416.1481.  Accordingly, the fact that there was no Appeals Council hearing--much like the fact that there was no reasoned Appeals Council decision on the merits--does not bar review.\nFootnote 11\u00a0We return below to the possibility, suggested by amicus, that \"final decision .\u00a0.\u00a0. made after a hearing\" could signify a final decision \"on a matter on which the Act requires a hearing.\"  Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae 13; see infra, at 11-12.  Here, we note only that while Congress certainly could have written something like \"final decision on the merits .\u00a0.\u00a0. made after a hearing,\" it did not.\nFootnote 12\u00a0The alternative risks untenable breadth.  The Battle of Yorktown predates our ruling today, but no one would describe today's opinion as a \"decision made after the Battle of Yorktown.\"  As we explain, however, the dismissal of Smith's claim is tethered to Smith's hearing in a way that more distant events are not.\nFootnote 13\u00a0The noteworthy counterpoint is \u00a7405(h), which withdraws federal-court jurisdiction under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1346.  While that provision clearly serves \"to route review through\" \u00a7405(g), see Sanders, 430 U.\u00a0S., at 103, n.\u00a03; see also Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.\u00a0S. 602, 614-615 (1984), that routing choice does not simultaneously constrict the route that Congress did provide.\nFootnote 14\u00a0For example, the agency receives roughly 2.5 million new disability claims per year.  See SSA, Annual Performance Report Fiscal Years 2017-2019, p.\u00a032 (Feb. 12, 2018), https:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/budget\/FY19Files\/ 2019APR.pdf.\nFootnote 15\u00a0See also Koch & Koplow 257 (noting that each Appeals Council member \"typically spends only ten to fifteen minutes reviewing an average case\" given \"the pressures of the caseload\").\nFootnote 16\u00a0See SSA, FY 2020 Congressional Justification 9 (Mar. 2019) (estimating 2019 average processing time for the first three steps at 113 days, 105 days, and 515 days, respectively), https:\/\/www. ssa.gov\/budget\/FY20Files\/FY20-JEAC.pdf; Brief for National Organization of Social Security Claimants' Representatives as Amicus Curiae 11.\nFootnote 17\u00a0A different question would be presented by a claimant who assertedly faltered at an earlier step--e.g., whose request for an ALJ hearing was dismissed as untimely and who then appealed that determination to the Appeals Council before seeking judicial review.  While such a claimant would not have received a \"hearing\" at all, the Court's precedents also make clear that a hearing is not always required.  See supra, at 5-6.  Because such a situation is not before us, we do not address it.\nFootnote 18\u00a0See Brief for Respondent 43, n.\u00a017 (number of timeliness dismissals); SSA, Annual Statistical Supplement 2018 (Table 2.F11) (number of dispositions), https:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/policy\/docs\/statcomps\/supplement\/ 2018\/2f8-2f11.pdf.\nFootnote 19\u00a0The parties agree, as do we, on the standard of review: abuse of discretion as to the overall conclusion, and \"substantial evidence\" \"as to any fact.\"  See \u00a7405(g); see also Brief for Respondent 43-44; Tr. of Oral Arg. 5; cf. Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U.\u00a0S. 467, 483 (1986) (\"Ordinarily, the Secretary has discretion to decide when to waive the exhaustion requirement\").\nFootnote 20\u00a0We make no statement, by contrast, regarding the applicability of this line of cases to situations in which the Appeals Council has had a chance to address the merits.  Cf. Sims v. Apfel, 530 U.\u00a0S. 103, 110-112 (2000) (plurality opinion) (discussing why the inquisitorial nature  of SSA proceedings counsels against imposing an issue-exhaustion requirement).\nFootnote 21\u00a0By the same token, remand may be forgone in rarer cases, such as where the Government joins the claimant in asking the court to reach the merits or where remand would serve no meaningful purpose.\n\n\n","58":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTOKELING v. UNITED STATES(2019)\nNo. 17-5554\nArgued: October 9, 2018Decided: January 15, 2019\n\n\nPetitioner Stokeling pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm and ammunition after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(1).  Based on Stokeling's prior criminal history, the probation office recommended the mandatory minimum 15-year prison term that the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) provides for \u00a7922(g) violators who have three previous convictions \"for a violent felony,\" \u00a7924(e).  As relevant here, Stokeling objected that his prior Florida robbery conviction was not a \"violent felony,\" which ACCA defines, in relevant part, as \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\" \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i).  The District Court held that Stokeling's actions during the robbery did not justify an ACCA sentence enhancement, but the Eleventh Circuit reversed.\nHeld: \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0ACCA's elements clause encompasses a robbery offense that requires the defendant to overcome the victim's resistance.  Pp.\u00a03-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0As originally enacted, ACCA prescribed a sentence enhancement for certain individuals with three prior convictions \"for robbery or burglary,\" 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. App. \u00a71202(a) (1982 ed., Supp. II), and defined robbery as an unlawful taking \"by force or violence,\" \u00a71202(c)(8)--a clear reference to common-law robbery, which required a level of \"force\" or \"violence\" sufficient to overcome the resistance of the victim, however slight.  When Congress amended ACCA two years later, it replaced the enumerated crimes with the elements clause, an expanded enumerated offenses clause, and the now-defunct residual clause.  The new elements clause extended ACCA to cover any offense that has as an element \"the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force,\" \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added).  By replacing robbery with a clause that has \"force\" as its touchstone, Congress retained the same common-law definition that undergirded the definition of robbery in the original ACCA.  This  understanding is buttressed by the then widely accepted definitions of robbery among the States, a significant majority of which defined nonaggravated robbery as requiring a degree of force sufficient only to overcome a victim's resistance.  Under Stokeling's reading, many of those state robbery statutes would not qualify as ACCA predicates.  But federal criminal statutes should not be construed in ways that would render them inapplicable in many States.  Pp.\u00a03-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) This understanding of \"physical force\" comports with Johnson v. United States, 559 U.\u00a0S. 133.  The force necessary for misdemeanor battery addressed in Johnson does not require resistance or even physical aversion on the part of the victim.  Rather, the \"slightest offensive touching\" would qualify.  Id., at 139.  It is thus different in kind from the force necessary to overcome resistance by a victim, which is inherently \"violent\" in the sense contemplated by Johnson and \"suggest[s] a degree of power that would not be satisfied by the merest touching.\"  Ibid.  Johnson did not purport, as Stokeling suggests, to establish a force threshold so high as to exclude even robbery from ACCA's scope.  Pp.\u00a08-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Stokeling's suggested definition of \"physical force\"--force \"reasonably expected to cause pain or injury\"--is inconsistent with the degree of force necessary to commit robbery at common law.  Moreover, the Court declined to adopt this standard in Johnson.  Stokeling's proposal would prove exceedingly difficult to apply, would impose yet another indeterminable line-drawing exercise on the lower courts, and is not supported by United States v. Castleman, 572  U.\u00a0S. 157.  Pp.\u00a010-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Robbery under Florida law qualifies as an ACCA-predicate offense under the elements clause.  The term \"physical force\" in ACCA encompasses the degree of force necessary to commit common-law robbery.  And the Florida Supreme Court has made clear that the robbery statute requires \"resistance by the victim that is overcome by the physical force of the offender.\"  Robinson v.

We conclude that it does.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the early hours of July 27, 2015, two people burgled the Tongue & Cheek restaurant in Miami Beach, Florida.  Petitioner Denard Stokeling was an employee of the restaurant, and the Miami Beach Police identified him as a suspect based on surveillance video from the burglary and witness statements.  After conducting a criminal background check, police learned that Stokeling had previously been convicted of three felonies--home invasion, kidnaping, and robbery.  When confronted, Stokeling admitted that he had a gun in his backpack.  The detectives opened the backpack and discovered a 9-mm semiautomatic firearm, a magazine, and 12 rounds of ammunition.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stokeling pleaded guilty in federal court to possessing a firearm and ammunition after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(1).  The probation office recommended that Stokeling be sentenced as an armed career criminal under ACCA, which provides that a person who violates \u00a7922(g) and who has three previous convictions for a \"violent felony\" shall be imprisoned for a minimum of 15 years.  \u00a7924(e).  ACCA defines \"violent felony\" as \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" that\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"  \u00a7924(e)(2)(B).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As relevant here, Stokeling objected that his 1997 Florida robbery conviction was not a predicate offense under ACCA.  This conviction, he argued, did not qualify under the first clause--the \"elements clause\"--because Florida robbery does not have \"as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\"\u00a0*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Florida law, robbery is defined as \"the taking of money or other property .\u00a0.\u00a0. from the person or custody of another, .\u00a0.\u00a0. when in the course of the taking there is the use of force, violence, assault, or putting in fear.\"  Fla. Stat. \u00a7812.13(1) (1995).  The Florida Supreme Court has explained that the \"use of force\" necessary to commit robbery requires \"resistance by the victim that is overcome by the physical force of the offender.\"  Robinson v. State, 692 So.\u00a02d 883, 886 (1997).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead of applying a categorical approach to the elements clause, the District Court evaluated whether the facts of Stokeling's robbery conviction were serious enough to warrant an enhancement.  The court concluded that, although Stokeling \"\u00a0'grabbed [the victim] by the neck and tried to remove her necklaces'\u00a0\" as she \"\u00a0'held onto'\u00a0\" them, his actions did not \"justify an enhancement.\"  Sentencing Hearing in 15-cv-20815 (SD Fla.), Doc. 45, pp. 10-11.  The court then sentenced Stokeling to less than half of the mandatory minimum 15-year term of imprisonment provided by ACCA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Eleventh Circuit reversed.  684 Fed. Appx. 870 (2017).  It held that the District Court erred in making its own factual determination about the level of violence involved in Stokeling's particular robbery offense.  Id., at 871.  The court also rejected Stokeling's argument that Florida robbery does not categorically require sufficient force to constitute a violent felony under ACCA's elements clause.  Id., at 871-872.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to address whether the \"force\" required to commit robbery under Florida law qualifies as \"physical force\" for purposes of the elements clause.  584 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).  We now affirm.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Construing the language of the elements clause in light of the history of ACCA and our opinion in Johnson v. United States, 559 U.\u00a0S. 133 (2010), we conclude that the elements clause encompasses robbery offenses that require the criminal to overcome the victim's resistance.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As originally enacted, ACCA prescribed a 15-year minimum sentence for any person who received, possessed, or transported a firearm following three prior convictions \"for robbery or burglary.\"  18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. App. \u00a71202(a) (1982 ed., Supp. II).  Robbery was defined in relevant part as \"any felony consisting of the taking of the property of another from the person or presence of another by force or violence.\"  \u00a71202(c)(8) (1982 ed., Supp. II) (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statute's definition mirrored the elements of the common-law crime of robbery, which has long required force or violence.  At common law, an unlawful taking was merely larceny unless the crime involved \"violence.\"  2 J. Bishop, Criminal Law \u00a71156, p. 860 (J. Zane & C. Zollman eds., 9th ed. 1923).  And \"violence\" was \"committed if sufficient force [was] exerted to overcome the resistance encountered.\"  Id., at 861.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few examples illustrate the point.  Under the common law, it was robbery \"to seize another's watch or purse, and use sufficient force to break a chain or guard by which it is attached to his person, or to run against another, or rudely push him about, for the purpose of diverting his attention and robbing him.\" W. Clark & W. Marshall, Law of Crimes 554 (H. Lazell ed., 2d ed. 1905) (Clark & Marshall) (footnotes omitted).  Similarly, it was robbery to pull a diamond pin out of a woman's hair when doing so tore away hair attached to the pin.  See 2 W. Russell, Crimes and Indictable Misdemeanors 68 (2d ed. 1828).  But the crime was larceny, not robbery, if the thief did not have to overcome such resistance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In fact, common-law authorities frequently used the terms \"violence\" and \"force\" interchangeably.  See ibid. (concluding that \"if any injury be done to the person, or there be any struggle by the party to keep possession of the property before it be taken from him, there will be a sufficient actual 'violence'\u00a0\" to establish robbery); Clark & Marshall 553 (\"Sufficient force must be used to overcome resistance.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. If there is any injury to the person of the owner, or if he resists the attempt to rob him, and his resistance is overcome, there is sufficient violence to make the taking robbery, however slight the resistance\" (emphasis added)).  The common law also did not distinguish between gradations of \"violence.\"  If an act physically overcame a victim's resistance, \"however slight\" that resistance might be, it necessarily constituted violence.  Ibid.; 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 242 (1769) (distinguishing \"taking .\u00a0.\u00a0. by force\" from \"privately stealing,\" and stating that the use of this \"violence\" differentiates robbery from other larcenies); see also 3 id., at 120 (explaining, in the battery context, that \"the law cannot draw the line between different degrees of violence, and therefore totally prohibits the first and lowest stage of it\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The overlap between \"force\" and \"violence\" at common law is reflected in modern legal and colloquial usage of these terms.  \"Force\" means \"[p]ower, violence, or pressure directed against a person or thing,\" Black's Law Dictionary 656 (7th ed. 1999), or \"unlawful violence threatened or committed against persons or property,\" Random House Dictionary of the English Language 748 (2d ed. 1987).  Likewise, \"violence\" implies force, including an \"unjust or unwarranted use of force.\"  Black's Law Dictionary, at 1564; accord, Random House Dictionary, at 2124 (\"rough or injurious physical force, action, or treatment,\" or \"an unjust or unwarranted exertion of force or power, as against rights or laws\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Against this background, Congress, in the original ACCA, defined robbery as requiring the use of \"force or violence\"--a clear reference to the common law of robbery.  See Samantar v. Yousuf, 560 U.\u00a0S. 305, 320, n.\u00a013 (2010) (\"Congress 'is understood to legislate against a background of common-law .\u00a0.\u00a0. principles'\u00a0\").  And the level of \"force\" or \"violence\" needed at common law was by this time well established: \"Sufficient force must be used to overcome resistance .\u00a0.\u00a0. however slight the resistance.\"  Clark & Marshall 553.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1986, Congress amended the relevant provisions of ACCA to their current form.  The amendment was titled Expansion of Predicate Offenses for Armed Career Criminal Penalties.  See Career Criminals Amendment Act of 1986, \u00a71402, 100 Stat. 3207-39.  This amendment replaced the two enumerated crimes of \"robbery or burglary\" with the current elements clause, a new enumerated-offenses list, and a (now-defunct) residual clause.  See Johnson v. United States, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015).  In the new statute, robbery was no longer enumerated as a predicate offense.  But the newly created elements clause extended ACCA to cover any offense that has as an element \"the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\"  18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) (2012 ed.) (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"\u00a0'[I]f a word is obviously transplanted from another legal source, whether the common law or other legislation, it brings the old soil with it.'\u00a0\"  Hall v. Hall, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 13) (quoting Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947)).  That principle supports our interpretation of the term \"force\" here.  By retaining the term \"force\" in the 1986 version of ACCA and otherwise \"[e]xpan[ding]\" the predicate offenses under ACCA, Congress made clear that the \"force\" required for common-law robbery would be sufficient to justify an enhanced sentence under the new elements clause.  We can think of no reason to read \"force\" in the revised statute to require anything more than the degree of \"force\" required in the 1984 statute.  And it would be anomalous to read \"force\" as excluding the quintessential ACCA-predicate crime of robbery, despite the amendment's retention of the term \"force\" and its stated intent to expand the number of qualifying offenses.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The symmetry between the 1984 definition of robbery (requiring the use of \"force or violence\") and the 1986 elements clause (requiring the use of \"physical force\") is striking.  By replacing robbery as an enumerated offense with a clause that has \"force\" as its touchstone, Congress made clear that \"force\" retained the same common-law definition that undergirded the original definition of robbery adopted a mere two years earlier.  That conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the original 1984 statute defined \"robbery\" using terms with well-established common-law meanings.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our understanding of \"physical force\" is further buttressed by the then widely accepted definitions of robbery in the States.  In 1986, a significant majority of the States defined nonaggravated robbery as requiring force that overcomes a victim's resistance.  The Government counts 43 States that measured force by this degree, 5 States that required \"force\" to cause bodily injury, and 2 States and the District of Columbia that permitted force to encompass something less, such as purse snatching.  App. B to Brief for United States.  Stokeling counters that, at most, 31 States defined force as overcoming victim resistance.  Reply Brief 21.  We need not declare a winner in this numbers game because, either way, it is clear that many States' robbery statutes would not qualify as ACCA predicates under Stokeling's reading.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His reading would disqualify more than just basic-robbery statutes.  Departing from the common-law understanding of \"force\" would also exclude other crimes that have as an element the force required to commit basic robbery.  For instance, Florida requires the same element of \"force\" for both armed robbery and basic robbery.  See Fla. Stat. \u00a7812.13(2)(a) (distinguishing armed robbery from robbery by requiring the additional element of \"carr[ying] a firearm or other deadly weapon\" during the robbery).  Thus, as Stokeling's counsel admitted at oral argument, \"armed robbery in Florida\" would not qualify under ACCA if his view were adopted.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 3-4; see United States v. Lee, 886 F.\u00a03d 1161, 1163, n. 1 (CA11 2018) (treating \"Florida strong-arm robbery [i.e., basic robbery], armed robbery, and attempted robbery .\u00a0.\u00a0. the same for purposes of analyzing the ACCA's elements clause\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where, as here, the applicability of a federal criminal statute requires a state conviction, we have repeatedly declined to construe the statute in a way that would render it inapplicable in many States.  See, e.g., United States v. Castleman, 572 U.\u00a0S. 157, 167 (2014) (reading \"physical force\" to include common-law force, in part because a different reading would render 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(9) \"ineffectual in at least 10 States\"); Voisine v. United States, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9) (declining to interpret \u00a7912(a)(33)(A) in a way that would \"risk rendering \u00a7922(g)(9) broadly inoperative\" in 34 States and the District of Columbia).  That approach is appropriate here as well.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our understanding of \"physical force\" comports with Johnson v. United States, 559 U.\u00a0S. 133 (2010).  There, the Court held that \"\u00a0'actua[l] and intentiona[l] touching'\u00a0\"--the level of force necessary to commit common-law misdemeanor battery--did not require the \"degree of force\" necessary to qualify as a \"violent felony\" under ACCA's elements clause.  Id., at 138, 140.  To reach this conclusion, the Court parsed the meaning of the phrase \"physical force.\"  First, it explained that the modifier \"physical\" \"plainly refers to force exerted by and through concrete bodies--distinguishing physical force, from, for example, intellectual force or emotional force.\"  Id., at 138.  The Court then considered \"whether the term 'force' in [the elements clause] has the specialized meaning that it bore in the common-law definition of battery.\"  Id., at 139.  After reviewing the context of the statute, the Court rejected the Government's suggestion that \"force\" encompassed even the \"slightest offensive touching.\"  Ibid.  Instead, it held that \"physical force\" means \"violent force--that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\"  Id., at 140.  Applying that standard to a Florida battery law criminalizing \"any intentional physical contact,\" the Court concluded that the law did not require the use of \"physical force\" within the meaning of ACCA.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stokeling argues that Johnson rejected as insufficient the degree of \"force\" required to commit robbery under Florida law because it is not \"substantial force.\"  We dis-agree.  The nominal contact that Johnson addressed involved physical force that is different in kind from the violent force necessary to overcome resistance by a victim.  The force necessary for misdemeanor battery does not require resistance or even physical aversion on the part of the victim; the \"unwanted\" nature of the physical contact itself suffices to render it unlawful.  See State v. Hearns, 961 So.\u00a02d 211, 216 (Fla. 2007).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, the force necessary to overcome a victim's physical resistance is inherently \"violent\" in the sense contemplated by Johnson, and \"suggest[s] a degree of power that would not be satisfied by the merest touching.\"  559 U.\u00a0S., at 139.  This is true because robbery that must overpower a victim's will--even a feeble or weak-willed victim--necessarily involves a physical confrontation and struggle.  The altercation need not cause pain or injury or even be prolonged; it is the physical contest between the criminal and the victim that is itself \"capable of causing physical pain or injury.\"  Id., at 140.  Indeed, Johnson itself relied on a definition of \"physical force\" that specifically encompassed robbery: \"\u00a0'[f]orce consisting in a physical act, esp. a violent act directed against a robbery victim.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 139 (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 717 (9th ed. 2009); emphasis added).  Robbery thus has always been within the \"\u00a0'category of violent, active crimes'\u00a0\" that Congress included in ACCA.  559 U.\u00a0S., at 140.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To get around Johnson, Stokeling cherry picks adjectives from parenthetical definitions in the opinion, insisting that the level of force must be \"severe,\" \"extreme,\" \"furious,\" or \"vehement.\"  These adjectives cannot bear the weight Stokeling would place on them.  They merely supported Johnson's actual holding: that common-law battery does not require \"force capable of causing physical pain or injury.\"  Ibid.  Johnson did not purport to establish a force threshold so high as to exclude even robbery from ACCA's scope.  Moreover, Stokeling ignores that the Court also defined \"violence\" as \"\u00a0'unjust or improper force.'\u00a0\"  Ibid. (emphasis added).  As explained above, the common law similarly linked the terms \"violence\" and \"force.\"  Overcoming a victim's resistance was per\u00a0se violence against the victim, even if it ultimately caused minimal pain or injury.  See Russell, Crimes and Indictable Misdemeanors, at 68.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the wake of Johnson, the Court has repeated its holding that \"physical force\" means \"\u00a0'force capable of causing physical pain or injury.'\u00a0\" Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 19-20) (quoting Johnson, supra, at 140); see also Castleman, supra, at 173-174 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finding this definition difficult to square with his position, Stokeling urges us to adopt a new, heightened reading of physical force: force that is \"reasonably expected to cause pain or injury.\"  For the reasons already explained, that definition is inconsistent with the degree of force necessary to commit robbery at common law.  Moreover, the Court declined to adopt that standard in Johnson, even after considering similar language employed in a nearby statutory provision, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(8)(C)(ii).  559 U.\u00a0S., at 143.  The Court instead settled on \"force capable of causing physical pain or injury.\"  Id., at 140 (emphasis added).  \"Capable\" means \"susceptible\" or \"having attributes .\u00a0.\u00a0. required for performance or accomplishment\" or \"having traits conducive to or features permitting.\"  Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 203 (1983); see also Oxford American Dictionary and Thesaurus 180 (2d ed. 2009) (\"having the ability or quality necessary to do\").  Johnson thus does not require any particular degree of likelihood or probability that the force used will cause physical pain or injury; only potentiality.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stokeling's proposed standard would also prove exceedingly difficult to apply.  Evaluating the statistical probability that harm will befall a victim is not an administrable standard under our categorical approach.  Crimes can be committed in many different ways, and it would be difficult to assess whether a crime is categorically likely to harm the victim, especially when the statute at issue lacks fine-tuned gradations of \"force.\"  We decline to impose yet another indeterminable line-drawing exercise on the lower courts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stokeling next contends that Castleman held that minor uses of force do not constitute \"violent force,\" but he misreads that opinion.  In Castleman, the Court noted that for purposes of a statute focused on domestic-violence misdemeanors, crimes involving relatively \"minor uses of force\" that might not \"constitute 'violence' in the generic sense\" could nevertheless qualify as predicate offenses.  572 U.\u00a0S., at 165.  The Court thus had no need to decide more generally whether, under Johnson, conduct that leads to relatively minor forms of injury--such as \"a cut, abrasion, [or] bruise\"--\"necessitate[s]\" the use of \"violent force.\"  572 U.\u00a0S., at 170.  Only Justice Scalia's separate opinion addressed that question, and he concluded that force as small as \"hitting, slapping, shoving, grabbing, pinching, biting, and hair pulling,\" id., at 182 (alterations omitted), satisfied Johnson's definition.  He reasoned that \"[n]one of those actions bears any real resemblance to mere offensive touching, and all of them are capable of causing physical pain or injury.\"  572 U.\u00a0S., at 182.  This understanding of \"physical force\" is consistent with our holding today that force is \"capable of causing physical injury\" within the meaning of Johnson when it is sufficient to overcome a victim's resistance.  Such force satisfies ACCA's elements clause.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We now apply these principles to Florida's robbery statute to determine whether it \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"  18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i).  We conclude that it does.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As explained, Florida law defines robbery as \"the taking of money or other property .\u00a0.\u00a0. from the person or custody of another, .\u00a0.\u00a0. when in the course of the taking there is the use of force, violence, assault, or putting in fear.\"  Fla. Stat. \u00a7812.13(1).  The Florida Supreme Court has made clear that this statute requires \"resistance by the victim that is overcome by the physical force of the offender.\"  Robinson v. State, 692 So.\u00a02d 883, 886 (1997).  Mere \"snatching of property from another\" will not suffice.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several cases cited by the parties illustrate the application of the standard articulated in Robinson.  For example, a defendant who grabs the victim's fingers and peels them back to steal money commits robbery in Florida.  Sanders v. State, 769 So.\u00a02d 506, 507-508 (Fla. App. 2000).  But a defendant who merely snatches money from the victim's hand and runs away has not committed robbery.  Goldsmith v. State, 573 So.\u00a02d 445 (Fla. App. 1991).  Similarly, a defendant who steals a gold chain does not use \"\u00a0'force,' within the meaning of the robbery statute,\" simply because the victim \"fe[els] his fingers on the back of her neck.\"  Walker v. State, 546 So.\u00a02d 1165, 1166-1167 (Fla. App. 1989).  It is worth noting that, in 1999, Florida enacted a separate \"sudden snatching\" statute that proscribes this latter category of conduct; under that statute, it is unnecessary to show either that the defendant \"used any amount of force beyond that effort necessary to obtain possession of the money or other property\" or that \"[t]here was any resistance by the victim to the offender.\"  Fla. Stat. \u00a7812.131 (1999).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the application of the categorical approach to the Florida robbery statute is straightforward.  Because the term \"physical force\" in ACCA encompasses the degree of force necessary to commit common-law robbery, and because Florida robbery requires that same degree of \"force,\" Florida robbery qualifies as an ACCA-predicate offense under the elements clause.  Cf. Descamps v. United States, 570 U.\u00a0S. 254, 261 (2013) (\"If the relevant statute has the same elemen[t],\" \"then the prior conviction can serve as an ACCA predicate\").\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, \"physical force,\" or \"force capable of causing physical pain or injury,\" Johnson, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 140, includes the amount of force necessary to overcome a victim's resistance.  Robbery under Florida law corresponds to that level of force and therefore qualifies as a \"violent felony\" under ACCA's elements clause.  For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nSotomayor, J., dissenting\n\u2002586 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-5554\nDENARD STOKELING, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\n[January 15, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Johnson v. United States, 559 U.\u00a0S. 133 (2010), this Court ruled that the words \"physical force\" in the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(2), denote a heightened degree of force, rather than the minimal contact that would have qualified as \"force\" for purposes of the common-law crime of battery.  Id., at 139-140.  This case asks whether Florida robbery requires such \"physical force,\" and thus qualifies as a \"violent felony\" under the ACCA, even though it can be committed through use  of only slight force.  See \u00a7924(e)(2)(B).  Under Johnson,  the answer to that question is no.  Because the Court's contrary ruling distorts Johnson, I respectfully dissent.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the majority explains, petitioner Denard Stokeling pleaded guilty in 2016 to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(1).  The Government and the probation department argued for an increased sentence under the ACCA.  Stokeling objected.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ACCA imposes a 15-year mandatory-minimum sentence on any \u00a7922(g) offender who has been convicted of at least three qualifying predicate convictions.  \u00a7924(e)(1).  As relevant here, a past conviction can qualify as an ACCA predicate if it is what ACCA calls a \"violent felony\"--that is, \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" that\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"  \u00a7924(e)(2)(B).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clause (i) is often called the \"elements clause\" (or \"force clause\"), because it requires each qualifying crime to have an element involving force.  The first part of clause (ii) is often called the \"enumerated clause,\" because it enumerates certain generic crimes--such as burglary--that Congress sought to cover.  The final part of clause (ii), often called the \"residual clause,\" once offered a catchall to sweep in otherwise uncovered convictions, but the Court struck it down as unconstitutionally vague in 2015.  See Johnson v. United States, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (slip op., at 15).  So the elements clause and the enumerated clause are now the only channels by which a prior conviction can qualify as an ACCA \"violent felony.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whether Stokeling is subject to the ACCA's 15-year mandatory minimum hinges on whether his 1997 conviction for Florida robbery, see App. 10, qualifies under the elements clause.  To determine whether a conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA, courts apply a method called the categorical approach.  See Taylor v. United States, 495 U.\u00a0S. 575, 600-602 (1990). In the  elements-clause context, that method requires asking whether the least culpable conduct covered by the statute at issue nevertheless \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"  See \u00a7924(e)(2); Johnson, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 137.  If it does not, then the statute is too broad to qualify as a \"violent felony.\"  In determining what a state crime covers for purposes of this federal sentencing enhancement, federal courts look to, and are constrained by, state courts' interpretations of state law.  See id., at 138.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As relevant here, Florida law defines robbery as \"the taking of money or other property\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. from the person or custody of another\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. when in the course of the taking there is the use of force, violence, assault, or putting in fear.\"  Fla. Stat. \u00a7812.13(1) (2017).  The Florida Supreme Court has interpreted the statute's reference to force to require \"force sufficient to overcome a victim's resistance.\"  Robinson v. State, 692 So. 2d 883, 887 (1997).  Otherwise, the \"degree of force used is immaterial.\"  Montsdoca v. State, 84 Fla. 82, 86, 93 So. 157, 159 (1922).  If the resistance is minimal, the force need only be minimal as well.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Florida robbery, as interpreted and applied by the Florida courts, covers too broad a range of conduct to qualify as  a \"violent felony\" under the ACCA.  Both the text and purpose of the ACCA--particularly as they have already been construed by our precedents--demonstrate why.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In considering the text of the ACCA, we do not write on a clean slate.  As everyone seems to agree, the key precedent here is this Court's decision in Johnson v. United States, 559 U.\u00a0S. 133.  See ante, at 3, 8.  But while the majority claims to honor Johnson, ante, at 8-10, it does so in the breach.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Johnson concerned whether Florida battery qualified as an ACCA predicate under the elements clause.  This Court held that it did not.  To arrive at that answer, the Court was required to interpret what exactly Congress meant when it used the words \"physical force\" to define the kind of \"violent felony\" that should be captured by the ACCA's elements clause.  See 559 U.\u00a0S., at 138-143.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rather than parsing \"cherry pick[ed] adjectives,\" ante, at 10, it is instructive to look to how Johnson actually answered that question.  Writing for the Court, Justice Scalia explained:\n\"We think it clear that in the context of a statutory definition of 'violent felony,' the phrase 'physical force' means violent force--that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.  See Flores v. Ashcroft, 350 F. 3d 666, 672 (CA7 2003) (Easterbrook, J.). Even by itself, the word 'violent' in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B) connotes a substantial degree of force.  Webster's Second 2846 (defining 'violent' as '[m]oving, acting, or characterized, by physical force, esp. by extreme and sudden or by unjust or improper force; furious; severe; vehement . . . '); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 656 (2d ed. 1989) ('[c]haracterized by the exertion of great physical force or strength'); Black's [Law Dictionary] 1706 [(9th ed. 2009)] ('[o]f, relating to, or characterized by strong physical force').  When the adjective 'violent' is attached to the noun 'felony,' its connotation of strong physical force is even clearer.  See id., at 1188 (defining 'violent felony' as '[a] crime characterized by extreme physical force, such as murder, forcible rape, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon'); see also United States v. Doe, 960 F. 2d 221, 225 (CA1 1992) (Breyer, C. J.) ('[T]he term  to be defined, \"violent felony,\" . . . calls to mind a  tradition of crimes that involve the possibility of  more closely related, active violence').\"  559 U.\u00a0S., at 140-141.\nIn other words, in the context of a statute delineating \"violent felon[ies],\" the phrase \"physical force\" signifies a degree of force that is \"violent,\" \"substantial,\" and \"strong\"--\"that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\"  See id., at 140; see also id., at 142 (\"As we have discussed .\u00a0.\u00a0. the term 'physical force' itself normally connotes force strong enough to constitute 'power'--and all the more so when it is contained in a definition of 'violent felony'\u00a0\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority, slicing Johnson up, concentrates heavily on the phrase \"capable of causing physical pain or injury\" and emphasizes the dictionary definition of the word \"capable\" to suggest that Johnson \"does not require any particular degree of likelihood or probability\" of \"pain or injury\"--merely, as with any law professor's eggshell-victim hypothetical, \"potentiality.\"  Ante, at 10-11.  Our opinions, however, should not be \"parsed as though we were dealing with the language of a statute,\" Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.\u00a0S. 330, 341 (1979), and in any event, the majority's parsing goes astray.  It is clear in context that the Court in Johnson did not mean the word \"capable\" in the way that the majority uses it today, because Johnson rejected an interpretation of \"physical force\" that would have included a crime of battery that could be satisfied by \"[t]he most 'nominal contact,' such as a 'ta[p] .\u00a0.\u00a0. on the shoulder without consent.'\u00a0\"  559 U.\u00a0S., at 138.  As any first-year torts student (or person with a shoulder injury) quickly learns, even a tap on the shoulder is \"capable of causing physical pain or injury\" in certain cases.  So the Court could not have meant \"capable\" in the \"potentiality\" sense that the majority, see ante, at 11, ascribes to it.  Rather, it meant it in the sense that its entire text indicates: \"force capable of causing physical pain or injury\" in the sense that a \"strong\" or \"substantial degree of force\" can cause physical pain or injury.  See Johnson, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 140. The phrase denoted, that is, a heightened degree of force.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Florida robbery, as interpreted by the Florida Supreme Court, cannot meet Johnson's definition of physical force.  As noted above, Florida robbery requires \"force sufficient to overcome a victim's resistance.\"  Robinson, 692 So.\u00a02d, at 887.  But that can mean essentially no force at all.  See McCloud v. State, 335 So.\u00a02d 257, 258 (Fla. 1976) (\"Any degree of force suffices to convert larceny into a robbery\"); Montsdoca, 84 Fla., at 86, 93 So., at 159 (\"The degree of force used is immaterial\").  For example, the force element of Florida robbery is satisfied by a pickpocket who attempts to pull free after the victim catches his arm.  See Robinson, 692 So.\u00a02d, at 887, n.\u00a010 (citing Colby v. State, 46 Fla. 112, 113, 35 So. 189, 190 (1903)).  Florida courts have held the same for a thief who pulls cash from a victim's hand by \"\u00a0'peel[ing] [his] fingers back,'\u00a0\" regardless of \"[t]he fact that [the victim] did not put up greater resistance.\"  Sanders v. State, 769 So. 2d 506, 507 (Fla. App. 2000).  The Government concedes, similarly, that a thief who grabs a bag from a victim's shoulder also commits Florida robbery, so long as the victim instinctively holds on to the bag's strap for a moment.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32-34; see also Benitez-Saldana v. State, 67 So. 3d 320, 322-323 (Fla. App. 2011).  And Stokeling points to at least one person who was convicted of Florida robbery after causing a bill to rip while pulling cash from a victim's hand.  See App. B to Brief for Petitioner.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While these acts can, of course, be accomplished with more than minimal force, they need not be.  The thief who loosens an already loose grasp or (assuming the angle is right) tears the side of a $5 bill has hardly used any force at all.  Nor does the thief who simply pulls his arm free from a store employee's weak grasp or snatches a handbag onto which a victim fleetingly holds use \"force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person\" in the sense that Johnson meant the phrase, because he does not use \"a substantial degree of force\" or \"strong physical force.\"  See Johnson, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 140.  By providing that \"[a]ny degree of force suffices to convert larceny into a robbery,\" McCloud, 335 So.\u00a02d, at 258--and thus making robbers out of thieves who use minimal force--Florida expands its law beyond the line that Johnson drew.  The least culpable conduct proscribed by Fla. Stat. \u00a7812.13 does not entail \"physical force,\" \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i), as this Court properly construed that phrase in Johnson.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The purpose underlying the ACCA confirms that a robbery statute that sweeps as broadly as Florida's does not qualify as an ACCA predicate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted above, the ACCA prescribes a 15-year  mandatory-minimum prison term for anyone convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm so long as that person has three qualifying past convictions.  In Begay v. United States, 553 U.\u00a0S. 137 (2008), this Court explained that, \"[a]s suggested by its title, the Armed Career Criminal Act focuses upon the special danger created when a particular type of offender--a violent criminal or drug trafficker--possesses a gun.\"  Id., at 146.  The ACCA, that is to say, does not look to past crimes simply to get a sense of whether a particular defendant is generally a recidivist; rather, it looks to past crimes to determine specifically \"the kind or degree of danger the offender would pose were he to possess a gun.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Begay considered whether a New Mexico felony conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) qualified as an ACCA predicate under the now-defunct residual clause.  See id., at 141-142.  Felony DUI, the Court explained, did not fit with the types of crimes that Congress was trying to capture, because while it \"reveal[ed] a degree of callousness toward risk,\" it did not \"show an increased likelihood that the offender is the kind of person who might deliberately point [a] gun and pull the trigger.\"  Id., at 146.  The Court had \"no reason to believe that Congress intended a 15-year mandatory prison term where that increased likelihood does not exist.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same is true here.  The lower grade offenders whom Florida still chooses to call \"robbers\" do not bear the hallmarks of being the kind of people who are likely to point a gun and pull the trigger, nor have they committed the more aggravated conduct--pointing a weapon, inflicting bodily injury--that most people think of when they hear the colloquial term \"robbery.\"  Under Florida law, \"robbers\" can be glorified pickpockets, shoplifters, and purse snatchers.  No one disputes that such an offender, if later discovered illegally in possession of a firearm, will in many cases merit greater punishment as a result of the past offense; unless it occurred far in the past, such a conviction will typically increase that defendant's advisory sentencing range under the U.\u00a0S. Sentencing Guidelines.  See Rosales-Mireles v. United States, 585 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2018) (slip op., at 2-3); United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7\u00a71B1.1(a)(6)-(7), 4A1.1, 4A1.2(e) (Nov. 2018).  But there is \"no reason to believe that Congress intended a 15-year mandatory prison term\" for such offenders, who do not present the increased risk of gun violence that more aggravated offenders present.  See Begay, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 146.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unable to rely heavily on text, precedent, or purpose to support its holding that Florida robbery qualifies as an ACCA \"violent felony,\" the majority turns to the common law, to legislative and statutory history, and finally to what it perceives as the consequences of ruling for Stokeling.  None of these rationales is persuasive.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority observes that Florida's statute requires no less force than was necessary to commit common-law robbery.  That may well be true: The majority notes, for example, that at common law \"it was robbery to pull a diamond pin out of a woman's hair when doing so tore away hair attached to the pin,\" ante, at 4, and as anyone who has ever pulled a bobby pin out of her hair knows, hair can break from even the most minimal force.  In the majority's telling, however, the ACCA itself \"encompasses the degree of force necessary to commit common-law robbery.\"  Ante, at 13.  That proposition is flatly inconsistent with Johnson.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In explaining its interpretation of \"physical force,\" the Court in Johnson expressly rejected the common law's definition of \"force,\" see 559 U.\u00a0S., at 139, instead recognizing that the phrase should be \"give[n]\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. its ordinary meaning,\" id., at 138.  At common law, \"force\" could be \"satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching.\"  Id., at 139.  But as the Court observed, \"[a]lthough a common-law term of art should be given its established common-law meaning, we do not assume that a statutory word is used as a term of art where that meaning does not fit.\"  Ibid. (citation omitted).  Rather, \"context determines meaning,\" ibid., and, \"in the context of a statutory definition of 'violent felony,'\u00a0\" the ordinary rather than the  common-law meaning of \"force\" was what fit, id., at 140.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority now says that while Johnson rejected the common-law meaning of force with regard to battery, it nevertheless meant somehow to preserve the common-law meaning of force with regard to robbery.  See ante, at 4-6, 8-10.  In other words, to reach its conclusion, the majority must construe \"physical force\" in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) to bear two different meanings--Johnson's and the majority's--depending on the crime to which it is being applied.  That is a radical and unsupportable step.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be clear, the majority does not simply rule that the phrase \"physical force\" carries the common-law meaning in one place but a different meaning in another statutory provision.  There would certainly be precedent for that.  See, e.g., United States v. Castleman, 572 U.\u00a0S. 157, 162-168 (2014) (explaining why the phrase \"physical force\" took on a common-law meaning, rather than its ACCA meaning under Johnson, in the context of a statute defining a \"\u00a0'misdemeanor crime of domestic violence'\u00a0\").  Johnson, in fact, expressly reserved the question whether \"physical force\" might mean something different in the context of a different statutory definition.  See 559 U.\u00a0S., at 143-144.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What Johnson did not do, however, was suggest that \"physical force\" in a single clause--the elements clause--that Johnson addressed might mean two different things for two different crimes.  See id., at 143 (\"We have interpreted the phrase 'physical force' only in the context of a statutory definition of 'violent felony'\u00a0\"); see also id., at 138-142.  Johnson had good reason not to say so: because that is not how we have said that statutory interpretation works.  See, e.g., Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.\u00a0S. 371, 378 (2005) (observing that a single statutory word or phrase \"cannot .\u00a0.\u00a0. be interpreted to do\" two different things \"at the same time\"); Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.\u00a0S. 135, 143 (1994) (similar).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Starting today, however, the phrase \"physical force\" in \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) will apparently lead a Janus-faced existence.  When it comes to battery, that phrase will look toward ordinary meaning; when it comes to robbery, that same piece of statutory text will look toward the common law.  To the extent that is a tenable construction, the majority has announced a brave new world of textual interpretation.  To the extent that a phrase so divided cannot stand, meanwhile, one could be forgiven for thinking that the majority, though it claims to praise Johnson, comes instead to bury it.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To shore up its argument that the ACCA's use of the phrase \"physical force,\" at least in the context of robbery, takes on the common-law meaning of \"force,\" the majority invokes the history of the ACCA.  Statutory history is no help to the majority here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the majority notes, a precursor to the ACCA prescribed a mandatory-minimum sentence for people convicted of firearm offenses who had three qualifying prior convictions \"for robbery or burglary.\"  18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. App. \u00a71202(a) (1982 ed., Supp. II).  That statute defined robbery, as relevant, as \"the taking of the property of another .\u00a0.\u00a0. by force or violence.\"  \u00a71202(c)(8) (1982 ed., Supp. II).  See ante, at 3-4.  In other words, it is undisputed that at one point, in a previous statute, Congress enumerated robbery as a qualifying predicate and used the words \"force or violence\" to describe a generic version of the crime.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, in 1986, Congress changed the statute, substituting instead the language we know today.  See Career Criminals Amendment Act of 1986, \u00a71402, 100 Stat. 3207-39.  Gone was any explicit reference to \"robbery\"; in its place came not only the elements clause (our focus here) but also the enumerated clause (which retained an express reference to \"burglary\" but omitted \"robbery\") and the capacious residual clause (struck down in 2015).  See ante, at 6; supra, at 2; see also Taylor, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 582-584.  So Congress did two salient things: It expanded the predicates in general, and it deleted an express reference to robbery.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority reasons that because (1) the old law's definition of \"robbery\" as a taking involving \"force or violence\" matched various common-law definitions of robbery, (2) Congress kept the word \"force\" (though not \"or violence\") in the new law's elements clause while deleting the word \"robbery,\" and (3) Congress meant to expand the enhancement's reach in a general sense, Congress must have meant for the phrase \"physical force\" in the new law also to carry the common-law meaning of robbery.  See ante, at 4-7.  The conclusion that the majority draws from these premises does not follow, for at least four reasons.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, as already discussed, the question whether Congress' use of the phrase \"physical force\" in the new law--that is, in the ACCA's elements clause--carries the  common-law meaning of \"force\" was already asked and answered by Johnson: It does not.  See 559 U.\u00a0S., at 138-143, 145; supra, at 9-10.  This part of the majority's argument may be couched in statutory history, but it is no more than an attempt to relitigate Johnson.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, Congress deleted the word \"robbery\" from the statute altogether while still enumerating robbery's former neighbor, \"burglary,\" in the enumerated clause.  See supra, at 2, 11.  When Congress keeps one piece of statutory text while deleting another, we generally \"have no trouble concluding that\" it does so with purpose, see, e.g., Director of Revenue of Mo. v. CoBank ACB, 531 U.\u00a0S. 316, 324 (2001), absent some reason to believe that the missing term simply got \"lost in the shuffle,\" United States v. Wilson, 503 U.\u00a0S. 329, 336 (1992).  See also, e.g., Russello v. United States, 464 U.\u00a0S. 16, 23-24 (1983) (\"Where Congress includes limiting language in an earlier version of a bill but deletes it prior to enactment, it may be presumed that the limitation was not intended\").  Here, it is inconceivable that Congress simply lost track of robbery, one of only two generic crimes that it enumerated in the old statute.  Accordingly, if Congress had wanted to retain the old statute's specific emphasis on robbery, the natural reading is that it would have accomplished that goal the same way it did with burglary: by making it an enumerated offense.  That it did not do so is telling.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, the fact that Congress wished to \"expan[d] the predicate offenses triggering the sentence enhancement,\" Taylor, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 582, is entirely consistent with paring back the statute's sweep with regard to robbery specifically.  I may wish to expand the contents of my refrigerator,  but that does not mean that I will buy more of every single item that is currently in it the next time that I go shopping.  Here, the ACCA--with its (new, generalized) elements clause, its (augmented) enumerated clause, and (until recently) its highly capacious residual clause--undeniably expanded the precursor statute's bare enumeration of robbery and burglary, regardless of how many robbery statutes qualify as predicates specifically under the elements clause.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth, even assuming that Congress wanted robbery to remain largely encompassed by the ACCA despite deleting the word from the precursor statute, that intent is fully consistent with properly applying Johnson here.  The majority, by focusing on the elements clause, ignores the residual clause, which--until it was declared unconstitutional in 2015--provided a home for many crimes regardless of whether they included an element of violent \"physical force.\"2  Hewing to a proper reading of Johnson, in other words, does not require assuming that Congress constricted the precursor statute's application to robbery when it enacted today's ACCA; whatever robberies would have qualified under the old statute presumably could have still qualified under the residual clause during its nearly 20-year existence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, the statutory history does not undermine the conclusion that the ACCA's elements clause, under our precedents, is not broad enough to encompass Florida's robbery statute.  Congress deleted the word \"robbery,\" kept the word \"burglary,\" supplemented burglary with the catchall residual clause that still captured many robberies outside the elements clause, and used the phrase \"physical force\" in the elements clause to define a type of \"violent felony,\" which Johnson tells us requires more force than the term's common-law meaning denotes.  See 559 U.\u00a0S., at 138-143, 145.  Statutory history cannot get the majority past both the text and the force of stare decisis here.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That leaves the majority with only the practical consequences that it asserts would follow if this Court were to hold that Florida robbery does not qualify under the ACCA's elements clause.  See ante, at 7-8.  While looking to how an interpretation of a federal statute would affect the applicability of related state statutes can be a useful approach in these cases, see, e.g., Castleman, 572 U.\u00a0S.,  at 167, the results that follow from a proper reading of Johnson are not nearly as incongruous as the majority suggests.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To begin, take the majority's assertion \"that many States' robbery statutes would not qualify as ACCA predicates,\" ante, at 7, if the Court were to apply Johnson as it was written. The accuracy of this statement is far less certain than the majority's opinion lets on.  While Stokeling and the Government come close to agreeing that at least 31 States' robbery statutes do have an overcoming-resistance requirement, see ante, at 7, that number is not conclusive because neither Stokeling nor the Government has offered an accounting of how many of those States allow minimal force to satisfy that requirement, as Florida does.  Because robbery laws vary from State to State, and because even similarly worded statutes may be construed differently by different States' courts, some of those 31 States may well require more force than Florida does.  See, e.g., United States v. Doctor, 842 F.\u00a03d 306, 312 (CA4 2016) (ruling that \"there is no indication that South Carolina robbery by violence\"--a statute cited by the Government here--\"can be committed with minimal actual force\"); see also Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.\u00a0S. 183, 193 (2007) (explaining that the categorical approach \"requires a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime\").3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, even if it is true \"that many States' robbery statutes would not qualify as ACCA predicates\" under a faithful reading of Johnson, see ante, at 7, that outcome would stem just as much (if not more) from the death of the residual clause as from a decision in this case.  As discussed above, various state robbery statutes qualified under that expansive clause for nearly 20 years, until vagueness problems led this Court to strike the clause down as unconstitutional.  See supra, at 13-14, and n.\u00a02; see also Johnson v. United States, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015).  The fall of that clause would therefore be an independent cause of any drop in qualifying predicates, regardless of what this Court decides today.  (A drop in robbery statutes qualifying as ACCA predicates could also, of course, be traceable to Congress' decision not to continue enumerating robbery when it enacted the ACCA in the first place.)  In short, the majority, fearful for the camel, errs in blaming the most recent straw.4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Separately, even if a number of simple robbery statutes were to cease qualifying as ACCA predicates, that does not mean--as the majority implies, see ante, at 7--that the same fate necessarily would befall most or even many aggravated robbery statutes.  The majority offers the single example of Florida aggravated robbery, noting that \"Florida requires the same element of 'force' for both armed robbery and basic robbery.\"  Ibid.  But while the majority accurately describes Florida law, there is scant reason to believe that a great many other States' statutes would be similarly affected, because the effect that hewing to Johnson would have on Florida aggravated robbery stems from the idiosyncrasy that Florida aggravated robbery requires neither displaying a weapon nor threatening or inflicting bodily injury.5  The result for Florida aggravated robbery therefore sheds little light on what would happen to other aggravated-robbery statutes, the vast majority of which do (and did at the time of the ACCA's enactment) appear to provide for convictions on such grounds--and whose validity as ACCA predicates would not necessarily turn on the question the Court faces today.6  The majority mistakes one anomalous result for a reason not to apply Johnson as it was written.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court's decision in Johnson tells us that when Congress wrote the words \"physical force\" in the context of a statute targeting \"violent felon[ies],\" it eschewed the common-law meaning of those words and instead required a higher degree of force.  See 559 U.\u00a0S., at 138-143, 145.  Johnson resolves this case.  Florida law requires no more than minimal force to commit Florida robbery, and Florida law therefore defines that crime more broadly than Congress defined the elements clause.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The crime that most people think of when they think of \"robbery\" is a serious one.  That is all the more reason, however, that this Court should not allow a dilution of the term in state law to drive the expansion of a federal statute targeted at violent recidivists.  Florida law applies the label \"robbery\" to crimes that are, at most, a half-notch above garden-variety pickpocketing or shoplifting.  The Court today does no service to Congress' purposes or our own precedent in deeming such crimes to be \"violent felonies\"--and thus predicates for a 15-year mandatory-minimum sentence in federal prison.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent. \n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1*\u00a0The Government did not argue that Florida robbery should qualify under \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), presumably because robbery is not among the enumerated offenses and the Court held the \"residual clause\" unconstitutionally vague in Johnson v. United States, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015).\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Of course, whether Congress wished to pull back the throttle with regard to robbery across the whole ACCA is less certain.  (Recall that Congress also enacted the capacious residual clause.)  But that is why the statutory history cannot tell us what the majority claims that it can about the elements clause specifically.  Instead, the more reliable guide is the new text that Congress enacted to replace the old.  Cf. West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.\u00a0S. 83, 98 (1991) (\"The best evidence of [Congress'] purpose is the statutory text adopted by both Houses of Congress and submitted to the President\").  And here, Congress omitted generic robbery altogether and made the \"violent felony\" clause at issue require \"physical force.\"  See supra, at 2, 4-5, 11.\nFootnote 2\u00a0In fact, the case in which this Court ruled that its decision striking down the residual clause applied retroactively on collateral review centered on a Florida robbery conviction under \u00a7812.13(1).  See Welch v. United States, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2016) (slip op., at 4-5).  The Eleventh Circuit, reviewing the defendant's ACCA enhancement on direct appeal, had ruled that Florida robbery (including when, under previous law, it could be accomplished merely \"by sudden snatching\") qualified as an ACCA predicate under the residual clause without deciding whether it also qualified under the elements clause.  See United States v. Welch, 683 F.\u00a03d 1304, 1310-1314 (2012).  Other Circuits likewise ruled, in the years before the clause's demise, that other state robbery statutes qualified under the residual clause.  See, e.g., United States v. Mitchell, 743 F.\u00a03d 1054, 1062-1063 (CA6 2014) (collecting cases).\nFootnote 3\u00a0The majority is able to suggest that following Johnson would beget a larger practical effect because it frames the question presented more broadly than is warranted.  The majority avers that \"[t]his case requires us to decide whether a robbery offense that has as an element the use of force sufficient to overcome a victim's resistance necessitates the use of 'physical force' within the meaning of the [ACCA].\"  Ante, at 1. But this case hinges on the fact that the Florida courts have ruled that the amount of resistance offered--and therefore the amount of force necessary to overcome it--is irrelevant.  See supra, at 6-7.  In other words, this case presents only the narrower question whether a robbery offense that has as an element the use of force sufficient to overcome a victim's resistance--even if that resistance is minimal-- necessitates the use of \"physical force\" within the meaning of the ACCA.  See also Brief for Petitioner i.  If a state robbery statute's overcoming-resistance requirement were pegged under state law to more than minimal resistance, this would be a different case.\nFootnote 4\u00a0The majority's doubling down on Johnson's \"capable of causing physical pain or injury\" language, see ante, at 10-11, suggests nostalgia for the residual clause (which reads: \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)).  Congress could, at any time, re-enumerate robbery (and any other crimes it might have intended the residual clause to cover) if it so chose.  The majority's decision today, meanwhile--with its endorsement of the mere \"potentiality\" of injury, see ante, at 11--risks sowing confusion in the lower courts for years to come.\nFootnote 5\u00a0Specifically, hewing to a proper reading of Johnson would also affect Florida's aggravated robbery statute because the crime's only element involving force is the one that it shares with Florida simple robbery.  See Fla. Stat. \u00a7812.13(1).  In Florida, robbery becomes aggravated if the defendant \"carrie[s]\" a weapon, see \u00a7812.13(2), but that means that the crime sweeps in offenders who never brandished, used, or otherwise intimated that they were armed, see, e.g., State v. Burris, 875 So.\u00a02d 408, 413 (Fla. 2004), and therefore prevents the crime from necessarily involving the \"threatened use of physical force,\" see 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i).  See also Tr. of Oral Arg. 4 (explaining this point).\nFootnote 6\u00a0See, e.g., Ala. Code \u00a713A-8-41(a)(2) (2015); Alaska Stat. \u00a7\u00a711.41.500(a)(2)-(3) (2016); Ariz. Rev. Stat.

FROST, IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS ALASKA REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, ET AL.(2019)\nNo. 17-949\nArgued: November 5, 2018Decided: March 26, 2019\n\n\nThe Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) set aside 104 million acres of federally owned land in Alaska for preservation purposes.  With that land, ANILCA created ten new national parks, monuments, and preserves (areas known as \"conservation system units\").  16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73102(4).  And in sketching those units' boundary lines, Congress made an uncommon choice--to follow natural features rather than enclose only federally owned lands.  It thus swept in a vast set of so-called inholdings--more than 18 million acres of state, Native, and private land.  Had Congress done nothing more, those inholdings could have become subject to many National Park Service rules, as the Service has broad authority under its Organic Act to administer both lands and waters within parks across the country.  54 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7100751.  But Congress added Section 103(c), the provision principally in dispute in this case.  Section 103(c)'s first sentence states that \"[o]nly\" the \"public lands\"--defined as most federally owned lands, waters, and associated interests--within any system unit's boundaries are \"deemed\" a part of that unit.  16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73103(c).  The second sentence provides that no state, Native, or private lands \"shall be subject to the regulations applicable solely to public lands within [system] units.\"  Ibid.  And the third sentence permits the Service to \"acquire such lands\" from \"the State, a Native Corporation, or other owner,\" after which it may \"administer[\u00a0]\" the land just as it does the other \"public lands within such units.\"  Ibid. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner John Sturgeon traveled for decades by hovercraft up a stretch of the Nation River that lies within the boundaries of the Yukon-Charley Preserve, a conservation system unit in Alaska.  On one such trip, Park rangers informed him that the Service's rules prohibit operating a hovercraft on navigable waters \"located within [a park's] boundaries.\"  36 CFR \u00a72.17(e).  That regulation--issued under the Service's Organic Act authority--applies to parks nationwide without any \"regard to the ownership of submerged lands, tidelands, or lowlands.\"  \u00a71.2(a)(3).  Sturgeon complied with the order, but shortly thereafter sought an injunction that would allow him to resume using his hovercraft on his accustomed route.  The District Court and the Ninth Circuit denied him relief, interpreting Section 103(c) to limit only the Service's authority to impose Alaska-specific regulations on inholdings--not its authority to enforce nationwide regulations like the hovercraft rule.  This Court granted review and rejected that ground for dismissal, but it remanded for consideration of two further questions: whether the Nation River \"qualifies as 'public land' for purposes of ANILCA,\" thus indisputably subjecting it to the Service's regulatory authority; and, if not, whether the Service could nevertheless \"regulate Sturgeon's activities on the Nation River.\"  Sturgeon v. Frost, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (Sturgeon I).  The Ninth Circuit never got past the first question, as it concluded that the Nation River was public land.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0The Nation River is not public land for purposes of ANILCA.  \"[P]ublic land\" under ANILCA means (almost all) \"lands, waters, and interests therein\" the \"title to which is in the United States.\"  16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73102(1)-(3).  Because running waters cannot be owned, the United States does not have \"title\" to the Nation River in the ordinary sense.  And under the Submerged Lands Act, it is the State of Alaska--not the United States--that holds \"title to and ownership of the lands beneath [the River's] navigable waters.\"  43 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71311.  The Service therefore argues that the United States has \"title\" to an \"interest\" in the Nation River under the reserved-water-rights doctrine, which provides that when the Federal Government reserves public land, it can retain rights to the specific \"amount of water\" needed to satisfy the purposes of that reservation.  See Cappaert v. United States, 426 U.\u00a0S. 128, 138-141.  But even assuming that the Service held such a right, the Nation River itself would not thereby become \"public land\" in the way the Service contends.  Under ANILCA, the \"public land\" would consist only of the Federal Government's specific \"interest\" in the River--i.e., its reserved water right.  And that right, the Service agrees, merely allows it to protect waters in the park from depletion or diversion.  The right could not justify applying the hovercraft rule on the Nation River, as that rule targets nothing of the kind.  Pp.\u00a012-15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Non-public lands within Alaska's national parks are exempt from the Park Service's ordinary regulatory authority.  Section 103(c) arose out of concern from the State, Native Corporations, and private individuals that ANILCA's broadly drawn boundaries might subject their properties to Park Service rules.  Section 103(c)'s first sentence therefore sets out which land within those new parks qualify as parkland--\"[o]nly\" the \"public lands\" within any system unit's boundaries are \"deemed\" a part of that unit.  By negative implication, non-public lands are \"deemed\" outside the unit.  In other words, non-federally owned lands inside system units (on a map) are declared outside them (for the law).  The effect of that exclusion, as Section 103(c)'s second sentence affirms, is to exempt non-public lands, including waters, from Park Service regulations.  That is, the Service's rules will apply \"solely\" to public lands within the units.  16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73103(c).  And for that reason, the third sentence provides a kind of escape hatch--it allows the Service to acquire inholdings when it believes regulation of those lands is needed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Service's alternative interpretation of Section 103(c) is unpersuasive.  The provision's second sentence, it says, means that if a Park Service regulation on its face applies \"solely\" to public lands, then the regulation cannot apply to non-public lands.  But if instead the regulation covers public and non-public lands alike, then the second sentence has nothing to say: The regulation can indeed cover both.  On that view, Section 103(c)'s second sentence is a mere truism, not any kind of limitation.  It does nothing to exempt inholdings from any regulation that might otherwise apply.  And because that is so, the Government's reading also strips the first and third sentences of their core functions.  The first sentence's \"deeming\" has no point, since there is no reason to pretend that inholdings are not part of a park if they can still be regulated as parklands.  And the third sentence's acquisition option has far less utility if the Service has its full regulatory authority over lands the Federal Government does not own.  This sort of statute-gutting cannot be squared with ANILCA's text and context.  Pp.\u00a016-26.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.\u00a0Navigable waters within Alaska's national parks--no less than other non-public lands--are exempt from the Park Service's normal regulatory authority.  The Service argues that, if nothing else, ANILCA must at least allow it to regulate navigable waters.  The Act, however, does not readily allow the decoupling of navigable waters from other non-federally owned areas in Alaskan national parks.  ANILCA defines \"land\" to mean \"lands, waters, and interests therein,\" \u00a73102(1)-(3); so when it refers to \"lands\" in Section 103(c) (and throughout the Act) it means waters as well.  Nothing in the few aquatic provisions to which the Service points conflicts with reading Section 103(c)'s regulatory exemption to cover navigable waters.  The Government largely relies on the Act's statements of purpose, but this Court's construction leaves the Service with multiple tools to \"protect\" and \"preserve\" rivers in Alaska's national parks, as those provisions anticipate.  See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a73181(j), 3191(b)(7).  While such authority might fall short of the Service's usual power, it accords with ANILCA's \"repeated[\u00a0] recogni[tion]\" that Alaska is \"the exception, not the rule.\"  Sturgeon I, 577 U.

See Sturgeon v. Frost, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016) (Sturgeon I\u00a0).  As we explained then, Sturgeon hunted moose along the Nation River in Alaska for some 40 years.  See id., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  He traveled by hovercraft, an amphibious vehicle able to glide over land and water alike.  To reach his favorite hunting ground, he would pilot the craft over a stretch of the Nation River that flows through the Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve, a unit of the federal park system managed by the National Park Service.  On one such trip, park rangers informed Sturgeon that a Park Service regulation prohibits the use of hovercrafts on rivers within any federal preserve or park.  Sturgeon complied with their order to remove his hovercraft from the Yukon-Charley, thus \"heading home without a moose.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6).  But soon afterward, Sturgeon sued the Park Service, seeking an injunction that would allow him to resume using his hovercraft on his accustomed route.  The lower courts denied him relief.  This Court, though, thought there was more to be said.  See id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 15-16).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we put the matter then, Sturgeon's case raises the issue how much \"Alaska is different\" from the rest of the country--how much it is \"the exception, not the rule.\"  Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 13-14).  The rule, just as the rangers told Sturgeon, is that the Park Service may regulate boating and other activities on waters within national parks--and that it has banned the use of hovercrafts there.  See 54 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7100751(b); 36 CFR \u00a72.17(e) (2018).  But Sturgeon claims that Congress created an Alaska-specific exception to that broad authority when it enacted the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), 94 Stat. 2371, 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73101 et seq.  In Alaska, Sturgeon argues, the Park Service has no power to regulate lands or waters that the Federal Government does not own; rather, the Service may regulate only what ANILCA calls \"public land\" (essentially, federally owned land) in national parks.  And, Sturgeon continues, the Federal Government does not own the Nation River--so the Service cannot ban hovercrafts there.  When we last faced that argument, we disagreed with the reason the lower courts gave to reject it.  But we remanded the case for consideration of two remaining questions.  First, does \"the Nation River qualif[y] as 'public land' for purposes of ANILCA\"?  577 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  Second, \"even if the [Nation] is not 'public land,'\u00a0\" does the Park Service have authority to \"regulate Sturgeon's activities\" on the part of the river in the Yukon-Charley?  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 16).  Today, we take up those questions, and answer both \"no.\"  That means Sturgeon can again rev up his hovercraft in search of moose.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We begin, as Sturgeon I did, with a slice of Alaskan history.  The United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867.  It thereby acquired \"[i]n a single stroke\" 365 million acres of land--an area more than twice the size of Texas.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2).  You might think that would be enough to go around.  But in the years since, the Federal Government and Alaskans (including Alaska Natives) have alternately contested and resolved and contested and .\u00a0.\u00a0. so forth who should own and manage that bounty.  We offer here a few highlights because they are the backdrop against which Congress enacted ANILCA.  As we do so, you might catch a glimpse of some former-day John Sturgeons--who (for better or worse) sought greater independence from federal control and, in the process, helped to shape the current law.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For 90 years after buying Alaska, the Federal Government owned all its land.  At first, those living in Alaska--a few settlers and some 30,000 Natives--were hardly aware of that fact.  See E. Gruening, The State of Alaska 355 (1968).  American citizens mocked the Alaska purchase as Secretary of State \"Seward's Folly\" and President Johnson's \"Polar Bear Garden.\"  They paid no attention to the new area, leading to an \"era of total neglect.\"  Id., at 31.  But as Sturgeon I recounted, the turn of the century brought \"newfound recognition of Alaska's economic potential.\"  577 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).  Opportunities to mine, trap, and fish attracted tens of thousands more settlers and sparked an emerging export economy.  And partly because of that surge in commercial activity, the country's foremost conservationists--President Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot, chief of the fledgling Forest Service--took unprecedented action to protect Alaska's natural resources.  In particular, Roosevelt (and then President Taft) prevented settlers from logging or coal mining on substantial acreage.  See W. Borneman, Alaska: Saga of a Bold Land 240-241 (2003).  Alaskans responded by burning Pinchot in effigy and, more creatively, organizing the \"Cordova Coal Party\"--a mass dumping of imported Canadian coal (instead of English tea) into the Pacific Ocean (instead of Boston Harbor).  See ibid.  The terms of future conflict were thus set: resource conservation vs. economic development, federal management vs. local control.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the 1950s, Alaskans hankered for both statehood and land--and Congress decided to give them both.  In pressing for statehood, Alaska's delegate to the House of Representatives lamented that Alaskans were no better than \"tenants upon the estate of the national landlord\"; and Alaska's Governor (then a Presidential appointee) called on the country to \"[e]nd American [c]olonialism.\"  W. Everhart, The National Park Service 126-127 (1983) (Everhart).  Ever more aware of Alaska's economic and strategic importance, Congress agreed the time for statehood had come.  The 1958 Alaska Statehood Act, 72 Stat. 339, made Alaska the country's 49th State.  And because the new State would need property--to propel private industry and create a tax base--the Statehood Act made a land grant too.  Over the next 35 years, Alaska could select for itself 103 million acres of \"vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved\" federal land--an area totaling the size of California.  \u00a7\u00a76(a)-(b), 72 Stat. 340, as amended; see Everhart 127.  And more: By incorporating the Submerged Lands Act of 1953, the Statehood Act gave Alaska \"title to and ownership of the lands beneath navigable waters,\" such as the Nation River.  43 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71311; see \u00a76(m), 72 Stat. 343.  And a State's title to the lands beneath navigable waters brings with it regulatory authority over \"navigation, fishing, and other public uses\" of those waters.  United States v. Alaska, 521 U.\u00a0S. 1, 5 (1997).  All told, the State thus emerged a formidable property holder.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the State's bonanza provoked land claims from Alaska Natives.  Their ancestors had lived in the area for thousands of years, and they asserted aboriginal title to much of the property the State was now taking (and more besides).  See Everhart 127.  When their demands threatened to impede the trans-Alaska pipeline, Congress stepped in.  The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 (ANCSA) extinguished the Natives' aboriginal claims.  See 85 Stat. 688, as amended, 43 U. S. C. \u00a71601 et seq.  But it granted the Natives much in return.  Under the law, corporations organized by groups of Alaska Natives could select for themselves 40 million acres of federal land--equivalent, when combined, to all of Pennsylvania.  See \u00a7\u00a71605, 1610-1615.  So the Natives became large landowners too.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet one more land dispute loomed.  In addition to settling the Natives' claims, ANCSA directed the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to designate, subject to congressional approval, 80 million more acres of federal land for inclusion in the national park, forest, or wildlife systems.  See \u00a71616(d)(2).  The Secretary dutifully made his selections, but Congress failed to ratify them within the five-year period ANCSA had set.  Rather than let the designations lapse, President Carter invoked another federal law (the 1906 Antiquities Act) to proclaim most of the lands (totaling 56 million acres) national monuments, under the National Park Service's aegis.  See 577 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  Many Alaskans balked.  \"[R]egard[ing] national parks as just one more example of federal interference,\" protesters demonstrated throughout the State and several thousand joined in the so-called Great Denali-McKinley Trespass.  Everhart 129; see 577 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  \"The goal of the trespass,\" as Sturgeon I explained, \"was to break over 25 Park Service rules in a two-day period.\"  Ibid.  One especially eager participant played a modern-day Paul Revere, riding on horseback through the crowd to deliver the message: \"The Feds are coming!  The Feds are coming!\"  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so they were--but not in quite the way President Carter had contemplated.  Responding to the uproar his proclamation had set off, Congress enacted a third major piece of legislation allocating land in Alaska.  We thus reach ANILCA, the statute principally in dispute in this case, in which Congress set aside extensive land for national parks and preserves--but on terms different from those governing such areas in the rest of the country.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Starting with the statement of purpose in its first section, ANILCA sought to \"balance\" two goals, often thought conflicting. 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73101(d).  The Act was designed to \"provide[] sufficient protection for the national interest in the scenic, natural, cultural and environmental values on the public lands in Alaska.\"  Ibid.  \"[A]nd at the same time,\" the Act was framed to \"provide[] adequate opportunity for satisfaction of the economic and social needs of the State of Alaska and its people.\"  Ibid.  So if, as you continue reading, you see some tension within the statute, you are not mistaken: It arises from Congress's twofold ambitions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ANILCA set aside 104 million acres of federally owned land in Alaska for preservation purposes.  See 577 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  In doing so, the Act rescinded President Carter's monument designations.  But it brought into the national park, forest, or wildlife systems millions more acres than even ANCSA had contemplated.  The park system's share of the newly withdrawn land (to be administered, as usual, by the Park Service) was nearly 44 million acres--an amount that more than doubled the system's prior (nationwide) size.  See Everhart 132.  With that land, ANILCA created ten new national parks, monuments, and preserves--including the Yukon-Charley Preserve--and expanded three old ones.  See \u00a7\u00a7410hh, 410hh-1.  In line with the Park Service's usual terminology, ANILCA calls each such park or other area a \"conservation system unit.\"  \u00a73102(4) (\"The term .\u00a0.\u00a0. means any unit in Alaska of the National Park System\"); see 54 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7100102(6) (similar).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sketching those units' boundary lines, Congress made an uncommon choice--to follow \"topographic or natural features,\" rather than enclose only federally owned lands.  \u00a73103(b); see Brief for Respondents 24 (agreeing that \"ANILCA [is] atypical in [this] respect\").  In most parks outside Alaska, boundaries surround mainly federal property holdings.  \"[E]arly national parks were carved out of a larger public domain, in which virtually all land\" was federally owned.  Sax, Helpless Giants: The National Parks and the Regulation of Private Lands, 75 Mich. L.\u00a0Rev. 239, 263 (1976); see Dept. of Interior, Nat. Park Serv., Statistical Abstract 87 (2017) (Table 9) (noting that only 2 of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres are in non-federal hands).  And even in more recently established parks, Congress has used gerrymandered borders to exclude most non-federal land.  See Sax, Buying Scenery, 1980 Duke L.\u00a0J. 709, 712, and n. 12.  But Congress had no real way to do that in Alaska.  Its prior cessions of property to the State and Alaska Natives had created a \"confusing patchwork of ownership\" all but impossible to draw one's way around.  C. Naske & H. Slotnick, Alaska: A History 317 (3d ed. 2011).  What's more, an Alaskan Senator noted, the United States might want to reacquire state or Native holdings in the same \"natural areas\" as reserved federal land; that could occur most handily if Congress drew boundaries, \"wherever possible, to encompass\" those holdings and authorized the Secretary to buy whatever lay inside.  126 Cong. Rec. 21882 (1980) (remarks of Sen. Stevens).  The upshot was a vast set of so-called inholdings--more than 18 million acres of state, Native, and private land--that wound up inside Alaskan system units.  See 577 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 5-6).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had Congress done nothing more, those inholdings could have become subject to many Park Service rules--the same kind of \"restrictive federal regulations\" Alaskans had protested in the years leading up to ANILCA (and further back too).  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  That is because the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Park Service, has broad authority under the National Park Service Organic Act (Organic Act), 39 Stat. 535, to administer both lands and waters within all system units in the country.  See 54 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7100751, 100501, 100102.  The Secretary \"shall prescribe such regulations as [he] considers necessary or proper for the use and management of System units.\"  \u00a7100751(a).  And he may, more specifically, issue regulations concerning \"boating and other activities on or relating to water located within System units.\"  \u00a7100751(b).  Those statutory grants of power make no distinctions based on the ownership of either lands or waters (or lands beneath waters).1  And although the Park Service has sometimes chosen not to regulate non-federally owned lands and waters, it has also imposed major restrictions on their use.  Rules about mining and solid-waste disposal, for example, apply to all lands within system units \"whether federally or nonfederally owned.\"  36 CFR \u00a76.2; see \u00a79.2.  And (of particular note here) the Park Service freely regulates activities on all navigable (and some other) waters \"within [a park's] boundaries\"--once more, \"without regard to .\u00a0.\u00a0. ownership.\"  \u00a71.2(a)(3).  So Alaska and its Natives had reason to worry about how the Park Service would regulate their lands and waters within the new parks.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress thus acted, as even the Park Service agrees, to give the State and Natives \"assurance that their [lands] wouldn't be treated just like\" federally owned property.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 50.  (It is only--though this is quite a large \"only\"--the nature and extent of that assurance that is in dispute.)  The key provision here is Section 103(c), which contains three sentences that may require some re-reading.  We quote it first in one block; then provide some definitions; then go over it again a bit more slowly.  But still, you should expect to return to this text as you proceed through this opinion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 103(c) provides in full:\n\"Only those lands within the boundaries of any conservation system unit which are public lands (as such term is defined in this Act) shall be deemed to be included as a portion of such unit.  No lands which, before, on, or after [the date of ANILCA's passage], are conveyed to the State, to any Native Corporation, or to any private party shall be subject to the regulations applicable solely to public lands within such units.  If the State, a Native Corporation, or other owner desires to convey any such lands, the Secretary may acquire such lands in accordance with applicable law (including this Act), and any such lands shall become part of the unit, and be administered accordingly.\"  \u00a73103(c).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now for the promised definitions.  The term \"land,\" as found in all three sentences, actually--and crucially for this case--\"means lands, waters, and interests therein.\"  \u00a73102(1).  The term \"public lands,\" in the first two sentences, then means \"lands\" (including waters and interests therein) \"the title to which is in the United States\"--except for lands selected for future transfer to the State or Native Corporations (under the Statehood Act or ANCSA).  \u00a73102(2), (3); see supra, at 4-5.  \"Public lands\" are therefore most but not quite all lands (and again, waters and interests) that the Federal Government owns.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, to recap.  As explained in Sturgeon I, \"Section 103(c) draws a distinction between 'public' and 'non-public' lands within the boundaries of conservation system units in Alaska.\"  577 U.\u00a0S., at __ (slip op., at 14).  Section 103(c)'s first sentence makes clear that only public lands (again, defined as most federally owned lands, waters, and associated interests) would be considered part of a system unit (again, just meaning a national park, preserve, or similar area).  By contrast, state, Native, or private lands would not be understood as part of such a unit, even though they in fact fall within its geographic boundaries.  Section 103(c)'s second sentence then expressly exempts all those non-public lands (the inholdings) from certain regulations--though exactly which ones, as will soon become clear, is a matter of dispute.  And last, Section 103(c)'s third sentence enables the Secretary to buy any inholdings.  If he does, the lands (because now public) become part of the park, and may be administered in  the usual way--e.g., without the provision's regulatory exemption.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We can now return to John Sturgeon, on his way to a hunting ground alternatively dubbed \"Moose Meadows\" or \"Sturgeon Fork.\"  As recounted above, Sturgeon used to travel by hovercraft up a stretch of the Nation River that lies within the boundaries of the Yukon-Charley Preserve.  See supra, at 1.  Until one day, three park rangers approached Sturgeon while he was repairing his steering cable and told him he was violating a Park Service rule.  According to the specified regulation, \"[t]he operation or use of hovercraft is prohibited\" on navigable (and some other) waters \"located within [a park's] boundaries,\" without any \"regard to .\u00a0.\u00a0. ownership.\"  36 CFR \u00a7\u00a72.17(e), 1.2(a)(3); see supra, at 2.  That regulation, issued under the Secretary's Organic Act authority, applies on its face to parks across the country.  See supra, at 8 (describing Organic Act).  And Sturgeon did not doubt that the Nation River is a navigable water.  But Sturgeon protested that in Alaska (even though nowhere else) the rule could not be enforced on a waterway--like, he said, the Nation River--that is not owned by the Federal Government. And when his objection got nowhere with the rangers (or with the Secretary, to whom he later petitioned), Sturgeon stopped using his hovercraft--but also brought this lawsuit, based on ANILCA's Section 103(c). \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Sturgeon I, we rejected one ground for dismissing Sturgeon's case, but remanded for consideration of two further questions.  The District Court and Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had held that even assuming the Nation River is non-public land, the Park Service could enforce its hovercraft ban there.  See 2013 WL 5888230 (Oct. 30, 2013); 768 F.\u00a03d 1066 (2014).  Those two courts interpreted Section 103(c) to limit only the Service's authority to impose Alaska-specific regulations on such lands--not its authority to apply nationwide regulations like the hovercraft rule.  But we viewed that construction as \"implausible.\"  577 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  ANILCA, we reasoned, \"repeatedly recognizes that Alaska is different.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13); see id., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (The Act \"reflect[s] the simple truth that Alaska is often the exception, not the rule\").  Yet the lower courts' reading would \"prevent the Park Service from recognizing Alaska's unique conditions\"--thus producing a \"topsy-turvy\" result.  Ibid.  Still, we thought two hurdles remained before Sturgeon could take his hovercraft out of storage.  We asked the Court of Appeals to decide whether the Nation River \"qualifies as 'public land' for purposes of ANILCA,\" thus indisputably subjecting it to the Service's regulatory authority.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  And if the answer was \"no,\" we asked the Ninth Circuit to address whether the Service, on some different theory from the one just dispatched, could still \"regulate Sturgeon's activities on the Nation River.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 16).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit never got past the first question because it concluded that the Nation River is \"public land[.]\"  See 872 F.\u00a03d 927, 936 (2017).  The court explained that it was bound by three circuit decisions construing that term, when used in ANILCA's provisions about subsistence fishing, as including all navigable waters.  Id., at 933-934.  Accordingly, the court again rejected Sturgeon's challenge.  Id., at 936.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And we again granted certiorari.  585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We first address whether, as the Ninth Circuit found, the Nation River is \"public land\" under ANILCA.  As defined, once again, that term means (almost all) \"lands, waters, and interests therein\" the \"title to which is in the United States.\"  16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73102(1)-(3).  If the Nation River comes within that definition, even Sturgeon agrees that the Park Service may enforce its hovercraft rule in the stretch traversing the Yukon-Charley.  That is because the Organic Act authorizes the Park Service to regulate boating and similar activities in parks and other system units--and under ANILCA's Section 103(c) those units include all \"public land\" within their boundaries.  54 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7100751(a)-(b); 16 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73103(c); see supra, at 8-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the United States does not have \"title\" (as the just-quoted definition demands) to the Nation River in the ordinary sense.  As the Park Service acknowledges, running waters cannot be owned--whether by a government or by a private party.  See FPC v. Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., 347 U.\u00a0S. 239, 247, n.\u00a010 (1954); Brief for Respondents 33.  In contrast, the lands beneath those waters--typically called submerged lands--can be owned, and the water regulated on that basis.  But that does not help the Park Service because, as noted earlier, the Submerged Lands Act gives each State \"title to and ownership of the lands beneath [its] navigable waters.\"  43 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71311; see supra, at 4.  That means Alaska, not the United States, has title to the lands beneath the Nation River.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So the Park Service argues instead that the United States has \"title\" to an \"interest\" in the Nation River, under what is called the reserved-water-rights doctrine.  See Brief for Respondents 32-37.  The canonical statement of that doctrine goes as follows: \"[W]hen the Federal Government withdraws its land from the public domain and reserves it for a federal purpose, the Government, by implication, reserves appurtenant water then unappropriated to the extent needed to accomplish the purpose of the reservation.\"  Cappaert v. United States, 426 U.\u00a0S. 128, 138 (1976).  For example, this Court decided that in reserving land for an Indian tribe, the Government impliedly reserved sufficient water from a nearby river to enable  the tribe to farm the area.  See Winters v. United States, 207 U.\u00a0S. 564, 576 (1908).  And similarly, we held that in creating a national monument to preserve a species of fish inhabiting an underground pool, the United States acquired an enforceable interest in preventing others from depleting the pool below the level needed for the fish to survive.  See Cappaert, 426 U.\u00a0S., at 147.  According to the Park Service, the United States has an analogous interest in the Nation River and other navigable waters in Alaska's national parks.  \"Because th[e] purposes [of those parks] require that the waters within [them] be safeguarded against depletion and diversion,\" the Service contends, \"Congress's reservations of park lands also reserved interests in appurtenant navigable waters.\"  Brief for Respondents 35.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That argument first raises the question whether it is even possible to hold \"title,\" as ANILCA uses the term, to reserved water rights.  16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73102(2).  Those rights, as all parties agree, are \"usufructuary\" in nature, meaning that they are rights for the Government to use--whether by withdrawing or maintaining--certain waters it does not own.  See Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., 347 U. S., at 246; Brief for Petitioner 36; Brief for Respondents 36.  The Park Service has found a couple of old cases suggesting that a person can hold \"title\" to such usufructuary interests.  See ibid.; Crum v. Mt. Shasta Power Corp., 220 Cal. 295, 307, 30 P.\u00a02d 30, 36 (1934); Radcliff's Ex'rs v. Mayor of Brooklyn, 4 N.\u00a0Y. 195, 196 (1850).  But the more common understanding, recently noted in another ANILCA case, is that \"reserved water rights are not the type of property interests to which title can be held\"; rather, \"the term 'title' applies\" to \"fee ownership of property\" and (sometimes) to \"possessory interests\" in property like those granted by a lease.  See Totemoff v. State, 905 P.\u00a02d 954, 965 (Alaska 1995) (collecting cases); Brief for State of Idaho et al. as Amici Curiae 21-22 (same).  And we see no evidence that the Congress enacting ANILCA meant to use the term in any less customary and more capacious sense.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But even assuming so, the Nation River itself would not thereby become \"public land\" in the way the Park Service argues.  Under ANILCA's definition, the \"public land\" at issue would consist only of the Federal Government's specific \"interest\" in the River--that is, its reserved water right. \u00a73102(1), (3).  And that reserved right, by its nature, is limited.  It does not give the Government plenary authority over the waterway to which it attaches.  Rather, the interest merely enables the Government to take or maintain the specific \"amount of water\"--and \"no more\"--required to \"fulfill the purpose of [its land] reservation.\"  Cappaert, 426 U.\u00a0S., at 141.  So, for example, in the cases described above, the Government could control only the volume of water necessary for the tribe to farm or the fish to survive.  See Winters, 207 U.\u00a0S., at 576-577; Cappaert, 426 U.\u00a0S., at 141.  And likewise here, the Government could protect \"only th[e] amount of water\" in the Nation River needed to \"accomplish the purpose of the [Yukon-Charley's] reservation.\"  Id., at 138, 141.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And whatever that volume, the Government's (purported) reserved right could not justify applying the hovercraft rule on the Nation River.  That right, to use the Park Service's own phrase, would support a regulation preventing the \"depletion or diversion\" of waters in the River (up to the amount required to achieve the Yukon-Charley's purposes).  Brief for Respondents 34-35.  But the hovercraft rule does nothing of that kind.  A hovercraft moves above the water, on a thin cushion of air produced by downward-directed fans; it does not \"deplet[e]\" or \"diver[t]\" any water.  Nor has the Park Service explained the hovercraft rule as an effort to protect the Nation River from pollution or other similar harm.  To the contrary, that rule is directed against the \"sight or sound\" of \"motorized equipment\" in remote locations--concerns not related to safeguarding the water.  48 Fed. Reg. 30258 (1983). So the Park Service's \"public lands\" argument runs aground: Even if the United States holds title to a reserved water right in the Nation River, that right (as opposed to title in the River itself) cannot prevent Sturgeon from wafting along the River's surface toward his preferred hunting ground.2\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We thus move on to the second question we posed in Sturgeon I, concerning the Park Service's power to regulate even non-public lands and waters within Alaska's system units (or, in our unofficial terminology, national parks).  The Service principally relies on that sort of  ownership-indifferent authority in defending its decision to expel Sturgeon's hovercraft from the Nation River.  See Brief for Respondents 16-18, 25-32.  And we can see why.  If Sturgeon lived in any other State, his suit would not have a prayer of success.  As noted earlier, the Park Service has used its Organic Act authority to ban hovercrafts on navigable waters \"located within [a national park's] boundaries\" without any \"regard to .\u00a0.\u00a0. ownership.\"  36 CFR \u00a7\u00a72.17(e), 1.2(a)(3); see supra, at 10-11.  And no one disputes that Sturgeon was driving his hovercraft on a stretch of the Nation River (a navigable water) inside the borders of the Yukon-Charley (a national park).  So case closed.  Except that Sturgeon lives in Alaska.  And as we have said before, \"Alaska is often the exception, not the rule.\"  Sturgeon I, 577 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  Here, Section 103(c) of ANILCA makes it so.  As explained below, that section provides that even when non-public lands--again, including waters--are geographically within a national park's boundaries, they may not be regulated as part of the park.  And that means the Park Service's hovercraft regulation cannot apply there.3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To understand why, first recall how Section 103(c) grew out of ANILCA's unusual method for drawing park boundaries.  See supra, at 7-8.  Those lines followed the area's \"natural features,\" rather than (as customary) the Federal Government's property holdings.  16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73103(b).  The borders thus took in immense tracts owned by the State, Native Corporations, and private individuals.  And as you might imagine, none of those parties was eager to have its lands newly regulated as national parks.  To the contrary, all of them wanted to preserve the regulatory status quo--to prevent ANILCA's maps from subjecting their properties to the Park Service's rules.  Hence arose Section 103(c).  Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 50 (Solicitor General acknowledging that Section 103(c) responds to the State's and Native Corporations' \"concern[s]\" about the effects of \"includ[ing their lands] within the outer boundaries\" of the new parks).  Now might be a good time to review that provision, block quoted above.  See supra, at 9.  In broad brush strokes, Sturgeon I described it as follows: \"Section 103(c) draws a distinction between 'public' and 'non-public' lands,\" including waters, \"within the boundaries of [Alaska's] conservation system units.\"  577 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 103(c)'s first sentence sets out the essential distinction, relating to what qualifies as parkland.  It provides, once again, that \"[o]nly\" the \"public lands\" (essentially, the federally owned lands) within any system unit's boundaries would be \"deemed\" a part of that unit.  \u00a73103(c).  The non-public lands (everything else) were, by negative implication, \"deemed\" not a part of the unit--even though within the unit's geographic boundaries.  The key word here is \"deemed.\"  That term is used in legal materials \"[t]o treat (something) as if .\u00a0.\u00a0. it were really something else.\"  Black's Law Dictionary 504 (10th ed. 2014).  Legislators (and other drafters) find the word \"useful\" when \"it is necessary to establish a legal fiction,\" either by \"'deeming' something to be what it is not\" or by \"'deeming' something not to be what it is.\"  Ibid. (quoting G.C. Thornton, Legislative Drafting 99 (4th ed. 1996)).  The fiction in Section 103(c) involves considering certain lands actually within the new national parks as instead without them.  As a matter of geography, both public and non-public lands fall inside those parks' boundaries.  But as a matter of law, only public lands would be viewed as doing so.  All non-public lands (again, including waters) would be \"deemed,\" abracadabra-style, outside Alaska's system units.4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The effect of that exclusion, as Section 103(c)'s second sentence affirms, is to exempt non-public lands, including waters, from the Park Service's ordinary regulatory authority.  Recall that the Organic Act pegs that authority to system units.  See supra, at 8.  The Service may issue rules thought \"necessary or proper\" for \"System units.\"  54 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7100751(a).  And more pertinently here, the Service may prescribe rules about activities on \"water located within System units.\"  \u00a7100751(b).  Absent Section 103(c), those grants of power enable the Service to administer even non-federally owned waters or lands inside national parks.  See supra, at 8.  But add Section 103(c), and the equation changes.  Now, according to that section's first sentence, non-federally owned waters and lands inside system units (on a map) are declared outside them (for the law).  So those areas are no longer subject to the Service's power over \"System units\" and the \"water located within\" them.  \u00a7100751(a), (b).  Instead, only the federal property in system units is subject to the Service's authority.5  And that is just what Section 103(c)'s second sentence pronounces, for waters and lands alike.  Again, that sentence says that no state, Native, or private lands \"shall be subject to the regulations applicable solely to public lands within [system] units.\"  16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73103(c).  The sentence thus expressly states the consequence of the statute's prior \"deeming.\"  The Service's rules will apply exclusively to public lands (meaning federally owned lands and waters) within system units.  The rules cannot apply to any non-federal properties, even if a map would show they are within such a unit's boundaries.  Geographic inholdings thus become regulatory outholdings, impervious to the Service's ordinary authority.6\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And for that reason, Section 103(c)'s third sentence provides a kind of escape hatch--for times when the Park Service believes regulation of the inholdings is needed.  In that event, \"the Secretary may acquire such lands\" from \"the State, a Native Corporation, or other owner.\"  \u00a73103(c).  (As noted earlier, facilitating those acquisitions was one reason Congress put non-federal lands inside park boundaries in the first instance.  See supra, at 7.)  When the Secretary makes such a purchase, the newly federal land \"become[s] part of the [system] unit.\"  \u00a73101(c).  And the Park Service may then \"administer[\u00a0]\" the land just as it does (in the second sentence's phrase) the other \"public lands within such units.\"  Ibid.  In thus providing a way out of the Section's first two sentences, the third underlines what they are doing: insulating the state, Native, or private lands that ANILCA enclosed in national parks from new and unexpected regulation.  In sum, those lands may be regulated only as they could have been before ANILCA's enactment, unless and until bought by the Federal Government.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Park Service interprets Section 103(c) differently, relying wholly on its second sentence and mostly on the single word \"solely\" there.  True enough, the Service acknowledges, that anxiety about how it would regulate inholdings was \"really what drove [Section] 103(c).\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 46; see supra, at 9, 17.  But still, the Service argues, the Section's second sentence exempts those non-public lands from only \"one particular class of Park Service regulations\"--to wit, rules \"\u00a0'applicable solely to public lands.'\u00a0\"  Brief for Respondents 30 (quoting and adding emphasis to \u00a73103(c)).  In other words, if a Park Service regulation on its face applies only (\"solely\") to public lands, then the regulation shall not apply to a park's non-public lands.  But if instead the regulation covers public and non-public lands alike, then the second sentence has nothing to say: The regulation can indeed cover both.  See ibid.  The Park Service labels that sentence a \"tailored limitation\" on its authority over inholdings.  Ibid.  And it concludes that the sentence has no bearing on the hovercraft rule, which expressly applies \"without regard to .\u00a0.\u00a0. ownership.\"  36 CFR \u00a71.2(a)(3).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But on the Park Service's view, Section 103(c)'s second sentence is a mere truism, not any kind of limitation (however \"tailored\").  Once again: It tells Alaskans, so the Park Service says, that rules applying only to public lands .\u00a0.\u00a0. will apply only to public lands.  And that rules applying to both public and non-public lands .\u00a0.\u00a0. will apply to both.  (Or, to say the same thing, but with approximate statutory definitions plugged in: It tells Alaskans that rules applying only to the Federal Government's lands .\u00a0.\u00a0. will apply only to the Federal Government's lands.  And that rules applying to federal, state, Native, and private lands alike .\u00a0.\u00a0. will apply to them all.)  In short, under the Park Service's reading, Section 103(c)'s second sentence does nothing but state the obvious.  Its supposed exemption does not in fact exempt anyone from anything to which they would otherwise be subject.  Remove the sentence from ANILCA and everything would be precisely the same.  For it curtails none of the Service's ordinary regulatory authority over inholdings.7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And more: The Park Service's reading of Section 103(c)'s second sentence also strips the first and third sentences of their core functions.  Under the Service's approach, the first sentence's \"deeming\" has no point.  There is no reason to pretend that inholdings are not part of a park if they can still be regulated as parklands.  Nor is there a need to create a special legal fiction if the end result is to treat Alaskan inholdings no differently from those in the rest of the country.  And similarly, the third sentence's acquisition option has far less utility if the Service has its full regulatory authority over lands the Federal Government does not own.  Why cough up money to \"administer[\u00a0]\" property as \"part of the [system] unit\" unless doing so makes a real difference, by removing a regulatory exemption otherwise in effect?  The Service's reading effectively turns the whole of Section 103(c) into an inkblot.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And still more (if implicit in all the above): That construction would undermine ANILCA's grand bargain.  Recall that ANILCA announced its Janus-faced nature in its statement of purpose, reflecting the century-long struggle over federal regulation of Alaska's resources.  See supra, at 3-6.  In that opening section, ANILCA spoke about safeguarding \"natural, scenic, historic[,] recreational, and wildlife values.\"  16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73101(a).  Yet it insisted as well on \"provid[ing] for\" Alaska's (and its citizens') \"economic and social needs.\"  \u00a73101(d).  In keeping with the statute's conservation goal, Congress reserved huge tracts of land for national parks.  But to protect Alaskans' economic well-being, it mitigated the consequences to non-federal owners whose land wound up in those new system units.  See supra, at 17-20.  Once again, even the Park Service acknowledges that Section 103(c) was supposed to provide an \"assurance\" that those owners would not be subject to all the regulatory constraints placed on neighboring federal properties.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 50; see id., at 46-47; supra, at 9, 17, 20.  But then the Service (head-spinningly) posits that it need only draft its regulations to cover both federal and non-federal lands in order to apply those rules to ANILCA's inholdings.  On that view, limitations on the Service's authority are purely a matter of administrative grace, dependent on how narrowly (or broadly) the Service chooses to write its regulations.  And ANILCA's carefully drawn balance is thrown off-kilter, as Alaskan, Native, and private inholdings  are exposed to the full extent of the Service's regulatory authority.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The word \"solely\" in Section 103(c)'s second sentence does not support that kind of statute-gutting.  We do not gainsay that the Park Service has identified a grammatically possible way of viewing that word's function: as pinpointing a narrow class of the Service's regulations (those \"solely applicable to public lands\").8  But that reading, for all the reasons just stated, is \"ultimately inconsistent\" with the \"text and context of the statute.\"  Sturgeon I, 577 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  And a different understanding of \"solely\" instead aligns with that text and context.  That word encapsulates Congress's view that the Park Service's regulations should apply \"solely\" to public lands (and not to state, Native, or private ones).  See supra, at 19, and n.\u00a05.  And the word serves to distinguish between the Park Service's rules and other regulations, both federal and state.  Consider if Congress had exempted non-public lands in a system unit from regulations  \"applicable to public lands\" there (without the \"solely\").  That language would apparently exempt those lands not just from park regulations but from a raft of others--e.g., pollution regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency, water safety regulations of the Coast Guard, even employment regulations of Alaska itself.  For those rules, too, apply to public lands inside national parks.  By adding \"solely,\" Congress made clear that the exemption granted was not from such generally applicable regulations.  Instead, it was from rules applying only in national parks--i.e., the newly looming Park Service rules.  Congress thus ensured that inholdings would emerge from ANILCA not worse off--but also not better off--than before.9\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The legislative history (for those who consider it) confirms, with unusual clarity, all we have said so far.  The Senate Report notes that state, Native, and private lands in the new Alaskan parks would be subject to \"[f\u00a0]ederal laws and regulations of general applicability,\" such as \"the Clean Air Act, the Water Pollution Control Act, [and] U.\u00a0S. Army Corps of Engineers wetlands regulations.\"  S. Rep. No. 96-413, p. 303 (1980).  But that would not be so of regulations applying only to parks.  The Senate Report states:\n\"Those private lands, and those public lands owned by the State of Alaska or a subordinate political entity, are not to be construed as subject to the management regulations which may be adopted to manage and administer any national conservation system unit which is adjacent to, or surrounds, the private or non-Federal public lands.\"  Ibid.\nThe sponsor of Section 103(c) in the House of Representatives described that provision's effect in similar terms.  The section was designed, he observed, to ensure that ANILCA's new boundary lines would \"not in any way change the status\" of the state, Native, and private lands placed within them.  125 Cong. Rec. 11158 (1979) (statement of Rep. Seiberling).  Those lands, he continued, \"are not parts of th[e system] unit and are not subject to regulations which are applied\" by virtue of being \"part of the unit.\"  Ibid.  In short, whatever the new map might suggest, they are not subject to regulation as parkland.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We thus arrive again at the conclusion that the Park Service may not prevent John Sturgeon from driving his hovercraft on the Nation River.  We held in an earlier part of this opinion that the Nation is not public land.  See supra, at 12-15.  And here we hold that it cannot be regulated as if it were.  Park Service regulations--like the hovercraft rule--do not apply to non-public lands in Alaska even when those lands lie within national parks.  Section 103(c) \"deem[s]\" those lands outside the parks and in so doing deprives the Service of regulatory authority.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet the Park Service makes one last plea--for some kind of special rule relating to Alaskan navigable waters.  Even suppose, the argument runs, that those waters do not count as \"public lands.\"  And even assume that Section 103(c) strips the Service of power to regulate most non-public lands.  Still, the Service avers--invoking \"the overall statutory scheme\"--that ANILCA must at least allow it to regulate navigable waters.  Brief for Respondents 40; see id., at 40-45; Tr. of Oral Arg. 42 (ANILCA's regulatory restrictions were \"not about navigable waters\"); id., at 63-64 (similar).  Here, the Service points to ANILCA's general statement of purpose, which lists (among many other things) the \"protect[ion] and preserv[ation]\" of \"rivers.\"  16 U. S. C. \u00a73101(b).  Similarly, the Service notes that the statements of purpose associated with particular system units refer to \"protect[ing]\" named rivers there.  E.g., \u00a7410hh-1(1).  And the Service highlights several statutory sections that in some way speak to its ability to regulate motorboating and fishing within the new units.  See \u00a7\u00a73121, 3170, 3201, 3203(b), 3204.10  According to the Service, all of those provisions show that \"ANILCA preserves [its] authority to regulate conduct on navigable waters\" in national parks.  Brief for Respondents 42.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But ANILCA does not readily allow the decoupling of navigable waters from other non-federally owned areas in Alaskan national parks for regulatory (or, indeed, any other) purposes.  Section 103(c), as we have described, speaks of \"lands (as such term is defined in th[e] Act).\"  16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73103(c); see supra, at 9.  The Act, in turn, defines \"land\" to mean \"lands, waters, and interests therein.\"  \u00a73102(1)-(3); see supra, at 9.  So according to an express definition, when ANILCA refers to \"lands,\" it means waters (including navigable waters) as well.  And that kind of definition is \"virtually conclusive.\"  A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 228 (2012); see ibid. (\"It is very rare that a defined meaning can be replaced\" or altered).  Save for some exceptional reason, we must read ANILCA as treating identically solid ground and flowing water.  So if the Park Service were right that it could regulate the Nation River under its ordinary authorities, then it also could regulate the private fields and farms in the surrounding park.  And more to the point, once Section 103(c) is understood to preclude the regulation of those landed properties, then the same result follows--\"virtually conclusive[\u00a0ly]\"--for the river.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And nothing in the few aquatic provisions to which the Park Service points can flip that strong presumption, for none conflicts with reading Section 103(c)'s regulatory exemption to cover non-federal waters.  The most substantive of those provisions, as just noted, contemplate some role for the Service in regulating motorboating and fishing.  But contra the Park Service, those sections have effect under our interpretation because both activities can occur on federally owned (and thus fully regulable) non-navigable waters.  The other provisions the Service emphasizes are statements of purpose, which by their nature \"cannot override [a statute's] operative language.\"  Id., at 220.  And anyway, our construction leaves the Park Service with multiple tools to \"protect\" rivers in Alaskan national parks, as those statements anticipate.  \u00a73101(b); \u00a7410hh-1(1).  The Park Service may at a minimum regulate the public lands flanking rivers.  It may, additionally, enter into \"cooperative agreements\" with the State (which holds the rivers' submerged lands) to preserve the rivers themselves.  \u00a73181(j).  It may similarly propose that state or other federal agencies with appropriate jurisdiction undertake needed regulatory action on those rivers.  See \u00a73191(b)(7); see also Kobuk Valley: Land Protection Plan, at 118, 121 (recommending that the Alaska Department of Natural Resources classify navigable parts of the Kobuk River for preservation efforts).  And if all else fails, the Park Service may invoke Section 103(c)'s third sentence to buy from Alaska the submerged lands of navigable waters--and then administer them as public lands.  See \u00a7\u00a73103(c), 3192; see also Kobuk Valley: Land Protection Plan, at 133 (proposing that if Alaska does not adequately protect the Kobuk River, the Park Service should \"seek to acquire title to th[o]se state lands through exchange\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those authorities, though falling short of the Service's usual power to administer navigable waters in system units, accord with ANILCA's \"repeated[\u00a0] recogni[tion] that Alaska is different.\"  Sturgeon I, 577 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  ANILCA's broadly drawn parks include stretches of some of the State's most important rivers, such as the Yukon and Kuskokwim.  See Brief for State of Alaska as Amicus Curiae 12.  And rivers function as the roads of Alaska, to an extent unknown anyplace else in the country.  Over three-quarters of Alaska's 300 communities live in regions unconnected to the State's road system.  See id., at 11.  Residents of those areas include many of Alaska's poorest citizens, who rely on rivers for access to necessities like food and fuel.  See id., at 11-12.  Who knows?--maybe John Sturgeon could have found a comparable hunting ground that did not involve traveling by hovercraft through a national park.  But some Alaskans have no such options.  The State's extreme climate and rugged terrain make them dependent on rivers to reach a market, a hospital, or a home.  So ANILCA recognized that when it came to navigable waters--just as to non-federal lands--in the new parks, Alaska should be \"the exception, not the rule.\"  Sturgeon I, 577 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  Which is to say, exempt from the Park Service's normal regulatory authority.\nV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ANILCA, like much legislation, was a settlement.  The statute set aside more than a hundred million acres of Alaska for conservation.  In so doing, it enabled the Park Service to protect--if need be, through expansive regulation--\"the national interest in the scenic, natural, cultural and environmental values on the public lands in Alaska.\"  16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73101(d).  But public lands (and waters) was where it drew the line--or, at any rate, the legal one.  ANILCA changed nothing for all the state, Native, and private lands (and waters) swept within the new parks' boundaries.  Those lands, of course, remain subject to all the regulatory powers they were before, exercised by the EPA, Coast Guard, and the like.  But they did not become subject to new regulation by the happenstance of ending up within a national park.  In those areas, Section 103(c) makes clear, Park Service administration does not replace local control.  For that reason, park rangers cannot enforce the Service's hovercraft rule on the Nation River.  And John Sturgeon can once again drive his hovercraft up that river to Moose Meadows.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We accordingly reverse the judgment below and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this  opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nSotomayor, J., concurring\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-949\njohn sturgeon, PETITIONER v. BERT FROST,  in his official capacity as alaska regional di- rector of the national park service, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\n[March 26, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Professors have long asked law students to interpret a hypothetical ordinance that prohibits bringing \"a vehicle into the park.\"1  The debate usually centers on what counts as a \"vehicle.\"  Is a moped forbidden?  How about a baby stroller?  In this case, we can all agree that John Sturgeon's hovercraft is a vehicle.  But now we ask whether he has brought it \"into the park\"--and, if not, how a river's designation as \"outside the park\" will affect future attempts to regulate there.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court decides that the Nation River is not parkland, and I join the Court's opinion because it offers a cogent reading of \u00a7103(c) of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), 94 Stat. 2371, 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73101 et seq.  I write separately to emphasize the important regulatory pathways that the Court's decision leaves open for future exploration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court holds only that the National Park Service may not regulate the Nation River as if it were within Alaska's federal park system, not that the Service lacks all authority over the Nation River.  A reading of ANILCA \u00a7103(c) that left the Service with no power whatsoever over navigable rivers in Alaska's parks would be untenable in light of ANILCA's other provisions, which state Congress' intent that the Service protect those very same rivers.  Congress would not have set out this aim and simultaneously deprived the Service of all means to carry out the task.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Properly interpreted, ANILCA \u00a7103(c) cannot nullify Congress' purposes in enacting ANILCA.  Even though the Service may not apply its ordinary park rules to nonpublic areas like the Nation River, two sources of Service authority over navigable rivers remain undisturbed by today's decision.  First, as a default, the Service may well have authority to regulate out-of-park, nonpublic areas in the midst of parklands when doing so is necessary or proper to protect in-park, public areas--for instance, to ban pollution of the Nation River if necessary to preserve habitat on the riverbanks or to ban hovercraft use on that river if needed to protect adjacent public park areas.  Nothing in ANILCA removes that power.  Second, Congress most likely meant for the Service to retain power to regulate as parklands a particular subset of navigable rivers designated as \"Wild and Scenic Rivers,\" although that particular authority does not, by its terms, apply to the Nation River.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the Court does not address these agency authorities, see ante, at 19, n.\u00a05, 26-27, n.\u00a010, I join its opinion.  I also wish to emphasize, however, that the Court's opinion introduces limitations on--and thus could engender uncertainty regarding--the Service's authority over navigable rivers that run through Alaska's parks.  If this is not what Congress intended, Congress should amend ANILCA to clarify the scope of the Service's authority.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the National Park System's creation in 1872, it has grown to include over 400 historic and recreation areas encompassing over 84 million acres.  54 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7100101(b)(1)(A); 83 Fed. Reg. 2065 (2018).  These areas provide habitat for 247 threatened or endangered species and received more than 325 million visitors in 2016 alone.  Id., at 2065-2066.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The task of protecting this vast park system principally falls to the Park Service.  In the National Park Service Organic Act (Organic Act), 39 Stat. 535, Congress entrusted the Service with regulating to leave the parks \"unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\"  54 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7100101(a).  Congress empowered the agency to promulgate regulations \"necessary or proper\" for managing the Park System, including regulations \"concerning boating and other activities on or relating to water located within [Park] System units.\"  \u00a7\u00a7100751(a), (b).  The Service has carried out this charge by enacting a wide range of regulations, including the ban on hovercraft use at issue.  See 36 CFR \u00a72.17(e) (2018).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wielding its Organic Act authority, the Service applies many park rules on federally owned lands and waters it administers, as well as navigable waters \"within the boundaries of the National Park System.\"  See 36 CFR \u00a7\u00a71.2(a)(1), (3).  The title to lands beneath navigable waters, even within national parks, typically belongs to the States.2  Because park boundaries can encompass both federally and nonfederally owned lands and waters, this means that some nonfederally owned waters are subject to Service regulations--at least outside of Alaska.  See ante, at 7-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Against this backdrop, Congress enacted ANILCA.  As the Court explains, ANILCA added millions of acres of federal land to the National Park System in Alaska and simultaneously swept around 18 million acres of nonfederally owned lands within the geographic boundary lines of the new Alaska parks.  Ante, at 6-8; see also Sturgeon v. Frost, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2016) (slip op., at 5-6).  In ANILCA, Congress directed the Service to manage Alaska's new and expanded parks \"as new areas of the National Park System\" under its Organic Act authority.  94 Stat. 2383, 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7410hh-2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ANILCA reflects Congress' expectation that the Service will manage Alaska's parks with a particular focus on rivers and river systems.  For instance, the agency must \"maintain unimpaired the water habitat\" for salmon in Katmai National Monument, preserve \"the natural environmental integrity and scenic beauty of .\u00a0.\u00a0. rivers\" in Gates of the Arctic National Park, and \"maintain the environmental integrity of the entire Charley River basin, including streams, lakes and other natural features.\"  \u00a7\u00a7410hh(4)(a), (10); \u00a7410hh-1(2); see also \u00a7\u00a7410hh(1), (6), (7)(a), (8)(a); \u00a7410hh-1(1).  Some provisions of ANILCA direct the Service to regulate boating in Alaska's parklands.  See, e.g., \u00a73170(a).  Others command the Service to regulate fishing.  See, e.g., \u00a73201.  Together, these provisions make clear that Congress must have intended for the Park Service to have at least some authority over navigable waters within Alaska's parks.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet, ANILCA includes one provision that can be read to throw a wrench into that authority: \u00a7103(c).  This provision says that \"[o]nly those lands within the boundaries of any conservation system unit which are public lands (as such term is defined in this Act) shall be deemed to be included as a portion of such unit.\"  16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73103(c).  Section 103(c) then says that no state, native, or private lands \"shall be subject to the regulations applicable solely to public lands within such units,\" although the Secretary may acquire those lands and administer them as part of the unit.  Ibid.  ANILCA, in turn, defines \"public lands\" as nearly all \"lands, waters, and interests therein\" in which the United States has title.  \u00a7\u00a73102(1)-(3).  Crucially, Alaska has title to the lands under its navigable waters.  See n.\u00a02, supra.  If the Service's ordinary authority over navigable waters within park boundaries is diminished in Alaska relative to everywhere else in the United States, all agree that ANILCA \u00a7103(c) is the culprit.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus we arrive at the crux of this case: How, if at all, does ANILCA \u00a7103(c) circumscribe the Service's ordinary authority over navigable rivers within the geographic boundaries of national parks?\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I agree with the Court that the Service may not treat every navigable river in Alaska as legally part of Alaska's parks merely because those (nonpublic) rivers flow within park boundaries.  The majority ably explains why ANILCA's text leads to this outcome.  See ante, at 16-20.  According to ANILCA \u00a7103(c), navigable waters (at least apart from Wild and Scenic Rivers) must be treated as waters outside of park units for legal purposes.  Thus they may not be \"subject to the regulations applicable solely to public lands within such units.\"  16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73103(c).3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This principle is all that is required to resolve Sturgeon's case.  The hovercraft rule applies only inside park boundaries.  36 CFR \u00a71.2(a) (\"regulations contained in this chapter apply to all persons entering, using, visiting, or otherwise within .\u00a0.\u00a0. [w]aters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States located within the boundaries of the National Park System\").  The Nation River is, for legal purposes, outside of park boundaries.  The hovercraft rule therefore does not apply on the Nation River.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Critically, although the Court decides today that the Service may not regulate the Nation River \"as part of the park,\" ante, at 16, the Court does not hold that ANILCA \u00a7103(c) strips the Service of all authority to protect navigable waters in Alaska.  For good reason.  It would be absurd to think that Congress intended for the Service to preserve Alaska's rivers, but left it without any tools to do so.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Imagine if all Service regulations could apply in Alaska's parklands only up to the banks of navigable rivers, and the Service lacked any authority whatsoever over the rivers themselves.  If Jane Smith were to stand on the public bank of the Nation River, bag of trash in hand, Service rules could prohibit her from discarding the trash on the riverbank.  See 36 CFR \u00a72.14(a)(1).  The rules also could bar her from intentionally disturbing wildlife breeding activities, \u00a72.2(a)(2), making unreasonably loud noises, \u00a72.12(a)(1)(ii), and introducing wildlife into the park ecosystem, \u00a72.1(a)(2).  But reading ANILCA \u00a7103(c) to bar any Park Service regulation of navigable waters would permit Jane to evade those rules entirely if she were to wade into the river or paddle along the bank in a canoe.  She could toss her trash bag in the water and amp up her speakers with impunity.  Under this reading, the Park Service would be powerless to stop her.  Jane's actions would likely harm flora and fauna on the banks of the river, which are public areas inside park boundaries.  Jane's trash also could drift from a navigable (and thus out-of-park, nonpublic) stretch of the Nation River into a nonnavigable (and thus in-park, public) stretch of the same river.4  So much for the Service's duty to maintain the \"environmental integrity\" of the Charley River basin \"in its undeveloped natural condition,\" 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7410hh(10).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How can the Service adequately protect Alaska's rivers if it cannot regulate?  What is more, how can it maintain nearby park areas, such as riverbanks or nonnavigable park waters downstream, if it has no power to check the contamination of navigable waters?  To achieve Congress' stated goals in creating Alaska's parks, the Service must have some authority to protect navigable rivers within those parks.5\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thankfully, today's decision does not leave the Service without any authority over the Nation River and other rivers like it.  Even though most navigable rivers in Alaska are not public parklands, Congress has left at least two avenues for the Service to achieve ANILCA's purposes.  Neither is addressed by the Court's decision.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Court expressly does not decide whether the Service may regulate navigable waters running through Alaska's parks as an adjunct to its authority over the parks themselves.  See ante, 19, n.\u00a05.6  In my view, the Service likely retains power over navigable rivers that run through Alaska's parks when that power is necessary to protect Alaska's parklands.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Service's default ability to regulate comes from the Organic Act.  That Act gives the Service general authority to promulgate all regulations \"necessary or proper\" for managing park units, including power to regulate activities \"on or relating to water located within [Park] System units.\"  54 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7100751(a), (b) (emphasis added).  Nothing in the text of the Organic Act suggests that the Service is powerless over out-of-park areas in the midst of public parklands, like the Nation River.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This brings us back to Jane, this time canoeing down the Nation River with a gallon of toxic insecticide onboard.  If Jane spills the insecticide into the river, the effects will surely reach the riverbanks--public areas within the park's legal boundaries.  An antipollution rule tailored to apply to the Nation River as it runs through the park thus could well be \"necessary or proper\" to manage the parklands on either side of the river, even though the river itself is not legally a part of the park.  \u00a7100751(a).  And if the pollution is likely to harm nonnavigable stretches of the river downstream--public waters that are \"within\" the park for legal purposes--the ban also could be authorized because it specifically concerns \"activities .\u00a0.\u00a0. relating to water located within [Park] System units.\"  \u00a7100751(b). Similar reasoning could justify a range of Service regulations, giving the Service substantial authority over navigable rivers inside geographic park boundaries in order to protect the parklands through which they flow.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Assuming that the Service has such authority over out-of-park areas pursuant to its Organic Act, nothing in ANILCA \u00a7103(c) takes it away.  That section's first sentence explains that nonpublic lands are not part of Alaska's park units.  See 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73103(c); supra, at 4-5.  The second sentence then emphasizes that the Service cannot regulate nonpublic lands as if they were part of the park.  Together, these sentences mean that the Service loses its authority to apply normal park rules to nonpublic lands, and instead can apply only those rules that it can justify by reference to the needs of other, public lands.  For instance, the Service is unlikely to have power to apply rules against abandoning property, 36 CFR \u00a72.22(a), or trespassing, \u00a72.31(a)(1), to nonpublic lands amid parklands because doing so would have little or no impact on neighboring public areas within the legal boundaries of the park.  But a Service regulation tailored to apply to nonparklands in order to protect sensitive surrounding parklands--like a rule against putting a toxic substance in the Nation River to stop harms to the riverbanks--would present a different question.  Such a regulation could be consistent with the Service's limited Organic Act authority over out-of-park areas, and it would not run afoul of ANILCA because it would not be applicable to public lands.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Service's out-of-park authority is not at issue in this case given that the hovercraft regulation applies only within park boundaries, see ante, at 19, n.\u00a05.  Hovercraft can be unsightly, be loud, and disturb sensitive ecosystems within the park.  See 48 Fed. Reg. 30258 (1983) (\"The Service has determined that hovercraft should be prohibited because they provide virtually unlimited access to park areas and introduce a mechanical mode of transportation into locations where the intrusion of motorized equipment by sight or sound is generally inappropriate\").  If the Service were to choose to apply its hovercraft ban to the Nation River, the agency could justify doing so in certain designated areas to protect a particular sensitivity in a surrounding (public) park area, including some habitats on the banks of the Nation River.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court also leaves open a second way for the Service to protect navigable rivers.  Because the Nation River is not a designated Wild and Scenic River, the Court expressly does not decide the extent of the Service's power over such designated rivers.  Ante, at 26-27, n.\u00a010.  If ANILCA \u00a7103(c) is to be harmonized with the remainder of the statute, the Service must possess authority to regulate fully, as parklands, at least that subset of rivers.7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71271 et seq., established a system of rivers that \"possess outstandingly remarkable scenic, recreational, geologic, fish and wildlife, historic, cultural, or other similar values.\"  \u00a71271.  Congress created the system to \"preserv[e]\" designated rivers \"in free-flowing condition.\"  Ibid.  Rivers can become part of the system if they are designated by an Act of Congress.  \u00a71273(a)(i).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ANILCA designated 26 Alaskan rivers as components of this system, more than doubling the mileage of the rivers in the system at the time.  16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71274; S. Johnson & L. Comay, CRS Report for Congress, The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System: A Brief Overview 1 (2015); see \u00a71281(c).  ANILCA, in turn, expressly defines the Alaskan park system as including \"any unit in Alaska of the .\u00a0.\u00a0. National Wild and Scenic Rivers Systems.\"  \u00a73102(4).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although ANILCA \u00a7103(c) generally has the effect of removing navigable waters from the legal boundaries of Alaska's parks, Congress' highly specific definition of the Wild and Scenic Rivers as a portion of Alaska's park system overrides ANILCA \u00a7103(c)'s general carveout.  \"General language of a statutory provision .\u00a0.\u00a0. will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment.\"  D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc. v. Popkin, 285 U.\u00a0S. 204, 208 (1932).  To make sense of ANILCA \u00a7103(c) within the context of the rest of ANILCA, the Service should retain full authority to regulate the Wild and Scenic Rivers as parklands.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One final note warrants mention.  Although I join the Court's opinion, I recognize that today's decision creates uncertainty concerning the extent of Service authority over navigable waters in Alaska's parks.  Courts ultimately may affirm some of the Service's authority over out-of-park areas and Wild and Scenic Rivers.  But that authority may be more circumscribed than the special needs of the parks require.  This would not only make it impossible for the Service to fulfill Congress' charge to preserve rivers, made plain in ANILCA itself, but also threaten the Service's ability to fulfill its broader duty to protect all of the parklands through which the rivers flow.  See, e.g., 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7410hh(6) (Kobuk Valley National Park \"shall be managed . . . [t]o maintain the environmental integrity of the natural features of the Kobuk River Valley, including the Kobuk, Salmon, and other rivers\").  Many of Alaska's navigable rivers course directly through the heart of protected parks, monuments, and preserves.  A decision that leaves the Service with no authority, or only highly constrained authority, over those rivers would undercut Congress' clear expectations in enacting ANILCA and could have exceedingly damaging consequences.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of the explicit instructions throughout ANILCA that the Service must regulate and protect rivers in Alaska, I am convinced that Congress intended the Service to possess meaningful authority over those rivers.  If I am correct, Congress can and should clarify the broad scope of the Service's authority over Alaska's navigable waters.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0None of the parties here have questioned the constitutional validity of the above statutory grants as applied to inholdings, and we therefore do not address the issue.  Cf. Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U.\u00a0S. 529, 536-541 (1976); Kansas v. Colorado, 206 U.\u00a0S. 46, 88-89 (1907).\nFootnote 2\u00a0As noted earlier, the Ninth Circuit has held in three cases--the so-called Katie John trilogy--that the term \"public lands,\" when used in ANILCA's subsistence-fishing provisions, encompasses navigable waters like the Nation River.  See Alaska v. Babbitt, 72 F.\u00a03d 698 (1995); John v. United States, 247 F.\u00a03d 1032 (2001) (en banc); John v. United States, 720 F.\u00a03d 1214 (2013); supra, at 12.  Those provisions are not at issue in this case, and we therefore do not disturb the Ninth Circuit's holdings that the Park Service may regulate subsistence fishing on navigable waters. See generally Brief for State of Alaska as Amicus Curiae 29-35 (arguing that this case does not implicate those decisions); Brief for Ahtna, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 30-36 (same).\nFootnote 3\u00a0Because we see, for the reasons given below, no ambiguity as to Section 103(c)'s meaning, we cannot give deference to the Park Service's contrary construction.  See Chevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.\u00a0S. 837, 842 (1984) (\"If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter\").\nFootnote 4\u00a0Consistent with that approach, Congress left out non-public lands in calculating the acreage of every new or expanded system unit.  Sections 201 and 202 of ANILCA, in describing those units, state the acreage of only their public lands.  See, e.g., \u00a7410hh(1) (providing that Aniakchak National Preserve would \"contain[\u00a0] approximately [367,000] acres of public lands\"); \u00a7410hh-1(3) (providing that Denali National Park would grow \"by the addition of an area containing approximately [2,426,000] acres of public land\").\nFootnote 5\u00a0At times, the Park Service has argued here that the Organic Act gives it authority to regulate waters outside system units, so long as doing so protects waters or lands inside them.  See Brief for Respondents 28-32.  If so, the argument goes, that authority would similarly permit the Service to regulate the non-federally owned waters that Section 103(c) has deemed outside Alaskan system units, if and when needed to conserve those units' federal waters or lands.  But at other points in this litigation, the Service has all but disclaimed such out-of-the-park regulatory authority.  See No. 14-1209, Tr. of Oral Arg. 58 (Jan. 20, 2016) (\"The Park Service [has] consistently understood its authority to be regulating [within] the park's boundaries.  It's never sought to enact a regulation outside of the park's boundaries\").  We take no position on the question because it has no bearing on the hovercraft rule at issue here.  That rule, by its express terms, applies only inside system units.  See supra, at 10-11.  It therefore does not raise any question relating to the existence or scope of the Service's authority over water outside system units.  \nFootnote 6\u00a0Another provision of ANILCA reflects that result.  Right after Sections 201 and 202 describe each new or expanded system unit by reference to how many acres of public land it contains, see n.\u00a04, supra, Section 203 authorizes the Park Service to administer, under the Organic Act, the areas listed in \"the foregoing sections.\"  \u00a7410hh-2.  In other words, Section 203 of ANILCA ties the Service's regulatory authority to the statute's immediately preceding statements of public-land acreage.\nFootnote 7\u00a0And just to pile on: Even taken as a truism, the Park Service's view of the second sentence misfires, because of the technical difference between \"public lands\" and federally owned lands in ANILCA.  Recall that \"public lands\" is defined in the statute to mean most but not all federally owned lands: The term excludes those federal lands selected for future transfer to the State or Native Corporations.  See \u00a73102(3); supra, at 9-10.  (That is why when we reframed the Park Service's argument just above, we noted that we were using \"approximate\" statutory definitions.) But the Park Service's existing regulations apply, at a minimum, to all federally owned lands within a park's borders.  See 36 CFR \u00a71.2(a).  That means there are no regulations \"applicable solely to public lands\" as defined in ANILCA.  \u00a73103(c).  So when the Park Service argues that the second sentence exempts non-public lands from that single \"class of [its] regulations,\" Brief for Respondents 18, 30, it is not even exempting those lands from obviously inapplicable regulations (as we assume in the text); instead, it is exempting them from a null set of rules.\nFootnote 8\u00a0It is unfortunate for the Park Service's argument that the narrow class of regulations thus identified does not in fact exist.  See n.\u00a07, supra.  But we put that point aside for the remainder of this paragraph.\nFootnote 9\u00a0The Park Service points to one provision of ANILCA that (it says) contemplates application of its rules to inholdings; but as suggested in the text that provision really envisions other agencies' regulations.  Section 1301(b)(7) requires the Service to create for each system unit a land management plan that includes (among other things) a description of \"privately owned areas\" within the unit, the activities carried out there, and the \"methods (such as cooperative agreements and issuance or enforcement of regulations)\" for limiting those activities if appropriate.  16 U. S. C. \u00a73191(b)(7).  Nothing in that section \"directs the Park Service\" itself to issue or enforce regulations, as the Service now argues.  See Brief for Respondents 30-31.  Instead, the Service satisfies all its obligations under the provision by reporting on the panoply of federal and state statutes and regulations that apply to any non-public land (whether or not in a park).  And indeed, the Service's management plans have taken exactly that form.  See, e.g., Dept. of Interior, Nat. Park Serv., Kobuk Valley National Park: Land Protection Plan 123-124 (1986) (noting that \"[w]hile [Park Service] regulations do not generally apply to private lands in the park (Section 103, ANILCA),\" the regulations \"that do apply\" include those issued under \"the Alaska Anadromous Fish Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water and Clean Air acts, and the Protection of Wetlands, to name a few\"); Dept. of Interior, Nat. Park Serv., Noatak National Preserve: Land Protection Plan 138-139, 142 (1986) (similar).\nFootnote 10\u00a0The Park Service also points to a separate title of ANILCA, which raises issues outside the scope of this case.  Title VI designates 26 named rivers in Alaska as \"wild and scenic rivers,\" to be \"administered by the Secretary\" under the (nationwide) Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 94 Stat. 2412-2413.  According to the Service, those special designations (and associated management instructions) enable it to \"administer the [specified] rivers pursuant to its general statutory authorities\"--notwithstanding anything in Section 103(c).  Brief for Respondents 42-43.  But the Nation River, all agree, is not a \"wild and scenic river.\"  We may therefore leave for another day the interplay between Section 103(c) and Title VI.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0See A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 36 (2012); Hart, Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals, 71 Harv. L. Rev. 593, 607 (1958).\nFootnote 2\u00a0Under the Submerged Lands Act of 1953, each State has \"title to and ownership of the lands beneath [its] navigable waters.\"  43 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71311(a); see ante, at 4, 13.\nFootnote 3\u00a0Notably, the Park Service did not argue--nor does the Court's opinion address--whether navigable waters may qualify as \"public lands\" because the United States has title to some interest other than an interest in reserved water rights.  See \u00a7\u00a73102(1)-(3).  In particular, the United States did not press the argument that the Federal Government functionally holds title to the requisite interest because of the navigational servitude.  See, e.g., Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U.\u00a0S. 164, 177 (1979) (\"The navigational servitude .\u00a0.\u00a0. gives rise to an authority in the Government to assure that [navigable] streams retain their capacity to serve as continuous highways for the purpose of navigation in interstate commerce\"); United States v. Rands, 389 U.\u00a0S. 121, 123 (1967) (\"This power to regulate navigation confers upon the United States a 'dominant servitude'\u00a0\"); 43 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71314 (providing that the United States retains the navigational servitude in navigable waters).\nFootnote 4\u00a0The navigability of a river is determined \"on a segment-by-segment basis.\"  PPL Montana, LLC v. Montana, 565 U. S. 576, 593 (2012); see also id., at 594.  \nFootnote 5\u00a0Even if the Service cannot regulate the rivers itself, the majority says that the agency can enter into \"cooperative agreements\" with Alaska to regulate the rivers, 16 U. S. C. \u00a73181(j), propose that state or other federal agencies take action to protect the rivers, \u00a73191(b)(7), or buy the submerged lands from Alaska and then regulate them, \u00a7\u00a73103(c), 3192.  See ante, at 28.  But Congress made the Service directly responsible for protecting Alaska's parks and park resources.  The Service cannot carry out its duty to \"manag[e]\" the park areas, see \u00a7410hh, if it is estopped from promulgating necessary rules and regulations.\nFootnote 6\u00a0The Court's interpretation prohibits the Service only from applying its usual, in-park rules to out-of-park areas.  See, e.g., ante, at 16 (nonpublic lands \"may not be regulated as part of the park\"); ante, at 18 (Section 103(c)'s exclusion \"exempt[s] non-public lands .\u00a0.\u00a0. from the Park Service's ordinary regulatory authority\"); ante, at 19 (the areas \"are no longer subject to the Service's power over 'System units' and the 'water located within' them\"); ante, at 22 (rejecting suggestion that inholdings can be \"regulated as parklands\");  ante, at 25 (the inholdings \"are not subject to regulation as parkland\").\nFootnote 7\u00a0This authority would supplement, not replace, the Service's authority over out-of-park navigable rivers, because the Service's authority over the Wild and Scenic Rivers alone cannot explain all of ANILCA's express references to protecting Alaskan rivers.  For instance, ANILCA states Congress' expectation that the Service will manage the Kobuk River in Kobuk Valley National Park.  See 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7410hh(6).  That portion of the river is not designated as a Wild and Scenic River, see \u00a71274, but the Bureau of Land Management has found it to be navigable, see Dept. of Interior, Nat.

LORENZEN, EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE OF BROWN, ET AL.(2019)\nNo. 18-489\nArgued: April 24, 2019Decided: June 3, 2019\n\n\nPetitioner Bradley Taggart formerly owned an interest in an Oregon company.  That company and two of its other owners, who are among the respondents here, filed suit in Oregon state court, claiming that Taggart had breached the company's operating agreement.  Before trial, Taggart filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  At the conclusion of that proceeding, the Federal Bankruptcy Court issued a discharge order that released Taggart from liability for most prebankruptcy debts.  After the discharge order issued, the Oregon state court entered judgment against Taggart in the prebankruptcy suit and awarded attorney's fees to respondents.  Taggart returned to the Federal Bankruptcy Court, seeking civil contempt sanctions against respondents for collecting attorney's fees in violation of the discharge order.  The Bankruptcy Court ultimately held respondents in civil contempt.  The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel vacated the sanctions, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed the panel's decision.  Applying a subjective standard, the Ninth Circuit concluded that a \"creditor's good faith belief\" that the discharge order \"does not apply to the creditor's claim precludes a finding of contempt, even if the creditor's belief if unreasonable.\"  888 F. 3d 438, 444.  \nHeld:\u00a0A court may hold a creditor in civil contempt for violating a discharge order if there is no fair ground of doubt as to whether the order barred the creditor's conduct.  Pp.\u00a04-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0This conclusion rests on a longstanding interpretive principle: When a statutory term is \"\u00a0'obviously transplanted from another legal source,'\u00a0\" it \"\u00a0'brings the old soil with it.'\u00a0\"  Hall v. Hall, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___.  Here, the bankruptcy statutes specifying that a discharge order \"operates as an injunction,\" 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7524(a)(2), and that a court may issue any \"order\" or \"judgment\" that is \"necessary or appropriate\" to \"carry out\" other bankruptcy provisions, \u00a7105(a), bring with them the \"old soil\" that has long governed how courts enforce injunctions.  In cases outside the bankruptcy context, this Court has said that civil contempt \"should not be resorted to where there is [a] fair ground of doubt as to the wrongfulness of the defendant's conduct.\"  California Artificial Stone Paving Co. v. Molitor, 113 U.\u00a0S. 609, 618.  This standard is generally an objective one.  A party's subjective belief that she was complying with an order ordinarily will not insulate her from civil contempt if that belief was objectively unreasonable.  Subjective intent, however, is not always irrelevant.  Civil contempt sanctions may be warranted when a party acts in bad faith, and a party's good faith may help to determine an appropriate sanction.  These traditional civil contempt principles apply straightforwardly to the bankruptcy discharge context.  Under the fair ground of doubt standard, civil contempt may be appropriate when the creditor violates a discharge order based on an objectively unreasonable understanding of the discharge order or the statutes that govern its scope.  Pp.\u00a05-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The standard applied by the Ninth Circuit is inconsistent with traditional civil contempt principles, under which parties cannot be insulated from a finding of civil contempt based on their subjective good faith.  Taggart, meanwhile, argues for a standard that would operate much like a strict-liability standard.  But his proposal often may lead creditors to seek advance determinations as to whether debts have been discharged, creating the risk of additional federal litigation, additional costs, and additional delays.  His proposal, which follows the standard some courts have used to remedy violations of automatic stays, also ignores key differences in text and purpose between the statutes governing automatic stays and discharge orders.

SHELLEY A. LORENZEN, executor of the ESTATE OF STUART BROWN, et al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\n[June 3, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the conclusion of a bankruptcy proceeding, a bankruptcy court typically enters an order releasing the debtor from liability for most prebankruptcy debts.  This order, known as a discharge order, bars creditors from attempting to collect any debt covered by the order.  See 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7524(a)(2).  The question presented here concerns the criteria for determining when a court may hold a creditor in civil contempt for attempting to collect a debt that a discharge order has immunized from collection.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bankruptcy Court, in holding the creditors here in civil contempt, applied a standard that it described as akin to \"strict liability\" based on the standard's expansive scope.  In\u00a0re Taggart, 522 B. R. 627, 632 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Ore. 2014).  It held that civil contempt sanctions are permissible, irrespective of the creditor's beliefs, so long as the creditor was \"\u00a0'aware of the discharge'\u00a0\" order and \"\u00a0'intended the actions which violate[d]'\u00a0\" it.  Ibid. (quoting In re Hardy, 97 F. 3d 1384, 1390 (CA11 1996)).  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, however, disagreed with that standard.  Applying a subjective standard instead, it concluded that a court cannot hold a creditor in civil contempt if the creditor has a \"good faith belief\" that the discharge order \"does not apply to the creditor's claim.\"  In\u00a0re Taggart, 888 F. 3d 438, 444 (2018).  That is so, the Court of Appeals held, \"even if the creditor's belief is unreasonable.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We conclude that neither a standard akin to strict liability nor a purely subjective standard is appropriate.  Rather, in our view, a court may hold a creditor in civil contempt for violating a discharge order if there is no fair ground of doubt as to whether the order barred the creditor's conduct.  In other words, civil contempt may be appropriate if there is no objectively reasonable basis for concluding that the creditor's conduct might be lawful.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bradley Taggart, the petitioner, formerly owned an interest in an Oregon company, Sherwood Park Business Center.  That company, along with two of its other owners, brought a lawsuit in Oregon state court, claiming that Taggart had breached the Business Center's operating agreement.  (We use the name \"Sherwood\" to refer to the company, its two owners, and--in some instances--their former attorney, who is now represented by the executor of his estate.  The company, the two owners, and the executor are the respondents in this case.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before trial, Taggart filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, which permits insolvent debtors to discharge their debts by liquidating assets to pay creditors.  See 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7704(a)(1), 726.  Ultimately, the Federal Bankruptcy Court wound up the proceeding and issued an order granting him a discharge.  Taggart's discharge order, like many such orders, goes no further than the statute: It simply says that the debtor \"shall be granted a discharge under \u00a7727.\"  App. 60; see United States Courts, Order of Discharge: Official Form 318 (Dec. 2015), http:\/ \/www.uscourts.gov \/ sites \/ default \/ files \/form _ b318_0.pdf (as last visited May 31, 2019).  Section 727, the statute cited in the discharge order, states that a discharge relieves the debtor \"from all debts that arose before the date of the order for relief,\" \"[e]xcept as provided in section 523.\"  \u00a7727(b).  Section 523 then lists in detail the debts that are exempt from discharge.  \u00a7\u00a7523(a)(1)-(19).  The words of the discharge order, though simple, have an important effect: A discharge order \"operates as an injunction\" that bars creditors from collecting any debt that has been discharged.  \u00a7524(a)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the issuance of Taggart's federal bankruptcy discharge order, the Oregon state court proceeded to enter judgment against Taggart in the prebankruptcy suit involving Sherwood.  Sherwood then filed a petition in state court seeking attorney's fees that were incurred after Taggart filed his bankruptcy petition.  All parties agreed that, under the Ninth Circuit's decision in In re Ybarra, 424 F. 3d 1018 (2005), a discharge order would normally cover and thereby discharge postpetition attorney's fees stemming from prepetition litigation (such as the Oregon litigation) unless the discharged debtor \"\u00a0'returned to the fray'\u00a0\" after filing for bankruptcy.  Id., at 1027.  Sherwood argued that Taggart had \"returned to the fray\" postpetition and therefore was liable for the postpetition attorney's fees that Sherwood sought to collect.  The state trial court agreed and held Taggart liable for roughly $45,000 of Sherwood's postpetition attorney's fees.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point, Taggart returned to the Federal Bankruptcy Court.  He argued that he had not returned to the state-court \"fray\" under Ybarra, and that the discharge order therefore barred Sherwood from collecting postpetition attorney's fees.  Taggart added that the court should hold Sherwood in civil contempt because Sherwood had violated the discharge order.  The Bankruptcy Court did not agree.  It concluded that Taggart had returned to the fray.  Finding no violation of the discharge order, it refused to hold Sherwood in civil contempt.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taggart appealed, and the Federal District Court held that Taggart had not returned to the fray.  Hence, it concluded that Sherwood violated the discharge order by trying to collect attorney's fees.  The District Court remanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bankruptcy Court, noting the District Court's decision, then held Sherwood in civil contempt.  In doing so, it applied a standard it likened to \"strict liability.\"  522 B.\u00a0R., at 632.  The Bankruptcy Court held that civil contempt sanctions were appropriate because Sherwood had been \"\u00a0'aware of the discharge'\u00a0\" order and \"\u00a0'intended the actions which violate[d]'\u00a0\" it.  Ibid. (quoting In re Hardy, 97 F. 3d, at 1390).  The court awarded Taggart approximately $105,000 in attorney's fees and costs, $5,000 in damages for emotional distress, and $2,000 in punitive damages.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sherwood appealed.  The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel vacated these sanctions, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed the panel's decision.  The Ninth Circuit applied a very different standard than the Bankruptcy Court.  It concluded that a \"creditor's good faith belief\" that the discharge order \"does not apply to the creditor's claim precludes a finding of contempt, even if the creditor's belief is unreasonable.\"  888 F. 3d, at 444.  Because Sherwood had a \"good faith belief\" that the discharge order \"did not apply\" to Sherwood's claims, the Court of Appeals held that civil contempt sanctions were improper.  Id., at 445.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taggart filed a petition for certiorari, asking us to decide whether \"a creditor's good-faith belief that the discharge injunction does not apply precludes a finding of civil contempt.\"  Pet. for Cert. I.  We granted certiorari.  \nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question before us concerns the legal standard for holding a creditor in civil contempt when the creditor attempts to collect a debt in violation of a bankruptcy discharge order.  Two Bankruptcy Code provisions aid our efforts to find an answer.  The first, section 524, says that a discharge order \"operates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action, the employment of process, or an act, to collect, recover or offset\" a discharged debt.  11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7524(a)(2).  The second, section 105, authorizes a court to \"issue any order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.\"  \u00a7105(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In what circumstances do these provisions permit a court to hold a creditor in civil contempt for violating a discharge order?  In our view, these provisions authorize a court to impose civil contempt sanctions when there is no objectively reasonable basis for concluding that the creditor's conduct might be lawful under the discharge order.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our conclusion rests on a longstanding interpretive principle: When a statutory term is \"\u00a0'obviously transplanted from another legal source,'\u00a0\" it \"\u00a0'brings the old soil with it.'\u00a0\"  Hall v. Hall, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 13) (quoting Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947)); see Field v. Mans, 516 U.\u00a0S. 59, 69-70 (1995) (applying that principle to the Bankruptcy Code).  Here, the statutes specifying that a discharge order \"operates as an injunction,\" \u00a7524(a)(2), and that a court may issue any \"order\" or \"judgment\" that is \"necessary or appropriate\" to \"carry out\" other bankruptcy provisions, \u00a7105(a), bring with them the \"old soil\" that has long governed how courts enforce injunctions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That \"old soil\" includes the \"potent weapon\" of civil contempt.  Longshoremen v. Philadelphia Marine Trade Assn., 389 U.\u00a0S. 64, 76 (1967).  Under traditional principles of equity practice, courts have long imposed civil contempt sanctions to \"coerce the defendant into compliance\" with an injunction or \"compensate the complainant for losses\" stemming from the defendant's noncompliance with an injunction.  United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U.\u00a0S. 258, 303-304 (1947); see D. Dobbs & C. Roberts, Law of Remedies \u00a72.8, p. 132 (3d ed. 2018); J. High, Law of Injunctions \u00a71449, p. 940 (2d ed. 1880).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The bankruptcy statutes, however, do not grant courts unlimited authority to hold creditors in civil contempt.  Instead, as part of the \"old soil\" they bring with them, the bankruptcy statutes incorporate the traditional standards in equity practice for determining when a party may be held in civil contempt for violating an injunction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In cases outside the bankruptcy context, we have said that civil contempt \"should not be resorted to where there is [a] fair ground of doubt as to the wrongfulness of the defendant's conduct.\"  California Artificial Stone Paving Co. v. Molitor, 113 U.\u00a0S. 609, 618 (1885) (emphasis added).  This standard reflects the fact that civil contempt is a \"severe remedy,\" ibid., and that principles of \"basic fairness requir[e] that those enjoined receive explicit notice\" of \"what conduct is outlawed\" before being held in civil contempt, Schmidt v. Lessard, 414 U.\u00a0S. 473, 476 (1974) (per curiam).  See Longshoremen, supra, at 76 (noting that civil contempt usually is not appropriate unless \"those who must obey\" an order \"will know what the court intends to require and what it means to forbid\"); 11A C. Wright, A.\u00a0Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a72960, pp. 430-431 (2013) (suggesting that civil contempt may be improper if a party's attempt at compliance was \"reasonable\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This standard is generally an objective one.  We have explained before that a party's subjective belief that she was complying with an order ordinarily will not insulate her from civil contempt if that belief was objectively unreasonable.  As we said in McComb v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 336 U.\u00a0S. 187 (1949), \"[t]he absence of wilfulness does not relieve from civil contempt.\"  Id., at 191.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have not held, however, that subjective intent is always irrelevant.  Our cases suggest, for example, that civil contempt sanctions may be warranted when a party acts in bad faith.  See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.\u00a0S. 32, 50 (1991).  Thus, in McComb, we explained that a party's \"record of continuing and persistent violations\" and \"persistent contumacy\" justified placing \"the burden of any uncertainty in the decree . . . on [the] shoulders\" of the party who violated the court order.  336 U.\u00a0S., at 192-193.  On the flip side of the coin, a party's good faith, even where it does not bar civil contempt, may help to determine an appropriate sanction.  Cf. Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A., 481 U.\u00a0S. 787, 801 (1987) (\"[O]nly the least possible power adequate to the end proposed should be used in contempt cases\" (quotation altered)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These traditional civil contempt principles apply straightforwardly to the bankruptcy discharge context.  The typical discharge order entered by a bankruptcy court is not detailed.  See supra, at 2-3.  Congress, however, has carefully delineated which debts are exempt from discharge.  See \u00a7\u00a7523(a)(1)-(19).  Under the fair ground of doubt standard, civil contempt therefore may be appropriate when the creditor violates a discharge order based on an objectively unreasonable understanding of the discharge order or the statutes that govern its scope.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Solicitor General, amicus here, agrees with the fair ground of doubt standard we adopt.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13-15.  And the respondents stated at oral argument that it would be appropriate for courts to apply that standard in this context.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 43.  The Ninth Circuit and petitioner Taggart, however, each believe that a different standard should apply.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the Ninth Circuit, the parties and the Solicitor General agree that it adopted the wrong standard.  So do we.  The Ninth Circuit concluded that a \"creditor's good faith belief\" that the discharge order \"does not apply to the creditor's claim precludes a finding of contempt, even if the creditor's belief is unreasonable.\"  888 F. 3d, at 444.  But this standard is inconsistent with traditional civil contempt principles, under which parties cannot be insulated from a finding of civil contempt based on their subjective good faith.  It also relies too heavily on difficult-to-prove states of mind.  And it may too often lead creditors who stand on shaky legal ground to collect discharged debts, forcing debtors back into litigation (with its accompanying costs) to protect the discharge that it was the very purpose of the bankruptcy proceeding to provide.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taggart, meanwhile, argues for a standard like the one applied by the Bankruptcy Court.  This standard would permit a finding of civil contempt if the creditor was aware of the discharge order and intended the actions that violated the order.  Brief for Petitioner 19; cf. 522 B. R., at 632 (applying a similar standard).  Because most creditors are aware of discharge orders and intend the actions they take to collect a debt, this standard would operate much like a strict-liability standard.  It would authorize civil contempt sanctions for a violation of a discharge order regardless of the creditor's subjective beliefs about the scope of the discharge order, and regardless of whether there was a reasonable basis for concluding that the creditor's conduct did not violate the order.  Taggart argues that such a standard would help the debtor obtain the \"fresh start\" that bankruptcy promises.  He adds that a standard resembling strict liability would be fair to creditors because creditors who are unsure whether a debt has been discharged can head to federal bankruptcy court and obtain an advance determination on that question before trying to collect the debt.  See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4007(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We doubt, however, that advance determinations would provide a workable solution to a creditor's potential dilemma.  A standard resembling strict liability may lead risk-averse creditors to seek an advance determination in bankruptcy court even where there is only slight doubt as to whether a debt has been discharged.  And because discharge orders are written in general terms and operate against a complex statutory backdrop, there will often be at least some doubt as to the scope of such orders.  Taggart's proposal thus may lead to frequent use of the advance determination procedure.  Congress, however, expected that this procedure would be needed in only a small class of cases.  See 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7523(c)(1) (noting only three categories of debts for which creditors must obtain advance determinations).  The widespread use of this procedure also would alter who decides whether a debt has been discharged, moving litigation out of state courts, which have concurrent jurisdiction over such questions, and into federal courts.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71334(b); Advisory Committee's 2010 Note on subd. (c)(1) of Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. App., p. 776 (noting that \"whether a claim was excepted from discharge\" is \"in most instances\" not determined in bankruptcy court).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taggart's proposal would thereby risk additional federal litigation, additional costs, and additional delays.  That result would interfere with \"a chief purpose of the bankruptcy laws\": \"\u00a0'to secure a prompt and effectual'\u00a0\" resolution of bankruptcy cases \"\u00a0'within a limited period.'\u00a0\"  Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.\u00a0S. 323, 328 (1966) (quoting Ex parte Christy, 3 How. 292, 312 (1844)).  These negative consequences, especially the costs associated with the added need to appear in federal proceedings, could work to the disadvantage of debtors as well as creditors.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taggart also notes that lower courts often have used a standard akin to strict liability to remedy violations of automatic stays.  See Brief for Petitioner 21.  An automatic stay is entered at the outset of a bankruptcy proceeding.  The statutory provision that addresses the remedies for violations of automatic stays says that \"an individual injured by any willful violation\" of an automatic stay \"shall recover actual damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, and, in appropriate circumstances, may recover punitive damages.\"  11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7362(k)(1).  This language, however, differs from the more general language in section 105(a).  Supra, at 5.  The purposes of automatic stays and discharge orders also differ: A stay aims to prevent damaging disruptions to the administration of a bankruptcy case in the short run, whereas a discharge is entered at the end of the case and seeks to bind creditors over a much longer period.  These differences in language and purpose sufficiently undermine Taggart's proposal to warrant its rejection.  (We note that the automatic stay provision uses the word \"willful,\" a word the law typically does not associate with strict liability but \"\u00a0'whose construction is often dependent on the context in which it appears.'\u00a0\"  Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U.\u00a0S. 47, 57 (2007) (quoting Bryan v. United States, 524 U.\u00a0S. 184, 191 (1998)).  We need not, and do not, decide whether the word \"willful\" supports a standard akin to strict liability.)\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We conclude that the Court of Appeals erred in applying a subjective standard for civil contempt.  Based on the traditional principles that govern civil contempt, the proper standard is an objective one.  A court may hold a creditor in civil contempt for violating a discharge order where there is not a \"fair ground of doubt\" as to whether the creditor's conduct might be lawful under the discharge order.  In our view, that standard strikes the \"careful balance between the interests of creditors and debtors\" that the Bankruptcy Code often seeks to achieve.  Clark v. Rameker, 573 U.\u00a0S. 122, 129 (2014).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the Court of Appeals did not apply the proper standard, we vacate the judgment below and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTHACKER ET UX. v. TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY(2019)\nNo. 17-1201\nArgued: January 14, 2019Decided: April 29, 2019\n\n\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), a Government-owned corporation, provides electric power to millions of Americans.  In creating the TVA, Congress decided that the corporation could \"sue and be sued in its corporate name,\" 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7831c(b), thus waiving at least some of the sovereign immunity from suit that it would have enjoyed as a Federal Government entity.  Congress subsequently waived immunity from tort suits involving agencies across the Government in the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), but it carved out an exception for claims based on a federal employee's performance of a \"discretionary function.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72680(a).  Congress specifically excluded from the FTCA's provisions--including the discretionary function exception--\"[a]ny claim arising from the activities of the [TVA].\"  \u00a72680(l).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, TVA employees were raising a downed power line that was partially submerged in the Tennessee River when petitioner Gary Thacker drove his boat into the area at high speed.  Thacker's boat collided with the power line, seriously injuring him and killing his passenger.  He sued for negligence.  The TVA moved to dismiss, claiming sovereign immunity, and the District Court granted the motion.  Affirming, the Eleventh Circuit used the same test it applies when evaluating whether the Government is immune from suit under the discretionary function exception to the FTCA, and it held that Thacker's suit was foreclosed because the challenged actions were \"a matter of choice.\"\nHeld: \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0The waiver of immunity in the TVA's sue-and-be-sued clause is not subject to a discretionary function exception of the kind in the FTCA.  By the terms of the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933, the TVA's sue-and-be-sued clause contains no exception for suits based on discretionary functions.  Nor does the FTCA's discretionary function exception apply to the TVA.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72680(l).  But this Court recognized in Federal Housing Administration v. Burr, 309 U.\u00a0S. 242, that a sue-and-be-sued clause might be subject to an \"implied restriction,\" id., at 245.  In particular, a court should recognize such a restriction if the type of suit at issue is \"not consistent with the statutory or constitutional scheme\" or the restriction is \"necessary to avoid grave interference with the performance of a governmental function.\"  Ibid.  The Government tries to use the framework of Burr to argue that this Court should imply an FTCA-like limit on the TVA's sue-and-be-sued clause for all suits challenging discretionary functions because those suits would conflict with separation-of-powers principles and interfere with important governmental functions.  At the outset, Congress made a considered decision not to apply the FTCA to the TVA, and the Government is effectively asking this Court to negate that legislative choice.  In any event, the Government errs in arguing that waiving the TVA's immunity from suits based on discretionary functions would offend the separation of powers.  And the Government overreaches when it says that all suits based on the TVA's discretionary conduct would interfere with governmental functions.  The discretionary acts of hybrid entities like the TVA may be commercial in nature, and a suit challenging a commercial act will not interfere with governmental functions.  Ibid.  Pp.\u00a04-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0The courts below, which wrongly relied on the discretionary function exception, should have the first chance to address the issues this Court finds relevant in deciding whether this suit may go forward.  To determine if the TVA has immunity, the court on remand must first decide whether the conduct alleged to be negligent is governmental or commercial in nature.  If it is commercial, the TVA cannot invoke sovereign immunity.  If it is governmental, the court might decide that an implied limitation on the clause bars the suit, but only if it finds that prohibiting the \"type[\u00a0] of suit [at issue] is necessary to avoid grave interference\" with that function's performance.

TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\n[April 29, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Federal law provides that the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), a Government-owned corporation supplying electric power to millions of Americans, \"[m]ay sue and be sued in its corporate name.\"  Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933 (TVA Act), 48 Stat. 60, 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7831c(b).  That provision serves to waive sovereign immunity from suit.  Today, we consider how far the waiver goes.  We reject the view, adopted below and pressed by the Government, that the TVA remains immune from all tort suits arising from its performance of so-called discretionary functions.  The TVA's sue-and-be-sued clause is broad and contains no such limit.  Under the clause--and consistent with our precedents construing similar ones--the TVA is subject to suits challenging any of its commercial activities.  The law thus places the TVA in the same position as a private corporation supplying electricity.  But the TVA might have immunity from suits contesting one of its governmental activities, of a kind not typically carried out by private parties.  We remand this case for consideration of whether that limited immunity could apply here.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress created the TVA--a \"wholly owned public corporation of the United States\"--in the throes of the Great Depression to promote the Tennessee Valley's economic development.  TVA v. Hill, 437 U.\u00a0S. 153, 157 (1978).  In its early decades, the TVA focused on reforesting the countryside, improving farmers' fertilization practices, and building dams on the Tennessee River.  See Brief for Respondent 3.  The corporation also soon began constructing new power plants for the region.  And over the years, as it completed other projects, the TVA devoted more and more of its efforts to producing and selling electric power.  Today, the TVA operates around 60 power plants and provides electricity to more than nine million people in seven States.  See id., at 3-4.  The rates it charges (along with the bonds it issues) bring in over $10 billion in annual revenues, making federal appropriations unnecessary.  See ibid.; GAO, FY 2018 Financial Report of the United\u00a0States Government 53 (GAO-19-294R, 2019).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As even that short description may suggest, the TVA is something of a hybrid, combining traditionally governmental functions with typically commercial ones.  On the one hand, the TVA possesses powers and responsibilities reserved to sovereign actors.  It may, for example, \"exercise the right of eminent domain\" and \"condemn all property\" necessary to carry out its goals.  16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7831c(h), (i).  Similarly, it may appoint employees as \"law enforcement agents\" with powers to investigate crimes and make arrests.  \u00a7831c-3(a); see \u00a7831c-3(b)(2).  But on the other hand, much of what the TVA does could be done--no, is done routinely--by non-governmental parties.  Just as the TVA produces and sells electricity in its region, privately owned power companies (e.g., Con Edison, Dominion Energy) do so in theirs.  As to those commonplace commercial functions, the emphasis in the oft-used label \"public corporation\" rests heavily on the latter word.  Hill, 437 U.\u00a0S., at 157.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In establishing this mixed entity, Congress decided (as it had for similar government businesses) that the TVA could \"sue and be sued in its corporate name.\"  \u00a7831c(b); see, e.g., Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act, \u00a74, 47 Stat. 6; Federal Home Loan Bank Act, \u00a712, 47 Stat. 735.  Without such a clause, the TVA (as an entity of the Federal Government) would have enjoyed sovereign immunity from suit.  See Loeffler v. Frank, 486 U.\u00a0S. 549, 554 (1988).  By instead providing that the TVA could \"be sued,\" Congress waived at least some of the corporation's immunity.  (Just how much is the question here.)  Slightly more than a decade after creating the TVA, Congress enacted the Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946 (FTCA), 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71346(b), 2671 et\u00a0seq., to waive immunity from tort suits involving agencies across the Government.  See \u00a71346(b)(1) (waiving immunity from damages claims based on \"the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government\").  That statute carved out an exception for claims based on a federal employee's performance of a \"discretionary function.\"  \u00a72680(a).  But Congress specifically excluded from all the FTCA's provisions--including the discretionary function exception--\"[a]ny claim arising from the activities of the [TVA].\"  \u00a72680(l).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case involves such a claim.  See App. 22-33 (Complaint).  One summer day, TVA employees embarked on work to replace a power line over the Tennessee River.  When a cable they were using failed, the power line fell into the water.  The TVA informed the Coast Guard, which announced that it was closing part of the river; and the TVA itself positioned two patrol boats near the downed line.  But several hours later, just as the TVA workers began to raise the line, petitioner Gary Thacker drove his boat into the area at high speed.  The boat and line collided, seriously injuring Thacker and killing a passenger.  Thacker sued for negligence, alleging that the TVA had failed to \"exercise reasonable care\" in \"assembl[ing] and install[ing] power lines\" and in \"warning boaters\" like him \"of the hazards it created.\"  Id., at 31.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The TVA moved to dismiss the suit, claiming sovereign immunity.  The District Court granted the motion.  It reasoned that the TVA, no less than other government agencies, is entitled to immunity from any suit based on an employee's exercise of discretionary functions.  See 188 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 1243, 1245 (ND Ala. 2016).  And it thought that the TVA's actions surrounding the boating accident were discretionary because \"they involve[d] some judgment and choice.\"  Ibid.  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed on the same ground.  According to the circuit court, the TVA has immunity for discretionary functions even when they are part of the \"TVA's commercial, power-generating activities.\"  868 F.\u00a03d 979, 981 (2017).  In deciding whether a suit implicates those functions, the court explained that it \"use[s] the same test that applies when the government invokes the discretionary-function exception to the [FTCA].\"  Id., at 982.  And that test, the court agreed, foreclosed Thacker's suit because the challenged actions were \"a matter of choice.\"  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to decide whether the waiver of sovereign immunity in TVA's sue-and-be-sued clause is subject to a discretionary function exception, of the kind in the FTCA.  585 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).  We hold it is not.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing in the statute establishing the TVA (again, the TVA Act for short) expressly recognizes immunity for discretionary functions.  As noted above, that law provides simply that the TVA \"[m]ay sue and be sued.\"  16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7831c(b); see supra, at 3.  Such a sue-and-be-sued clause serves to waive sovereign immunity otherwise belonging to an agency of the Federal Government.  See Loeffler, 486 U.\u00a0S., at 554.  By the TVA Act's terms, that waiver is subject to \"[e]xcept[ions] as \"specifically provided in\" the statute itself.  \u00a7831c.  But the TVA Act contains no exceptions relevant to tort claims, let alone one turning on whether the challenged conduct is discretionary.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor does the FTCA's exception for discretionary functions apply to the TVA.  As described earlier, see supra, at 3, the FTCA retained the Federal Government's immunity from tort suits challenging discretionary conduct, even while allowing other tort claims to go forward.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71346(b), 2680(a); United States v. Gaubert, 499 U.\u00a0S. 315, 322-325 (1991) (describing the discretionary function exception's scope).  But Congress made clear that the FTCA does \"not apply to[] [a]ny claim arising from the activities of the [TVA].\"  \u00a72680(l).  That means the FTCA's discretionary function provision has no relevance to this case.  Even the Government concedes as much.  It acknowledges that the FTCA's discretionary function exception \"does not govern [Thacker's] suit.\"  Brief for Respondent 15.  Rather, it says, the TVA Act's sue-and-be-sued clause does so.  See id., at 6.  And that is the very clause we have just described as containing no express exception for discretionary functions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But that is not quite the end of the story because in Federal Housing Administration v. Burr, 309 U.\u00a0S. 242 (1940), this Court recognized that a sue-and-be-sued clause might contain \"implied exceptions.\"  Id., at 245.  The Court in that case permitted a suit to proceed against a government entity (providing mortgage insurance) whose organic statute had a sue-and-be-sued clause much like the TVA Act's.  And the Court made clear that in green-lighting the suit, it was doing what courts normally should.  Sue-and-be-sued clauses, the Court explained, \"should be liberally construed.\"  Ibid.; see FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.\u00a0S. 471, 475 (1994) (similarly calling such clauses \"broad\"). Those words \"in their usual and ordinary sense,\" the Court noted, \"embrace all civil process incident to the commencement or continuance of legal proceedings.\"  Burr, 309 U.\u00a0S., at 245-246.  And Congress generally \"intend[s] the full consequences of what it sa[ys]\"--even if \"inconvenient, costly, and inefficient.\"  Id., at 249 (quotation modified).  But not quite always, the Court continued.  And when not--when Congress meant to use the words \"sue and be sued\" in a more \"narrow sense\"--a court should recognize \"an implied restriction.\"  Id., at 245.  In particular, Burr stated, a court should take that route if one of the following circumstances is \"clearly shown\": either the \"type[] of suit [at issue is] not consistent with the statutory or constitutional scheme\" or the restriction is \"necessary to avoid grave interference with the performance of a governmental function.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the courts below never considered Burr, the Government tries to use its framework to defend their decisions.  See Brief for Respondent 17-40.  According to the Government, we should establish a limit on the TVA's sue-and-be-sued clause--like the one in the FTCA--for all suits challenging discretionary functions.  That is for two reasons, tracking Burr's statement of when to recognize an \"implied exception\" to a sue-and-be-sued clause.  309 U.\u00a0S., at 245.  First, the Government argues that allowing those suits would conflict with the \"constitutional scheme\"--more precisely, with \"separation-of-powers principles\"--by subjecting the TVA's discretionary conduct to \"judicial second-guessing.\"  Brief for Respondent 19, 21 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Second, the Government maintains that permitting those suits would necessarily \"interfere[\u00a0] with important governmental functions.\"  Id., at 36; see id., at 39-40; Tr. of Oral Arg. 39-41.  We disagree.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the outset, we balk at using Burr to provide a government entity excluded from the FTCA with a replica of that statute's discretionary function exception.  Congress made a considered decision not to apply the FTCA to the TVA (even as Congress applied that legislation to some other public corporations, see 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72679(a)).  See supra, at 3, 5.  The Government effectively asks us to negate that legislative choice.  Or otherwise put, it asks us to let the FTCA in through the back door, when Congress has locked the front one.  We have once before rejected such a maneuver.  In FDIC v. Meyer, a plaintiff brought a constitutional tort claim against a government agency with another broad sue-and-be-sued clause.  The agency claimed immunity, stressing that the claim would have fallen outside the FTCA's immunity waiver (which extends only to conventional torts).  We dismissed the argument.  \"In essence,\" we observed, the \"FDIC asks us to engraft\" a part of the FTCA \"onto [the agency's] sue-and-be-sued clause.\"  510 U.\u00a0S., at 480.  But that would mean doing what Congress had not.  See id., at 483.  And so too here, if we were to bestow the FTCA's discretionary function exception on the TVA through the conduit of Burr.  Indeed, the Government's proposal would make the TVA's tort liability largely coextensive with that of all the agencies the FTCA governs.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-34.  Far from acting to achieve such parity, Congress did everything possible to avoid it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, the Government is wrong to think that waiving the TVA's immunity from suits based on discretionary functions would offend the separation of powers.  As this Court explained in Burr, the scope of immunity that federal corporations enjoy is up to Congress.  That body \"has full power to endow [such an entity] with the government's immunity from suit.\"  309 U.\u00a0S., at 244.  And equally, it has full power to \"waive [that] immunity\" and \"subject[ the entity] to the judicial process\" to whatever extent it wishes.  Ibid.  When Congress takes the latter route--even when it goes so far as to waive the corporation's immunity for discretionary functions--its action raises no separation of powers problems.  The right governmental actor (Congress) is making a decision within its bailiwick (to waive immunity) that authorizes an appropriate body (a court) to render a legal judgment.  Indeed, the Government itself conceded at oral argument that Congress, when creating a public corporation, may constitutionally waive its \"immunity [for] discretionary functions.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 37.  But once that is acknowledged, the Government's argument from \"separation-of-powers principles\" collapses.  Brief for Respondent 19.  Those principles can offer no reason to limit a statutory waiver that even without any emendation complies with the constitutional scheme.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Government overreaches when it says that all suits based on the TVA's discretionary conduct will \"grave[ly] interfere[]\" with \"governmental function[s].\"  Burr, 309 U.\u00a0S., at 245.  That is so, at the least, because the discretionary acts of hybrid entities like the TVA may be not governmental but commercial in nature.  And a suit challenging a commercial act will not \"grave[ly]\"--or, indeed, at all--interfere with the \"governmental functions\" Burr cared about protecting.  The Government contests that point, arguing that this Court has not meant to distinguish between the governmental and the commercial in construing sue-and-be-sued clauses.  See Brief for Respondent 39-40.  But both Burr and later decisions do so explicitly.  Burr took as its \"premise\" that an agency \"launched [with such a clause] into the commercial world\" and \"authorize[d]\u00a0to engage\" in \"business transactions with the public\" should have the same \"amenab[ility] to judicial process [as] a private enterprise under like circumstances.\"  309 U.\u00a0S., at 245.  Meyer also made clear that such an agency \"could not escape the liability a private enterprise would face in similar circumstances.\"  510 U.\u00a0S., at 482; see ibid. (\"[T]he liability of a private enterprise [is] a floor below which the agency's liability [may] not fall\").  And twice the Court held that the liability of the Postal Service (another sue-and-be-sued agency) should be \"similar[\u00a0] to [that of] other self-sustaining commercial ventures.\"  Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Postal Service, 467 U.\u00a0S. 512, 525 (1984); see Loeffler, 486 U.\u00a0S., at 556.  The point of those decisions, contra the Government, is that (barring special constitutional or statutory issues not present here) suits based on a public corporation's commercial activity may proceed as they would against a private company; only suits challenging the entity's governmental activity may run into an implied limit on its sue-and-be-sued clause.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Burr and its progeny thus require a far more refined analysis than the Government offers here.  The reasons those decisions give to recognize a restriction on a sue-and-be-sued clause do not justify the wholesale incorporation of the discretionary function exception.  As explained above, the \"constitutional scheme\" has nothing to say about lawsuits challenging a public corporation's discretionary activity--except to leave their fate to Congress.  Burr, 309 U.\u00a0S., at 245; see supra, at 8. For its part, Congress has not said in enacting sue-and-be-sued clauses that it wants to prohibit all such suits--quite the contrary.  And no concern for \"governmental functions\" can immunize discretionary activities that are commercial in kind.  Burr, 309 U.\u00a0S., at 245; see supra, at 8-9. When the TVA or similar body operates in the marketplace as private companies do, it is as liable as they are for choices and judgments.  The possibility of immunity arises only when a suit challenges governmental activities--the kinds of functions private parties typically do not perform.  And even then, an entity with a sue-and-be-sued clause may receive immunity only if it is \"clearly shown\" that prohibiting the \"type[\u00a0] of suit [at issue] is necessary to avoid grave interference\" with a governmental function's performance.  Burr, 309 U.\u00a0S., at 245.  That is a high bar.  But it is no higher than appropriate given Congress's enactment of so broad an immunity waiver--which demands, as we have held, a \"liberal construction.\"  Ibid. (quotation modified).\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All that remains is to decide this case in accord with what we have said so far.  But as we often note at this point, \"we are a court of review, not of first view.\"  Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.\u00a0S. 709, 718, n.\u00a07 (2005).  In wrongly relying on the discretionary function exception, the courts below never addressed the issues we have found relevant in deciding whether this suit may go forward.  Those courts should have the first chance to do so, as guided by the principles set out above and a few last remarks about applying them here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As described earlier, the TVA sometimes resembles a government actor, sometimes a commercial one.  See supra, at 2-3.  Consider a few diverse examples.  When the TVA exercises the power of eminent domain, taking landowners' property for public purposes, no one would confuse it for a private company.  So too when the TVA exercises its law enforcement powers to arrest individuals.  But in other operations--and over the years, a growing number--the TVA acts like any other company producing and supplying electric power.  It is an accident of history, not a difference in function, that explains why most Tennesseans get their electricity from a public enterprise and most Virginians get theirs from a private one.  Whatever their ownership structures, the two companies do basically the same things to deliver power to customers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So to determine if the TVA has immunity here, the court on remand must first decide whether the conduct alleged to be negligent is governmental or commercial in nature.  For the reasons given above, if the conduct is commercial--the kind of thing any power company might do--the TVA cannot invoke sovereign immunity.  In that event, the TVA's sue-and-be-sued clause renders it liable to the same extent as a private party.  Only if the conduct at issue is governmental might the court decide that an implied limit on the clause bars the suit.  But even assuming governmental activity, the court must find that prohibiting the \"type[] of suit [at issue] is necessary to avoid grave interference\" with that function's performance.  Burr, 309 U.\u00a0S., at 245.  Unless it is, Congress's express statement that the TVA may \"be sued\" continues to demand that this suit go forward.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n","62":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTHEODORE H.

We granted certiorari to review whether such cy pres settlements satisfy the requirement that class settlements be \"fair, reasonable, and adequate.\"  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(e)(2).  Because there remain substantial questions about whether any of the named plaintiffs has standing to sue in light of our decision in Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016), we vacate the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and remand for further proceedings.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Google operates an Internet search engine.  The search engine allows users to search for a word or phrase by typing a query into the Google website.  Google returns a list of webpages that are relevant to the indicated term or phrase.  The complaints alleged that when an Internet user conducted a Google search and clicked on a hyperlink to open one of the webpages listed on the search results page, Google transmitted information including the terms of the search to the server that hosted the selected webpage.  This so-called referrer header told the server that the user arrived at the webpage by searching for particular terms on Google's website.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paloma Gaos challenged Google's use of referrer headers.  She filed a complaint in Federal District Court on behalf of herself and a putative class of people who conducted a Google search and clicked on any of the resulting links within a certain time period.  Gaos alleged that Google's transmission of users' search terms in referrer headers violated the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72701 et\u00a0seq.  The SCA prohibits \"a person or entity providing an electronic communication service to the public\" from \"knowingly divulg[ing] to any person or entity the contents of a communication while in electronic storage by that service.\"  \u00a72702(a)(1).  The Act also creates a private right of action that entitles any \"person aggrieved by any violation\" to \"recover from the person or entity, other than the United States, which engaged in that violation such relief as may be appropriate.\"  \u00a72707(a).  Gaos also asserted several state law claims.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Google moved to dismiss for lack of standing three times.  Its first attempt was successful.  The District Court reasoned that although \"a plaintiff may establish standing through allegations of violation of a statutory right,\" Gaos had \"failed to plead facts sufficient to support a claim for violation of her statutory rights.\"  Gaos v. Google, Inc., 2011 WL 7295480, *3 (ND Cal., Apr. 7, 2011).  In particular, the court faulted Gaos for failing to plead \"that she clicked on a link from the Google search page.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After Gaos filed an amended complaint, Google again moved to dismiss.  That second attempt was partially successful.  The District Court dismissed Gaos' state law claims, but denied the motion as to her SCA claims.  The court reasoned that because the SCA created a right to be free from the unlawful disclosure of certain communications, and because Gaos alleged a violation of the SCA that was specific to her (i.e., based on a search she conducted), Gaos alleged a concrete and particularized injury.  Gaos v. Google Inc., 2012 WL 1094646, *4 (ND Cal., Mar. 29, 2012).  The court rested that conclusion on Edwards v. First American Corp., 610 F.\u00a03d 514 (2010)--a Ninth Circuit decision reasoning that an Article III injury exists whenever a statute gives an individual a statutory cause of action and the plaintiff claims that the defendant violated the statute.  2012 WL 1094646, *3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the District Court ruled on Google's second motion to dismiss, we granted certiorari in Edwards to address whether an alleged statutory violation alone can support standing.  First American Financial Corp. v. Edwards, 564 U.\u00a0S. 1018 (2011).  In the meantime, Gaos and an additional named plaintiff filed a second amended complaint against Google.  Google once again moved to dismiss.  Google argued that the named plaintiffs did not have standing to bring their SCA claims because they had failed to allege facts establishing a cognizable injury.  Google recognized that the District Court had previously relied on Edwards to find standing based on the alleged violation of a statutory right.  But because this Court had agreed to review Edwards, Google explained that it would continue to challenge the District Court's conclusion.  We eventually dismissed Edwards as improvidently granted, 567 U.\u00a0S. 756 (2012) (per curiam), and Google then withdrew its argument that Gaos lacked standing for the SCA claims.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gaos' putative class action was consolidated with a similar complaint, and the parties negotiated a classwide settlement.  The terms of their agreement required Google to include certain disclosures about referrer headers on three of its webpages.  Google could, however, continue its practice of transmitting users' search terms in referrer headers.  Google also agreed to pay $8.5 million.  None of those funds would be distributed to absent class members.  Instead, most of the money would be distributed to six cy pres recipients.  In the class action context, cy pres refers to the practice of distributing settlement funds not amenable to individual claims or meaningful pro\u00a0rata distribution to nonprofit organizations whose work is determined to indirectly benefit class members.  Black's Law Dictionary 470 (10th ed. 2014).  In this case, the cy pres recipients were selected by class counsel and Google to \"promote public awareness and education, and\/or to support research, development, and initiatives, related to protecting privacy on the Internet.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 84.  The rest of the funds would be used for administrative costs and fees, given to the named plaintiffs in the form of incentive payments, and awarded to class counsel as attorney's fees.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court granted preliminary certification of the class and preliminary approval of the settlement.  Five class members, including petitioners Theodore Frank and Melissa Holyoak, objected to the settlement on several grounds.  They complained that settlements providing only cy pres relief do not comply with the requirements of Rule 23(e), that cy pres relief was not justified in this case, and that conflicts of interest infected the selection of the  cy pres recipients.  After a hearing, the District Court granted final approval of the settlement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Frank and Holyoak appealed.  After briefing before the Ninth Circuit was complete, but prior to decision by that court, we issued our opinion in Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).  In Spokeo, we held that \"Article III standing requires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory violation.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  We rejected the premise, relied on in the decision then under review and in Edwards, that \"a plaintiff automatically satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement whenever a statute grants a person a statutory right and purports to authorize that person to sue to vindicate that right.\"  578 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9); see also id., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  Google notified the Ninth Circuit of our opinion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed, without addressing Spokeo.  In\u00a0re Google Referrer Header Privacy Litigation, 869 F.\u00a03d 737 (2017).  We granted certiorari, 584 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018), to decide whether a class action settlement that provides a cy pres award but no direct relief to class members satisfies the requirement that a settlement binding class members be \"fair, reasonable, and adequate.\"  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(e)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In briefing on the merits before this Court, the Solicitor General filed a brief as amicus curiae supporting neither party.  He urged us to vacate and remand the case for the lower courts to address standing.  The Government argued that there is a substantial open question about whether any named plaintiff in the class action actually had standing in the District Court.  Because Google withdrew its standing challenge after we dismissed Edwards as improvidently granted, neither the District Court nor the Ninth Circuit ever opined on whether any named plaintiff sufficiently alleged standing in the operative complaint.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We have an obligation to assure ourselves of litigants' standing under Article III.\"  DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.\u00a0S. 332, 340 (2006) (quoting Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.\u00a0S. 167, 180 (2000); internal quotation marks omitted).  That obligation extends to court approval of proposed class action settlements.  In ordinary non-class litigation, parties are free to settle their disputes on their own terms, and plaintiffs may voluntarily dismiss their claims without a court order.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 41(a)(1)(A).  By contrast, in a class action, the \"claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class--or a class proposed to be certified for purposes of settlement--may be settled, voluntarily dismissed, or compromised only with the court's approval.\"  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(e).  A court is powerless to approve a proposed class settlement if it lacks jurisdiction over the dispute, and federal courts lack jurisdiction if no named plaintiff has standing.  Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.\u00a0S. 26, 40, n.\u00a020 (1976).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the District Court ruled on Google's second motion to dismiss, it relied on Edwards to hold that Gaos had standing to assert a claim under the SCA.  Our decision in Spokeo abrogated the ruling in Edwards that the violation of a statutory right automatically satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement whenever a statute authorizes a person to sue to vindicate that right.  578 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9); see Edwards, 610 F.\u00a03d, at 517-518.  Since that time, no court in this case has analyzed whether any named plaintiff has alleged SCA violations that are sufficiently concrete and particularized to support standing.  After oral argument, we ordered supplemental briefing from the parties and Solicitor General to address that question.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After reviewing the supplemental briefs, we conclude that the case should be remanded for the courts below to address the plaintiffs' standing in light of Spokeo.  The supplemental briefs filed in response to our order raise a wide variety of legal and factual issues not addressed in the merits briefing before us or at oral argument.  We \"are a court of review, not of first view.\"  Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.\u00a0S. 709, 718, n.\u00a07 (2005).  Resolution of the standing question should take place in the District Court or the Ninth Circuit in the first instance.  We therefore vacate and remand for further proceedings.  Nothing in our opinion should be interpreted as expressing a view on any particular resolution of the standing question.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nThomas, J., dissenting\n\u2002586 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-961\nTHEODORE H.

As I have previously explained, a plaintiff seeking to vindicate a private right need only allege an invasion of that right to establish standing.  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (concurring opinion) (slip op., at 6).  Here, the plaintiffs alleged violations of the Stored Communications Act, which creates a private right: It prohibits certain electronic service providers from \"knowingly divulg[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0. the contents of a communication\" sent by a \"\u00a0'user,'\u00a0\" \"subscriber,\" or \"customer\" of the service, except as provided in the Act.  18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a72510(13), 2702(a)(1)-(2), (b); see \u00a72707(a) (providing a cause of action to persons aggrieved by violations of the Act).  They also asserted violations of private rights under state law.  By alleging the violation of \"private dut[ies] owed personally\" to them \"\u00a0'as individuals,'\u00a0\" Spokeo, supra, at ___, ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 7, 2), the plaintiffs established standing.  Whether their allegations state a plausible claim for relief under the Act or state law is a separate question on which I express no opinion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the class-certification and class-settlement orders, I would reverse.  The named plaintiffs here sought to simultaneously certify and settle a class action under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) and (e).  Yet the settlement agreement provided members of the class no damages and no other form of meaningful relief.*  Most of the settlement fund was devoted to cy pres payments to nonprofit organizations that are not parties to the litigation; the rest, to plaintiffs' lawyers, administrative costs, and incentive payments for the named plaintiffs.  Ante, at 3-4.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals approved this arrangement on the view that the cy pres payments provided an \"indirect\" benefit to the class.  In re Google Referrer Header Privacy Litigation, 87 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 1122, 1128-1129, 1137 (ND Cal. 2015); In\u00a0re Google Referrer Header Privacy Litigation, 869 F.\u00a03d 737, 741 (CA9 2017).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whatever role cy pres may permissibly play in disposing of unclaimed or undistributable class funds, see Klier v. Elf Atochem North Am., Inc., 658 F.\u00a03d 468, 474-476 (CA5 2011); id., at 480-482 (Jones, C. J., concurring), cy pres payments are not a form of relief to the absent class members and should not be treated as such (including when calculating attorney's fees).  And the settlement agreement here provided no other form of meaningful relief to the class.  This cy pres-only arrangement failed several requirements of Rule 23.  First, the fact that class counsel and the named plaintiffs were willing to settle the class claims without obtaining any relief for the class--while securing significant benefits for themselves--strongly suggests that the interests of the class were not adequately represented.  Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 23(a)(4), (g)(4); see Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.\u00a0S. 591, 619-620 (1997) (settlement terms can inform adequacy of representation).  Second, the lack of any benefit for the class rendered the settlement unfair and unreasonable under Rule 23(e)(2).  Further, I question whether a class action is \"superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy\" when it serves only as a vehicle through which to extinguish the absent class members' claims without providing them any relief.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3); see Rule 23(b)(3)(A) (courts must consider \"the class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution .\u00a0.\u00a0. of separate actions\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, because the class members here received no settlement fund, no meaningful injunctive relief, and no other benefit whatsoever in exchange for the settlement of their claims, I would hold that the class action should not have been certified, and the settlement should not have been approved.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1*The settlement required that Google make additional disclosures on its website for the benefit of \"future users.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 50.  But no party argues that these disclosures were valuable enough on their own to independently support the settlement.\n\n\n","63":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTIMBS v. INDIANA(2019)\nNo. 17-1091\nArgued: November 28, 2018Decided: February 20, 2019\n\n\nTyson Timbs pleaded guilty in Indiana state court to dealing in a controlled substance and conspiracy to commit theft.  At the time of Timbs's arrest, the police seized a Land Rover SUV Timbs had purchased for $42,000 with money he received from an insurance policy when his father died.  The State sought civil forfeiture of Timbs's vehicle, charging that the SUV had been used to transport heroin.  Observing that Timbs had recently purchased the vehicle for more than four times the maximum $10,000 monetary fine assessable against him for his drug conviction, the trial court denied the State's request.  The vehicle's forfeiture, the court determined, would be grossly disproportionate to the gravity of Timbs's offense, and therefore unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause.  The Court of Appeals of Indiana affirmed, but the Indiana Supreme Court reversed, holding that the Excessive Fines Clause constrains only federal action and is inapplicable to state impositions.\nHeld:\u00a0The Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause is an incorporated protection applicable to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.  Pp.\u00a02-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause incorporates and renders applicable to the States Bill of Rights protections \"fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty,\" or \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.\"  McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.\u00a0S. 742, 767 (alterations omitted).  If a Bill of Rights protection is incorporated, there is no daylight between the federal and state conduct it prohibits or requires.  Pp.\u00a02-3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The prohibition embodied in the Excessive Fines Clause carries forward protections found in sources from Magna Carta to the English Bill of Rights to state constitutions from the colonial era to the present day.  Protection against excessive fines has been a constant shield throughout Anglo-American history for good reason: Such fines undermine other liberties.  They can be used, e.g., to retaliate against or chill the speech of political enemies.  They can also be employed, not in service of penal purposes, but as a source of revenue.  The historical and logical case for concluding that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Excessive Fines Clause is indeed overwhelming.  Pp.\u00a03-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Indiana argues that the Clause does not apply to its use of civil in\u00a0rem forfeitures, but this Court held in Austin v. United States, 509 U.\u00a0S. 602, that such forfeitures fall within the Clause's protection when they are at least partially punitive.  Indiana cannot prevail unless the Court overrules Austin or holds that, in light of Austin, the Excessive Fines Clause is not incorporated because its application to civil in\u00a0rem forfeitures is neither fundamental nor deeply rooted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first argument, overturning Austin, is not properly before this Court.  The Indiana Supreme Court held only that the Excessive Fines Clause did not apply to the States.  The court did not address the Clause's application to civil in\u00a0rem forfeitures, nor did the State ask it to do so.  Timbs thus sought this Court's review only of the question whether the Excessive Fines Clause is incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Indiana attempted to reformulate the question to ask whether the Clause restricted States' use of civil in rem forfeitures and argued on the merits that Austin was wrongly decided.  Respondents' \"right, .\u00a0.\u00a0. to restate the questions presented,\" however, \"does not give them the power to expand [those] questions,\" Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, 506 U.\u00a0S. 263, 279, n. 10 (emphasis deleted), particularly where the proposed reformulation would lead the Court to address a question neither pressed nor passed upon below, cf. Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.\u00a0S. 709, 718, n.\u00a07.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second argument, that the Excessive Fines Clause cannot be incorporated if it applies to civil in rem forfeitures, misapprehends the nature of the incorporation inquiry.  In considering whether the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates a Bill of Rights protection, this Court asks whether the right guaranteed--not each and every particular application of that right--is fundamental or deeply rooted.  To suggest otherwise is inconsistent with the approach taken in cases concerning novel applications of rights already deemed incorporated.  See, e.g., Packingham v. North Carolina, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___.  The Excessive Fines Clause is thus incorporated regardless of whether application of the Clause to civil in\u00a0rem forfeitures is itself fundamental or deeply rooted.  Pp.\u00a07-9.\n84 N.\u00a0E. 3d 1179, vacated and remanded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.\u00a0J., and Breyer, Alito, Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ., joined.

INDIANA\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of indiana\n[February 20, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tyson Timbs pleaded guilty in Indiana state court to dealing in a controlled substance and conspiracy to commit theft.  The trial court sentenced him to one year of home detention and five years of probation, which included a court-supervised addiction-treatment program.  The sentence also required Timbs to pay fees and costs totaling $1,203.  At the time of Timbs's arrest, the police seized his vehicle, a Land Rover SUV Timbs had purchased for about $42,000.  Timbs paid for the vehicle with money he received from an insurance policy when his father died.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State engaged a private law firm to bring a civil suit for forfeiture of Timbs's Land Rover, charging that the vehicle had been used to transport heroin.  After Timbs's guilty plea in the criminal case, the trial court held a hearing on the forfeiture demand.  Although finding that Timbs's vehicle had been used to facilitate violation of a criminal statute, the court denied the requested forfeiture, observing that Timbs had recently purchased the vehicle for $42,000, more than four times the maximum $10,000 monetary fine assessable against him for his drug conviction.  Forfeiture of the Land Rover, the court determined, would be grossly disproportionate to the gravity of Timbs's offense, hence unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause.  The Court of Appeals of Indiana affirmed that determination, but the Indiana Supreme Court reversed.  84 N.\u00a0E. 3d 1179 (2017).  The Indiana Supreme Court did not decide whether the forfeit-ure would be excessive.  Instead, it held that the Excessive Fines Clause constrains only federal action and is inapplicable to state impositions.  We granted certiorari.  585 U.\u00a0S. __ (2018).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question presented: Is the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause an \"incorporated\" protection applicable to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause?  Like the Eighth Amendment's proscriptions of \"cruel and unusual punishment\" and \"[e]xcessive bail,\" the protection against excessive fines guards against abuses of government's punitive or criminal-law-enforcement authority.  This safeguard, we hold, is \"fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty,\" with \"dee[p] root[s] in [our] history and tradition.\"  McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.\u00a0S. 742, 767 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted).  The Excessive Fines Clause is therefore incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When ratified in 1791, the Bill of Rights applied only to the Federal Government.  Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243 (1833).  \"The constitutional Amendments adopted in the aftermath of the Civil War,\" however, \"fundamentally altered our country's federal system.\"  McDonald, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 754.  With only \"a handful\" of exceptions, this Court has held that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause incorporates the protections contained in the Bill of Rights, rendering them applicable to the States.  Id., at 764-765, and nn. 12-13.  A Bill of Rights protection is incorporated, we have explained, if it is \"fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty,\" or \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.\"  Id., at 767 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incorporated Bill of Rights guarantees are \"enforced against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to the same standards that protect those personal rights against federal encroachment.\"  Id., at 765 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, if a Bill of Rights protection is incorporated, there is no daylight between the federal and state conduct it prohibits or requires.1\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the Eighth Amendment, \"[e]xcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\"  Taken together, these Clauses place \"parallel limitations\" on \"the power of those entrusted with the criminal-law function of government.\"  Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U.\u00a0S. 257, 263 (1989) (quoting Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.\u00a0S. 651, 664 (1977)).  Directly at issue here is the phrase \"nor excessive fines imposed,\" which \"limits the government's power to extract payments, whether in cash or in kind, 'as punishment for some offense.'\u00a0\"  United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.\u00a0S. 321, 327-328 (1998) (quoting Austin v. United States, 509 U.\u00a0S. 602, 609-610 (1993)).  The Fourteenth Amendment, we hold, incorporates this protection.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Excessive Fines Clause traces its venerable lineage back to at least 1215, when Magna Carta guaranteed that \"[a] Free-man shall not be amerced for a small fault, but after the manner of the fault; and for a great fault after the greatness thereof, saving to him his contenement .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  \u00a720, 9 Hen. III, ch. 14, in 1 Eng. Stat. at Large 5 (1225).2  As relevant here, Magna Carta required that economic sanctions \"be proportioned to the wrong\" and \"not be so large as to deprive [an offender] of his livelihood.\"  Browning-Ferris, 492 U.\u00a0S., at 271.  See also 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 372 (1769) (\"[N]o man shall have a larger amercement imposed upon him, than his circumstances or personal estate will bear .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\").  But cf. Bajakajian, 524 U.\u00a0S., at 340, n.\u00a015 (taking no position on the question whether a person's income and wealth are relevant considerations in judging the excessiveness of a fine).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite Magna Carta, imposition of excessive fines persisted.  The 17th century Stuart kings, in particular, were criticized for using large fines to raise revenue, harass their political foes, and indefinitely detain those un-able to pay.  E.g., The Grand Remonstrance \u00b6\u00b617, 34 (1641), in The Constitutional Documents of the Puritan Revolution 1625-1660, pp. 210, 212 (S. Gardiner ed., 3d ed. rev. 1906); Browning-Ferris, 492 U.\u00a0S., at 267.  When James II was overthrown in the Glorious Revolution, the attendant English Bill of Rights reaffirmed Magna Carta's guarantee by providing that \"excessive Bail ought not to be required, nor excessive Fines imposed; nor cruel and unusual Punishments inflicted.\"  1 Wm. & Mary, ch. 2, \u00a710, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 441 (1689).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Across the Atlantic, this familiar language was adopted almost verbatim, first in the Virginia Declaration of Rights, then in the Eighth Amendment, which states: \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adoption of the Excessive Fines Clause was in tune not only with English law; the Clause resonated as well with similar colonial-era provisions.  See, e.g., Pa. Frame of Govt., Laws Agreed Upon in England, Art. XVIII (1682), in 5 Federal and State Constitutions 3061 (F. Thorpe ed. 1909) (\"[A]ll fines shall be moderate, and saving men's contenements, merchandize, or wainage.\").  In 1787, the constitutions of eight States--accounting for 70% of the U.\u00a0S. population--forbade excessive fines.  Calabresi, Agudo, & Dore, State Bills of Rights in 1787 and 1791, 85 S.\u00a0Cal. L.\u00a0Rev. 1451, 1517 (2012).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An even broader consensus obtained in 1868 upon ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment.  By then, the constitutions of 35 of the 37 States--accounting for over 90% of the U.\u00a0S. population--expressly prohibited excessive fines.  Calabresi & Agudo, Individual Rights Under State Constitutions When the Fourteenth Amendment Was Ratified in 1868, 87 Texas L.\u00a0Rev. 7, 82 (2008).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding the States' apparent agreement that the right guaranteed by the Excessive Fines Clause was fundamental, abuses continued.  Following the Civil War, Southern States enacted Black Codes to subjugate newly freed slaves and maintain the prewar racial hierarchy.  Among these laws' provisions were draconian fines for violating broad proscriptions on \"vagrancy\" and other dubious offenses.  See, e.g., Mississippi Vagrant Law, Laws of Miss. \u00a72 (1865), in 1 W. Fleming, Documentary History of Reconstruction 283-285 (1950).  When newly freed slaves were unable to pay imposed fines, States often demanded involuntary labor instead.  E.g., id. \u00a75; see Finkelman, John Bingham and the Background to the Fourteenth Amendment, 36 Akron L.\u00a0Rev 671, 681-685 (2003) (describing Black Codes' use of fines and other methods to \"replicate, as much as possible, a system of involuntary servitude\").  Congressional debates over the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the joint resolution that became the Fourteenth Amendment, and similar measures repeatedly mentioned the use of fines to coerce involuntary labor.  See, e.g., Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 443 (1866); id., at 1123-1124.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, acknowledgment of the right's fundamental nature remains widespread.  As Indiana itself reports, all 50 States have a constitutional provision prohibiting the imposition of excessive fines either directly or by requiring proportionality.  Brief in Opposition 8-9.  Indeed, Indiana explains that its own Supreme Court has held that the Indiana Constitution should be interpreted to impose the same restrictions as the Eighth Amendment.  Id., at 9 (citing Norris v. State, 271 Ind. 568, 576, 394 N.\u00a0E. 2d 144, 150 (1979)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For good reason, the protection against excessive fines has been a constant shield throughout Anglo-American history: Exorbitant tolls undermine other constitutional liberties.  Excessive fines can be used, for example, to retaliate against or chill the speech of political enemies, as the Stuarts' critics learned several centuries ago.  See Browning-Ferris, 492 U.\u00a0S., at 267.  Even absent a political motive, fines may be employed \"in a measure out of accord with the penal goals of retribution and deterrence,\" for \"fines are a source of revenue,\" while other forms of punishment \"cost a State money.\"  Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.\u00a0S. 957, 979, n. 9 (1991) (opinion of Scalia, J.) (\"it makes sense to scrutinize governmental action more closely when the State stands to benefit\").  This concern is scarcely hypothetical.  See Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 7 (\"Perhaps because they are politically easier to impose than generally applicable taxes, state and local governments nationwide increasingly depend heavily on fines and fees as a source of general revenue.\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, the historical and logical case for concluding that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Excessive Fines Clause is overwhelming.  Protection against excessive punitive economic sanctions secured by the Clause is, to repeat, both \"fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty\" and \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.\"  McDonald, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 767 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State of Indiana does not meaningfully challenge the case for incorporating the Excessive Fines Clause as a general matter.  Instead, the State argues that the Clause does not apply to its use of civil in\u00a0rem forfeitures because, the State says, the Clause's specific application to such forfeitures is neither fundamental nor deeply rooted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Austin v. United States, 509 U.\u00a0S. 602 (1993), however, this Court held that civil in\u00a0rem forfeitures fall within the Clause's protection when they are at least partially punitive.  Austin arose in the federal context.  But when a Bill of Rights protection is incorporated, the protection applies \"identically to both the Federal Government and the States.\"  McDonald, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 766, n. 14.  Accordingly, to prevail, Indiana must persuade us either to overrule our decision in Austin or to hold that, in light of Austin, the Excessive Fines Clause is not incorporated because the Clause's application to civil in\u00a0rem forfeitures is neither fundamental nor deeply rooted.  The first argument is not properly before us, and the second misapprehends the nature of our incorporation inquiry.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the Indiana Supreme Court, the State argued that forfeiture of Timbs's SUV would not be excessive.  See Brief in Opposition 5.  It never argued, however, that civil in\u00a0rem forfeitures were categorically beyond the reach of the Excessive Fines Clause.  The Indiana Supreme Court, for its part, held that the Clause did not apply to the States at all, and it nowhere addressed the Clause's application to civil in\u00a0rem forfeitures.  See 84 N.\u00a0E. 3d 1179.  Accordingly, Timbs sought our review of the question \"[w]hether the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause is incorporated against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment.\"  Pet. for Cert. i.  In opposing review, Indiana attempted to reformulate the question to ask \"[w]hether the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause restricts States' use of civil asset forfeitures.\"  Brief in Opposition i.  And on the merits, Indiana has argued not only that the Clause is not incorporated, but also that Austin was wrongly decided.  Respondents' \"right, in their brief in opposition, to restate the questions presented,\" however, \"does not give them the power to expand [those] questions.\"  Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, 506 U.\u00a0S. 263, 279, n. 10 (1993) (emphasis deleted).  That is particularly the case where, as here, a respondent's reformulation would lead us to address a question neither pressed nor passed upon below.  Cf. Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.\u00a0S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005) (\"[W]e are a court of review, not of first view .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\").  We thus decline the State's invitation to reconsider our unanimous judgment in Austin that civil in\u00a0rem forfeitures are fines for purposes of the Eighth Amendment when they are at least partially punitive.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a fallback, Indiana argues that the Excessive Fines Clause cannot be incorporated if it applies to civil in\u00a0rem forfeitures.  We disagree.  In considering whether the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates a protection contained in the Bill of Rights, we ask whether the right guaranteed--not each and every particular application of that right--is fundamental or deeply rooted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indiana's suggestion to the contrary is inconsistent with the approach we have taken in cases concerning novel applications of rights already deemed incorporated.  For example, in Packingham v. North Carolina, 582 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017), we held that a North Carolina statute prohibiting registered sex offenders from accessing certain commonplace social media websites violated the First Amendment right to freedom of speech.  In reaching this conclusion, we noted that the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause was \"applicable to the States under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  We did not, however, inquire whether the Free Speech Clause's application specifically to social media websites was fundamental or deeply rooted.  See also, e.g., Riley v. California, 573 U.\u00a0S. 373 (2014) (holding, without separately considering incorporation, that States' warrantless search of digital information stored on cell phones ordinarily violates the Fourth Amendment).  Similarly here, regardless of whether application of the Excessive Fines Clause to civil in\u00a0rem forfeitures is itself fundamental or deeply rooted, our conclusion that the Clause is incorporated remains unchanged.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Indiana Supreme Court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nGorsuch, J., concurring\n\u2002586 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1091\nTYSON TIMBS, PETITIONER v. INDIANA\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of indiana\n[February 20, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch, concurring.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority faithfully applies our precedent and, based on a wealth of historical evidence, concludes that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause against the States.  I  agree with that conclusion.  As an original matter, I acknowledge, the appropriate vehicle for incorporation may well be the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause, rather than, as this Court has long assumed, the Due Process Clause.  See, e.g., post, at 1-3 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.\u00a0S. 742, 805-858 (2010) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (documenting evidence that the \"privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\" include, at minimum, the individual rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights); Wildenthal, Nationalizing the Bill of Rights: Revisiting the Original Understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1866-67, 68 Ohio St. L. J. 1509 (2007); A. Amar, The Bill of Rights: Creation and Reconstruction 163-214 (1998); M. Curtis, No State Shall Abridge: The Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights (1986).  But nothing in this case turns on that question, and, regardless of the precise vehicle, there can be no serious doubt that the Fourteenth Amendment requires the States to respect the freedom from excessive fines enshrined in the Eighth Amendment.\n\nThomas, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002586 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 17-1091\nTYSON TIMBS, PETITIONER v. INDIANA\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of indiana\n[February 20, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I agree with the Court that the Fourteenth Amendment makes the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on excessive fines fully applicable to the States.  But I cannot agree with the route the Court takes to reach this conclusion.  Instead of reading the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause to encompass a substantive right that has nothing to do with \"process,\" I would hold that the right to be free from excessive fines is one of the \"privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Fourteenth Amendment provides that \"[n]o State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\"  \"On its face, this appears to grant .\u00a0.\u00a0. United States citizens a certain collection of rights--i.e., privileges or immunities--attributable to that status.\"  McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.\u00a0S. 742, 808 (2010) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  But as I have previously explained, this Court \"marginaliz[ed]\" the Privileges or Immunities Clause in the late 19th century by defining the collection of rights covered by the Clause \"quite narrowly.\"  Id., at 808-809.  Litigants seeking federal protection of substantive rights against the States thus needed \"an alternative fount of such rights,\" and this Court \"found one in a most curious place,\" id., at 809--the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, which prohibits \"any State\" from \"depriv[ing] any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because this Clause speaks only to \"process,\" the Court has \"long struggled to define\" what substantive rights it protects.  McDonald, supra, at 810 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  The Court ordinarily says, as it does today, that the Clause protects rights that are \"fundamental.\"  Ante, at 2, 3, 7, 9.  Sometimes that means rights that are \"\u00a0'deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.'\u00a0\"  Ante, at 3, 7 (quoting McDonald, supra, at 767 (majority opinion)).  Other times, when that formulation proves too restrictive, the Court defines the universe of \"fundamental\" rights so broadly as to border on meaningless.  See, e.g., Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2015) (slip op., at 1-2) (\"rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity\"); Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.\u00a0S. 833, 851 (1992) (\"At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life\").  Because the oxymoronic \"substantive\" \"due process\" doctrine has no basis in the Constitution, it is unsurprising that the Court has been unable to adhere to any \"guiding principle to distinguish 'fundamental' rights that warrant protection from nonfundamental rights that do not.\"  McDonald, supra, at 811 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  And because the Court's substantive due process precedents allow the Court to fashion fundamental rights without any textual constraints, it is equally unsurprising that among these precedents are some of the Court's most notoriously incorrect decisions.  E.g., Roe v. Wade, 410 U.\u00a0S. 113 (1973); Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393, 450 (1857).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The present case illustrates the incongruity of the Court's due process approach to incorporating fundamental rights against the States.  Petitioner argues that the forfeiture of his vehicle is an excessive punishment.  He does not argue that the Indiana courts failed to \"\u00a0'proceed according to the \"law of the land\"--that is, according to written constitutional and statutory provisions,'\u00a0\" or that the State failed to provide \"some baseline procedures.\"  Nelson v. Colorado, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n.\u00a01 (2017) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2, n.\u00a01).  His claim has nothing to do with any \"process\" \"due\" him.  I therefore decline to apply the \"legal fiction\" of substantive  due process.  McDonald, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 811 (opinion of Thomas, J.).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, \"the terms 'privileges' and 'immunities' had an established meaning as synonyms for 'rights.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 813.  Those \"rights\" were the \"inalienable rights\" of citizens that had been \"long recognized,\" and \"the ratifying public understood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to protect constitutionally enumerated rights\" against interference by the States.  Id., at 822, 837.  Many of these rights had been adopted from English law into colonial charters, then state constitutions and bills of rights, and finally the Constitution.  \"Consistent with their English heritage, the founding generation generally did not consider many of the rights identified in [the Bill of Rights] as new entitlements, but as inalienable rights of all men, given legal effect by their codification in the Constitution's text.\"  Id., at 818.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question here is whether the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on excessive fines was considered such a right.  The historical record overwhelmingly demonstrates that it was.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Excessive Fines Clause \"was taken verbatim from the English Bill of Rights of 1689,\" United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.\u00a0S. 321, 335 (1998), which itself formalized a longstanding English prohibition on disproportionate fines.  The Charter of Liberties of Henry I, issued in 1101, stated that \"[i]f any of my barons or men shall have committed an offence he shall not give security to the extent of forfeiture of his money, as he did in the time of my father, or of my brother, but according to the measure of the offence so shall he pay .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  Sources of English Legal and Constitutional History \u00b68, p.\u00a050 (M. Evans & R. Jack eds. 1984) (emphasis added).  Expanding this principle, Magna Carta required that \"amercements (the medieval predecessors of fines) should be proportioned to the offense and that they should not deprive a wrongdoer of his livelihood,\" Bajakajian, supra, at 335:\n\"A free man shall be amerced for a small fault only according to the measure thereof, and for a great crime according to its magnitude, saving his position; and in like manner, a merchant saving his trade, and a villein saving his tillage, if they should fall under Our mercy.\"  Magna Carta, ch. 20 (1215), in A. Howard, Magna Carta: Text & Commentary 42 (rev. ed. 1998).\nSimilar clauses levying amercements \"only in proportion to the measure of the offense\" applied to earls, barons, and clergymen.  Chs. 21-22, ibid.  One historian posits that, due to the prevalence of amercements and their use in increasing the English treasury, \"[v]ery likely there was no clause in Magna Carta more grateful to the mass of the people than that about amercements.\"  Pleas of the Crown for the County of Gloucester xxxiv (F. Maitland ed. 1884).  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The principle was reiterated in the First Statute of Westminster, which provided that no man should \"be amerced, without reasonable cause, and according to the quantity of his Trespass.\"  3 Edw. I, ch. 6 (1275).  The English courts have long enforced this principle.  In one early case, for example, the King commanded the bailiff \"to take a moderate amercement proper to the magnitude and manner of th[e] offense, according to the tenour of the Great Charter of the Liberties of England,\" and the bailiff was sued for extorting \"a heavier ransom.\"  Le Gras v. Bailiff of Bishop of Winchester, Y. B. Mich. 10 Edw. II, pl. 4 (1316), reprinted in 52 Selden Society 3, 5 (1934); see also Richard Godfrey's Case, 11 Co. Rep. 42a, 44a, 77 Eng. Rep. 1199, 1202 (1615) (excessive fines are \"against law\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the reign of the Stuarts in the period leading up to the Glorious Revolution of 1688-1689, fines were a flashpoint \"in the constitutional and political struggles between the king and his parliamentary critics.\"  L. Schwoerer, The Declaration of Rights, 1689, p.\u00a091 (1981) (Schwoerer).  From 1629 to 1640, Charles I attempted to govern without convening Parliament, but \"in the absence of parliamentary grants,\" he needed other ways of raising revenue.  4 H. Walter, A History of England 135 (1834); see 1 T. Macaulay, History of England 85 (1899).  He thus turned \"to exactions, some odious and obsolete, some of very questionable legality, and others clearly against law.\"  1 H. Hallam, Constitutional History of England: From the Accession of Henry VII to the Death of George II 462 (1827) (Hallam); see 4 Walter, supra, at 135.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Star Chamber, for instance, \"imposed heavy fines on the king's enemies,\" Schwoerer 91, in disregard \"of the provision of the Great Charter, that no man shall be amerced even to the full extent of his means.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  2 Hallam 46-47.  \"[T]he strong interest of th[is] court in these fines .\u00a0.\u00a0. had a tendency to aggravate the punishment.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  1 id., at 490.  \"The statute abolishing\" the Star Chamber in 1641 \"specifically prohibited any court thereafter from .\u00a0.\u00a0. levying .\u00a0.\u00a0. excessive fines.\"  Schwoerer 91.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But towards the end of Charles II's reign\" in the 1670s and early 1680s, courts again \"imposed ruinous fines on the critics of the crown.\"  Ibid.  In 1680, a committee of the House of Commons \"examined the transcripts of all the fines imposed in King's Bench since 1677\" and found that \"the Court of King's Bench, in the Imposition of Fines on Offenders of late Years, hath acted arbitrarily, illegally, and partially; favouring Papists and Persons popishly affected; and excessively oppressing his Majesty's Protestant Subjects.\"  Ibid.; 9 Journals of the House of Commons 692 (Dec. 23, 1680).  The House of Commons determined that the actions of the judges of the King's Bench, particularly the actions of Chief Justice William Scroggs, had been so contrary to law that it prepared articles of impeachment against him.  The articles alleged that Scroggs had \"most notoriously departed from all Rules of Justice and Equality, in the Imposition of Fines upon Persons convicted of Misdemeanors\" without \"any Regard to the Nature of the Offences, or the Ability of the Persons.\"  Id., at 698.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet \"[o]ver the next few years fines became even more excessive and partisan.\"  Schwoerer 91.  The King's Bench, presided over by the infamous Chief Justice Jeffreys, fined Anglican cleric Titus Oates 2,000 marks (among other punishments) for perjury.  Id., at 93.  For speaking against the Duke of York, the sheriff of London was fined \u00a3100,000 in 1682, which corresponds to well over $10 million in present-day dollars1--\"an amount, which, as it extended to the ruin of the criminal, was directly contrary to the spirit of [English] law.\"  The History of England Under the House of Stuart, pt. 2, p.\u00a0801 (1840).  The King's Bench fined Sir Samuel Barnadiston \u00a310,000 for allegedly seditious letters, a fine that was overturned by the House of Lords as \"exorbitant and excessive.\"  14 Journals of the House of Lords 210 (May 14, 1689).  Several members of the committees that would draft the Declaration of Rights--which included the prohibition on excessive fines that was enacted into the English Bill of Rights of 1689--had themselves \"suffered heavy fines.\"  Schwoerer 91-92.  And in 1684, judges in the case of John Hampden held that Magna Carta did not limit \"fines for great offences\" against the King, and imposed a \u00a340,000 fine.  Trial of Hampden, 9 State Trials 1054, 1125 (K. B. 1684); 1 J. Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England 490 (1883).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Freedom from excessive fines\" was considered \"indisputably an ancient right of the subject,\" and the Declaration of Rights' indictment against James II \"charged that during his reign judges had imposed excessive fines, thereby subverting the laws and liberties of the kingdom.\"  Schwoerer 90. Article 10 of the Declaration declared \"[t]hat excessive Bayle ought not to be required nor excessive fynes imposed nor cruel and unusuall Punishments inflicted.\"  Id., at 297.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shortly after the English Bill of Rights was enacted, Parliament addressed several excessive fines imposed before the Glorious Revolution.  For example, the House of Lords overturned a \u00a330,000 fine against the Earl of Devonshire as \"excessive and exorbitant, against Magna Charta, the common right of the subject, and against the law of the land.\"  Case of Earl of Devonshire, 11 State Trials 1354, 1372 (K. B. 1687).  Although the House of Lords refused to reverse the judgments against Titus Oates, a minority argued that his punishments were \"contrary to Law and ancient Practice\" and violated the prohibition on \"excessive Fines.\"  Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.\u00a0S. 957, 971 (1991); Trial of Oates, 10 State Trials 1080, 1325 (K. B. 1685).  The House of Commons passed a bill to overturn Oates's conviction, and eventually, after a request from Parliament, the King pardoned Oates.  Id., at 1329-1330.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Writing a few years before our Constitution was adopted, Blackstone--\"whose works constituted the preeminent authority on English law for the founding generation,\" Alden v. Maine, 527 U.\u00a0S. 706, 715 (1999)--explained that the prohibition on excessive fines contained in the English Bill of Rights \"had a retrospect to some unprecedented proceedings in the court of king's bench.\"  4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 372 (1769).  Blackstone confirmed that this prohibition was \"only declaratory .\u00a0.\u00a0. of the old constitutional law of the land,\" which had long \"regulated\" the \"discretion\" of the courts in imposing fines.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, at the time of the founding, the prohibition on excessive fines was a longstanding right of Englishmen.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"As English subjects, the colonists considered themselves to be vested with the same fundamental rights as other Englishmen,\" McDonald, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 816 (opinion of Thomas, J.), including the prohibition on excessive fines.  E.g., J. Dummer, A Defence of the New-England Charters 16-17 (1721) (\"The Subjects Abroad claim the Privilege of Magna Charta, which says that no Man shall be fin'd above the Nature of his Offence, and whatever his Miscarriage be, a Salvo Contenemento suo is to be observ'd by the Judge\").  Thus, the text of the Eighth Amendment was \"\u00a0'based directly on .\u00a0.\u00a0. the Virginia Declaration of Rights,' which 'adopted verbatim the language of the English Bill of Rights.'\u00a0\"  Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U.\u00a0S. 257, 266 (1989) (quoting Solem v. Helm, 463 U.\u00a0S. 277, 285, n.\u00a010 (1983)); see Jones v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. 555, 557 (1799) (opinion of Carrington, J.) (explaining that the clause in the Virginia Declaration of Rights embodied the traditional legal understanding that any \"fine or amercement ought to be according to the degree of the fault and the estate of the defendant\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the States were considering whether to ratify the Constitution, advocates for a separate bill of rights emphasized the need for an explicit prohibition on excessive fines mirroring the English prohibition.  In colonial times, fines were \"the drudge-horse of criminal justice,\" \"probably the most common form of punishment.\"  L. Friedman, Crime and Punishment in American History 38 (1993).  To some, this fact made a constitutional prohibition on excessive fines all the more important.  As the well-known Anti-Federalist Brutus argued in an essay, a prohibition on excessive fines was essential to \"the security of liberty\" and was \"as necessary under the general government as under that of the individual states; for the power of the former is as complete to the purpose of requiring bail, imposing fines, inflicting punishments, .\u00a0.\u00a0. and seizing .\u00a0.\u00a0. property .\u00a0.\u00a0. as the other.\"  Brutus II (Nov. 1, 1787), in The Complete Bill of Rights 621 (N. Cogan ed. 1997).  Similarly, during Virginia's ratifying convention, Patrick Henry pointed to Virginia's own prohibition on excessive fines and said that it would \"depart from the genius of your country\" for the Federal Constitution to omit a similar prohibition.  Debate on Virginia Convention (June 14, 1788), in 3 Debates on the Federal Constitution 447 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1854).  Henry continued: \"[W]hen we come to punishments, no latitude ought to be left, nor dependence put on the virtue of representatives\" to \"define punishments without this control.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Governor Edmund Randolph responded to Henry, arguing that Virginia's charter was \"nothing more than an investiture, in the hands of the Virginia citizens, of those rights which belonged to British subjects.\"  Id., at 466.  According to Randolph, \"the exclusion of excessive bail and fines .\u00a0.\u00a0. would follow of itself without a bill of rights,\" for such fines would never be imposed absent \"corruption in the House of Representatives, Senate, and President,\" or judges acting \"contrary to justice.\"  Id., at 467-468.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For all the debate about whether an explicit prohibition on excessive fines was necessary in the Federal Constitution, all agreed that the prohibition on excessive fines was a well-established and fundamental right of citizenship.  When the Excessive Fines Clause was eventually considered by Congress, it received hardly any discussion before \"it was agreed to by a considerable majority.\"  1 Annals of Cong. 754 (1789).  And when the Bill of Rights was ratified, most of the States had a prohibition on excessive fines in their constitutions.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Early commentary on the Clause confirms the widespread agreement about the fundamental nature of the prohibition on excessive fines.  Justice Story, writing a few decades before the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, explained that the Eighth Amendment was \"adopted, as an admonition to all departments of the national  government, to warn them against such violent proceedings, as had taken place in England in the arbitrary reigns of some of the Stuarts,\" when \"[e]normous fines and amercements were .\u00a0.\u00a0. sometimes imposed.\"  3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a71896, pp.\u00a0750-751 (1833).  Story included the prohibition on excessive fines as a right, along with the \"right to bear arms\" and others protected by the Bill of Rights, that \"operates, as a qualification upon powers, actually granted by the people to the government\"; without such a \"restrict[ion],\" the government's \"exercise or abuse\" of its power could be \"dangerous to the people.\"  Id., \u00a71858, at 718-719.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chancellor Kent likewise described the Eighth Amendment as part of the \"right of personal security .\u00a0.\u00a0. guarded by provisions which have been transcribed into the constitutions in this country from magna carta, and other fundamental acts of the English Parliament.\"  2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 9 (1827).  He understood the Eighth Amendment to \"guard against abuse and oppression,\" and emphasized that \"the constitutions of almost every state in the Unio[n] contain the same declarations in substance, and nearly in the same language.\"  Ibid.  Accordingly, \"they must be regarded as fundamental doctrines in every state, for all the colonies were parties to the national declaration of rights in 1774, in which the .\u00a0.\u00a0. rights and liberties of English subjects were peremptorily claimed as their undoubted inheritance and birthright.\"  Ibid.; accord, W. Rawle, A View of the Constitution of the United States of America 125 (1825) (describing the prohibition on excessive fines as \"founded on the plainest principles of justice\").\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The prohibition on excessive fines remained fundamental at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment.  In 1868, 35 of 37 state constitutions \"expressly prohibited excessive fines.\"  Ante, at 5.  Nonetheless, as the Court notes, abuses of fines continued, especially through the Black Codes adopted in several States.  Ante, at 5-6.  The \"centerpiece\" of the Codes was their \"attempt to stabilize the black work force and limit its economic options apart from plantation labor.\"  E. Foner, Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution 1863-1877, p.\u00a0199 (1988).  Under the Codes, \"the state would enforce labor agreements and plantation discipline, punish those who refused to contract, and prevent whites from competing among themselves for black workers.\"  Ibid.  The Codes also included \"\u00a0'antienticement' measures punishing anyone offering higher wages to an employee already under contract.\"  Id., at 200.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 39th Congress focused on these abuses during its debates over the Fourteenth Amendment, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, and the Freedmen's Bureau Act.  During those well-publicized debates, Members of Congress consistently highlighted and lamented the \"severe penalties\" inflicted by the Black Codes and similar measures, Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 474 (1866) (Sen. Trumbull), suggesting that the prohibition on excessive fines was understood to be a basic right of citizenship.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, under Mississippi law, adult \"freedmen, free negroes and mulattoes\" \"without lawful employment\" faced $50 in fines and 10 days' imprisonment for vagrancy.  Reports of Assistant Commissioners of Freedmen, and Synopsis of Laws on Persons of Color in Late Slave States, S. Exec. Doc. No. 6, 39th Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a72, p.\u00a0192 (1867).  Those convicted had five days to pay or they would be arrested and leased to \"any person who will, for the shortest period of service, pay said fine and forfeiture and all costs.\"  \u00a75, ibid.  Members of Congress criticized such laws \"for selling [black] men into slavery in punishment of crimes of the slightest magnitude.\"  Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 1123 (1866) (Rep. Cook); see id., at 1124 (\"It is idle to say these men will be protected by the States\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similar examples abound.  One congressman noted that Alabama's \"aristocratic and anti-republican laws, almost reenacting slavery, among other harsh inflictions impose .\u00a0.\u00a0. a fine of fifty dollars and six months' imprisonment on any servant or laborer (white or black) who loiters away his time or is stubborn or refractory.\"  Id., at 1621 (Rep. Myers).  He also noted that Florida punished vagrants with \"a fine not exceeding $500 and imprison[ment] for a term not exceeding twelve months, or by being sold for a term not exceeding twelve months, at the discretion of the court.\"  Ibid.  At the time, such fines would have been ruinous for laborers.  Cf. id., at 443 (Sen. Howe) (\"A thousand dollars!  That sells a negro for his life\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These and other examples of excessive fines from the historical record informed the Nation's consideration of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Even those opposed to civil-rights legislation understood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to guarantee those \"fundamental principles\" \"fixed\" by the Constitution, including \"immunity from .\u00a0.\u00a0. excessive fines.\"  2 Cong. Rec. 384-385 (1874) (Rep. Mills); see also id., at App. 241 (Sen. Norwood).  And every post-1855 state constitution banned excessive fines.  S. Calabresi & S. Agudo, Individual Rights Under State Constitutions When the Fourteenth Amendment Was Ratified in 1868, 87 Texas L.\u00a0Rev. 7, 82 (2008).  The attention given to abusive fines at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment, along with the ubiquity of state excessive-fines provisions, demonstrates that the public continued to understand the prohibition on excessive fines to be a fundamental right of American citizenship.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The right against excessive fines traces its lineage back in English law nearly a millennium, and from the founding of our country, it has been consistently recognized as a core right worthy of constitutional protection.  As a constitutionally enumerated right understood to be a privilege of American citizenship, the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on excessive fines applies in full to the States.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The sole exception is our holding that the Sixth Amendment requires jury unanimity in federal, but not state, criminal proceedings.

As we have explained, that \"exception to th[e] general rule .\u00a0.\u00a0. was the result of an unusual division among the Justices,\" and it \"does not undermine the well-established rule that incorporated Bill of Rights protections apply identically to the States and the Federal Government.\"  McDonald, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 766, n.\u00a014.\nFootnote 2\u00a0\"Amercements were payments to the Crown, and were required of individuals who were 'in the King's mercy,' because of some act offensive to the Crown.\"  Browning-Ferris, 492 U.\u00a0S., at 269.  \"[T]hough fines and amercements had distinct historical antecedents, they served fundamentally similar purposes--and, by the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the terms were often used interchangeably.\"  Brief for Eighth Amendment Scholars as Amici Curiae 12.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0See Currency Converter: 1270-2017 (estimating the 2017 equivalent of \u00a3100,000 in 1680), http:\/\/nationalarchives.gov.uk\/currency-converter (as last visited Feb. 8, 2019)\nFootnote 2\u00a0Del.

BETHUNE-HILL ET AL.(2019)\nNo. 18-281\nArgued: March 18, 2019Decided: June 17, 2019\n\n\nAfter the 2010 census, Virginia redrew legislative districts for the State's Senate and House of Delegates.  Voters in 12 impacted House districts sued two state agencies and four election officials (collectively, State Defendants), charging that the redrawn districts were racially gerrymandered in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.  The House of Delegates and its Speaker (collectively, the House) intervened as defendants, participating in the bench trial, on appeal to this Court, and at a second bench trial, where a three-judge District Court held that 11 of the districts were unconstitutionally drawn, enjoined Virginia from conducting elections for those districts before adoption of a new plan, and gave the General Assembly several months to adopt that plan.  Virginia's Attorney General announced that the State would not pursue an appeal to this Court.  The House, however, did file an appeal.\nHeld:\u00a0The House lacks standing, either to represent the State's interests or in its own right.  Pp.\u00a03-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0To cross the standing threshold, a litigant must show (1) a concrete and particularized injury, that (2) is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct, and (3) is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.  Hollingsworth v. Perry, 570 U.\u00a0S. 693, 704.  Standing must be met at every stage of the litigation, including on appeal.  Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.\u00a0S. 43, 64.  And as a jurisdictional requirement, standing cannot be waived or forfeited.  To appeal a decision that the primary party does not challenge, an intervenor must independently demonstrate standing.  Wittman v. Personhuballah, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___.  Pp.\u00a03-4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The House lacks standing to represent the State's interests.  The State itself had standing to press this appeal, see Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.\u00a0S. 54, 62, and could have designated agents to do so, Hollingsworth, 570 U.\u00a0S., at 710.  However, the State did not designate the House to represent its interests here.  Under Virginia law, authority and responsibility for representing the State's interests in civil litigation rest exclusively with the State's Attorney General.  Virginia state courts permitted the House to intervene to defend legislation in Vesilind v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 295 Va. 427, 813 S.\u00a0E. 2d 739, but the House's participation in Vesilind occurred in the same defensive posture as did the House's participation in earlier phases of this case, when the House did not need to establish standing.  Moreover, the House pointed to nothing in the Vesilind litigation suggesting that the Virginia courts understood the House to be representing the interests of the State itself.  Karcher v. May, 484 U.\u00a0S. 72, distinguished.  Throughout this litigation, the House has purported to represent only its own interests.  The House thus lacks authority to displace Virginia's Attorney General as the State's representative.  Pp.\u00a04-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0The House also lacks standing to pursue this appeal in its own right.  This Court has never held that a judicial decision invalidating a state law as unconstitutional inflicts a discrete, cognizable injury on each organ of government that participated in the law's passage.  Virginia's Constitution allocates redistricting authority to the \"General Assembly,\" of which the House constitutes only a part.  That fact distinguishes this case from Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Comm'n, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, where Arizona's House and Senate--acting together--had standing to challenge the constitutionality of a referendum that gave redistricting authority exclusively to an independent commission.  The Arizona referendum was also assailed on the ground that it permanently deprived the legislative plaintiffs of their role in the redistricting process, while the order challenged here does not alter the General Assembly's dominant initiating and ongoing redistricting role.  Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.\u00a0S. 433, also does not aid the House here, where the issue is the constitutionality of a concededly enacted redistricting plan, not the results of a legislative chamber's poll or the validity of any counted or uncounted vote.  Redrawing district lines indeed may affect the chamber's membership, but the House as an institution has no cognizable interest in the identity of its members.  The House has no prerogative to select its own members.  It is a representative body composed of members chosen by the people.  Changes in its membership brought about by the voting public thus inflict no cognizable injury on the House.  Sixty-seventh Minnesota State Senate v. Beens, 406 U.\u00a0S. 187, distinguished.  Nor does a court order causing legislators to seek reelection in districts different from those they currently represent affect the House's representational nature.  Legislative districts change frequently, and the Virginia Constitution guards against representational confusion by providing that delegates continue to represent the districts that elected them, even if their reelection campaigns will be waged in different districts.  In short, the State of Virginia would rather stop than fight on.  One House of its bicameral legislature cannot alone continue the litigation against the will of its partners in the legislative process.  Pp.\u00a07-12.\nAppeal dismissed.

GOLDEN BETHUNE-HILL, et\u00a0al.\non appeal from the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia\n[June 17, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court resolves in this opinion a question of standing to appeal.  In 2011, after the 2010 census, Virginia redrew legislative districts for the State's Senate and House of Delegates.  Voters in 12 of the impacted House districts sued two Virginia state agencies and four election officials (collectively, State Defendants) charging that the redrawn districts were racially gerrymandered in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.  The Virginia House of Delegates and its Speaker (collectively, the House) intervened as defendants and carried the laboring oar in urging the constitutionality of the challenged districts at a bench trial, see Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 141 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 505 (ED Va. 2015), on appeal to this Court, see Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017), and at a second bench trial.  In June 2018, after the second bench trial, a three-judge District Court in the Eastern District of Virginia, dividing 2 to 1, held that in 11 of the districts \"the [S]tate ha[d] [unconstitutionally] sorted voters .\u00a0.\u00a0. based on the color of their skin.\"  Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 326 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 128, 180 (2018).  The court therefore enjoined Virginia \"from conducting any elections .\u00a0.\u00a0. for the office of Delegate .\u00a0.\u00a0. in the Challenged Districts until a new redistricting plan is adopted.\"  Id., at 227.  Recognizing the General Assembly's \"primary jurisdiction\" over redistricting, the District Court gave the General Assembly approximately four months to \"adop[t] a new redistricting plan that eliminate[d] the constitutional infirmity.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few weeks after the three-judge District Court's ruling, Virginia's Attorney General announced, both publicly and in a filing with the District Court, that the State would not pursue an appeal to this Court.  Continuing the litigation, the Attorney General concluded, \"would not be in the best interest of the Commonwealth or its citizens.\"  Defendants' Opposition to Intervenor-Defendants' Motion to Stay Injunction Pending Appeal Under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71253 in No. 3:14-cv-852 (ED Va.), Doc. 246, p.\u00a01.  The House, however, filed an appeal to this Court, App. to Juris. Statement 357-358, which the State Defendants moved to dismiss for want of standing.  We postponed probable jurisdiction, 586 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018), and now grant the State Defendants' motion.  The House, we hold, lacks authority to displace Virginia's Attorney General as representative of the State.  We further hold that the House, as a single chamber of a bicameral legislature, has no standing to appeal the invalidation of the redistricting plan separately from the State of which it is a part.1\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To reach the merits of a case, an Article III court must have jurisdiction.  \"One essential aspect of this requirement is that any person invoking the power of a federal court must demonstrate standing to do so.\"  Hollingsworth v. Perry, 570 U.\u00a0S. 693, 704 (2013).  The three elements of standing, this Court has reiterated, are (1) a concrete and particularized injury, that (2) is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct, and (3) is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.  Ibid. (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.\u00a0S. 555, 560-561 (1992)).  Although rulings on standing often turn on a plaintiff's stake in initially filing suit, \"Article III demands that an 'actual controversy' persist throughout all stages of litigation.\"  Hollingsworth, 570 U.\u00a0S., at 705 (quoting Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.\u00a0S. 85, 90-91 (2013)).  The standing requirement therefore \"must be met by persons seeking appellate review, just as it must be met by persons appearing in courts of first instance.\"  Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.\u00a0S. 43, 64 (1997).  As a jurisdictional requirement, standing to litigate cannot be waived or forfeited.  And when standing is questioned by a court or an opposing party, the litigant invoking the court's jurisdiction must do more than simply allege a nonobvious harm.  See Wittman v. Personhuballah, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2016) (slip op., at 5-6).  To cross the standing threshold, the litigant must explain how the elements essential to standing are met.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before the District Court, the House participated in both bench trials as an intervenor in support of the State Defendants.  And in the prior appeal to this Court, the House participated as an appellee.  Because neither role entailed invoking a court's jurisdiction, it was not previously incumbent on the House to demonstrate its standing.  That situation changed when the House alone endeavored to appeal from the District Court's order holding 11 districts unconstitutional, thereby seeking to invoke this Court's jurisdiction.  As the Court has repeatedly recognized, to appeal a decision that the primary party does not challenge, an intervenor must independently demonstrate standing.  Wittman, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___; Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.\u00a0S. 54 (1986).  We find unconvincing the House's arguments that it has standing, either to represent the State's interests or in its own right.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The House urges first that it has standing to represent the State's interests.  Of course, \"a State has standing to defend the constitutionality of its statute.\"  Id., at 62.  No doubt, then, the State itself could press this appeal.  And, as this Court has held, \"a State must be able to designate agents to represent it in federal court.\"  Hollingsworth, 570 U.\u00a0S., at 710.  So if the State had designated the House to represent its interests, and if the House had in fact carried out that mission, we would agree that the House could stand in for the State.  Neither precondition, however, is met here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To begin with, the House has not identified any legal basis for its claimed authority to litigate on the State's behalf.  Authority and responsibility for representing the State's interests in civil litigation, Virginia law prescribes, rest exclusively with the State's Attorney General:\n\"All legal service in civil matters for the Commonwealth, the Governor, and every state department, institution, division, commission, board, bureau, agency, entity, official, court, or judge .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be rendered and performed by the Attorney General, except as provided in this chapter and except for [certain judicial misconduct proceedings].\"  Va. Code Ann. \u00a72.2-507(A) (2017).2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Virginia has thus chosen to speak as a sovereign entity with a single voice.  In this regard, the State has adopted an approach resembling that of the Federal Government, which \"centraliz[es]\" the decision whether to seek certiorari by \"reserving litigation in this Court to the Attorney General and the Solicitor General.\"  United States v. Providence Journal Co., 485 U.\u00a0S. 693, 706 (1988) (dismissing a writ of certiorari sought by a special prosecutor without authorization from the Solicitor General); see 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7518(a); 28 CFR \u00a70.20(a) (2018).  Virginia, had it so chosen, could have authorized the House to litigate on the State's behalf, either generally or in a defined class of cases.  Hollingsworth, 570 U.\u00a0S., at 710.  Some States have done just that.  Indiana, for example, empowers \"[t]he House of Representatives and Senate of the Indiana General Assembly .\u00a0.\u00a0. to employ attorneys other than the Attorney General to defend any law enacted creating legislative or congressional districts for the State of Indiana.\"  Ind. Code \u00a72-3-8-1 (2011).  But the choice belongs to Virginia, and the House's argument that it has authority to represent the State's interests is foreclosed by the State's contrary decision.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The House observes that Virginia state courts have permitted it to intervene to defend legislation.  But the sole case the House cites on this point--Vesilind v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 295 Va. 427, 813 S.\u00a0E. 2d 739 (2018)--does not bear the weight the House would place upon it.  In Vesilind, the House intervened in support of defendants in the trial court, and continued to defend the trial court's favorable judgment on appeal.  Id., at 433-434, 813 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at 742.  The House's participation in Vesilind thus occurred in the same defensive posture as did the House's participation in earlier phases of this case, when the House did not need to establish standing.  Moreover, the House has pointed to nothing in the Virginia courts' decisions in the Vesilind litigation suggesting that the courts understood the House to be representing the interests of the State itself.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nonetheless, the House insists, this Court's decision in Karcher v. May, 484 U.\u00a0S. 72 (1987), dictates that we treat Vesilind as establishing conclusively the House's authority to litigate on the State's behalf.  True, in Karcher, the Court noted a record, similar to that in Vesilind, of litigation by state legislative bodies in state court, and concluded without extensive explanation that \"the New Jersey Legislature had authority under state law to represent the State's interests .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  484 U.\u00a0S., at 82.  Of crucial significance, however, the Court in Karcher noted no New Jersey statutory provision akin to Virginia's law vesting the Attorney General with exclusive authority to speak for the Commonwealth in civil litigation.  Karcher therefore scarcely impels the conclusion that, despite Virginia's clear enactment making the Attorney General the State's sole representative in civil litigation, Virginia has designated the House as its agent to assert the State's interests in this Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, even if, contrary to the governing statute, we indulged the assumption that Virginia had authorized the House to represent the State's interests, as a factual matter the House never indicated in the District Court that it was appearing in that capacity.  Throughout this litigation, the House has purported to represent its own interests.  Thus, in its motion to intervene, the House observed that it was \"the legislative body that actually drew the redistricting plan at issue,\" and argued that the existing parties--including the State Defendants--could not adequately protect its interests.  App. 2965-2967.  Nowhere in its motion did the House suggest it was intervening as agent of the State.  That silence undermines the House's attempt to proceed before us on behalf of the State.  As another portion of the Court's Karcher decision clarifies, a party may not wear on appeal a hat different from the one it wore at trial.  484 U.\u00a0S., at 78 (parties may not appeal in particular capacities \"unless the record shows that they participated in those capacities below\").3\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The House also maintains that, even if it lacks standing to pursue this appeal as the State's agent, it has standing in its own right.  To support standing, an injury must be \"legally and judicially cognizable.\"  Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.\u00a0S. 811, 819 (1997).  This Court has never held that a judicial decision invalidating a state law as unconstitutional inflicts a discrete, cognizable injury on each organ of government that participated in the law's passage.  The Court's precedent thus lends no support for the notion that one House of a bicameral legislature, resting solely on its role in the legislative process, may appeal on its own behalf a judgment invalidating a state enactment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seeking to demonstrate its asserted injury, the House emphasizes its role in enacting redistricting legislation in particular.  The House observes that, under Virginia law, \"members of the Senate and of the House of Delegates of the General Assembly shall be elected from electoral districts established by the General Assembly.\"  Va. Const., Art. 2, \u00a76.  The House has standing, it contends, because it is \"the legislative body that actually drew the redistricting plan,\" and because, the House asserts, any remedial order will transfer redistricting authority from it to the District Court.  Brief for Appellants 23, 26-28 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But the Virginia constitutional provision the House cites allocates redistricting authority to the \"General Assembly,\" of which the House constitutes only a part.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That fact distinguishes this case from Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Comm'n, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015), in which the Court recognized the standing of the Arizona House and Senate--acting to- gether--to challenge a referendum that gave redistricting authority exclusively to an independent commission, thereby allegedly usurping the legislature's authority under the Federal Constitution over congressional redistricting.  In contrast to this case, in Arizona State Legislature there was no mismatch between the body seeking to litigate and the body to which the relevant constitutional provision allegedly assigned exclusive redistricting authority.  See 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 11-12).  Just as individual members lack standing to assert the institutional interests of a legislature, see Raines, 521 U.\u00a0S., at 829,4 a single House of a bicameral legislature lacks capacity to assert interests belonging to the legislature as a whole.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, in Arizona State Legislature, the challenged referendum was assailed on the ground that it permanently deprived the legislative plaintiffs of their role in the redistricting process.  Here, by contrast, the challenged order does not alter the General Assembly's dominant initiating and ongoing role in redistricting.  Compare Arizona State Legislature, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (allegation of nullification of \"any vote by the Legislature, now or in the future, purporting to adopt a redistricting plan\" (internal quotation marks omitted)), with 326 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 227 (recognizing the General Assembly's \"primary jurisdiction\" over redistricting and giving the General Assembly first crack at enacting a revised redistricting plan).5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor does Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.\u00a0S. 433 (1939), aid the House.  There, the Court recognized the standing of 20 state legislators who voted against a resolution ratifying the proposed Child Labor Amendment to the Federal Constitution.  Id., at 446.  The resolution passed, the opposing legislators stated, only because the Lieutenant Governor cast a tie-breaking vote--a procedure the legislators argued was impermissible under Article V of the Federal Constitution.  See Arizona State Legislature, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 13-14) (citing Coleman, 307 U.\u00a0S., at 446).  As the Court has since observed, Coleman stands \"at most\" \"for the proposition that legislators whose votes would have been sufficient to defeat (or enact) a specific legislative Act have standing to sue if that legislative action goes into effect (or does not go into effect), on the ground that their votes have been completely nullified.\"  Raines, 521 U.\u00a0S., at 823.  Nothing of that sort happened here.  Unlike Coleman, this case does not concern the results of a legislative chamber's poll or the validity of any counted or uncounted vote.  At issue here, instead, is the constitutionality of a concededly enacted redistricting plan.  As we have already explained, a single House of a bicameral legislature generally lacks standing to appeal in cases of this order.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aside from its role in enacting the invalidated redistricting plan, the House, echoed by the dissent, see post, at 1-5, asserts that the House has standing because altered district boundaries may affect its composition.  For support, the House and the dissent rely on Sixty-seventh Minnesota State Senate v. Beens, 406 U.\u00a0S. 187 (1972) (per curiam), in which this Court allowed the Minnesota Senate to challenge a District Court malapportionment litigation order that reduced the Senate's size from 67 to 35 members.  The Court said in Beens: \"[C]ertainly the [Minnesota Senate] is directly affected by the District Court's orders,\" rendering the Senate \"an appropriate legal entity for purpose of intervention and, as a consequence, of an appeal in a case of this kind.\"  Id., at 194.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beens predated this Court's decisions in Diamond v. Charles and other cases holding that intervenor status alone is insufficient to establish standing to appeal.  Whether Beens established law on the question of standing, as distinct from intervention, is thus less than pellucid.  But even assuming, arguendo, that Beens was, and remains, binding precedent on standing, the order there at issue injured the Minnesota Senate in a way the order challenged here does not injure the Virginia House.  Cutting the size of a legislative chamber in half would necessarily alter its day-to-day operations.  Among other things, leadership selection, committee structures, and voting rules would likely require alteration.  By contrast, although redrawing district lines indeed may affect the membership of the chamber, the House as an institution has no cognizable interest in the identity of its members.6  Although the House urges that changes to district lines will \"profoundly disrupt its day-to-day operations,\" Reply Brief 3, it is scarcely obvious how or why that is so.  As the party invoking this Court's jurisdiction, the House bears the burden of doing more than \"simply alleg[ing] a nonobvious harm.\"  Wittman, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Analogizing to \"group[s] other than a legislative body,\" the dissent insists that the House has suffered an \"obvious\" injury.  Post, at 3.  But groups like the string quartet and basketball team posited by the dissent select their own members.  Similarly, the political parties involved in the cases the dissent cites, see post, at 3, n.\u00a01 (citing New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U.\u00a0S. 196, 202 (2008), and Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U.\u00a0S. 214, 229-230 (1989)), select their own leadership and candidates.  In stark contrast, the House does not select its own members.  Instead, it is a representative body composed of members chosen by the people.  Changes to its membership brought about by the voting public thus inflict no cognizable injury on the House.7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The House additionally asserts injury from the creation of what it calls \"divided constituencies,\" suggesting that a court order causing legislators to seek reelection in districts different from those they currently represent affects the House's representational nature.  But legislative districts change frequently--indeed, after every decennial census--and the Virginia Constitution resolves any confusion over which district is being represented.  It provides that delegates continue to represent the districts that elected them, even if their reelection campaigns will be waged in different districts.  Va. Const., Art. 2, \u00a76 (\"A member in office at the time that a decennial redistricting law is enacted shall complete his term of office and shall continue to represent the district from which he was elected for the duration of such term of office .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\").  We see little reason why the same would not hold true after districting changes caused by judicial decisions, and we thus foresee no representational confusion.  And if harms centered on costlier or more difficult election campaigns are cognizable--a question that, as in Wittman, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 5-6), we need not decide today--those harms would be suffered by individual legislators or candidates, not by the House as a body.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, Virginia would rather stop than fight on.  One House of its bicameral legislature cannot alone continue the litigation against the will of its partners in the legislative process.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated, we dismiss the House's appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nAlito, J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 18-281\nVIRGINIA HOUSE OF DELEGATES, et\u00a0al., APPELLANTS v. GOLDEN BETHUNE-HILL, et\u00a0al.\non appeal from the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia\n[June 17, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Breyer, and Justice Kavanaugh join, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would hold that the Virginia House of Delegates has standing to take this appeal.  The Court disagrees for two reasons: first, because Virginia law does not authorize the House to defend the invalidated redistricting plan on behalf of the Commonwealth, see ante, at 4-7, and, second, because the imposition of the District Court's districting plan would not cause the House the kind of harm required by Article III of the Constitution, see ante, at 7-12.  I am convinced that the second holding is wrong and therefore will not address the first.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our decision in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\u00a0504 U.\u00a0S. 555, 560 (1992), identified the three elements that constitute the \"irreducible constitutional minimum of standing\" demanded by Article III.  A party invoking the jurisdiction of a federal court must have \"(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\"  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6).  The Virginia House of Delegates satisfies all those requirements in this case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I begin with \"injury in fact.\"  It is clear, in my judgment, that the new districting plan ordered by the lower court will harm the House in a very fundamental way.  A legislative districting plan powerfully affects a legislative body's output of work.  Each legislator represents a particular district, and each district contains a particular set of constituents with particular interests and views.  Cf., e.g., App. 165 (noting the \"varied factors that can create or contribute to communities of interest\" in districts (House Committee on Privileges and Elections resolution)).  The interests and views of these constituents generally have an important effect on everything that a legislator does--meeting with the representatives of organizations and groups seeking the legislator's help in one way or another, drafting and sponsoring bills, pushing for and participating in hearings, writing or approving reports, and of course, voting.  When the boundaries of a district are changed, the constituents and communities of interest present within the district are altered, and this is likely to change the way in which the district's representative does his or her work.  And while every individual voter will end up being represented by a legislator no matter which districting plan is ultimately used, it matters a lot how voters with shared interests and views are concentrated or split up.  The cumulative effects of all the decisions that go into a districting plan have an important impact on the overall work of the body.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All of this should really go without saying.  After all, it is precisely because of the connections between the way districts are drawn, the composition of a legislature, and the things that a legislature does that so much effort is invested in drawing, contesting, and defending districting plans.  Districting matters because it has institutional and legislative consequences.  To suggest otherwise, to argue that substituting one plan for another has no effect on the work or output of the legislative body whose districts are changed, would really be quite astounding.  If the selection of a districting plan did not alter what the legislative body does, why would there be such pitched battles over redistricting efforts?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What the Court says on this point is striking.  According to the Court, \"the House as an institution has no cognizable interest in the identity of its members,\" and thus suffers no injury from the imposition of a districting plan that \"may affect the membership of the chamber\" or the \"content of legislation its future members may elect to enact.\"  Ante, at 11, and n.\u00a06 (emphasis deleted).  Really?  It seems obvious that any group consisting of members who must work together to achieve the group's aims has a keen interest in the identity of its members, and it follows that the group also has a strong interest in how its members are selected.  And what is more important to such a group than the content of its work?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apply what the Court says to a group other than a legislative body and it is immediately obvious that the Court is wrong.  Does a string quartet have an interest in the identity of its cellist?  Does a basketball team have an interest in the identity of its point guard?  Does a board of directors have an interest in the identity of its chairperson?  Does it matter to these groups how their members are selected?  Do these groups care if the selection method affects their performance?  Of course.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Virginia House of Delegates exists for a purpose: to represent and serve the interests of the people of the Commonwealth.  The way in which its members are selected has a powerful effect on how it goes about this purpose1--a proposition reflected by the Commonwealth's choice to mandate certain districting criteria in its constitution.  See Va. Const., Art. II, \u00a76.  As far as the House's standing, we must assume that the districting plan enacted by the legislature embodies the House's judgment regarding the method of selecting members that best enables it to serve the people of the Commonwealth.  (Whether this is a permissible judgment is a merits question, not a question of standing.  Cf. Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.\u00a0S. 490, 502 (1975)).  It therefore follows that discarding that plan and substituting another inflicts injury in fact.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our most pertinent precedent supports the standing of the House on this ground.  In Sixty-seventh Minnesota State Senate v. Beens, 406 U.\u00a0S. 187 (1972) (per curiam), we held that the Minnesota Senate had standing to appeal a district court order reapportioning the Senate's seats.  In reaching that conclusion, we noted that \"certainly\" such an order \"directly affected\" the Senate.  Id., at 194.  The same is true here.  There can be no doubt that the new districting plan \"directly affect[s]\" the House whose districts it redefines and whose legislatively drawn districts have been replaced with a court-ordered map.  That the Beens Court drew its \"directly affect[s]\" language from a case involving a standard reapportionment challenge, see Silver v. Jordan, 241 F.\u00a0Supp. 576, 579 (SD Cal. 1964) (per curiam), aff'd, 381 U.\u00a0S. 415 (1965) (per curiam), only serves to confirm that the House's injury is sufficient to demonstrate standing under Beens.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In an effort to distinguish Beens, it is argued that the District Court decision at issue there, which slashed the number of senators in half, \"ha[d] a distinct and more direct effect on the body itself than a mere shift in district lines.\"  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17; see Brief for State Appellees 38.  But even if the effect of the court order was greater in Beens than it is here, it is the existence--not the extent--of an injury that matters for purposes of Article III standing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court suggests that the effects of the court-ordered districting plan in Beens were different from the effects of the plan now before us because the former concerned the legislature's internal operations.  See ante, at 10-11.  But even if the imposition of the court-ordered plan in this case would not affect the internal operations of the House (and that is by no means clear), it is very strange to think that changes to such things as \"committee structures\" and \"voting rules,\" see ante, at 10, are more important than changes in legislative output.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, the invalidation of the House's redistricting plan and its replacement with a court-ordered map would cause the House to suffer a \"concrete\" injury.  And as Article III demands, see Spokeo, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 6-7), that injury would also be \"particularized\" (because it would target the House); \"imminent\" (because it would certainly occur if this appeal is dismissed); \"traceable\" to the imposition of the new, court-ordered plan; and \"redress[able]\" by the relief the House seeks here.  Ibid.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the opinion of the Court begins by citing the three fundamental Article III standing requirements just discussed, see ante, at 3, it is revealing that the Court never asserts that the effect of the court-ordered plan at issue would not cause the House \"concrete\" harm.  Instead, the Court claims only that any harm would not be \"\u00a0'judicially cognizable,'\u00a0\" ante, at 7; see also ante, at 11.  The Court lifts this term from Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.\u00a0S. 811, 819 (1997), where the Court held that individual Members of Congress lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act.  But the decision in Raines rested heavily on federal separation-of-powers concerns, which are notably absent here.  See id., at 819-820, 826-829; id., at 832-835 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment).  And although the Court does not say so expressly, what I take from its use of the term \"judicially cognizable\" injury rather than \"concrete\" injury is that the decision here is not really based on the Lujan factors, which set out the \"irreducible\" minimum demanded by Article III.  504 U.\u00a0S., at 560.  Instead, the argument seems to be that the House's injury is insufficient for some other, only-hinted-at reason.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both the United States, appearing as an amicus, and the Commonwealth of Virginia are more explicit.  The Solicitor General's brief argues as follows:\n\"In the federal system, the Constitution gives Congress only 'legislative Powers,' U.\u00a0S. Const. Art. 1, \u00a71, and the 'power to seek judicial relief .\u00a0.\u00a0. cannot possibly be regarded as merely in aid of the legislative function.'  Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.\u00a0S. 1, 138 (1976) (per curiam).  As a result, 'once Congress makes its choice in enacting legislation, its participation ends.'  Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.\u00a0S. 714, 733 (1986).\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The same is true here.  A branch of a state government that makes rather than enforces the law does not itself have a cognizable Article III interest in the defense of its laws.\"  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14-15 (emphasis added).\nThe Virginia Solicitor General makes a similar argument.  See Brief for State Appellees 42-44.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These arguments are seriously flawed because the States are under no obligation to follow the Federal Constitution's model when it comes to the separation of powers.  See Whalen v. United States, 445 U.\u00a0S. 684, 689, n.\u00a04 (1980); cf. Raines, supra, at 824, n.\u00a08; Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Comm'n, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n.\u00a012 (2015) (slip op., at 14, n.\u00a012).  If one House of Congress or one or more Members of Congress attempt to invoke the power of a federal court, the court must consider whether this attempt is consistent with the structure created by the Federal Constitution.  An interest asserted by a Member of Congress or by one or both Houses of Congress that is inconsistent with that structure may not be judicially cognizable.  But I do not see how we can say anything similar about the standing of state legislators or state legislative bodies.2  Cf. Karcher v. May, 484 U.\u00a0S. 72, 81-82 (1987).  The separation of powers (or the lack thereof) under a state constitution is purely a matter of state law, and neither the Court nor the Virginia Solicitor General has provided any support for the proposition that Virginia law bars the House from defending, in its own right, the constitutionality of a districting plan.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, I would hold that the House of Delegates has standing, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0After the General Assembly failed to enact a new redistricting plan within the four months allowed by the District Court, that court entered a remedial order delineating districts for the 2019 election.  The House has noticed an appeal to this Court from that order as well, and the State Defendants have moved to dismiss the follow-on appeal for lack of standing.  See Virginia House of Delegates v. Bethune-Hill, No. 18-1134.  In the appeal from the remedial order, the House and the State Defendants largely repeat the arguments on standing earlier advanced in this appeal.  The House's claim to standing to pursue an appeal from the remedial order fares no better than its assertion of standing here.  See post, p. ___.\nFootnote 2\u00a0The exceptions referenced in the statute's text are inapposite here.  They include circumstances where, \"in the opinion of the Attorney General, it is impracticable or uneconomical for [the] legal service to be rendered by him or one of his assistants,\" or where the Virginia Supreme Court or any of its justices are litigating matters \"arising out of [that court's] official duties.\"  \u00a72.2-507(C).\nFootnote 3\u00a0Nor can we give ear to the House's assertion that forfeiture or acquiescence bar the State Defendants from contesting the House's authority to represent the State's interests.  See Brief for Appellants 29-30.  As earlier observed, standing to sue (or appeal) is a nonwaivable jurisdictional requirement.  See supra, at 3.  Moreover, even if forfeiture were not beyond the pale, the State Defendants here could hardly be held to have relinquished an objection to the House's participation in a capacity--on behalf of the State itself--in which the House was not participating in the District Court.\nFootnote 4\u00a0Raines held that individual Members of Congress lacked standing to challenge the Line Item Veto Act.\nFootnote 5\u00a0Misplaced for similar reasons is the House's reliance on this Court's statements in INS v. Chadha, 462 U.\u00a0S. 919, 929-931, and nn. 5-6, 939-940 (1983), that the United States House and Senate were \"proper parties\" or \"adverse parties.\"  First, it is far from clear that the Court meant those terms to refer to standing, as opposed to the simple fact that both Houses of Congress had intervened.  In any event, the statute at issue in Chadha granted each Chamber of Congress an ongoing power--to veto certain Executive Branch decisions--that each House could exercise independent of any other body.\nFootnote 6\u00a0The dissent urges that changes to district lines will alter the House's future legislative output.  See post, at 1-5.  A legislative chamber as an institution, however, suffers no legally cognizable injury from changes to the content of legislation its future members may elect to enact.  By contrast, the House has an obvious institutional interest in the manner in which it goes about its business.\nFootnote 7\u00a0The dissent further suggests that \"we must assume that the districting plan enacted by the legislature embodies the House's judgment\" regarding the best way to select its members.  Post, at 4.  For the reasons explained supra, at 7-10, however, the House's role in the legislative process does not give it standing to pursue this appeal.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The Court has not hesitated to recognize this link in other contexts.  See, e.g., New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U.\u00a0S. 196, 202 (2008); Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U.\u00a0S. 214, 229-230 (1989).\nFootnote 2\u00a0The Court's observation that the Virginia Constitution gives legislative districting authority to the General Assembly as a whole--in other words, to the House of Delegates and the Senate in combination--does not answer the question.  To start, a similar argument against standing was pressed and rejected in Sixty-seventh Minnesota State Senate v. Beens, 406 U.\u00a0S. 187 (1972) (per curiam), see Motion of Appellees to Dismiss Appeal in O. T. 1971, No. 71-1024, p.\u00a09, and the Court does not explain why a different outcome is warranted here.  Nor am I persuaded by the Court's citation of Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Comm'n, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015).  There, the Court held that the Arizona Legislature had standing to bring a suit aimed at protecting its redistricting authority.  But from the fact that a whole legislature may have standing to defend its redistricting authority, it does not follow that the House necessarily lacks standing to challenge a redistricting decision based on concrete injuries to its institutional interests.  Cf. Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n.\u00a07 (2016) (slip op., at 8, n.\u00a07).\n\n\n","65":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVIRGINIA URANIUM, INC., ET AL. v.

Both the District Court and the Fourth Circuit rejected the company's argument, finding that while the AEA affords the NRC considerable authority over the nuclear fuel life cycle, it offers no hint that Congress sought to strip States of their traditional power to regulate mining on private lands within their borders.\nHeld:\u00a0The judgment is affirmed.\n848 F. 3d 590, affirmed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch, joined by Justice Thomas and Justice Kavanaugh, concluded that the AEA does not preempt Virginia's law banning uranium mining.  Pp.\u00a03-17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Virginia Uranium claims that the AEA is best read to reserve to the NRC alone the regulation of uranium mining based on nuclear safety concerns.  But the AEA contains no provision expressly preempting state law.  More pointedly, it grants the NRC extensive and sometimes exclusive authority to regulate nearly every aspect of the nuclear fuel life cycle except mining, expressly stating that the NRC's regulatory powers arise only \"after [uranium's] removal from its place of deposit in nature,\" 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72092.  And statutory context confirms this reading: If the federal government wants to control uranium mining on private land, it must purchase or seize the land by eminent domain and make it federal land, \u00a72096, indicating that state authority remains untouched.  Later amendments to the AEA point to the same conclusion.  Section 2021 allows the NRC to devolve certain of its regulatory powers to the States but does nothing to extend the NRC's power to activities, like mining, historically beyond its reach.  And \u00a72021(k) explains that States remain free to regulate the activities discussed in \u00a72021 for purposes other than nuclear safety without the NRC's consent.  Virginia Uranium contends instead that subsection (k) greatly expands the AEA's preemptive effect by demanding the displacement of any state law enacted for the purpose of protection the public against \"radiation hazards.\"  But subsection (k) merely clarifies that nothing in \u00a72021 limits States' ability to regulate the activities subject to NRC control for other purposes.  In addition, the company's reading would prohibit not only the States from regulating uranium mining to protect against radiation hazards but the federal government as well, since the AEA affords it no authority to regulate uranium mining on private land.  Pp.\u00a04-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Virginia Uranium also submits that preemption may be found in this Court's precedents, pointing to Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U.\u00a0S. 190, which rejected a preemption challenge to a state law prohibiting the construction of new nuclear power plants after the Court observed that it was enacted out of concern with economic development, not for the purpose of addressing radiation safety hazards.  But Pacific Gas concerned a state moratorium on construction of new nuclear power plants, and nuclear plant construction has always been an area exclusively regulated by the federal government.  It is one thing to inquire exactingly into state legislative purposes when state law comes close to trenching on core federal powers; it is another thing altogether to insist on the same exacting scrutiny for state laws far removed from core NRC powers.  Later cases confirm the propriety of restraint in this area.  See, e.g., Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U.\u00a0S. 238; English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U.\u00a0S. 72.  This Court has generally treated field preemption as depending on what the State did, not why it did it.  See, e.g., Arizona v. United States, 567 U.\u00a0S. 387.  And because inquiries into legislative purpose both invite well-known conceptual and practical problems and pose risks to federalism and individual liberty, this Court has long warned against undertaking potential misadventures into hidden state legislative intentions without a clear statutory mandate for the project, see, e.g., Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P.\u00a0A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.\u00a0S. 393, 404-405.  Pp.\u00a07-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Virginia Uranium alternatively suggests that that the AEA displaces state law through so-called conflict preemption--in particular, that Virginia's mining law stands as an impermissible \"obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\" Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.\u00a0S. 52, 67.  But any \"[e]vidence of pre-emptive purpose,\" whether express or implied, must be \"sought in the [statute's] text and structure.\"  CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U.\u00a0S. 658, 664.  Efforts to ascribe unenacted purposes and objectives to a federal statute face many of the same challenges as inquiries into state legislative intent.  The only thing a court can be sure of is what can be found in the law itself.  And the compromise that Congress actually struck in the AEA leaves mining regulation on private land to the States and grants the NRC regulatory authority only after uranium is removed from the earth.  It is also unclear whether laws like Virginia's might have a meaningful impact on the development of nuclear power in this country given the other available foreign and domestic sources of uranium.  Pp.\u00a014-17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan, agreed with Justice Gorsuch that the Commonwealth's mining ban is not preempted but concluded that his discussion of the perils of inquiring into legislative motive sweeps well beyond the confines of this case.  Further, Virginia Uranium's obstacle preemption arguments fail under existing doctrine, so there is little reason to question whether that doctrine should be retained.  Pp.\u00a01-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The Commonwealth has forbidden conventional uranium mining on private land.  The AEA leaves that activity unregulated.  State law on the subject is therefore not preempted, whatever the reason for the law's enactment.  Pp.\u00a07-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Section 2021(k) lends no support for Virginia Uranium's cause.  That provision is most sensibly read to clarify that the door newly opened for state regulation of certain activities for nuclear safety purposes left in place pre-existing state authority to regulate activities for nonradiological purposes.  House and Senate Reports endorse this reading of \u00a72021(k).  Pp.\u00a08-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Virginia Uranium leans heavily on a statement in Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U.\u00a0S. 190, that \"the Federal Government has occupied the entire field of nuclear safety concerns.\"  Id., at 212.  But neither in that case nor in later decisions in its wake--Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U.\u00a0S. 238; English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U.\u00a0S. 72--did the Court rest preemption on the purposes for which state laws were enacted.  Indeed, in all three, the Court held that the laws at issue were not preempted.  Moreover, the state law involved in Pacific Gas addressed an activity--construction of nuclear power plants--closely regulated by the AEA.  Inquiry into why the state law at issue in that case was enacted was therefore proper under \u00a72021(k).  The Commonwealth's mining ban, in contrast, governs an activity not regulated by the AEA. Pp.\u00a09-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0The Solicitor General's argument--that the Commonwealth's mining ban is preempted because it is a pretext for regulating the radiological safety hazards of milling and tailings storage--is unpersuasive.  To the degree the AEA preempts state laws based on the purposes for which they were enacted, \u00a72021(k) stakes out the boundaries of the preempted field.  National Meat Assn. v. Harris, 565 U.\u00a0S. 452, distinguished.  Pp.\u00a010-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(e)\u00a0Virginia Uranium and the United States also fail to show that the mining ban creates an \"unacceptable 'obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.'\u00a0\"  Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.\u00a0S. 555, 563-564.

JOHN WARREN, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit\n[June 17, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which Justice Thomas and Justice Kavanaugh join.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Virginia Uranium insists that the federal Atomic Energy Act preempts a state law banning uranium mining, but we do not see it.  True, the AEA gives the Nuclear Regulatory Commission significant authority over the milling, transfer, use, and disposal of uranium, as well as the construction and operation of nuclear power plants.  But Congress conspicuously chose to leave untouched the States' historic authority over the regulation of mining activities on private lands within their borders.  Nor do we see anything to suggest that the enforcement of Virginia's law would frustrate the AEA's purposes and objectives.  And we are hardly free to extend a federal statute to a sphere Congress was well aware of but chose to leave alone.  In this, as in any field of statutory interpretation, it is our duty to respect not only what Congress wrote but, as importantly, what it didn't write.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Virginia Uranium thought its plan was pretty straightforward.  First, the company wanted to use conventional mining techniques to extract raw uranium ore from a site near Coles Hill, Virginia.  Next, it intended to mill that ore into a usable form.  Typically performed at the mine site, milling involves grinding the ore into sand-sized grains and then exposing it to a chemical solution that leaches out pure uranium.  Once dried, the resulting mixture forms a solid \"yellowcake,\" which the company planned to sell to enrichment facilities that produce fuel for nuclear reactors.  Finally, because the leaching process does not remove all of the uranium from the ore, the company expected to store the leftover \"tailings\" near the mine to reduce the chances of contaminating the air or water.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But putting the plan into action didn't prove so simple.  Pursuant to the AEA, ch. 724, 60 Stat. 755, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72011 et\u00a0seq., the NRC regulates milling and tailing storage activities nationwide, and it has issued an array of rules on these subjects.  See, e.g., 10 CFR \u00a740 et\u00a0seq. (2018).  None of those, though, proved the real problem for Virginia Uranium.  The company hit a roadblock even before it could get to the point where the NRC's rules kick in: State law flatly prohibits uranium mining in Virginia.  See Va. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a745.1-161.292:30, 45.1-283 (2013); 848 F.\u00a03d 590, 593-594 (CA4 2017).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To overcome that obstacle, Virginia Uranium filed this lawsuit.  The company alleged that, under the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, the AEA preempts state uranium mining laws like Virginia's and ensconces the NRC as the lone regulator in the field.  And because the NRC's regulations say nothing about uranium mining, the company continued, it remains free to mine as it will in Virginia or elsewhere.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both the district court and a divided panel of the Fourth Circuit rejected the company's argument.  The courts acknowledged that the AEA affords the NRC considerable authority over the nuclear fuel life cycle.  But both courts found missing from the AEA any hint that Congress sought to strip States of their traditional power to regulate mining on private lands within their borders.  Given the significance of the question presented, we granted review.  584 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2018).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Supremacy Clause supplies a rule of priority.  It provides that the \"Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof,\" are \"the supreme Law of the Land .\u00a0.\u00a0. any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any state to the Contrary notwithstanding.\" Art.\u00a0VI, cl.\u00a02.  This Court has sometimes used different labels to describe the different ways in which federal statutes may displace state laws--speaking, for example, of express, field, and conflict preemption.  But these categories \"are not rigidly distinct.\"  Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.\u00a0S. 363, 372, n.\u00a06 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And at least one feature unites them: Invoking some brooding federal interest or appealing to a judicial policy preference should never be enough to win preemption of a state law; a litigant must point specifically to \"a constitutional text or a federal statute\" that does the displacing or conflicts with state law.  Puerto Rico Dept. of Consumer Affairs v. ISLA Petroleum Corp., 485 U.\u00a0S. 495, 503 (1988); see also 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a71831, p. 694 (1st ed. 1833) (\"the supremacy of the laws is attached to those only, which are made in pursuance of the constitution\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before us, Virginia Uranium contends that the AEA (and only the AEA) unseats state uranium mining regulations and that it does so under the doctrines of both field and conflict preemption.  We examine these arguments about the AEA's preemptive effect much as we would any other about statutory meaning, looking to the text and context of the law in question and guided by the traditional tools of statutory interpretation.  Here, no more than in any statutory interpretation dispute, is it enough for any party or court to rest on a supposition (or wish) that \"it must be in there somewhere.\"\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We begin with the company's claim that the text and structure of the AEA reserve the regulation of uranium mining for the purpose of addressing nuclear safety concerns to the NRC alone--and almost immediately problems emerge.  Unlike many federal statutes,1 the AEA contains no provision preempting state law in so many words.  Even more pointedly, the statute grants the NRC extensive and sometimes exclusive authority to regulate nearly every aspect of the nuclear fuel life cycle except mining.  Companies like Virginia Uranium must abide the NRC's rules and regulations if they wish to handle enriched uranium, to mill uranium ore or store tailings, or to build or run a nuclear power plant.  See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a72111(a), 2113(a), 2073.  But when it comes to mining, the statute speaks very differently, expressly stating that the NRC's regulatory powers arise only \"after [uranium's] removal from its place of deposit in nature.\"  \u00a72092 (emphasis added).  As the government itself has conceded, this means that \"uranium mining\" lies \"outside the NRC's jurisdiction,\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14, and the agency's grip takes hold only \"at the mill, rather than at the mine,\" In\u00a0re Hydro Resources, Inc., 63 N.\u00a0R.\u00a0C. 510, 512 (2006).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What the text states, context confirms.  After announcing a general rule that mining regulation lies outside the NRC's jurisdiction, the AEA carves out a notably narrow exception.  On federal lands, the statute says, the NRC may regulate uranium mining.  \u00a72097.  And if the federal government wants to control mining of uranium on private land, the AEA tells the NRC exactly what to do: It may purchase or seize the land by eminent domain and make it federal land.  \u00a72096.  Congress thus has spoken directly to the question of uranium mining on private land, and every bit of what it's said indicates that state authority remains untouched.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Later amendments to the AEA point to the same conclusion.  Some years after the statute's passage, Congress added a provision, currently codified in \u00a72021, allowing the NRC to devolve certain of its regulatory powers to the States.  Unsurprisingly, Congress indicated that the NRC must maintain regulatory control over especially sensitive activities like the construction of nuclear power plants.  \u00a72021(c).  But under \u00a72021(b) the NRC may now, by agreement, pass to the States some of its preexisting authorities to regulate various nuclear materials \"for the protection of the public health and safety from radiation hazards.\"  Out of apparent concern that courts might (mis)read these new provisions as prohibiting States from regulating any activity even tangentially related to nuclear power without first reaching an agreement with the NRC, Congress added subsection (k):\n\"Nothing in this section [that is, \u00a72021] shall be construed to affect the authority of any State or local agency to regulate activities for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 2021, thus, did nothing to extend the NRC's power to activities, like mining, historically beyond its reach.  Instead, it served only to allow the NRC to share with the States some of the powers previously reserved to the federal government.  Even then, the statute explained in subsection (k) that States remain free to regulate the activities discussed in \u00a72021 for purposes other than nuclear safety without the NRC's consent.  Indeed, if anything, subsection (k) might be described as a non-preemption clause.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Virginia Uranium's case hinges on a very different construction of subsection (k).  The company suggests that, properly read, the provision greatly expands the preemptive effect of the AEA and demands the displacement of any state law (touching on mining or any other subject) if that law was enacted for the purpose of protecting the public against \"radiation hazards.\"  And, the company adds, Virginia's law bears just such an impermissible purpose.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In our view, this reading nearly turns the provision on its head.  Subsection (k) does not displace traditional state regulation over mining or otherwise extend the NRC's grasp to matters previously beyond its control.  It does not expose every state law on every subject to a searching judicial inquiry into its latent purposes.  Instead and much more modestly, it clarifies that \"nothing in this [new] section [2021]\"--a section allowing for the devolution-by-agreement of federal regulatory authority--should be construed to curtail the States' ability to regulate the activities discussed in that same section for purposes other than protecting against radiation hazards.  So only state laws that seek to regulate the activities discussed in \u00a72021 without an NRC agreement--activities like the construction of nuclear power plants--may be scrutinized to ensure their purposes aim at something other than regulating nuclear safety.  Really, to accomplish all it wants, Virginia Uranium would have to persuade us to read 13 words out of the statute and add 2 more:\nNothing in this section shall be construed to affect the authority of any State or local agency to may regulate activities only for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.\nThat may be a statute some would prefer, but it is not the statute we have.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just consider what would follow from Virginia Uranium's interpretation.  Not only would States be prohibited from regulating uranium mining to protect against radiation hazards; the federal government likely would be barred from doing so as well.  After all, the NRC has long believed, and still maintains, that the AEA affords it no authority to regulate uranium mining on private land.  Nor does Virginia Uranium dispute the federal government's understanding.  Admittedly, if Virginia Uranium were to prevail here, the NRC might respond by changing course and seeking to regulate uranium mining for the first time.  But given the statute's terms, the prospects that it might do so successfully in the face of a legal challenge appear gloomy.  Admittedly, as well, federal air and water and other regulations might apply at a uranium mine much as at any other workplace.  But the possibility that both state and federal authorities would be left unable to regulate the unique risks posed by an activity as potentially hazardous as uranium mining seems more than a little unlikely, and quite a lot to find buried deep in subsection (k).  Talk about squeezing elephants into mouseholes.  See Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U.\u00a0S. 457, 468 (2001).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the best reading of the AEA doesn't require us to hold the state law before us preempted, Virginia Uranium takes another swing in the same direction.  Only this time, the company submits, our precedents have adopted a different, even if maybe doubtful, reading of the AEA that we must follow.  Most prominently, Virginia Uranium points to this Court's decision in Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U.\u00a0S. 190 (1983).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But here, too, problems quickly appear.  Pacific Gas rejected a preemption challenge to a state law prohibiting the construction of new nuclear power plants.  Along the way, the Court expressly dismissed the notion that \u00a72021 establishes the federal government as \"the sole regulator of all matters nuclear.\"  Id., at 205.  The Court observed that subsection (k) addresses itself only to \"the preemptive effect of 'this section,' that is [\u00a72021].\"  Id., at 210.  And the Court acknowledged that subsection (k) does not \"cut back on pre-existing state authority outside the NRC's jurisdiction,\" a field that surely includes uranium mining.  Id., at 209.  None of this remotely helps Virginia Uranium's cause.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still, Virginia Uranium seeks to make the best of a bad situation.  The company points out that Pacific Gas upheld the state law at issue there only after observing that it was enacted out of concern with economic development, not for the purpose of addressing radiation safety hazards.  Id., at 205.  From this, the company reasons, we should infer that any state law enacted with the purpose of addressing nuclear hazards must fall thanks to our precedent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But even that much does not follow.  Since the passage of the AEA, the NRC has always played a significant role in regulating the construction of nuclear power plants.  Indeed, under \u00a72021(c) this remains one area where the NRC generally cannot devolve its responsibilities to the States.  See id., at 197-198, 206-207.  And because \u00a72021 classifies the construction of nuclear power plants as one of the core remaining areas of special federal concern, any state law regulating that activity risks being subjected to an inquiry into its purposes under subsection (k).  But the activity Virginia's law regulates--mining on private land--isn't one the AEA has ever addressed, and it isn't one \u00a72021 discusses, so subsection (k) does not authorize any judicial inquiry into state legislative purpose in this case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Admittedly, there is a wrinkle here.  Pacific Gas seemed to accept California's argument that its law addressed whether new power plants may be built, while the NRC's regulatory power under \u00a72021(c) extends only to the question how such plants are constructed and operated.  Id., at 212.  And accepting (without granting) these premises, it would appear that California's law did not implicate an activity addressed by \u00a72021, so an inquiry into state legislative purpose under subsection (k) was not statutorily authorized.  Yet Pacific Gas inquired anyway, perhaps on the unstated belief that the state law just came \"too close\" to a core power \u00a72021(c) reserves to the federal government.  Does that mean we must do the same?  Certainly Virginia Uranium sees it that way.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We do not.  Just because Pacific Gas may have made more of state legislative purposes than the terms of the AEA allow does not mean we must make more of them yet.  It is one thing to do as Pacific Gas did and inquire exactingly into state legislative purposes when state law prohibits a regulated activity like the construction of a nuclear plant, and thus comes close to trenching on core federal powers reserved to the federal government by the AEA.  It is another thing to do as Virginia Uranium wishes and impose the same exacting scrutiny on state laws prohibiting an activity like mining far removed from the NRC's historic powers.  And without some clearer congressional mandate suggesting an inquiry like that would be appropriate, we decline to undertake it on our own authority.  The preemption of state laws represents \"a serious intrusion into state sovereignty.\"  Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.\u00a0S. 470, 488 (1996) (plurality opinion).  And to order preemption based not on the strength of a clear congressional command, or even on the strength of a judicial gloss requiring that much of us, but based only on a doubtful extension of a questionable judicial gloss would represent not only a significant federal intrusion into state sovereignty.  It would also represent a significant judicial intrusion into Congress's authority to delimit the preemptive effect of its laws.  Being in for a dime doesn't mean we have to be in for a dollar.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court's later cases confirm the propriety of restraint in this area.  In a decision issued just a year after Pacific Gas (and by the same author), this Court considered whether the AEA preempted state tort remedies for radiation injuries after a nuclear plant accident.  Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U.\u00a0S. 238 (1984).  In doing so, the Court did not inquire into state legislative purposes, apparently because it thought state tort law (unlike a law prohibiting the construction of a nuclear power plant) fell beyond any fair understanding of the NRC's reach under the AEA. Id., at 251.  Exactly the same, as we have seen, can be said of Virginia's mining law.  In fact, if the Silkwood Court had inquired into state legislative purposes, the law there might well have been harder to sustain than the one now before us.  State tort laws, after all, plainly intend to regulate public safety.  And as applied in Silkwood, state tort law sought to regulate the safety of a nuclear plant's operations, an area of special federal interest under \u00a72021(c).  Id., at 256.  Nothing comparable, of course, can be said of the mining regulations before us.  Some years later, this Court in English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U.\u00a0S. 72 (1990), went further still, casting doubt on whether an inquiry into state legislative purposes had been either necessary or appropriate in Pacific Gas itself.  496 U.\u00a0S., at 84-85, n.\u00a07 (\"Whether the suggestion of the majority in Pacific Gas that legislative purpose is relevant to the definition of the pre-empted field is part of the holding of that case is not an issue before us today\" (emphasis added)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Pacific Gas and its progeny alone marked our path, this case might be a close one, as our dissenting colleagues suggest.  Post, at 3-5 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.).  But for us any lingering doubt dissipates when we consult other cases in this area and this Court's traditional tools of statutory interpretation.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Start with the fact that this Court has generally treated field preemption inquiries like this one as depending on what the State did, not why it did it.  Indeed, this Court has analyzed most every other modern field preemption doctrine dispute in this way--from immigration, Arizona v. United States, 567 U.\u00a0S. 387 (2012), to arbitration, AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S. 333 (2011), to foreign affairs, Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.\u00a0S. 363 (2000), to railroads, Kurns v. Railroad Friction Products Corp., 565 U.\u00a0S. 625 (2012), to energy, Hughes v. Talen Energy Marketing, LLC, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016), to civil procedure, Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P.\u00a0A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.\u00a0S. 393 (2010).  It is unclear why we would proceed differently here without some clear congressional instruction requiring it.3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our field preemption cases proceed as they do, moreover, for good reasons.  Consider just some of the costs to cooperative federalism and individual liberty we would invite by inquiring into state legislative purpose too precipitately.  The natural tendency of regular federal judicial inquiries into state legislative intentions would be to stifle deliberation in state legislatures and encourage resort to secrecy and subterfuge.  That would inhibit the sort of open and vigorous legislative debate that our Constitution recognizes as vital to testing ideas and improving laws.  In Virginia Uranium's vision as well, federal courts would have to allow depositions of state legislators and governors, and perhaps hale them into court for cross-examination at trial about their subjective motivations in passing a mining statute.  And at the end of it all, federal courts would risk subjecting similarly situated persons to radically different legal rules as judges uphold and strike down materially identical state regulations based only on the happenstance of judicial assessments of the \"true\" intentions lurking behind them.  In light of all this, it can surprise no one that our precedents have long warned against undertaking potential misadventures into hidden state legislative intentions without a clear statutory mandate for the project.  See, e.g., Shady Grove, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 404-405; Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assn., 552 U.\u00a0S. 364, 373-374 (2008); Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.\u00a0S. 217, 225 (1971); Arizona v. California, 283 U.\u00a0S. 423, 455, n.\u00a07 (1931) (collecting cases).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, Virginia Uranium insists that we don't need to worry about concerns like these in this case.  We don't, the company says, because Virginia has admitted that it enacted its law with the (impermissible) purpose of protecting the public from nuclear safety hazards.  But the Commonwealth denies making any such admission.  Instead, it says it has merely accepted as true the allegations in the company's complaint about the intentions animating state law for purposes of the Commonwealth's own motion to dismiss this suit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  If the case were to proceed beyond the pleadings stage, Virginia insists, a more searching judicial inquiry into the law's motivation would be inevitable.  Whoever may be right about the status of Virginia's admissions in this case, though, the point remains that following Virginia Uranium's lead would require serious intrusions into state legislative processes in future cases.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beyond these concerns, as well, lie well-known conceptual and practical ones this Court has also advised against inviting unnecessarily.  State legislatures are composed of individuals who often pursue legislation for multiple and unexpressed purposes, so what legal rules should determine when and how to ascribe a particular intention to a particular legislator?  What if an impermissible intention existed but wasn't necessary to her vote?  And what percentage of the legislature must harbor the impermissible intention before we can impute it to the collective institution?  Putting all that aside, how are courts supposed to conduct a reasonable inquiry into these questions when recorded state legislative history materials are often not as readily available or complete as their federal counterparts?  And if trying to peer inside legislators' skulls is too fraught an enterprise, shouldn't we limit ourselves to trying to glean legislative purposes from the statutory text where we began?  Even Pacific Gas warned future courts against too hastily accepting a litigant's invitation to \"become embroiled in attempting to ascertain\" state legislative \"motive[s],\" acknowledging that such inquiries \"often\"  prove \"unsatisfactory venture[s].  What motivates one legislator to vote for a statute is not necessarily what motivates scores of others to enact it.\"  461 U.\u00a0S., at 216 (citation omitted).  See also Shady Grove, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 403-404, n.\u00a06; Palmer, 403 U.\u00a0S., at 225; Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.\u00a0S. 578, 636-639 (1987) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Cf. Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U.\u00a0S. 75, 79 (1998).  We think these warnings wise, and we heed them today.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the AEA doesn't occupy the field of radiation safety in uranium mining, Virginia Uranium suggests the statute still displaces state law through what's sometimes called conflict preemption.  In particular, the company suggests, Virginia's mining law stands as an impermissible \"obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\"  Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.\u00a0S. 52, 67 (1941).  On Virginia Uranium's account, Congress sought to capture the benefits of developing nuclear power while mitigating its safety and environmental costs.  And, the company contends, Virginia's moratorium disrupts the delicate \"balance\" Congress sought to achieve between these benefits and costs.  Maybe the text of the AEA doesn't touch on mining in so many words, but its authority to regulate later stages of the nuclear fuel life cycle would be effectively undermined if mining laws like Virginia's were allowed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A sound preemption analysis cannot be as simplistic as that.  No more than in field preemption can the Supremacy Clause be deployed here to elevate abstract and unenacted legislative desires above state law; only federal laws \"made in pursuance of\" the Constitution, through its prescribed processes of bicameralism and presentment, are entitled to preemptive effect.  Art.\u00a0VI, cl. 2; ISLA Petroleum, 485 U.\u00a0S., at 503.  So any \"[e]vidence of pre-emptive purpose,\" whether express or implied, must therefore be \"sought in the text and structure of the statute at issue.\"  CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U.\u00a0S. 658, 664 (1993).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sound and well-documented reasons underlie this rule too.  Efforts to ascribe unenacted purposes and objectives to a federal statute face many of the same challenges as inquiries into state legislative intent.  Trying to discern what motivates legislators individually and collectively invites speculation and risks overlooking the reality that individual Members of Congress often pursue multiple and competing purposes, many of which are compromised to secure a law's passage and few of which are fully realized in the final product.  Hefty inferences may be required, as well, when trying to estimate whether Congress would have wanted to prohibit States from pursuing regulations that may happen to touch, in various degrees and different ways, on unenacted federal purposes and objectives.  Worse yet, in piling inference upon inference about hidden legislative wishes we risk displacing the legislative compromises actually reflected in the statutory text--compromises that sometimes may seem irrational to an outsider coming to the statute cold, but whose genius lies in having won the broad support our Constitution demands of any new law.  In disregarding these legislative compromises, we may only wind up displacing perfectly legitimate state laws on the strength of \"purposes\" that only we can see, that may seem perfectly logical to us, but that lack the democratic provenance the Constitution demands before a federal law may be declared supreme.  See, e.g., Pacific Gas, 461 U.\u00a0S., at 222 (acknowledging that under the AEA \"the promotion of nuclear power is not to be accomplished 'at all costs'\u00a0\"); Cyan, Inc. v. Beaver County Employees Retirement Fund, 583 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2018) (slip op., at 14-15); Aguillard, 482 U.\u00a0S., at 636-639 (Scalia, J., dissenting); United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.\u00a0S. 367, 382-384 (1968); Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 130 (1810).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So it may be that Congress meant the AEA to promote the development of nuclear power.  It may be that Congress meant the AEA to balance that goal against various safety concerns.  But it also may be that Members of Congress held many other disparate or conflicting goals in mind when they voted to enact and amend the AEA, and many different views on exactly how to manage the competing costs and benefits.  If polled, they might have reached very different assessments, as well, about the consistency of Virginia's law with their own purposes and objectives.  The only thing a court can be sure of is what can be found in the law itself.  And every indication in the law before us suggests that Congress elected to leave mining regulation on private land to the States and grant the NRC regulatory authority only after uranium is removed from the earth.  That compromise may not be the only permissible or even the most rationally attractive one, but it is surely both permissible and rational to think that Congress might have chosen to regulate the more novel aspects of nuclear power while leaving to States their traditional function of regulating mining activities on private lands within their boundaries.4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As an alternative to proceeding down the purposes-and-objectives branch of conflict preemption, Virginia Uranium might have pursued another.  Our cases have held that we can sometimes infer a congressional intent to displace a state law that makes compliance with a federal statute impossible.  English, 496 U.\u00a0S., at 79.  But Virginia Uranium hasn't pursued an argument along any of these lines, and understandably so.  Not only can Virginia Uranium comply with both state and federal laws; it is also unclear whether laws like Virginia's might have a meaningful impact on the development of nuclear power in this country.  Some estimate that the United States currently imports over 90 percent of the uranium used in this country.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 19a.  Domestic uranium mines currently exist on federal lands as well and are thus beyond the reach of state authorities.  Ibid.  And if the federal government concludes that development of the Coles Hill deposit or any other like it is crucial, it may always purchase the site (or seize it through eminent domain) under the powers Congress has supplied.  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72096.  All this may be done without even amending the AEA, itself another course which Congress is always free to pursue--but which this Court should never be tempted into pursuing on its own.\n*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the court of appeals is\nAffirmed.\n\nGinsburg, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 16-1275\nVIRGINIA URANIUM, INC., et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v. JOHN WARREN, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit\n[June 17, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan join, concurring in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Soon after discovery of a large deposit of uranium ore in Virginia in the late 1970s, the Commonwealth banned uranium mining.  Petitioners (collectively, Virginia Uranium) now seek to mine that deposit.  They challenge the Commonwealth's uranium mining ban as preempted by the Atomic Energy Act (AEA or Act), 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72011 et\u00a0seq., either because the ban intrudes on the federally occupied field of nuclear safety, or because it obstructs realization of federal purposes and objectives.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I reach the same bottom-line judgment as does Justice Gorsuch: The Commonwealth's mining ban is not preempted.  And I agree with much contained in Justice Gorsuch's opinion.  See ante, at 4-10.  But his discussion of the perils of inquiring into legislative motive, see ante, at 11-14, sweeps well beyond the confines of this case, and therefore seems to me inappropriate in an opinion speaking for the Court, rather than for individual members of the Court.  Further, Virginia Uranium's obstacle preemption arguments fail under existing doctrine, so there is little reason to question, as Justice Gorsuch does, see ante, at 14-16, whether that doctrine should be retained.  For these reasons, I join the Court's judgment, and separately state how I would resolve the instant controversy.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The production of nuclear fuel begins with mining uranium, a radioactive metal.  See ante, at 1-2; Brief for Former Nuclear Regulators as Amici Curiae 7.  Conventionally, uranium ore is mined and then \"milled\"--crushed and treated with chemicals that extract the usable uranium.  Ibid.  The resulting concentrated uranium oxide, known as yellowcake, is shipped elsewhere for conversion, enrichment, and fabrication into fuel.  Ibid.  Producing just a pound of usable uranium requires milling hundreds or even thousands of pounds of ore.  H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 95-1480, pt. 1, p.\u00a011 (1978).  Milling thus generates vast quantities of \"tailings\": Sandy waste that is radioactive, contains toxic heavy metals, ibid., and must \"be carefully regulated, monitored, and controlled,\" U. S. NRC, Conventional Uranium Mills (rev. May 15, 2017), https:\/\/www .nrc.gov\u00a0\/materials\u00a0\/uranium\u00a0-\u00a0recovery\u00a0\/extraction\u00a0-\u00a0methods\u00a0\/ conventional-mills.html (as last visited June 12, 2019).  Milling and tailings storage typically occur within 30 miles of the place where uranium is mined.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Government regulates much of this process, primarily to protect public health and safety from radiation, but also for national security reasons.  English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U.\u00a0S. 72, 81-82 (1990); Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U.\u00a0S. 190, 207, 211-212 (1983) (PG&E).  Under the AEA, a federal license is required to, inter alia, \"transfer or receive in interstate commerce\" nontrivial quantities of \"source material,\" including uranium ore, \"after removal from its place of deposit in nature,\" \u00a7\u00a72092, 2014(z).  See also \u00a7\u00a72091-2099.  Licensing requirements also apply to the production, possession, or disposal of \"byproduct material,\" including tailings.  See \u00a7\u00a72014(e), 2111-2114.  Federal regulations govern, as well, subsequent processes, including uranium enrichment and nuclear power generation.  See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a72131-2142.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Government does not regulate conventional uranium mining on private land, having long taken the position that its authority begins \"at the mill, rather than at the mine.\"  In\u00a0re Hydro Resources, Inc., 63 N.\u00a0R.\u00a0C. 510, 512-513 (2006); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 4.  See also ante, at 4-6.  And while the Federal Government has exclusive authority over the radiation hazards of milling and subsequent stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, States may regulate these activities for other purposes.  See \u00a72018 (AEA does not affect state authority over \"the generation, sale, or transmission of electric power produced\" by nuclear powerplants); English, 496 U.\u00a0S., at 81-82; PG&E, 461 U.\u00a0S., at 207, 211-212.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The AEA provides a means by which States may take over federal responsibility for regulating the nuclear safety aspects of milling and the disposal of tailings.  See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72021.  In 1959, Congress amended the AEA to \"recognize the interests of the States in the peaceful uses of atomic energy, and to clarify the respective responsibilities under th[e] Act of the States and [federal authorities] with respect to the regulation of byproduc[t and] source .\u00a0.\u00a0. materials.\"  Act of Sept. 23, 1959, 73 Stat. 688, as amended, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72021(a)(1).  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and a State may agree for the former to devolve to the latter authority to regulate source or byproduct materials \"for the protection of the public health and safety from radiation hazards.\"  \u00a72021(b).  \"During the duration of such an agreement .\u00a0.\u00a0. the State shall have authority to regulate the materials covered by the agreement for the protection of the public health and safety from radiation hazards.\"  Ibid.  Section 2021(c) prohibits the NRC, however, from devolving its authority over \"more dangerous activities--such as nuclear reactors.\"  S.\u00a0Rep. No. 870, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (1959).  Finally, and of critical importance to this case, \u00a72021(k) provides that \"[n]othing in this section shall be construed to affect the authority of any State or local agency to regulate activities for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.\"\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the late 1970s, uranium ore was discovered under Coles Hill, an unincorporated community in Pittsylvania County, Virginia.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 216a.  Totaling 119 million pounds of uranium ore, the deposit is the Nation's largest.  Id., at 201a.  See also 848 F.\u00a03d 590, 593 (CA4 2017) (case below).  After a private company began leasing mineral rights to the deposit, the Virginia General Assembly directed the state Coal and Energy Commission to study the effects on the environment and public health of uranium exploration, mining, and milling.  H.\u00a0J. Res. No. 324, 1981 Va. Acts p. 1404; App. to Pet. for Cert. 216a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next year, the General Assembly authorized uranium exploration but imposed a one-year moratorium on uranium mining.  1982 Va. Acts ch. 269.  The Assembly's stated purpose was \"to encourage and promote the safe and efficient exploration for uranium resources within the Commonwealth, and to assure .\u00a0.\u00a0. that uranium mining and milling will be subject to statutes and regulations which protect the environment and the health and safety of the public.\"  Ibid.  The Assembly soon extended the ban \"until a program for permitting uranium mining is established by statute.\"  1983 Va. Acts ch.\u00a03.  The Commonwealth has not established a permitting program, so the ban remains in force.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A slowdown in construction of new nuclear powerplants in the 1980s contributed to a \"precipitous decline in the price of uranium ore.\"  Huffman v. Western Nuclear, Inc., 486 U.\u00a0S. 663, 666-667, and n.\u00a05 (1988).  Rising prices in the first decade of the new millennium prompted renewed interest in mining the deposit, and Virginia Uranium lobbied to have the ban repealed.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 222a; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When efforts to persuade the state legislature proved unsuccessful, Virginia Uranium brought this suit seeking a declaration that the ban is preempted by federal law and an injunction requiring the Commonwealth to issue uranium mining permits.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 237a.  Respondents, Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals, and Energy officials (together, the Commonwealth Defendants), moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, and the District Court granted the motion.  Virginia Uranium, Inc. v. McAuliffe, 147 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 462, 478 (WD Va. 2015).1  The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding in principal part that because the Commonwealth's mining ban did not regulate an activity overseen by the NRC, there was no need to consider the purposes for which the ban was imposed.  848 F.\u00a03d, at 597-598.  Given the importance of the issue, and to resolve a division of authority among the Courts of Appeals, we granted Virginia Uranium's petition for a writ of certiorari.  Compare id., at 594-599 (case below), with, e.g., Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians v. Nielson, 376 F.\u00a03d 1223, 1246 (CA10 2004) (state laws grounded in nuclear safety concerns are preempted).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the Supremacy Clause, the \"Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof,\" are \"the supreme Law of the Land.\"  Art.\u00a0VI, cl.\u00a02.  \"Put simply, federal law preempts contrary state law.\"  Hughes v. Talen Energy Marketing, LLC, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 11).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has delineated three circumstances in which state law must yield to federal law.  English, 496 U.\u00a0S., at 78-79.  First, and most obvious, federal law operates exclusively when Congress expressly preempts state law.  Ibid.  Second, state law can play no part when \"Congress has legislated comprehensively to occupy an entire field of regulation, leaving no room for the States to supplement federal law.\"  Hughes, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Third, state law is rendered inoperative when it \"actually conflicts with federal law,\" English, 496 U.\u00a0S., at 79, as when a private party cannot \"comply with both state and federal requirements,\" Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. v. Albrecht, 587 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 2) (internal quotation marks omitted), or when state law \"creates an unacceptable 'obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,'\u00a0\" Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.\u00a0S. 555, 563-564 (2009) (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.\u00a0S. 52, 67 (1941)).  Whatever the category of preemption asserted, \"the purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone\" in determining whether federal law preempts state law.  Hughes, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (internal quotation marks omitted). Virginia Uranium invokes both field and obstacle preemption; I address each in turn.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Virginia Uranium's primary contention is that Congress has occupied the field of nuclear safety regulation, preempting state laws enacted because of concerns about the radiation safety of federally regulated activities.  Defining the preempted field by reference to the purpose for which state laws were enacted finds \"some support in the text of the [AEA],\" English, 496 U.\u00a0S., at 84, and, in particular, \u00a72021(k).  Again, this provision states that \"[n]othing in [\u00a72021] shall be construed to affect the authority of any State .\u00a0.\u00a0. to regulate activities for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.\"  (Emphasis added.)  Section 2021(k) presupposes federal preemption of at least some state laws enacted to guard \"against radiation hazards.\"  Virginia Uranium and the dissent read this subsection to include within the preempted sphere all state laws motivated by concerns about the radiation hazards of NRC-regulated activities.  Brief for Petitioners 35; post, at 2.  The Commonwealth Defendants would exclude from federal foreclosure state laws directed to activities not regulated by the NRC.  E.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-34.  The Commonwealth Defendants have the better reading of the statute.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commonwealth has forbidden only conventional uranium mining on private land, an activity all agree is not federally regulated.  E.g., id., at 9-10, 17-18, 30.  The controlling AEA provision, \u00a72092, triggers federal regulation only when source material is \"remov[ed] from its place of deposit in nature.\"  Federal authorities have long read that provision to preclude federal regulation of conventional uranium mining.  Ante, at 4; supra, at 4.  In contrast to the AEA's express provisions for uranium mining on public lands, \u00a7\u00a72097-2098, the Act is nearly silent about conventional uranium mining on private lands.  See ante, at 4-6.  Indeed, insofar as the Act addresses private conventional mining, it does so to bar federal regulators from obtaining reports about ore \"prior to removal from its place of deposit in nature.\"  \u00a72095.  Every indication, then, is that Congress left private conventional mining unregulated.  And if Congress did not provide for regulation of private conventional mining, it is hard to see how or why state law on the subject would be preempted, whatever the reason for the law's enactment.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Virginia Uranium's argument to the contrary rests on \u00a72021(k), but that provision, correctly read, lends no support for Virginia Uranium's cause.  By its terms, \u00a72021(k) addresses only state authority to regulate \"activities\" for nonradiological purposes.  Read in context of \u00a72021 as a whole, \"activities\" means activities regulated by the NRC.  See \u00a72021(c), (l), (m), (o); ante, at 6 (\u00a72021(k) \"might be described as a non-preemption clause\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The AEA's context and history are corroborative.  Prior to enactment of \u00a72021(k), the Federal Government and States shared responsibility for most steps of the nuclear fuel cycle, with the former regulating primarily for public health and safety, and the latter regulating for economic and other nonradiological purposes.  See supra, at 4.  Section 2021 was designed \"to heighten the States' role,\" PG&E, 461 U.\u00a0S., at 209, by enabling federal regulators to cede their previously exclusive authority over the nuclear safety of several lower risk activities, \u00a72021(b).  Given this aim, \u00a72021(k) is most sensibly read to clarify that the door newly opened for state regulation left in place pre-existing state authority \"to regulate activities for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.\"  See ante, at 5-6.  The House and Senate Reports are explicit on this point: Section \u00a72021(k) was \"intended to make it clear that the bill does not impair the State[s'] authority to regulate activities of [federal] licensees for the manifold health, safety, and economic purposes other than radiation protection\"; the bill simply provides a means for States to obtain heretofore exclusively federal authority to regulate these activities for \"protection against radiation hazards.\"  S.\u00a0Rep. No. 870, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., at 12; accord H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 1125, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 12 (1959).  Nothing suggests that Congress \"intended to cut back on pre-existing state authority outside the NRC's jurisdiction.\"  PG&E, 461 U.\u00a0S., at 209-210.  That authority encompassed state laws regulating conventional uranium mining, even if enacted because of concerns about the radiological safety of postextraction, NRC-regulated steps in the nuclear fuel cycle.\n3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Virginia Uranium leans most heavily on a statement in the Court's PG&E opinion: \"[T]he Federal Government has occupied the entire field of nuclear safety concerns.\"  461 U.\u00a0S., at 212.  But in neither PG&E nor in later decisions in its wake, Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U.\u00a0S. 238 (1984), and English, 496 U.\u00a0S. 72, did the Court rest preemption on the purposes for which state laws were enacted.  Indeed, in all three, the Court held that the state laws at issue were not preempted.  See ante, at 7-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, without gainsaying that it may sometimes be appropriate to inquire into the purpose for which a state law was enacted, PG&E calls for no such inquiry here.  PG&E considered whether the AEA preempted a California law conditioning approval to build new nuclear plants on a finding that an adequate method existed for disposing of spent nuclear fuel.  461 U.\u00a0S., at 197-198.  The Court upheld the law because it was enacted out of concern for economic development, not because of radiation safety hazards.  Id., at 205, 213-216.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is unsurprising that the PG&E Court asked why the California law had been enacted.  The State's law addressed construction of a nuclear powerplant, an activity closely regulated by the Federal Government for nuclear safety purposes.  See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a72021(c)(1), 2132-2142; 10 CFR pt. 50 (2018).  The Court therefore inquired whether the state law was enacted, in \u00a72021(k)'s words, \"for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.\"  Here, in contrast, the Commonwealth's mining ban targets an exclusively state-regulated activity.  See ante, at 8-10.2\n4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I am not persuaded by the Solicitor General's argument that the Commonwealth's mining ban is preempted because it is a pretext for regulating the radiological safety hazards of milling and tailings storage.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28-30.  To the degree the AEA preempts state laws enacted for certain purposes, \u00a72021(k) stakes out the boundaries of the preempted field, i.e., state laws that apply to federally licensed activities and are driven by concerns about the radiological safety of those activities.  We have no license to expand those boundaries.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The case on which the Solicitor General primarily relies, National Meat Assn. v. Harris, 565 U.\u00a0S. 452 (2012), does not counsel otherwise.  National Meat concerned a set of California laws that \"dictat[ed] what slaughterhouses must do with pigs that cannot walk, known in the trade as nonambulatory pigs.\"  Id., at 455.  The question presented: Did California's prescriptions conflict with the Federal Meat Inspection Act's express preemption of state law that imposed requirements \"in addition to, or different than those made under\" the Act?  21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7678.  One of the California provisions, a ban on the sale of meat or products from nonambulatory pigs, regulated a subject outside the scope of the Federal Meat Inspection Act.  National Meat, 565 U.\u00a0S., at 463.  The Court nevertheless concluded that the sale ban fell within the scope of the Act's express preemption clause because it was intended to work together with other California provisions to impose additional requirements on slaughterhouse operations.  Id., at 463-464.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0National Meat is not controlling here.  No express preemption provision is involved.  The mining ban sets no safety standards for federally supervised milling or tailings storage activities.  True enough, the ban makes it far less likely, though not impossible, that such activities will take place in the Commonwealth.3  In that regard, the Commonwealth's mining ban is more aptly analogized to state bans on slaughtering horses, upheld by courts of appeals and distinguished in National Meat from California's nonambulatory pig laws.  Horse slaughtering bans, National Meat explained, \"work[ed] at a remove from the sites and activities that the FMIA most directly governs\" by ensuring that \"no horses will be delivered to, inspected at, or handled by a slaughterhouse, because no horses will be ordered for purchase in the first instance.\"  Id., at 465, 467 (citing Cavel Int'l, Inc. v. Madigan, 500 F.\u00a03d 551 (CA7 2007), and Empacadora de Carnes de Fresnillo, S.\u00a0A. de C.\u00a0V. v. Curry, 476 F.\u00a03d 326 (CA5 2007)).  The distinction drawn in National Meat thus supports this conclusion: A state law regulating an upstream activity within the State's authority is not preempted simply because a downstream activity falls within a federally occupied field.4\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor is the Commonwealth's mining ban preempted as an \"unacceptable obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\"  Wyeth, 555 U.\u00a0S., at 563-564 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Together, Virginia Uranium and the United States identify four ways in which the mining ban supposedly conflicts with federal purposes and objectives.  None carry the day.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, Virginia Uranium contends that the mining ban conflicts with the \"delicate balance\" federal law has struck between promoting nuclear power and ensuring public safety.  Brief for Petitioners 55-56; see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 31-33.  But the Federal Government does not regulate the radiological safety of conventional uranium mining on private land, so federal law struck no balance in this area.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, Virginia Uranium contends that the mining ban \"prohibit[s] the achievement of one of Congress['] 'primary purpose[s]': 'the promotion of nuclear power.'\u00a0\"  Brief for Petitioners 56 (quoting PG&E, 461 U.\u00a0S., at 221).  PG&E, however, dismissed the suggestion that Congress had a policy of promoting nuclear power \"at all costs.\"  Id., at 222 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Given the absence of federal regulation in point, it is improbable that the Federal Government has a purpose or objective of promoting conventional uranium mining on private land.  Cf. ante, at 16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Virginia Uranium warns of dire consequences if all 50 States enact bans similar to the Commonwealth's.  Brief for Petitioners 56-57.  But, as the Court of Appeals explained, numerous domestic uranium recovery facilities are federally regulated (either because they sit on federal land or use unconventional mining techniques) and are \"thus beyond the reach of any state bans\"; and the AEA authorizes the Federal Government to develop uranium deposits on public lands and to acquire private deposits.  848 F.\u00a03d, at 599; see 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a72096-2097.  Federal purposes and objectives do not require judicial supplementation of the AEA's express provisions for maintaining the uranium supply.  Cf. ante, at 17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent suggests that national security may require further domestic uranium production.  Post, at 2, n.\u00a02.  If the Executive Branch--which presumably knows more about \"the critical role of uranium to the country's energy industry and national defense,\" ibid.--agrees, it can arrange for acquisition of the site by the United States, and then for commencement of mining notwithstanding the Commonwealth's ban.  Yet the site remains in private hands.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, Virginia Uranium argues that \u00a72021 provides the sole means for States to regulate radiological safety hazards resulting from milling and tailings storage, and that Virginia has effectively regulated milling and tailings storage without obtaining authority to do so through an adequate \u00a72021 agreement.  Brief for Petitioners 57-59 (citing Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U.\u00a0S. 88, 98-101 (1992)); see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 33-34.  As explained, see supra, at 7-9, 11, Virginia has not regulated the radiological safety of tailings storage; it has prohibited only an antecedent activity subject to exclusive state authority.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the United States contends that Virginia's mining ban frustrates federal purposes and objectives by \"prevent[ing] the occurrence of\" activities that Congress intended the Federal Government to regulate.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 31 (quoting 848 F.\u00a03d, at 600 (Traxler, J., dissenting)).  But federal regulation of certain activities does not mean that States must authorize activities antecedent to those federally regulated.  For example, federal regulation of nuclear powerplants does not demand that States allow the construction of such powerplants in the first place.  PG&E, 461 U.\u00a0S., at 222.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated, I concur in the Court's judgment affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\nRoberts, C. J., dissenting\n\u2002587 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 16-1275\nVIRGINIA URANIUM, INC., et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v. JOHN WARREN, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit\n[June 17, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice Breyer and Justice Alito join, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although one party will be happy with the result of today's decision, both will be puzzled by its reasoning.  That's because the lead opinion sets out to defeat an argument that no one made, reaching a conclusion with which no one disagrees.  Specifically, the opinion devotes its analysis to whether the field of uranium mining safety is preempted under the Atomic Energy Act, ultimately concluding that it is not.  But no party disputes that.  Rather, the question we agreed to address is whether a State can purport to regulate a field that is not preempted (uranium mining safety) as an indirect means of regulating other fields that are preempted (safety concerns about uranium milling and tailings).  And on that question, our precedent is clear: The AEA prohibits state laws that have the purpose and effect of regulating preempted fields.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As relevant here, processing uranium ore involves three steps: mining, milling, and storing \"tailings.\"  Mining is the extracting of uranium ore from the ground; milling is the process of turning the substance into a usable form; and tailings are the leftover radioactive waste that must be safely stored.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is no dispute over which of these fields the AEA reserves to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  The parties agree that the field of uranium mining safety is not preempted.  See Brief for Petitioners 3, 22, n.\u00a04, 27; Reply Brief 8; Brief for Respondents 1; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 4, 14.  And it is undisputed that radiological safety concerns about milling and tailings are preempted fields.  See Brief for Petitioners 32; Tr. of Oral Arg. 36-37 (counsel for respondents); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23.  Indeed, that shared understanding was the basis of the question presented.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite all this, the lead opinion insists that petitioners (hereafter the company) press an entirely different argument.  \"Before us, Virginia Uranium contends that the AEA (and only the AEA) unseats state uranium mining regulations,\" ante, at 3, but \"almost immediately problems emerge,\" ante, at 4.  Problems do immediately emerge in the opinion, but they are of its own making.  The company does not argue that the AEA reserves the field of uranium mining safety.  After attributing this failing argument to the company, the lead opinion then proceeds to explain why the argument must, in fact, fail.  See ante, at 3-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning to the question presented, however, the company's theory of the case is fairly straightforward.  The property at issue here contains the largest known uranium deposit in the country and one of the largest in the world.2  Shortly after its discovery, Virginia enacted a complete ban on uranium mining.  According to the company, the ban was not motivated by concerns about mining safety.  Instead, it was motivated by Virginia's desire to ban the more hazardous steps that come after mining--uranium milling and the storage of radioactive tailings--due to the Commonwealth's disagreement with the NRC over how to safely regulate those activities.  And, crucially, Virginia has yet to put forward any other rationale to support the ban.3  Thus, the question before us is whether, consistent with the AEA and our precedents, the Commonwealth may purport to regulate a non-preempted field (mining safety) with the purpose and effect of indirectly regulating a preempted field (milling and tailings).  That should have made for an easy case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under our AEA precedents, a state law is preempted not only when it \"conflicts with federal law,\" but also when its purpose is to regulate within a preempted field.  Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U.\u00a0S. 190, 212-213 (1983).  Because \"the Federal Government has occupied the entire field of nuclear safety concerns,\" a state law that is \"grounded in [such] safety concerns falls squarely within the prohibited field.\"  Ibid.; see also English v. General Elec. Co., 496 U.\u00a0S. 72, 84 (1990) (state regulations \"motivated by [nuclear] safety concerns\" are preempted by the AEA (citing 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72021(k))).  For example, even though a State may generally regulate its roads, it may not shut down all of the roads to a nuclear power plant simply because it disagrees with the NRC's nuclear safety regulations.  Here, because Virginia has not even disputed that its uranium mining ban was \"grounded in\" its \"nuclear safety concerns\" about uranium milling and tailings, the company's preemption claim should not have been dismissed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The lead opinion and the concurrence miss that simple analysis because they shrink from our AEA precedents, particularly Pacific Gas.  In Pacific Gas, California had banned the construction of nuclear power plants until the State could ensure that new plants would have a viable method for permanently disposing of nuclear waste.  See 461 U.\u00a0S., at 197-198.  On its face, the ban did not purport to regulate a preempted field; it did not regulate the manner in which nuclear power plants may be constructed or operated, which is a field preempted by the AEA.  See id., at 212.  If it had, the Court noted, the ban \"would clearly be impermissible.\"  Ibid.  The California statute instead purported to address the antecedent question whether new plants should be constructed at all--an area within the State's traditional authority over the generation and cost of electricity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the Court did not stop its preemption analysis there.  Instead, it was \"necessary\" to look beyond the face of the statute to determine California's \"rationale\" for the ban.  Id., at 213.  California had argued that it could exercise its traditional authority over power generation to \"completely prohibit new construction until its safety concerns [we]re satisfied by the Federal Government.\"  Id., at 212.  The Court flatly \"reject[ed] this line of reasoning.\"  Ibid.  Because the AEA reserves the \"field of nuclear safety concerns\" to the Federal Government, a state law that was \"grounded in\" those concerns would fall \"squarely within the prohibited field.\"  Id., at 212-213.  In other words, if the purpose of California's ban on nuclear plant construction was to regulate radiological safety, it would be preempted.  California's statute ultimately avoided that outcome, however, because the State had put forward an independent \"nonsafety rationale\"--namely, its concern that new nuclear plants would not be economically viable if they were unable to permanently dispose of nuclear waste.  Id., at 213.  On that basis, the Court determined that the ban was not preempted.  Id., at 216 (\"[W]e accept California's avowed economic purpose as the rationale for enacting [the statute].  Accordingly, the statute lies outside the occupied field of nuclear safety regulation.\" (emphasis added)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pacific Gas should control the outcome here.  Like California's ban in that case, Virginia's ban on its face regulates a non-preempted field--uranium mining safety.  Like the plaintiffs challenging the California ban, the mining company argues that the statute's purpose is really to regulate a preempted field--safety concerns about uranium milling and tailings.  But unlike California in Pacific Gas, Virginia in this case has not put forward a \"nonsafety rationale.\"  That should have been the end of the story, at least at this stage of the litigation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither the lead opinion nor the concurrence explain why this Court inquired into purpose in Pacific Gas but can dispense with that \"necessary\" step here, id., at 213; they just say the Court can.  See ante, at 8-9 (lead opinion); ante, at 10, n.\u00a02 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).  At one point, the lead opinion suggests that the AEA \"authorize[s]\" a purpose inquiry only when a state law \"comes close to trenching on core federal powers.\"  Ante, at 9.  But the opinion does not say where that rule comes from.  Certainly not the statute or our precedents.  And the lead opinion never explains why the safety concerns about nuclear plants in Pacific Gas are more \"core\" to the AEA than the safety concerns about uranium milling and tailings storage at issue here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The central argument from my colleagues appears to be that the AEA authorizes a purpose inquiry only when a State \"targets\" or \"seek[s] to regulate\" an activity that is also regulated by the federal statute.  Ante, at 6 (lead opinion); ante, at 10 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.). And because the Virginia statute seeks to regulate mining, the AEA \"does not authorize any judicial inquiry into state legislative purpose in this case.\"  Ante, at 8-9 (lead opinion); see ante, at 9-10 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).  But it is conceded that the mining ban was adopted because of radiological safety concerns about milling and tailings.  That is why Virginia argues, as it must, that its mining ban would not be preempted even if it expressly stated that it was enacted due to the Commonwealth's disagreement with the NRC's nuclear safety regulations.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 33.  If such a statute does not \"target\" or \"seek to regulate\" a preempted field, what would?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0States may try to regulate one activity by exercising their authority over another.  That is the whole point of the purpose inquiry mandated by Pacific Gas.  Indeed, Pacific Gas specifically \"emphasize[d]\" that the California law did not expressly seek to regulate \"the construction or operation of a nuclear powerplant,\" that is, the statute on its face was not directed at a preempted field.  461 U.\u00a0S., at 212.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The AEA's purpose inquiry is most useful precisely when the challenged state law does not purport to regulate a preempted field.  If a State disagrees with the AEA's nuclear safety regulations, and thus wants to block nuclear development within its borders, it has myriad ways to do so through its broad police powers.  Under the rule adopted by the lead opinion and the concurrence, so long as the State is not boneheaded enough to express its real purpose in the statute, the State will have free rein to subvert Congress's judgment on nuclear safety.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A State could, for instance, restrict the ability of a county to provide a nuclear facility with municipal services like law enforcement, fire protection, and garbage collection.  If it wanted to target investors, a State could eliminate limited liability for the stockholders of companies that operate nuclear facilities.  Although these examples may seem farfetched, they have already happened.  See Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians v. Nielson, 376 F.\u00a03d 1223, 1247-1248, 1250-1252 (CA10 2004).  In Skull Valley, however, the Tenth Circuit correctly applied our precedent and concluded that the \"state cannot use its authority to regulate law enforcement and other similar matters as a means of regulating radiological hazards.\"  Id., at 1248; see Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee, LLC v. Shumlin, 733 F.\u00a03d 393 (CA2 2013) (applying Pacific Gas and concluding that a state statute was a pretext for regulating radiological safety).  Neither the lead opinion nor the concurrence hazards an answer for cases like Skull Valley.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As these examples show, AEA preemption cannot turn on the label a State affixes to its regulations.  That approach would simply invite evasion, which is why we have rejected it in our preemption cases more generally.  For example, in National Meat Assn. v. Harris, 565 U.\u00a0S. 452 (2012), we addressed a preemption challenge involving slaughterhouses in California.  A federal statute preempted state regulation of slaughterhouses' front-end procedures for inspecting, handling, and slaughtering livestock.  California, however, had regulated the back-end operations of slaughterhouses by prohibiting the sale of meat from livestock that had not been inspected, handled, and slaughtered according to the State's regulations.  Id., at 455, 463-464.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the federal statute's preemption clause did \"not usually foreclose state regulation of the commercial sales activities of slaughterhouses,\" we unanimously held that California's sales regulation was preempted because it was a transparent attempt to circumvent federal law.  Id., at 463 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Concluding otherwise, we noted, would allow a State to \"impose any regulation on slaughterhouses just by framing it as a ban on the sale of meat produced in whatever way the State disapproved.\"  Id., at 464.  And that \"would make a mockery of the [federal statute's] preemption provision.\"  Ibid.; see also Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist., 541 U.\u00a0S. 246, 255 (2004) (stating that it \"would make no sense\" to allow a state regulation to evade preemption simply because it addressed the purchase, rather than manufacture, of a federally regulated product).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The concurrence argues that National Meat is distinguishable because there the State regulated a downstream, non-preempted activity (sale of meat) in an effort to regulate an upstream, preempted activity (processing of livestock).  Here, however, Virginia's regulation is upstream (mining) and the preempted activity is downstream (milling and tailings).  Ante, at 11.  That's true but beside the point.  Regardless whether the state regulation is downstream like National Meat, upstream like here and Pacific Gas, or entirely out of the stream like Skull Valley, States may not legislate with the purpose and effect of regulating a federally preempted field.4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That common sense approach is consistent with the text of the AEA, which recognizes that States continue to have authority \"to regulate activities for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.\"  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72021(k) (emphasis added).  The lead opinion finds this purpose-based approach discomfiting, citing the \"well-known conceptual and practical\" difficulties about inquiring into legislative motive.  Ante, at 13.  The statute and our precedent plainly require such an approach here, however, and the difficulty of the task does not permit us to choose an easier way.  I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0See, e.g., Chamber of Commerce of United States of America v. Whiting, 563 U.\u00a0S. 582, 594-595 (2011); Geier v.

Harris, 565 U.\u00a0S. 452 (2012), doesn't command a different result.  There, the Court merely enforced an express statutory preemption clause that prohibited States from setting standards for handling non-ambulatory pigs that differed from federal standards.  As we've seen, the AEA contains no comparable preemption clause forbidding Virginia to regulate mining in any way.  Admittedly, National Meat went on to say that a State could not enforce a preempted animal-handling standard indirectly by banning the sale of meat from non-ambulatory pigs if its law \"function[ed] as a command to slaughterhouses to structure their operations in the exact way\" state regulators desired rather than as federal standards required.  Id., at 464.  But here, by contrast, no one suggests that Virginia's mining law requires anyone to disregard NRC regulations.\nFootnote 4\u00a0The concurrence takes a slightly different tack.  It seems to accept the premise that the Court can divine the unenacted \"purposes\" and \"objectives\" underlying the AEA and weigh them against Virginia's mining law.  But in rejecting Virginia Uranium's argument, it winds up emphasizing repeatedly that the text of the AEA does not address mining.  See post, at 12-14.  That may not fully address Virginia Uranium's assertion that state mining regulations interfere with a latent statutory purpose lying beyond the text, but it does highlight the propriety of confining our inquiries to the statute's terms.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The District Court also dismissed the Commonwealth's Governor and several other state officials as defendants on the ground that the Eleventh Amendment barred suit against them.

But as Justice Gorsuch explains, PG&E\u00a0's inquiry into the purpose for which some state laws were enacted does not mean we must now extend that inquiry to all state laws.  Ante, at 10 (\"Being in for a dime doesn't mean we have to be in for a dollar.\").\nFootnote 3\u00a0Were a similar deposit found over the state line, the mining ban at issue would not prevent uranium ore mined in North Carolina from being milled, and the resulting tailings stored, in the Commonwealth.\nFootnote 4\u00a0The distinction drawn here does not turn, as the dissent misperceives, post, at 8, on whether the state-regulated activity is upstream or downstream of the federally preempted field.  The Commonwealth regulated an activity, conventional uranium mining, that Congress left to state regulation.  Again, nothing in the AEA shows that Congress intended to preempt such a law based on the purpose for which it was enacted.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0\"Does the AEA preempt a state law that on its face regulates an activity within its jurisdiction (here uranium mining), but has the purpose and effect of regulating the radiological safety hazards of activities entrusted to the NRC (here, the milling of uranium and the management of the resulting tailings)?\"  Pet. for Cert. i.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Oddly, the lead opinion and concurrence suggest that developing this site is unnecessary because domestic production accounts for less than ten percent of the uranium used in the country.  See ante, at 16-17 (lead opinion); ante, at 12-13 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment).  But given the critical role of uranium to the country's energy industry and national defense, the near complete reliance on foreign sources of uranium--including substantial imports from Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan--would seem to suggest just the opposite.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 353a (detailing foreign sources of uranium imports); 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72012(d) (\"The processing and utilization of source, byproduct, and special nuclear material must be regulated in the national interest and in order to provide for the common defense and security and to protect the health and safety of the public.\"); Energy Futures Initiatives, Inc., The U.\u00a0S. Nuclear Energy Enterprise: A Key National Security Enabler 18 (Aug. 2017) (\"A vibrant domestic nuclear energy industry, including a healthy supply chain .\u00a0.\u00a0. is essential for the achievement of U.\u00a0S. national security objectives.\").\nFootnote 3\u00a0As the lead opinion acknowledges, Virginia has thus far in the litigation accepted the company's claim that the actual purpose of the mining ban is to regulate the radiological safety of uranium milling and tailings storage.  See ante, at 11-12.  Virginia contends that if the case were to proceed past the pleadings stage, it could establish a nonsafety rationale for the ban.  See Brief for Respondents 47.  That may well be true.  See id., at 11 (discussing environmental concerns).  But for our purposes today, we must resolve the case on the terms that it has come to us.\nFootnote 4\u00a0In a footnote, the concurrence appears to reject its own analysis, stating that it makes no difference whether the state law is upstream or downstream of the federally preempted field.  See ante, at 11, n.\u00a04.  Instead, the concurrence contends, the difference is that here the Commonwealth \"regulated an activity, conventional uranium mining, that Congress left to state regulation.\"  Ibid.  But that is equally true in National Meat, where the State had likewise regulated an activity, the sale of meat, that Congress left to state regulation.  See 565 U.\u00a0S., at 463.  The concurrence and lead opinion also note that National Meat involved an \"express\" preemption provision whereas this case does not.  Ante, at 11, n.\u00a03 (lead opinion); ante, at 11 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).  But they do not explain why that matters, and there's no reason it should.  In both cases, the plaintiffs alleged that the State regulated an undisputedly non-preempted activity as an indirect means to regulate an undisputedly preempted activity.\n\n\n","66":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWALTER DANIEL, INDIVIDUALLY AND AS PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ESTATE OF REBEKAH DANIEL  v.

COUGAR DEN, INC.(2019)\nNo. 16-1498\nArgued: October 30, 2018Decided: March 19, 2019\n\n\nThe State of Washington taxes \"motor vehicle fuel importer[s]\" who bring large quantities of fuel into the State by \"ground transportation.\"  Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a782.36.010(4), (12), (16).  Respondent Cougar Den, Inc., a wholesale fuel importer owned by a member of the Yakama Nation, imports fuel from Oregon over Washington's public highways to the Yakama Reservation to sell to Yakama-owned retail gas stations located within the reservation.  In 2013, the Washington State Department of Licensing assessed Cougar Den $3.6 million in taxes, penalties, and licensing fees for importing motor vehicle fuel into the State.  Cougar Den appealed, arguing that the Washington tax, as applied to its activities, is pre-empted by an 1855 treaty between the United States and the Yakama Nation that, among other things, reserves the Yakamas' \"right, in common with citizens of the United States, to travel upon all public highways,\" 12 Stat. 953.  A Washington Superior Court held that the tax was pre-empted, and the Washington Supreme Court affirmed.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n188 Wash. 2d 55, 392 P. 3d 1014, affirmed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan, concluded that the 1855 treaty between the United States and the Yakama Nation pre-empts the State of Washington's fuel tax as applied to Cougar Den's importation of fuel by public highway.  Pp.\u00a04-18.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a) The Washington statute at issue here taxes the importation of fuel by public highway.  The Washington Supreme Court construed the statute that way in the decision below.  That court wrote that the statute \"taxes the importation of fuel, which is the transportation of fuel.\"  188 Wash. 2d 55, 69, 392 P. 3d 1014, 1020.  It added that \"travel on public highways is directly at issue because the tax [is] an importation tax.\"  Id., at 67, 392 P.\u00a03d, at 1019.  The incidence of a tax is a question of state law, Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Chickasaw Nation, 515 U.\u00a0S. 450, 461, and this Court is bound by the Washington Supreme Court's interpretation of Washington law, Johnson v. United States, 559 U.\u00a0S. 133, 138.  Nor is there any reason to doubt that the Washington Supreme Court meant what it said when it interpreted the statute.  In the statute's own words, Washington \"impose[s] upon motor vehicle fuel licensees,\" including \"licensed importer[s],\" a tax for \"each gallon of motor vehicle fuel\" that \"enters into this state,\" but only \"if . . . entry is\" by means of \"a railcar, trailer, truck, or other equipment suitable for ground transportation.\"  Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a782.36.010(4), 82.36.020(1), (2), 82.36.026(3).  Thus, Cougar Den owed the tax because Cougar Den traveled with fuel by public highway.  See App. 10a-26a; App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a.  Pp.\u00a04-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The State of Washington's application of the tax to Cougar Den's importation of fuel is pre-empted by the Yakama Nation's reservation of \"the right, in common with citizens of the United States, to travel upon all public highways.\"  This conclusion rests upon three considerations taken together.  First, this Court has considered this treaty four times previously; each time it has considered language very similar to the language now before the Court; and each time it has stressed that the language of the treaty should be understood as bearing the meaning that the Yakamas understood it to have in 1855.  See United States v. Winans, 198 U.\u00a0S. 371, 380-381; Seufert Brothers Co. v. United States, 249 U.\u00a0S. 194, 196-198; Tulee v. Washington, 315 U.\u00a0S. 681, 683-685; Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U.\u00a0S. 658, 677-678.  Thus, although the words \"in common with\" on their face could be read to permit application to the Yakamas of general legislation (like the legislation at issue here) that applies to all citizens, this Court has refused to read \"in common with\" in this way because that is not what the Yakamas understood the words to mean in 1855.  See Winans, 198 U.\u00a0S., at 379, 381; Seufert Brothers, 249 U.\u00a0S., at 198-199; Tulee, 315 U.\u00a0S., at 684; Fishing Vessel, 443 U.\u00a0S., at 679, 684-685.  Second, the historical record adopted by the agency and the courts below indicates that the treaty negotiations and the United States' representatives' statements to the Yakamas would have led the Yakamas to understand that the treaty's protection of the right to travel on the public highways included the right to travel with goods for purposes of trade.  Third, to impose a tax upon traveling with certain goods burdens that travel.  And the right to travel on the public highways without such burdens is just what the treaty protects.  Therefore, precedent tells the Court that the tax must be pre-empted.  In Tulee, for example, the fishing right reserved by the Yakamas in the treaty was held to pre-empt the application to the Yakamas of a state law requiring fishermen to buy fishing licenses.  315 U.\u00a0S., at 684.  The Court concluded that \"such exaction of fees as a prerequisite to the enjoyment of\" a right reserved in the treaty \"cannot be reconciled with a fair construction of the treaty.\"  Id., at 685.  If the cost of a fishing license interferes with the right to fish, so must a tax imposed on travel with goods (here fuel) interfere with the right to travel.  Pp.\u00a010-18.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch, joined by Justice Ginsburg, concluded that the 1855 treaty guarantees tribal members the right to move their goods, including fuel, to and from market freely.  When dealing with a tribal treaty, a court must \"give effect to the terms as the Indians themselves would have understood them.\"  Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U.\u00a0S. 172, 196.  The Yakamas' understanding of the terms of the 1855 treaty can be found in a set of unchallenged factual findings in Yakama Indian Nation v. Flores, 955 F.\u00a0Supp. 1229, which are binding here and sufficient to resolve this case.  They provide \"no evidence [suggesting] that the term 'in common with' placed Indians in the same category as non-Indians with respect to any tax or fee the latter must bear with respect to public roads.\"  Id., at 1247.  Instead, they suggest that the Yakamas understood the treaty's right-to-travel provision to provide them \"with the right to travel on all public highways without being subject to any licensing and permitting fees related to the exercise of that right while engaged in the transportation of tribal goods.\"  Id., at 1262.  A wealth of historical evidence confirms this understanding.  \"Far-reaching travel was an intrinsic ingredient in virtually every aspect of Yakama culture,\" and travel for purposes of trade was so important to their \"way of life that they could not have performed and functioned as a distinct culture\" without it.  Id., at 1238.  Everyone then understood that the treaty would protect the Yakamas' preexisting right to take goods to and from market freely throughout its traditional trading area.  The State reads the treaty only as a promise to tribal members of the right to venture out of their reservation and use the public highways like everyone else.  But the record shows that the consideration the Yakamas supplied--millions of acres desperately wanted by the United States to settle the Washington Territory--was worth far more than an abject promise they would not be made prisoners on their reservation.  This Court's cases interpreting the treaty's neighboring and parallel right-to-fish provision further confirm this understanding.  See, e.g., United States v. Winans, 198 U.\u00a0S. 371.

The question before us is whether an 1855 treaty between the United States and the Yakama Nation forbids the State of Washington to impose that tax upon fuel importers who are members of the Yakama Nation.  We conclude that it does, and we affirm the Washington Supreme Court's similar decision.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Washington statute applies to \"motor vehicle fuel importer[s]\" who bring large quantities of fuel into the State by \"ground transportation\" such as a \"railcar, trailer, [or] truck.\"  Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a782.36.010(4), (12), (16) (2012).  The statute requires each fuel importer to obtain a license, and it says that a fuel tax will be \"levied and imposed upon motor vehicle fuel licensees\" for \"each gallon of motor vehicle fuel\" that the licensee brings into the State.  \u00a7\u00a782.36.020(1), (2)(c).  Licensed fuel importers who import fuel by ground transportation become liable to pay the tax as of the time the \"fuel enters into this [S]tate.\"  \u00a782.36.020(2)(c); see also \u00a7\u00a782.38.020(4), (12), (15), (26), 82.38.030(1), (7)(c)(ii) (equivalent regulation of diesel fuel importers).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But only those licensed fuel importers who import fuel by ground transportation are liable to pay the tax.  \u00a7\u00a782.36.026(3), 82.36.020(2)(c).  For example, if a licensed fuel importer brings fuel into the State by pipeline, that fuel importer need not pay the tax.  \u00a7\u00a782.36.026(3), 82.36.020(2)(c)(ii), 82.36.010(3).  Similarly, if a licensed fuel importer brings fuel into the State by vessel, that fuel importer need not pay the tax.  \u00a7\u00a782.36.026(3), 82.36.020(2)(c)(ii), 82.36.010(3).  Instead, in each of those instances, the next purchaser or possessor of the fuel will pay the tax.  \u00a7\u00a782.36.020(2)(a), (b), (d). The only licensed fuel importers who must pay this tax are the fuel importers who bring fuel into the State by means of ground transportation.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The relevant treaty provides for the purchase by the United States of Yakama land.  See Treaty Between the United States and the Yakama Nation of Indians, June 9, 1855, 12 Stat. 951.  Under the treaty, the Yakamas granted to the United States approximately 10 million acres of land in what is now the State of Washington, i.e., about one-fourth of the land that makes up the State today.  Art.\u00a0I, id., at 951-952; see also Brief for Respondent 4, 9.  In return for this land, the United States paid the Yakamas $200,000, made improvements to the remaining Yakama land, such as building a hospital and schools for the Yakamas to use, and agreed to respect the Yakamas' reservation of certain rights.  Arts.\u00a0III-V, 12 Stat. 952-953.  Those reserved rights include \"the right, in common with citizens of the United States, to travel upon all public highways,\" \"the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places, in common with citizens of the Territory,\" and other rights, such as the right to hunt, to gather roots and berries, and to pasture cattle on open and unclaimed land.  Art.\u00a0III, id., at 953.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cougar Den, Inc., the respondent, is a wholesale fuel importer owned by a member of the Yakama Nation, incorporated under Yakama law, and designated by the Yakama Nation as its agent to obtain fuel for members of the Tribe.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a-64a; App. 99a.  Cougar Den buys fuel in Oregon, trucks the fuel over public highways to the Yakama Reservation in Washington, and then sells the fuel to Yakama-owned retail gas stations located within the reservation.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a, 55a.  Cougar Den believes that Washington's fuel import tax, as applied to Cougar Den's activities, is pre-empted  by the treaty.  App. 15a.  In particular, Cougar Den  believes that requiring it to pay the tax would infringe the Yakamas' reserved \"right, in common with citizens of the United States, to travel upon all public highways.\"  Art. III, 12 Stat. 953.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In December 2013, the Washington State Department of Licensing (Department), believing that the state tax was not pre-empted by the treaty, assessed Cougar Den $3.6 million in taxes, penalties, and licensing fees.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a; App. 10a.  Cougar Den appealed the assessment to higher authorities within the state agency.  App. 15a.  An Administrative Law Judge agreed with Cougar Den that the tax was pre-empted.  App. to Brief in Opposition 14a.  The Department's Director, however, disagreed and overturned the ALJ's order.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a.  A Washington Superior Court in turn disagreed with the director and held that the tax was pre-empted.  Id., at 34a.  The director appealed to the Washington Supreme Court.  188 Wash. 2d 55, 58, 392 P.\u00a03d 1014, 1015 (2017).  And that court, agreeing with Cougar Den, upheld the Superior Court's determination of pre-emption.  Id., at 69, 392 P.\u00a03d, at 1020.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Department filed a petition for certiorari asking us to review the State Supreme Court's determination.  And we agreed to do so.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Washington statute at issue here taxes the importation of fuel by public highway.  The Washington Supreme Court construed the statute that way in the decision below.  That court wrote that the statute \"taxes the importation of fuel, which is the transportation of fuel.\"  Ibid.  It added that \"travel on public highways is directly at issue because the tax [is] an importation tax.\"  Id., at 67, 392 P.\u00a03d, at 1019.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor is there any reason to doubt that the Washington Supreme Court means what it said when it interpreted the Washington statute.  We read the statute the same way.  In the statute's own words, Washington \"impose[s] upon motor vehicle fuel licensees,\" including \"licensed importer[s],\" a tax for \"each gallon of motor vehicle fuel\" that \"enters into this state,\" but only \"if .\u00a0.\u00a0. entry is\" by means of \"a railcar, trailer, truck, or other equipment suitable for ground transportation.\"  Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a782.36.010(4), 82.36.020(1), (2), 82.36.026(3).  As is true of most tax laws, the statute is long and complex, and it is easy to stumble over this technical language.  But if you are able to walk slowly through its provisions, the statute is easily followed.  We need take only five steps.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We start our journey at the beginning of the statute which first declares that \"[t]here is hereby levied and imposed upon motor vehicle fuel licensees, other than motor vehicle fuel distributors, a tax at the rate .\u00a0.\u00a0. provided in [the statute] on each gallon of motor vehicle fuel.\"  \u00a782.36.020(1).  That is simple enough.  Washington imposes a tax on a group of persons called \"motor vehicle fuel licensees\" for \"each gallon of motor vehicle fuel.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who are the \"motor vehicle fuel licensees\" that Washington taxes?  We take a second step to find out.  As the definitions section of the statute explains, the \"motor vehicle fuel licensees\" upon whom the tax is imposed are \"person[s] holding a .\u00a0.\u00a0. motor vehicle fuel importer, motor vehicle fuel exporter, motor vehicle fuel blender, motor vehicle distributor, or international fuel tax agreement license.\"  \u00a782.36.010(12).  This, too, is easy to grasp.  Not everyone who possesses motor vehicle fuel owes the tax.  Instead, only motor vehicle fuel importers (and other similar movers and shakers within the motor vehicle fuel industry) who are licensed by the State to deal in fuel, must pay the tax.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But must each of these motor vehicle fuel licensees pay the tax, so that the fuel is taxed as it passes from blender, to importer, to exporter, and so on?  We take a third step, and learn that the answer is \"no.\"  As the statute explains, \"the tax shall be imposed at the time and place of the first taxable event and upon the first taxable person within this state.\"  \u00a782.36.022.  Reading that, we understand that only the first licensee who can be taxed, will be taxed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, we ask, who is the first taxable licensee?  Who must actually pay this tax?  We take a fourth step to find out.  Logic tells us that the first licensee who can be taxed will likely be the licensee who brings fuel into the State.  But, the statute tells us that a \"licensed importer\" is \"liable for and [must] pay tax to the department\" when \"[m]otor vehicle fuel enters into this state if .\u00a0.\u00a0. [t]he entry is not by bulk transfer.\"  \u00a7\u00a782.36.020(2)(c), 82.36.026(3) (emphasis added).  That is, a licensed importer can only be the first taxable licensee (and therefore the licensee that must pay the tax) if the importer brings fuel into the State by a method other than \"bulk transfer.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But what is \"bulk transfer\"?  What does it mean to say that licensed fuel importers need only pay the tax if they do not bring in fuel by \"bulk transfer\"?  We take a fifth, and final, step to find out.  \"[B]ulk transfer,\" the definitions section explains, \"means a transfer of motor vehicle fuel by pipeline or vessel,\" as opposed to \"railcar, trailer, truck, or other equipment suitable for ground transportation.\"  \u00a7\u00a782.36.010(3), (4).  So, we learn that if the licensed fuel importer brings fuel into the State by ground transportation, then the fuel importer owes the tax.  But if the licensed fuel importer brings fuel into the State by pipeline or vessel, then the importer will not be the first taxable person to possess the fuel, and he will not owe the tax.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, Washington taxes travel by ground transportation with fuel.  That feature sets the Washington statute apart from other statutes with which we are more familiar.  It is not a tax on possession or importation.  A statute that taxes possession would ordinarily require all people who own a good to pay the tax.  A good example of that would be a State's real estate property tax.  That statute would require all homeowners to pay the tax, every year, regardless of the specifics of their situation.  And a statute that taxes importation would ordinarily require all people who bring a good into the State to pay a tax.  A good example of that would be a federal tax on newly manufactured cars.  That statute would ordinarily require all people who bring a new car into the country to pay a tax.  But Washington's statute is different because it singles out ground transportation.  That is, Washington does not just tax possession of fuel, or even importation of fuel, but instead taxes importation by ground transportation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The facts of this case provide a good example of the tax in operation.  Each of the assessment orders that the Department sent to Cougar Den explained that Cougar Den owed the tax because Cougar Den traveled by highway.  See App. 10a-26a; App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a.  As the director explained, Cougar Den owed the tax because Cougar Den had caused fuel to enter \"into this [S]tate at the Washington-Oregon boundary on the Highway 97 bridge\" by means of a \"tank truck\" destined for \"the Yakama Reservation.\"  Ibid.  The director offers this explanation in addition to quoting the quantity of fuel that Cougar Den possessed because the element of travel by ground transportation is a necessary prerequisite to the imposition of the tax.  Put another way, the State must prove that Cougar Den traveled by highway in order to apply its tax.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are not convinced by the arguments raised to the contrary.  The Department claims, and The Chief Justice agrees, that the state tax has little or nothing to do with the treaty because it is not a tax on travel with fuel but rather a tax on the possession of fuel.  See Brief for Petitioner 26-28; post, at 5 (dissenting opinion).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We cannot accept that characterization of the tax, however, for the Washington Supreme Court has authoritatively held that the statute is a tax on travel.  The Washington Supreme Court held that the Washington law at issue here \"taxes the importation of fuel, which is the transportation of fuel.\"  188 Wash. 2d, at 69, 392 P.\u00a03d, at 1020.  It added that \"travel on public highways is directly at issue because the tax [is] an importation tax.\"  Id., at 67, 392 P.\u00a03d, at 1019.  In so doing, the State Supreme Court heard, considered, and rejected the construction of the fuel tax that the Department advances here.  See ibid., 392 P.\u00a03d, at 1019 (\"The Department argues, and the director agreed, that the taxes are assessed based on incidents of ownership or possession of fuel, and not incident to use of or travel on the roads or highways.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The Department's argument is unpersuasive.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Here, travel on public highways is directly at issue because the tax was an importation tax\").  The incidence of a tax is a question of state law, Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Chickasaw Nation, 515 U.\u00a0S. 450, 461 (1995), and this Court is bound by the Washington Supreme Court's interpretation of Washington law, Johnson v. United States, 559 U.\u00a0S. 133, 138 (2010).  We decline the Department's invitation to overstep the bounds of our authority and construe the tax to mean what the Washington Supreme Court has said it does not.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor would it make sense to construe the tax's incidence differently.  The Washington Supreme Court's conclusion follows directly from its (and our) interpretation of how the tax operates.  See supra, at 4-7.  To be sure, it is generally true that fuel imported into the State by trucks driving the public highways can also be described as fuel that is possessed for the first time in the State.  But to call the Washington statute a tax on \"first possession\" would give the law an over-inclusive label.  As explained at length above, there are several ways in which a company could be a \"first possessor\" of fuel without incurring the tax.  See ibid.  For example, Cougar Den would not owe the tax had Cougar Den \"first possessed\" fuel by piping fuel from out of State into a Washington refinery.  First possession is not taxed if the fuel is brought into the State by pipeline and bound for a refinery.  \u00a7\u00a782.36.026(3), 82.36.020(2)(c)(ii), 82.36.010(3).  Similarly, Cougar Den would not owe the tax had Cougar Den \"first possessed\" fuel by bringing fuel into Washington through its waterways rather than its highways.  First possession is not taxed if the fuel is brought into the State by vessel.  \u00a7\u00a782.36.026(3), 82.36.020(2)(c)(ii), 82.36.010(3).  Thus, it seems rather clear that the tax cannot accurately be described as a tax on the first possession of fuel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But even if the contrary were true, the tax would still have the practical effect of burdening the Yakamas' travel.  Here, the Yakamas' lone off-reservation act within the State is traveling along a public highway with fuel.  The tax thus operates on the Yakamas exactly like a tax on transportation would: It falls upon them only because they happened to transport goods on a highway while en route to their reservation.  And it is the practical effect of the state law that we have said makes the difference.  We held, for instance, that the fishing rights reserved in the treaty pre-empted the State's enforcement of a trespass law against Yakama fishermen crossing private land to access the river.  See, e.g., United States v. Winans, 198 U.\u00a0S. 371, 381 (1905).  That was so even though the trespass law was not limited to those who trespass in order to fish but applied more broadly to any trespasser.  Put another way, it mattered not that the tax was \"on\" trespassing rather than fishing because the tax operated upon the Yakamas when they were exercising their treaty-protected right.  Ibid.; see also Tulee v. Washington, 315 U.\u00a0S. 681, 685 (1942) (holding that the fishing rights reserved in the treaty pre-empted the State's application of a fishing licensing fee to a Yakama fisherman, even though the fee also applied to types of fishing not practiced by the Yakamas).  And this approach makes sense.  When the Yakamas bargained in the treaty to protect their right to travel, they could only have cared about preventing the State from burdening their exercise of that right.  To the Yakamas, it is thus irrelevant whether the State's tax might apply to other activities beyond transportation.  The only relevant question is whether the tax \"act[ed] upon the Indians as a charge for exercising the very right their ancestors intended to reserve.\"  Tulee, 315 U.\u00a0S., at 685.  And the State's tax here acted upon Cougar Den in exactly that way.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the same reason, we are unpersuaded by the Department's insistence that it adopted this tax after a District Court, applying this Court's decision in Chickasaw Nation, barred the State from taxing the sale of fuel products on tribal land.  See Brief for Petitioner 6-7; Squaxin Island Tribe v. Stephens, 400 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 1250, 1262 (WD Wash. 2005).  Although a State \"generally is free to amend its law to shift the tax's legal incidence,\" Chickasaw Nation, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 460, it may not burden a treaty-protected right in the process, as the State has done here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, we must turn to the question whether this fuel tax, falling as it does upon members of the Tribe who travel on the public highways, violates the treaty.\nIII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In our view, the State of Washington's application of the fuel tax to Cougar Den's importation of fuel is pre-empted by the treaty's reservation to the Yakama Nation of \"the right, in common with citizens of the United States, to travel upon all public highways.\"  We rest this conclusion upon three considerations taken together.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, this Court has considered this treaty four times previously; each time it has considered language very similar to the language before us; and each time it has stressed that the language of the treaty should be understood as bearing the meaning that the Yakamas understood it to have in 1855.  See Winans, 198 U.\u00a0S., at 380-381; Seufert Brothers Co. v. United States, 249 U.\u00a0S. 194, 196-198 (1919); Tulee, 315 U.\u00a0S., at 683-685; Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U.\u00a0S. 658, 677-678 (1979).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The treaty language at issue in each of the four cases is similar, though not identical, to the language before us.  The cases focus upon language that guarantees to the Yakamas \"the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places, in common with citizens of the Territory.\"  Art.\u00a0III, para. 2, 12 Stat. 953.  Here, the language guarantees to the Yakamas \"the right, in common with citizens of the United States, to travel upon all public highways.\"  Art.\u00a0III, para. 1, ibid.  The words \"in common with\" on their face could be read to permit application to the Yakamas of general legislation (like the legislation before us) that applies to all citizens, Yakama and non-Yakama alike.  But this Court concluded the contrary because that is not what the Yakamas understood the words to mean in 1855.  See Winans, 198 U.\u00a0S., at 379, 381; Seufert Brothers, 249 U.\u00a0S., at 198-199; Tulee, 315 U.\u00a0S., at 684; Fishing Vessel, 443 U.\u00a0S., at 679, 684-685.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The cases base their reasoning in part upon the fact that the treaty negotiations were conducted in, and the treaty was written in, languages that put the Yakamas at a significant disadvantage.  See, e.g., Winans, 198 U.\u00a0S., at 380; Seufert Brothers, 249 U.\u00a0S., at 198; Fishing Vessel, 443 U.\u00a0S., at 667, n.\u00a010.  The parties negotiated the treaty in Chinook jargon, a trading language of about 300 words that no Tribe used as a primary language.  App. 65a; Fishing Vessel, 443 U.\u00a0S., at 667, n.\u00a010.  The parties memorialized the treaty in English, a language that the Yakamas could neither read nor write.  And many of the representations that the United States made about the treaty had no adequate translation in the Yakamas' own language.  App. 68a-69a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, in the year 1905, in Winans, this Court wrote that, to interpret the treaty, courts must focus upon the historical context in which it was written and signed.  198 U.\u00a0S., at 381; see also Tulee, 315 U.\u00a0S., at 684 (\"It is our responsibility to see that the terms of the treaty are carried out, so far as possible, in accordance with the meaning they were understood to have by the tribal representatives at the council\"); cf. Water Splash, Inc. v. Menon, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 8) (noting that, to ascertain the meaning of a treaty, courts \"may look beyond the written words to the history of the treaty, the negotiations, and the practical construction adopted by the parties\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court added, in light of the Yakamas' understanding in respect to the reservation of fishing rights, the treaty words \"in common with\" do not limit the reservation's scope to a right against discrimination.  Winans, 198 U.\u00a0S., at 380-381.  Instead, as we explained in Tulee, Winans held that \"Article III [of the treaty] conferred upon the Yakimas continuing rights, beyond those which other citizens may enjoy, to fish at their 'usual and accustomed places' in the ceded area.\"  Tulee, 315 U.\u00a0S., at 684 (citing Winans, 198 U.\u00a0S. 371; emphasis added).  Also compare, e.g., Fishing Vessel, 443 U.\u00a0S., at 677, n.\u00a022 (\"Whatever opportunities the treaties assure Indians with respect to fish are admittedly not 'equal' to, but are to some extent greater than, those afforded other citizens\" (emphasis added)), with post, at 4 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (citing this same footnote in Fishing Vessel as support for the argument that the treaty guarantees the Yakamas only a right against discrimination).  Construing the treaty as giving the Yakamas only antidiscrimination rights, rights that any inhabitant of the territory would have, would amount to \"an impotent outcome to negotiations and a convention, which seemed to promise more and give the word of the Nation for more.\"  Winans, 198 U.\u00a0S., at 380.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the historical record adopted by the agency and the courts below indicates that the right to travel includes a right to travel with goods for sale or distribution.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a; App. 56a-74a.  When the United States and the Yakamas negotiated the treaty, both sides emphasized that the Yakamas needed to protect their freedom to travel so that they could continue to fish, to hunt, to gather food, and to trade.  App. 65a-66a.  The Yakamas maintained fisheries on the Columbia River, following the salmon runs as the fish moved through Yakama territory.  Id., at 62a-63a.  The Yakamas traveled to the nearby plains region to hunt buffalo.  Id., at 61a.  They traveled to the mountains to gather berries and roots.  Ibid.  The Yakamas' religion and culture also depended on certain goods, such as buffalo byproducts and shellfish, which they could often obtain only through trade.  Id., at 61a-62a.  Indeed, the Yakamas formed part of a great trading network that stretched from the Indian tribes on the Northwest coast of North America to the plains tribes to the east.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States' representatives at the treaty negotiations well understood these facts, including the importance of travel and trade to the Yakamas.  Id., at 63a.  They repeatedly assured the Yakamas that under the treaty the Yakamas would be able to travel outside their reservation on the roads that the United States built.  Id., at 66a-67a; see also, e.g., id., at 66a (\"\u00a0'[W]e give you the privilege of traveling over roads'\u00a0\").  And the United States repeatedly assured the Yakamas that they could travel along the roads for trading purposes.  Id., at 65a-67a.  Isaac Stevens, the Governor of the Washington Territory, told the Yakamas, for example, that, under the terms of the treaty, \"You will be allowed to go on the roads, to take your things to market, your horses and cattle.\"  App. to Brief for Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation as Amicus Curiae 68a (record of the treaty proceedings).  He added that the Yakamas \"will be allowed to go to the usual fishing places and fish in common with the whites, and to get roots and berries and to kill game on land not occupied by the whites; all this outside the Reservation.\"  Ibid.  Governor Stevens further urged the Yakamas to accept the United States' proposals for reservation boundaries in part because the proposal put the Yakama Reservation in close proximity to public highways that would facilitate trade.  He said, \"\u00a0'You will be near the great road and can take your horses and your cattle down the river and to the [Puget] Sound to market.'\u00a0\"  App. 66a.  In a word, the treaty negotiations and the United States' representatives' statements to the Yakamas would have led the Yakamas to understand that the treaty's protection of the right to travel on the public highways included the right to travel with goods for purposes of trade.  We consequently so construe the relevant treaty provision.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, to impose a tax upon traveling with certain goods burdens that travel.  And the right to travel on the public highways without such burdens is, as we have said, just what the treaty protects.  Therefore, our precedents tell us that the tax must be pre-empted.  In Tulee, for example, we held that the fishing right reserved by the Yakamas in the treaty pre-empted the application to the Yakamas of a state law requiring fishermen to buy fishing licenses.  315 U.\u00a0S., at 684.  We concluded that \"such exaction of fees as a prerequisite to the enjoyment of\u00a0\" a right reserved in the treaty \"cannot be reconciled with a fair construction of the treaty.\"  Id., at 685.  If the cost of a fishing license interferes with the right to fish, so must a tax imposed on travel with goods (here fuel) interfere with the right to travel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We consequently conclude that Washington's fuel tax \"acts upon the Indians as a charge for exercising the very right their ancestors intended to reserve.\"  Ibid.  Washington's fuel tax cannot lawfully be assessed against Cougar Den on the facts here.  Treaties with federally recognized Indian tribes--like the treaty at issue here--constitute federal law that pre-empts conflicting state law as applied to off-reservation activity by Indians.  Cf. Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U.\u00a0S. 145, 148-149 (1973).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Again, we are not convinced by the arguments raised to the contrary.  The Chief Justice concedes that \"the right to travel with goods is just an application of the Yakamas' right to travel.\" Post, at 2 (dissenting opinion); see also ibid. (\"It ensures that the Yakamas enjoy the same privileges when they travel with goods as when they travel without them.\").  But he nevertheless insists that, because of the way in which the Washington statute taxes fuel, the statute does not interfere with the right to travel reserved by the Yakamas in the treaty.  Post, at 3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, The Chief Justice finds it significant that \"[t]he tax is calculated per gallon of fuel; not, like a toll, per vehicle or distance traveled.\"  Ibid., see also ibid. (\"The tax before us does not resemble a blockade or a toll\").  But that argument fails on its own terms.  A toll on highway travel is no less a toll when the toll varies based on the number of axels on a vehicle traveling the highway, or on the number of people traveling in the vehicle.  We cannot, therefore, see why the number of gallons of fuel that the vehicle carries should make all the difference.  Put another way, the fact that a tax on travel varies based on the features of that travel does not mean that the tax is not a tax on travel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, The Chief Justice argues that it \"makes no sense,\" for example, to hold that \"a tax on certain luxury goods\" that is assessed the first time the goods are possessed in Washington cannot apply to a Yakama member \"who buys\" a mink coat \"over the state line in Portland and then drives back to the reservation,\" but the tax can apply to a Yakama member who \"buys a mink coat at an off-reservation store in Washington.\"  Post, at 4.  The short, conclusive answer to this argument is that there is a treaty that forbids taxing Yakama travel on highways with goods (e.g., fuel, or even furs) for market; and there is no treaty that forbids taxing Yakama off-reservation purchases of goods.  Indeed, if our precedents supported The Chief Justice's rule, then our fishing rights cases would have turned on whether Washington also taxed fish purchased in the grocery store.  Compare, e.g., Tulee, 315 U.\u00a0S., at 682, n.\u00a01 (holding that the fishing right reserved by the Yakamas in the treaty pre-empted the application to the Yakamas of a state law which prohibited \"\u00a0'catch[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0. fish for food'\u00a0\" without having purchased a license).  But in those cases, we did not look to whether fish were taxed elsewhere in Washington.  That is because the treaty does not protect the Yakamas from state sales taxes imposed on the off-reservation sale of goods.  Instead, the treaty protects the Yakamas' right to travel the public highways without paying state taxes on that activity, much like the treaty protects the Yakamas' right to fish without paying state taxes on that activity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, The Chief Justice argues that only a law that \"punished or charged the Yakamas\" for an \"integral feature\" of a treaty right could be pre-empted by the treaty.  Post, at 6.  But that is true of the Washington statute at issue here.  The treaty protects the right to travel with goods, see supra, at 10-14, and the Washington statute taxes travel with goods, see supra, at 4-7.  Therefore, the statute charges the Yakamas for an \"integral feature\" of a treaty right.  But even if the statute indirectly burdened a treaty right, under our precedents, the statute would still be pre-empted.  One of the Washington statutes at issue in Winans was not a fishing regulation, but instead a trespassing statute.  That trespassing statute indirectly burdened the right to fish by preventing the Yakamas from crossing privately owned land so that the Yakamas could reach their traditional fishing places and camp on that private property during the fishing season.  See 198 U.\u00a0S., at 380-381.  It cannot be true that a law prohibiting trespassing imposed a burden on the right to fish that is \"integral\" enough to be pre-empted by the treaty, while a law taxing goods carried to the reservation on the public highway imposes a burden on the right to travel that is too attenuated to be pre-empted by the treaty.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although we hold that the treaty protects the right to travel on the public highway with goods, we do not say or imply that the treaty grants protection to carry any and all goods.  Nor do we hold that the treaty deprives the State of the power to regulate, say, when necessary for conservation.  To the contrary, we stated in Tulee that, although the treaty \"forecloses the [S]tate from charging the Indians a fee of the kind in question here,\" the State retained the \"power to impose on Indians, equally with others, such restrictions of a purely regulatory nature .\u00a0.\u00a0. as are necessary for the conservation of fish.\"  315 U.\u00a0S., at 684.  Indeed, it was crucial to our decision in Tulee that, although the licensing fees at issue were \"regulatory as well as revenue producing,\" \"their regulatory purpose could be accomplished otherwise,\" and \"the imposition of license fees [was] not indispensable to the effectiveness of a state conservation program.\"  Id., at 685.  See also Puyallup Tribe v. Department of Game of Wash., 391 U.\u00a0S. 392, 402, n.\u00a014 (1968) (\"As to a 'regulation' concerning the time and manner of fishing outside the reservation (as opposed to a 'tax'), we said that the power of the State was to be measured by whether it was 'necessary for the conservation of fish'\u00a0\" (quoting Tulee, 315 U.\u00a0S., at 684)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor do we hold that the treaty deprives the State of the power to regulate to prevent danger to health or safety occasioned by a tribe member's exercise of treaty rights.  The record of the treaty negotiations may not support the contention that the Yakamas expected to use the roads entirely unconstrained by laws related to health or safety.  See App. to Brief for Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation as Amicus Curiae 20a-21a, 31a-32a.  Governor Stevens explained, at length, the United States' awareness of crimes committed by United States citizens who settled amongst the Yakamas, and the United States' intention to enact laws that would restrain both the  United States citizens and the Yakamas alike for the safety of both groups.  See id., at 31a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor do we here interpret the treaty as barring the State from collecting revenue through sales or use taxes (applied outside the reservation).  Unlike the tax at issue here, which applies explicitly to transport by \"railcar, trailer, truck, or other equipment suitable for ground transportation,\" see supra, at\u00a06, a sales or use tax normally applies irrespective of transport or its means.  Here, however, we deal with a tax applicable simply to importation by ground transportation.  Moreover, it is a tax designed to secure revenue that, as far as the record shows here, the State might obtain in other ways.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To summarize, our holding rests upon three propositions: First, a state law that burdens a treaty-protected right is pre-empted by the treaty.  See supra, at 14-18.  Second, the treaty protects the Yakamas' right to travel on the public highway with goods for sale.  See supra, at 10-14.  Third, the Washington statute at issue here taxes the Yakamas for traveling with fuel by public highway.  See supra, at 4-10.  For these three reasons, Washington's fuel tax cannot lawfully be assessed against Cougar Den on the facts here.  Therefore, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington is affirmed.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nGorsuch, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002586 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 16-1498\nWASHINGTON STATE DEPARTMENT OF LICENSING, PETITIONER v. COUGAR DEN, INC.\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of washington\n[March 19, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Yakamas have lived in the Pacific Northwest for centuries.  In 1855, the United States sought and won a treaty in which the Tribe agreed to surrender 10 million acres, land that today makes up nearly a quarter of the State of Washington.  In return, the Yakamas received a reservation and various promises, including a guarantee that they would enjoy \"the right, in common with citizens of the United States, to travel upon all public highways.\"  Today, the parties offer dueling interpretations of this language.  The State argues that it merely allows the Yakamas to travel on public highways like everyone else.  And because everyone else importing gasoline from out of State by highway must pay a tax on that good, so must tribal members.  Meanwhile, the Tribe submits that the treaty guarantees tribal members the right to move their goods to and from market freely.  So that tribal members may bring goods, including gasoline, from an out-of-state market to sell on the reservation without incurring taxes along the way.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our job here is a modest one.  We are charged with adopting the interpretation most consistent with the treaty's original meaning.  Eastern Airlines, Inc. v. Floyd, 499 U.\u00a0S. 530, 534-535 (1991).  When we're dealing with a tribal treaty, too, we must \"give effect to the terms as the Indians themselves would have understood them.\"  Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U.\u00a0S. 172, 196 (1999).  After all, the United States drew up this contract, and we normally construe any ambiguities against the drafter who enjoys the power of the pen.  Nor is there any question that the government employed that power to its advantage in this case.  During the negotiations \"English words were translated into Chinook jargon .\u00a0.\u00a0. although that was not the primary language\" of the Tribe.  Yakama Indian Nation v. Flores, 955 F.\u00a0Supp. 1229, 1243 (ED Wash. 1997).  After the parties reached agreement, the U.\u00a0S. negotiators wrote the treaty in English--a language that the Yakamas couldn't read or write.  And like many such treaties, this one was by all accounts more nearly imposed on the Tribe than a product of its free choice.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When it comes to the Yakamas' understanding of the treaty's terms in 1855, we have the benefit of a set of unchallenged factual findings.  The findings come from a separate case involving the Yakamas' challenge to certain restrictions on their logging operations.  Id., at 1231.  The state Superior Court relied on these factual findings in this case and held Washington collaterally estopped from challenging them.  Because the State did not challenge the Superior Court's estoppel ruling either in the Washington Supreme Court or here, these findings are binding on us as well.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They also tell us all we need to know to resolve this case.  To some modern ears, the right to travel in common with others might seem merely a right to use the roads subject to the same taxes and regulations as everyone else.  Post, at 1-2 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).  But that is not how the Yakamas understood the treaty's terms.  To the Yakamas, the phrase \"\u00a0'in common with' .\u00a0.\u00a0. implie[d] that the Indian and non-Indian use [would] be joint but [did] not imply that the Indian use [would] be in any way restricted.\"  Yakama Indian Nation, 955 F.\u00a0Supp., at 1265.  In fact, \"[i]n the Yakama language, the term 'in common with' .\u00a0.\u00a0. suggest[ed] public use or general use without restriction.\"  Ibid.  So \"[t]he most the Indians would have understood .\u00a0.\u00a0. of the term[s] 'in common with' and 'public' was that they would share the use of the road with whites.\"  Ibid.  Significantly, there is \"no evidence [to] sugges[t] that the term 'in common with' placed Indians in the same category as non-Indians with respect to any tax or fee the latter must bear with respect to public roads.\"  Id., at 1247.  Instead, the evidence suggests that the Yakamas understood the right-to-travel provision to provide them \"with the right to travel on all public highways without being subject to any licensing and permitting fees related to the exercise of that right while engaged in the transportation of tribal goods.\"  Id., at 1262.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying these factual findings to our case requires a ruling for the Yakamas.  As the Washington Supreme Court recognized, the treaty's terms permit regulations that allow the Yakamas and non-Indians to share the road in common and travel along it safely together.  But they do not permit encumbrances on the ability of tribal members to bring their goods to and from market.  And by everyone's admission, the state tax at issue here isn't about facilitating peaceful coexistence of tribal members and non-Indians on the public highways.  It is about taxing a good as it passes to and from market--exactly what the treaty forbids.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A wealth of historical evidence confirms this understanding.  The Yakama Indian Nation decision supplies an admirably rich account of the history, but it is enough to recount just some of the most salient details.  \"Prior to and at the time the treaty was negotiated,\" the Yakamas \"engaged in a system of trade and exchange with other plateau tribes\" and tribes \"of the Northwest coast and plains of Montana and Wyoming.\"  Ibid.  This system came with no restrictions; the Yakamas enjoyed \"free and open access to trade networks in order to maintain their system of trade and exchange.\"  Id., at 1263.  They traveled to Oregon and maybe even to California to trade \"fir trees, lava rocks, horses, and various species of salmon.\"  Id., at 1262-1263.  This extensive travel \"was necessary to obtain goods that were otherwise unavailable to [the Yakamas] but important for sustenance and religious purposes.\"  Id., at 1262.  Indeed, \"far-reaching travel was an intrinsic ingredient in virtually every aspect of Yakama culture.\"  Id., at 1238.  Travel for purposes of trade was so important to the \"Yakamas' way of life that they could not have performed and functioned as a distinct culture .\u00a0.\u00a0. without extensive travel.\"  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Everyone understood that the treaty would protect the Yakamas' preexisting right to take goods to and from market freely throughout their traditional trading area.  \"At the treaty negotiations, a primary concern of the Indians was that they have freedom to move about to .\u00a0.\u00a0. trade.\"  Id., at 1264.  Isaac Stevens, the Governor of the Washington Territory, specifically promised the Yakamas that they would \"\u00a0'be allowed to go on the roads to take [their] things to market.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 1244 (emphasis deleted).  Governor Stevens called this the \"\u00a0'same libert[y]'\u00a0\" to travel with goods free of restriction \"\u00a0'outside the reservation'\u00a0\" that the Tribe would enjoy within the new reservation's boundaries.  Ibid.  Indeed, the U.\u00a0S. representatives' \"statements regarding the Yakama's use of the public highways to take their goods to market clearly and without ambiguity promised the Yakamas the use of public highways without restriction for future trading endeavors.\"  Id., at 1265.  Before the treaty, then, the Yakamas traveled extensively without paying taxes to bring goods to and from market, and the record suggests that the Yakamas would have understood the treaty to preserve that liberty.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0None of this can come as much of a surprise.  As the State reads the treaty, it promises tribal members only the right to venture out of their reservation and use the public highways like everyone else.  But the record shows that the consideration the Yakamas supplied was worth far more than an abject promise they would not be made prisoners on their reservation.  In fact, the millions of acres the Tribe ceded were a prize the United States desperately wanted.  U.\u00a0S. treaty negotiators were \"under tremendous pressure to quickly negotiate treaties with eastern Washington tribes, because lands occupied by those tribes were important in settling the Washington territory.\"  Id., at 1240.  Settlers were flooding into the Pacific Northwest and building homesteads without any assurance of lawful title.  The government needed \"to obtain title to Indian lands\" to place these settlements on a more lawful footing.  Ibid.  The government itself also wanted to build \"wagon and military roads through Yakama lands to provide access to the settlements on the west side of the Cascades.\"  Ibid.  So \"obtaining Indian lands east of the Cascades became a central objective\" for the government's own needs.  Id., at 1241.  The Yakamas knew all this and could see the writing on the wall: One way or another, their land would be taken.  If they managed to extract from the negotiations the simple right to take their goods freely to and from market on the public highways, it was a price the United States was more than willing to pay.  By any fair measure, it was a bargain-basement deal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our cases interpreting the treaty's neighboring and parallel right-to-fish provision further confirm this understanding.  The treaty \"secure[s] .\u00a0.\u00a0. the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places, in common with citizens of the Territory.\"  Treaty Between the United States and the Yakama Nation of Indians, Art. III, June 9, 1855, 12 Stat. 953 (emphasis added).  Initially, some suggested this guaranteed tribal members only the right to fish according to the same regulations and subject to the same fees as non-Indians.  But long ago this Court refused to impose such an \"impotent\" construction on the treaty.  United States v. Winans, 198 U.\u00a0S. 371, 380 (1905).  Instead, the Court held that the treaty language prohibited state officials from imposing many nondiscriminatory fees and regulations on tribal members.  While such laws \"may be both convenient and, in [their] general impact, fair,\" this Court observed, they act \"upon the Indians as a charge for exercising the very right their ancestors intended to reserve.\"  Tulee v. Washington, 315 U.\u00a0S. 681, 685 (1942).  Interpreting the same treaty right in Winans, we held that, despite arguments otherwise, \"the phrase 'in common with citizens of the Territory'\u00a0\" confers \"upon the Yak[a]mas continuing rights, beyond those which other citizens may enjoy, to fish at their 'usual and accustomed places.'\u00a0\"  Tulee, 315 U.\u00a0S., at 684 (citing Winans, 198 U.\u00a0S., at 371; emphasis added).  Today, we simply recognize that the same language should yield the same result.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With its primary argument now having failed, the State encourages us to labor through a series of backups.  It begins by pointing out that the treaty speaks of allowing the Tribe \"free access\" from local roads to the public highways, but indicates that tribal members are to use those highways \"in common with\" non-Indians.  On the State's account, these different linguistic formulations must be given different meanings.  And the difference the State proposes?  No surprise: It encourages us to read the former language as allowing goods to be moved tax-free along local roads to the highways but the latter language as authorizing taxes on the Yakamas' goods once they arrive there.  See also post, at 3 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trouble is that nothing in the record supports this interpretation.  Uncontested factual findings reflect the Yakamas' understanding that the treaty would allow them to use the highways to bring goods to and from market freely.  These findings bind us under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, and no one has proposed any lawful basis for ignoring them.  Nor, for that matter, has anyone even tried to offer a reason why the Tribe might have bargained for the right to move its goods freely only part of the way to market.  Our job in this case is to interpret the treaty as the Yakamas originally understood it in 1855--not in light of new lawyerly glosses conjured up for litigation a continent away and more than 150 years after the fact.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If that alternative won't work, the State offers another.  It admits that the Yakamas personally may have a right to travel the highways free of most restrictions on their movement.  See also post, at 3 (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting) (acknowledging that the treaty prohibits the State from \"charg[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0. a toll\" on Yakamas traveling on the highway).  But, the State continues, the law at issue here doesn't offend that right.  It doesn't, we are told, because the \"object\" of the State's tax isn't travel but the possession of fuel; the fact that the State happens to assess its tax when fuel is possessed on a public highway rather than someplace else is neither here nor there.  And just look, we are told, at the anomalies that might arise if we ruled otherwise.  A tribal member who buys a \"mink coat\" in a Washington store would have to pay the State's sales tax, but a tribal member who purchases the same coat at market in Oregon could not be taxed for possessing it  on the highway when reentering Washington.  See post,  at 2-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This argument suffers from much the same problem as its predecessors.  Now, at least, the State may acknowledge that the Yakamas personally have a right to travel free of most restrictions.  But the State still fails to give full effect to the treaty's terms and the Yakamas' original understanding of them.  After all and as we've seen, the treaty doesn't just guarantee tribal members the right to travel on the highways free of most restrictions on their movement; it also guarantees tribal members the right to move goods freely to and from market using those highways.  And it's impossible to transport goods without possessing them.  So a tax that falls on the Yakamas' possession of goods as they travel to and from market on the highway violates the treaty just as much as a tax on travel alone would.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider the alternative.  If the State could save the tax here simply by labeling it a fee on the \"possession\" of a good, the State might just as easily revive the fishing license fee Tulee struck down simply by calling it a fee on the \"possession\" of fish.  That, of course, would be ridiculous.  The Yakamas' right to fish includes the right to possess the fish they catch--just like their right to move goods on the highways embraces the right to possess them there.  Nor does the State's reply solve the problem.  It accepts, as it must, that possessing fish is \"integral\" to the right to fish.  Post, at 6, n.\u00a02 (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting).  But it stands pat on its assertion that the treaty protects nothing more than a personal right to travel, ignoring all of the facts and binding findings before us establishing that the treaty also guarantees a right to move (and so possess) goods freely as they travel to and from market.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What about the supposed \"mink coat\" anomaly?  Under the terms of the treaty before us, it's true that a Yakama who buys a mink coat (or perhaps some more likely item) at an off-reservation store in Washington will have to pay sales tax because the treaty is silent there.  And it is also  true that a Yakama who buys the same coat right over the state line, pays any taxes due at market there, and then drives back to the reservation using the public highways is entitled to move that good tax-free from market back to the reservation.  But that is hardly anomalous--that is the treaty right the Yakamas reserved.  And it's easy to see why.  Imagine the Yakama Reservation reached the Washington\/Oregon state line (as it did before the 1855 Treaty).  In that case, Washington would have no basis to tax the Yakamas' transportation of goods from Oregon (whether they might be fuel, mink coats, or anything else), as all of the Yakamas' conduct would take place outside of the State or on the reservation.  The only question here is whether the result changes because the Tribe must now use Washington's highways to make the trek home.  And the answer is no.  The Tribe bargained for a right to travel with goods off reservation just as it could on reservation and just as it had for centuries.  If the State and federal governments do not like that result, they are free to bargain for more, but they do not get to rewrite the existing bargain in this Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alternatively yet, the State warns us about the dire consequences of a ruling against it.  Highway speed limits, reckless driving laws, and much more, the State tells us, will be at risk if we rule for the Tribe.  See also post, at 7-10 (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting). But notice.  Once you acknowledge (as the State and primary dissent just have) that the Yakamas themselves enjoy a right to travel free of at least some nondiscriminatory state regulations, this \"problem\" inevitably arises.  It inevitably arises, too, once you concede that the Yakamas enjoy a right to travel freely at least on local roads.  See post, at 3 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).  Whether you read the treaty to afford the Yakamas the further right to bring goods to and from market is beside the point.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It turns out, too, that the State's parade of horribles isn't really all that horrible.  While the treaty supplies the Yakamas with special rights to travel with goods to and from market, we have seen already that its \"in common with\" language also indicates that tribal members knew they would have to \"share the use of the road with whites\" and accept regulations designed to allow the two groups' safe coexistence.  Yakama Indian Nation, 955 F.\u00a0Supp., at 1265.  Indeed, the Yakamas expected laws designed to \"protec[t]\" their ability to travel safely alongside non-Indians on the highways.  See App. to Brief for Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation as Amicus Curiae 21a, 31a.  Maybe, too, that expectation goes some way toward explaining why the State's hypothetical parade of horribles has yet to take its first step in the real world.  No one before us has identified a single challenge to a state highway speed limit, reckless driving law, or other critical highway safety regulation in the entire life of the Yakama treaty.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Retreating now, the State suggests that the real problem isn't so much about the Yakamas themselves traveling freely as it is with their goods doing so.  We are told we should worry, for example, about limiting Washington's ability to regulate the transportation of diseased apples from Oregon.  See also post, at 10 (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting).  But if bad apples prove to be a public menace, Oregon and its localities may regulate them when they are grown or picked at the orchard.  Oregon, its localities, and maybe even the federal government may regulate the bad apples when they arrive at market for sale in Oregon.  The Tribe and again, perhaps, the federal government may regulate the bad apples when they arrive on the reservation.  And if the bad apples somehow pose a threat to safe travel on the highways, even Washington may regulate them as they make their way from Oregon to the reservation--just as the State may require tribal members to abide nondiscriminatory regulations governing the safe transportation of flammable cargo as they drive their gas trucks from Oregon to the reservation along public highways.  The only thing that Washington may not do is reverse the promise the United States made to the Yakamas in 1855 by imposing a tax or toll on tribal members or their goods as they pass to and from market.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, some worry that, if we recognize the potential permissibility of state highway safety laws, we might wind up impairing the interests of \"tribal members across the country.\"  See post, at 10 (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting).  But our decision today is based on unchallenged factual findings about how the Yakamas themselves understood this treaty in light of the negotiations that produced it.  And the Tribe itself has expressly acknowledged that its treaty, while extending real and valuable rights to tribal members, does not preclude laws that merely facilitate the safe use of the roads by Indians and non-Indians alike.  Nor does anything we say here necessarily apply to other tribes and other treaties; each must be taken on its own terms.  In the end, then, the only true threat to tribal interests today would come from replacing the meaningful right the Yakamas thought they had reserved with the trivial promise the State suggests.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Really, this case just tells an old and familiar story.  The State of Washington includes millions of acres that the Yakamas ceded to the United States under significant pressure.  In return, the government supplied a handful of modest promises.  The State is now dissatisfied with the consequences of one of those promises.  It is a new day, and now it wants more.  But today and to its credit, the Court holds the parties to the terms of their deal.  It is the least we can do.\n\nRoberts, C.

COUGAR DEN, INC.\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of washington\n[March 19, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice Thomas, Justice Alito, and Justice Kavanaugh join, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the 1855 treaty in which the Yakamas surrendered most of their lands to the United States, the Tribe sought to protect its way of life by reserving, among other rights, \"the right, in common with citizens of the United States, to travel upon all public highways.\"  Treaty Between the United States and the Yakama Nation of Indians, Art. III, June 9, 1855, 12 Stat. 953.  Cougar Den, a Yakama corporation that uses public highways to truck gas into Washington, contends that the treaty exempts it from Washington's fuel tax, which the State assesses upon the importation of fuel into the State.  The plurality agrees, concluding that Washington cannot impose the tax on Cougar Den because doing so would \"have the practical effect of burdening\" Cougar Den's exercise of its right to travel on the highways.  Ante, at 9.  The concurrence reaches the same result, reasoning that, because the Yakamas' right to travel includes the right to travel with goods, the State cannot tax or regulate the Yakamas' goods on the highways.  Ante, at 7-8 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in judgment).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the mere fact that a state law has an effect on the Yakamas while they are exercising a treaty right does not establish that the law impermissibly burdens the right itself.  And the right to travel with goods is just an application of the Yakamas' right to travel.  It ensures that the Yakamas enjoy the same privileges when they travel with goods as when they travel without them.  It is not an additional right to possess whatever goods they wish on the highway, immune from regulation and taxation.  Under our precedents, a state law violates a treaty right only if the law imposes liability upon the Yakamas \"for exercising the very right their ancestors intended to reserve.\"  Tulee v. Washington, 315 U.\u00a0S. 681, 685 (1942).  Because Washington is taxing Cougar Den for possessing fuel, not for traveling on the highways, the State's method of administering its fuel tax is consistent with the treaty.  I respectfully dissent from the contrary conclusion of the plurality and concurrence.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have held on three prior occasions that a nondiscriminatory state law violated a right the Yakamas reserved in the 1855 treaty.  All three cases involved the \"right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places, in common with citizens of the Territory.\"  Art. III, 12 Stat. 953.  In United States v. Winans, 198 U.\u00a0S. 371 (1905), and later again in Seufert Brothers Co. v. United States, 249 U.\u00a0S. 194 (1919), we held that state trespass law could not be used to prevent tribe members from reaching a historic fishing site.  And in Tulee v. Washington, we held that Washington could not punish a Yakama member for fishing without a license.  We concluded that the license law was preempted because the required fee \"act[ed] upon the Indians as a charge for exercising the very right their ancestors intended to reserve\"--the right to fish.  315 U.\u00a0S., at 685.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These three cases found a violation of the treaty when the challenged action--application of trespass law and enforcement of a license requirement--actually blocked the Yakamas from fishing at traditional locations.  Applying the reasoning of those decisions to the Yakamas' right to travel, it follows that a State could not bar Yakama members from traveling on a public highway, or charge them a toll to do so.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing of the sort is at issue here.  The tax before us does not resemble a blockade or a toll.  It is a tax on a product imported into the State, not a tax on highway travel.  The statute says as much: \"There is hereby levied and imposed .\u00a0.\u00a0. a tax .\u00a0.\u00a0. on each gallon of motor vehicle fuel.\"  Wash. Rev. Code \u00a782.36.020(1) (2012) (emphasis added).  It is difficult to imagine how the legislature could more clearly identify the object of the tax.  The tax is calculated per gallon of fuel; not, like a toll, per vehicle or distance traveled.  It is imposed on the owner of the fuel, not the driver or owner of the vehicle--separate entities in this case.  And it is imposed at the same rate on fuel that enters the State by methods other than a public highway--whether private road, rail, barge, or pipeline.  \u00a7\u00a782.36.010(4), 020(1), (2).  Had Cougar Den filled up its trucks at a refinery or pipeline terminal in Washington, rather than trucking fuel in from Oregon, there would be no dispute that it was subject to the exact same tax.  See \u00a7\u00a782.36.020(2)(a), (b)(ii).  Washington is taxing the fuel that Cougar Den imports, not Cougar Den's travel on the highway; it is not charging the Yakamas \"for exercising the very right their ancestors intended to reserve.\"  Tulee, 315 U.\u00a0S., at 685.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It makes no difference that Washington happens to impose that charge when Cougar Den's drivers cross into Washington on a public highway.  The time and place of the imposition of the tax does not change what is taxed, and thus what activity--possession of goods or travel--is burdened.  Say Washington imposes a tax on certain luxury goods, assessed upon first possession of the goods by a retail customer.  A Yakama member who buys a mink coat at an off-reservation store in Washington will pay the tax.  Yet, as the plurality acknowledges, under its view a tribal member who buys the same coat right over the state line in Portland and then drives back to the reservation will owe no tax--all because of a reserved right to travel on the public highways.  Ante, at 15.  That makes no sense.  The tax charges individuals for possessing expensive furs.  It in no way burdens highway travel.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plurality devotes five pages to planting trees in hopes of obscuring the forest: to delving into irrelevancies about how the tax is assessed or collected, instead of the substance of what is taxed.  However assessed or collected, the tax on 10,000 gallons of fuel is the same whether the tanker carrying it travels three miles in Washington or three hundred.  The tax varies only with the amount of fuel.  Why?  Because the tax is on fuel, not travel.  If two tankers travel 200 miles together from the same starting point to the same destination--one empty, one full of fuel--the full tanker will pay the fuel tax, the empty tanker will pay nothing.  Their travel has been identical, but only the full one pays tax.  Why?  Because the tax is on fuel, not travel.  The tax is on the owner of the fuel, not the owner of the vehicle.  Why?  You get the point.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plurality responds that, even though the tax is calculated per gallon of fuel, it remains a tax on travel because it taxes a \"feature\" of travel.  Ante, at 15.  It is of course true that tanker trucks can be seen from time to time on the highways, but that hardly makes them a regular \"feature\" of travel, like the plurality's examples of axels or passengers.  And we know that Washington is not taxing the gas insofar as it is a feature of Cougar Den's travel, because Washington imposes the exact same tax on gas that is not in transit on the highways. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rather than grappling with the substance of the tax, the plurality fixates on variations in the time and place of its assessment.  The plurality thinks it significant that Washington does not impose the tax at the moment of entry on fuel that enters the State by pipeline or by a barge bound for a refinery, but instead when a tanker truck withdraws the fuel from the refinery or pipeline terminal.  This may demonstrate that the tax is not on first possession of fuel in the State, as the plurality stresses, but it hardly demonstrates that the tax is not on possession of fuel at all.  Regardless of how fuel enters the State, someone will eventually pay a per-gallon charge for possessing it.  Washington simply assesses the fuel tax in each case upon the wholesaler.  See 188 Wash. 2d 55, 60, 392 P. 3d 1014, 1016 (2017).  This variation does not indicate, as the plurality suggests, that the fuel tax is somehow targeted at highway travel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plurality also says that it is bound by the Washington Supreme Court's references to the tax as an \"importation tax\" and tax on \"the importation of fuel,\" ante, at 7 (quoting 188 Wash. 2d, at 67, 69, 392 P. 3d, at 1019, 1020), but these two references to the point at which the tax is assessed are not authoritative constructions of the object of the tax.  The state court did not reject Washington's argument that this is a tax on fuel; instead, like the plural-ity today, it ignored that argument and concluded that the tax was invalid simply because Washington imposed it while Cougar Den was traveling on the highway.  In any event, the state court more often referred to the tax as a \"tax on fuels\" or \"fuel tax[\u00a0].\"  Id., at 58-61, 392 P. 3d, at 1015-1016.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the five pages arguing that a tax expressly labeled as on \"motor vehicle fuel\" is actually a tax on something else, the plurality concludes . . . it doesn't matter.  As the plurality puts it at page nine of its opinion, \"even if\u00a0\" the tax is on fuel and not travel, it is preempted because it has \"the practical effect of burdening\" the Yakamas' right to travel on the highways.  The plurality's rule--that States may not enforce general legislation that has an effect on the Yakamas while they are traveling--has no basis in our precedents, which invalidated laws that punished or charged the Yakamas simply for exercising their reserved rights.  The plurality is, of course, correct that the trespass law in Winans did not target fishing, but it effectively made illegal the very act of fishing at a traditional location.  Here, it is the possession of commercial quantities of fuel that exposes the Yakamas to liability, not travel itself or any integral feature of travel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The concurrence reaches the same result as the plural-ity, but on different grounds.  Rather than holding that the treaty preempts any law that burdens the Yakamas while traveling on the highways, the concurrence reasons that the fuel tax is preempted because it regulates the possession of goods, and the Yakamas' right to travel includes the right to travel with goods.  Ante, at 7-8.  But the right to travel with goods is just an application of the right to travel.  It means the Yakamas enjoy the same privileges whether they travel with goods or without.  It does not provide the Yakamas with an additional right to carry any and all goods on the highways, tax free, in any manner they wish.2  The concurrence purports to find this additional right in the record of the treaty negotiations, but the record shows only that the Yakamas wanted to ensure they could continue to travel to the places where they traded.  They did not, and did not intend to, insulate the goods they carried from all regulation and taxation.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing in the text of the treaty, the historical record, or our precedents supports the conclusion that the right \"to travel upon all public highways\" transforms the Yakamas' vehicles into mobile reservations, immunizing their contents from any state interference.  Before it reaches the reservation, the fuel in Cougar Den's tanker trucks is always susceptible to state regulation--it does not pass in and out of state authority with every exit off or entry onto the road.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recognizing the potentially broad sweep of its new rule, the plurality cautions that it does not intend to deprive the State of the power to regulate when necessary \"to prevent danger to health or safety occasioned by a tribe member's exercise of treaty rights.\"  Ante, at 17.  This escape hatch ensures, the plurality suggests, that the treaty will not preempt essential regulations that burden highway travel.  Ante, at 9-10.  I am not so confident.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, by its own terms, the plurality's health and safety exception is limited to laws that regulate dangers \"occasioned by\" a Yakama's travel.  That would seem to allow speed limits and other rules of the road.  But a law against possession of drugs or illegal firearms--the dangers of which have nothing to do with travel--does not address a health or safety risk \"occasioned by\" highway driving.  I do not see how, under the plurality's rule or the concurrence's, a Washington police officer could burden a Yakama's travel by pulling him over on suspicion of carrying such contraband on the highway.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the more fundamental problem is that this Court has never recognized a health and safety exception to reserved treaty rights, and the plurality today mentions the exception only in passing.  Importantly, our precedents--all of which concern hunting and fishing rights--acknowledge the authority of the States to regulate Indians' exercise of their reserved rights only in the interest of conservation.  See Tulee, 315 U.\u00a0S., at 684 (\"[T]he treaty leaves the state with power to impose on Indians, equally with others, such restrictions .\u00a0.\u00a0. as are necessary for the conservation of fish .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"); see also Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U.\u00a0S. 172, 205 (1999) (\"We have repeatedly reaffirmed state authority to impose reasonable and necessary nondiscriminatory regulations on Indian hunting, fishing, and gathering rights in the interest of conservation.\"); Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation v. Anderson, 903 F. Supp. 2d 1187, 1197 (ED Wash. 2011) (\"Notably absent from the binding Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit cases dealing with state regulation of 'in common' usufructuary rights is any reference to a state's exercise of its public-safety police power.\").  Indeed, this Court had previously assured the Yakamas that \"treaty fishermen are immune from all regulation save that required for conservation.\"  Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U.\u00a0S. 658, 682 (1979) (emphasis added).  Adapted to the travel right, the conservation exception would presumably protect regulations that preserve the subject of the Yakamas' right by maintaining safe and orderly travel on the highways.  But many regulations that burden highway travel (such as emissions standards, noise restrictions, or the plurality's hypothetical ban on the importation of plutonium) do not fit that description.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The need for the health and safety exception, of course, follows from the overly expansive interpretation of the treaty right adopted by the plurality and concurrence.  Today's decision digs such a deep hole that the future promises a lot of backing and filling.  Perhaps there are good reasons to revisit our long-held understanding of reserved treaty rights as the plurality does, and adopt a broad health and safety exception to deal with the inevitable fallout.  Hard to say, because no party or amicus has addressed the question.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plurality's response to this important issue is the following, portentous sentence: \"The record of the treaty negotiations may not support the contention that the Yakamas expected to use the roads entirely unconstrained by laws related to health or safety.\"  Ante, at 17.  A lot of weight on two words, \"may not.\"  The plurality cites assurances from the territorial Governor of Washington that the United States would make laws to prevent \"bad white men\" from harming the Yakamas, and that the United States expected the Yakamas to exercise similar restraint in return.  Ante, at 18.  What this has to do with health and safety regulations affecting the highways (or fishing or hunting) is not clear.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, do not assume today's decision is good news for tribal members across the country.  Application of state safety regulations, for example, could prevent Indians from hunting and fishing in their traditional or preferred manner, or in particular \"usual and accustomed places.\"  I fear that, by creating the need for this untested exception, the unwarranted expansion of the Yakamas' right to travel may undermine rights that the Yakamas and other tribes really did reserve.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The concurrence does not mention the plurality's possible health and safety exception, but observes that the Yakamas expected to follow laws that \"facilitate the safe use of the roads by Indians and non-Indians alike.\"  Ante, at 11.  The State is therefore wrong, the concurrence says, to contend that a decision exempting Cougar Den's fuel from taxation would call into question speed limits and reckless driving laws.  But that is not the State's principal argument.  The State acknowledges that laws facilitating safe travel on the highways would fall within the long-recognized conservation exception.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12-13.  The problem is that today's ruling for Cougar Den preempts the enforcement of any regulation of goods on the highway that does not concern travel safety--such as a prohibition on the possession of potentially contamin-ated apples taken from a quarantined area (a matter of vital concern in Washington).  See id., at 13; Brief for Petitioner 44.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The concurrence says not to worry, the apples could be regulated and inspected where they are grown, or when they arrive at a market.  Or, if the Yakamas are taking the apples back to the reservation, perhaps the Federal Government or the Tribe itself could address the problem there.  Ante, at 10.  What the concurrence does not say is that the State could regulate the contraband apples on the highway.  And there is no reason offered why other contraband should be treated any differently.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Surely the concurrence does not mean to suggest that the parties to the 1855 treaty intended to confer on the Tribe the right to travel with illegal goods, free of any regulation.  But if that is not the logical consequence of the decision today, the plurality and the concurrence should explain why.  It is the least they should do.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent.\n\nKavanaugh, J., dissenting\n\u2002586 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2019)\nNo. 16-1498\nWASHINGTON STATE DEPARTMENT OF LICENSING, PETITIONER v. COUGAR DEN, INC.\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of washington\n[March 19, 2019]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kavanaugh, with whom Justice Thomas joins, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The text of the 1855 treaty between the United States and the Yakama Tribe affords the Tribe a \"right, in common with citizens of the United States, to travel upon all public highways.\"  Treaty Between the United States and the Yakama Nation of Indians, Art.\u00a0III, June 9, 1855, 12 Stat. 953.  The treaty's \"in common with\" language means what it says.  The treaty recognizes tribal members' right to travel on off-reservation public highways on equal terms with other U.\u00a0S. citizens.  Under the text of the treaty, the tribal members, like other U.\u00a0S. citizens, therefore still remain subject to nondiscriminatory state highway regulations--that is, to regulations that apply equally to tribal members and other U.\u00a0S. citizens.  See Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U.\u00a0S. 145, 148-149 (1973).  That includes, for example, speed limits, truck restrictions, and reckless driving laws.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Washington law at issue here imposes a nondiscriminatory fuel tax.  The Chief Justice concludes that the fuel tax is not a highway regulation and, for that reason, he says that the fuel tax does not infringe the Tribe's treaty right to travel on the public highways.  I agree with The Chief Justice and join his dissent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if the fuel tax is a highway regulation, it is a nondiscriminatory highway regulation.  For that reason as well, the fuel tax does not infringe the Tribe's treaty right to travel on the public highways on equal terms with other U.\u00a0S. citizens.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plurality, as well as the concurrence in the judgment, suggests that the treaty, if construed that way, would not have been important to the Yakamas.  For that reason, the plurality and the concurrence would not adhere to that textual meaning and would interpret \"in common with\" other U.\u00a0S. citizens to mean, in essence, \"exempt from regulations that apply to\" other U.\u00a0S.  citizens.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully disagree with that analysis.  The treaty right to travel on the public highways \"in common with\"--that is, on equal terms with--other U.\u00a0S. citizens was important to the Yakama tribal members at the time the treaty was signed.  That is because, as of 1855, States and the Federal Government sometimes required tribal members to seek permission before leaving their reservations or even prohibited tribal members from leaving their reservations altogether.  See, e.g., Treaty Between the United States of America and the Utah Indians, Art.\u00a0VII, Dec. 30, 1849, 9 Stat 985; Mo. Rev. Stat., ch. 80, \u00a710 (1845).  The Yakamas needed to travel to sell their goods and trade for other goods.  As a result, those kinds of laws would have devastated the Yakamas' way of life.  Importantly, the terms of the 1855 treaty made crystal clear that those kinds of travel restrictions could not be imposed on the Yakamas.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, the treaty afforded Yakama tribal members two relevant rights.  First was \"free access\" on roads from the reservation to \"the nearest public highway.\"  Art.\u00a0III, 12 Stat. 953.  Second was a right to travel \"in common with\" other U. S. citizens on \"all public highways.\"  Ibid.  The right to free access from the reservation to public highways, combined with the right to travel off reservation on public highways, facilitated the Yakama tribal members' extensive trading network.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In determining the meaning of the \"in common with\" language, we must recognize that the treaty used different language in defining (1) the right to \"free access,\" which applies only on roads connecting the reservation to the off-reservation public highways, and (2) the right to travel \"in common with\" other U.\u00a0S. citizens, which applies on those off-reservation public highways.  The approach of the plurality and the concurrence would collapse that distinction between the \"free access\" and \"in common with\" language and thereby depart from the text of the treaty.  I would stick with the text.  The treaty's \"in common with\" language--both at the time the treaty was signed and now--means what it says: the right for Yakama tribal members to travel on public highways on equal terms with other U.\u00a0S. citizens.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, the treaty as negotiated and written may not have turned out to be a particularly good deal for the Yakamas.  As a matter of separation of powers, however, courts are bound by the text of the treaty.  See Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, 473 U.\u00a0S. 753, 774 (1985).  It is for Congress and the President, not the courts, to update a law and provide additional compensation or benefits to tribes beyond those provided by an old law.  And since 1855, and especially since 1968, Congress has in fact taken many steps to assist tribes through a variety of significant legislative measures.  In short, lament about the terms of the treaty negotiated by the Federal Government and the Tribe in 1855 does not support the Judiciary (as opposed to Congress and the President) rewriting the law in 2019.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What about precedent?  It is true that some of our older precedents interpreted similar \"in common with\" treaty language regarding fishing rights to grant tribal members an exemption from certain fishing regulations, even when the fishing regulations were nondiscriminatory.  But as we explained in the most recent of those fishing cases, those nondiscriminatory fishing regulations had the effect of preventing the Tribes from catching a fair share of the fish in the relevant area.  In other words, the fishing regulations at issue were discriminatory in effect even though nondiscriminatory on their face.  See Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U.\u00a0S. 658, 676, n. 22 (1979).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That rationale for departing from the treaty text in the narrow context of the fishing cases does not apply in the highway context.  Facially nondiscriminatory highway regulations--such as speed limits, truck restrictions, and reckless driving laws--are also nondiscriminatory in effect, as relevant here.  They do not deprive tribal members of use of the public highways or deprive tribal members of a fair share of the public highways.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Washington's facially nondiscriminatory fuel tax is likewise nondiscriminatory in effect.  The Washington fuel tax therefore does not violate the key principle articulated in the fishing cases.  I would adhere to the text of the treaty and hold that the tribal members, like other citizens of the State of Washington, are subject to the nondiscriminatory fuel tax.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court (via the plurality opinion and the concurrence) disagrees.  The Court relies on the fishing cases and fashions a new right for Yakama tribal members to disregard even nondiscriminatory highway regulations, such as the Washington fuel tax and perhaps also Washington's similarly structured cigarette tax.  The Court's newly created right will allow Yakama businesses not to pay state taxes that must be paid by other competing businesses, including by businesses run by members of the many other tribes in the State of Washington.  As a result, the State of Washington (along with other States) stands to lose millions of dollars annually in tax revenue, which will necessarily mean fewer services or increased taxes for other citizens and tribes in the State.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Court's newly created right--if applied across the board--would seem to afford Yakama tribal members an exemption from all manner of highway regulations, ranging from speed limits to truck restrictions to reckless driving laws.  No doubt because of those negative real-world consequences, the Court simultaneously fashions a new health and safety exception.1  But neither the right nor the exception comes from the text of the treaty.  As The Chief Justice explains, the Court's \"need for the health and safety exception, of course, follows from the overly expansive interpretation of the treaty right adopted by the plurality and concurrence.\"  Ante, at 8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I share The Chief Justice's concern that the Court's new right for tribal members to disregard even nondiscriminatory highway regulations and the Court's new exception to that right for health and safety regulations could generate significant uncertainty and unnecessary litigation for States and tribes.  The Chief Justice says it well: The Court \"digs such a deep hole that the future promises a lot of backing and filling.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead of judicially creating a new atextual right for tribal members to disregard nondiscriminatory highway regulations and then backfilling by judicially creating a new atextual exception to that right for health and safety regulations, I would adhere to the text of the treaty and leave it to Congress, if it chooses, to provide additional benefits for the Yakamas.  In my respectful view, even when we interpret any ambiguities in the treaty in favor of the Tribe, the treaty phrase \"in common with\" cannot properly be read to exempt tribal members from nondiscriminatory highway regulations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, under the treaty, Washington's nondiscriminatory fuel tax may be imposed on Yakama tribal members just as it may be imposed on other citizens and tribes in the State of Washington.  I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0There is something of an optical illusion in this case that may subtly distort analysis.  It comes from the fact that the tax here happens to be on motor fuel.  There is no claim, however, that the tax inhibits the treaty right to travel because of the link between motor fuel and highway travel.  The question presented must be analyzed as if the tax were imposed on goods of any sort.\nFootnote 2\u00a0The plurality simply assumes that the right to travel with goods is an additional, substantive right when it reasons that the fuel tax is preempted because it taxes an \"integral feature\" of travel with goods.  Ante, at 16.  The concurrence makes the same assumption when it compares the fuel tax to a tax on \"\u00a0'possession' of fish\"  Ante, at 8.  That tax would be preempted because \"taking possession of fish\" is just another way of describing the act of fishing.  But possession of a tanker full of fuel is not an integral feature of travel, which is the relevant activity protected by the treaty.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1I understand both the plurality opinion and the concurrence to approve of a health and safety exception.\n\n\n"}}
