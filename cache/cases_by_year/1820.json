MOORE(1820)\nNo. 27\nArgued: Decided: February 16, 1820\n\n\n THIS was a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania, in a case where was drawn in question the validity of a statute of that [ Houston v. Moore \n18 U.S. 1\n (1820) \nState, on the ground of its repugnancy to the constitution and laws of the United States, and the decision was in favour of its validity. The statute which formed the ground of controversy in the State court, was passed on the 28th of March, 1814, and enacts, among other things, (sec. 21.) that every non-commissioned officer and private of the militia who shall have neglected or refused to serve when called into actual service, in pursuance of any order or requisition of the President of the United States, shall be liable to the penalties defined in the act of the Congress of the United States, passed on the 28th of February, 1795; and then proceeds to enumerate them, and to each clause adds-'or shall be liable to any penalty which may have been prescribed since the date of the passing of the said act, or which may hereafter be prescribed by any law of the United States.' The statute then further provides that, 'within one month after the expiration of the time for which any detachment of militia shall have been called into the service of the United States, by or in pursuance of orders from the President of the United States, the proper brigade inspector shall summon a general or a regimental Court Martial, as the case may be, for the trial of such person or persons belonging to the detachment called out, who shall have refused or neglected to march therewith, or to furnish a sufficient substitute; or who, after having marched therewith, shall have returned, without leave from his commanding officer, of which delinquents the proper brigade inspector shall furnish to the said Court \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n Martial an accurate list. And as soon as the said Court Martial shall have decided in each of the cases which shall be submitted to their consideration, the President thereof shall furnish to the Marshal of the United States, or to his deputy, and also to the Comptroller of the Treasury of the United States, a list of the delinquents fined, in order that the further proceedings directed to be had thereon by the laws of the United States, may be completed.'\n Houston, the plaintiff in error, and in the original suit, was a private, enrolled in the Pennsylvania militia, and belonging to the detachment of the militia which was ordered out by the Governor of that State, in pursuance of a requisition from the President of the United States, dated the 4th of July, 1814. Being duly notified and called upon, he neglected to march with the detachment to the appointed place of rendezvous. He was tried for this delinquency before a Court Martial summoned under the authority of the executive of that State, in pursuance of the section of the statute above referred to. He appeared before the Court Martial, pleaded not guilty, and was in due from sentenced to pay a fine; for levying of which on his property, he brought an action of trespass in the State Court of Common Pleas, against the Deputy Marshal by whom it was levied. At the trial in that Court, the plaintiff prayed the Court to instruct the Jury, that the first, second, and third paragraphs of the 21st section of the above statute of Pennsylvania, so far as they related to the militia called into the \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n service of the United States, under the laws of Congress, and who failed to obey the orders of the President of the United States, are contrary to the constitution of the United States, and the laws of Congress made in pursuance thereof, and are, therefore, null and void. The Court instructed the jury that these paragraphs were not contrary to the constitution or laws of the United States, and were, therefore, not null and void. A verdict and judgment was thereupon rendered for the defendant, Moore; which judgment being carried by writ of error before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the highest court of law or equity of that State, was affirmed; and the cause was then brought before this Court, under the 25th section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, c. 20.\n This cause was argued at the last term, and continued to the present term for advisement.\n March 15th, 1819.\n Mr. Hopkins, for the plaintiff in error, argued, that the constitutional power of Congress over the militia, is exclusive of State authority, except as to officering and training them according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. By the constitution of the United States, (art. 1. s. 8.) Congress is invested with power 'to provide for calling forth the militia, to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.' And also, 'to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.' The terms 'to provide for calling forth,' import an authority to place the militia under the power of the United States; in certain cases, implying a command, which the militia are bound to obey. Congress has exercised this authority by authorizing the President to call forth the militia in the cases mentioned in the constitution, and inflicting penalties on those who disobey the call.a Whenever a draft is made, the persons drafted are immediately, and to all intents and purposes, in the service of the United States, and from that moment all State authority over them ceases. The power to govern the militia, thus called forth, and employed in the service of the United States, is exclusively in the national government. A national militia grew out of the federal constitution, and did not previously exist. It is in its very nature one indivisible object, and of the utmost importance to the support of the federal authority and government.b But even supposing this power not to be exclusively vested in Congress, and admitting it to be concurrent between the United States' government, and the respective State governments; as Congress have legislated on the subject matter, to the extent of the authority given, State legislation, which is subordinate, is necessarily excluded. Even where the grant of a certain power to the government of the Union is not,\n a Act of the 28th of February, 1795, c. 277. (CI.)\n b Livingston v. Van Ingen, 9 Johns. Rep. 507. 565. 575. \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n in express terms, exclusive, yet if the exercise of it by that government be practically inconsistent with the exercise of the same power by the States, their laws must yield to the supremacy of the laws of the United States.c Meade's case is an example of the application of the same principle to the very question now before the Court.d Is it possible that Congress meant to give power to a State Court, without naming the Court, or granting the power in express terms? The exercise of this jurisdiction by a State Court Martial would either oust the United States' Courts of their jurisdiction, or might subject the alleged delinquents to be twice tried and punished for the same offence. If the State Court could try them, the Governor of the State could pardon them for an offence committed against the laws of the United States. There is, in various particulars, a manifest repugnancy between the two laws. They are in direct collision; and, consequently, the State law is void. Again; if the State of Pennsylvania had power to pass the act of the 28th of March, 1814, or the 21st section of that act, it was superseded by the act of Congress of the 18th of April, 1814, c. 670., occupying the same ground, and making a more complete provision on the same subject. These two laws are still more manifestly repugnant and inconsistent with each other. Again; if the State law was constitutional, and not superseded by the act of Congress of the 18th of April, 1814, c. 670. still the treaty of peace\n c Livingston v. Van Ingen, 9 Johns. Rep. 507. 565. 575.\n d 5 Hall's Law Journ. 536. \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n between the United States and Great Britain, ratified in February, 1815, suspended and abrogated all proceedings under the State law.\n Mr. C. J. Ingersoll and Mr. Rogers, contra, insisted, that there were many cases in which the laws of the United States are carried into effect by State Courts and State officers; that this was contemplated by the framers of the constitution; that the Governor of Pennsylvania, by whom the Court Martial, in the present case, was summoned, is the commander in chief of the militia of that State, except when called into the actual service of the United States. The militia drafted in pursuance of the requisition of the President were not in actual service, until mustered, and in the pay of the United States; until they reached the place of rendezvous, and were put uncer the command of the United States' officers. It is not the requisition, but the obedience to the requisition, which makes the persons drafted amenable to martial law, as a part of the military force of the Union. When the constitution speaks of the power of 'calling forth' the militia, it means an effectual calling. The plaintiff was called, but not called forth. The power invested in Congress, is to determine in what mode the requisition shall be made; how the quota of each State is to be apportioned; from what States requisitions shall be made in particular cases; and by what process the call is to be enforced. Congress not having directed the mode by which Courts Martial are to be summoned and held for the purpose of enforcing it, the States have a constitutional \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n authority to supply the omission. Before this Court proceeds to declare the State law made for this purpose to be void, it must be satisfied, beyond all doubt, of its repugnancy to the constitution.e The case must fall within some of the express prohibitory clauses of the constitution, or some of its clearly implied prohibitions. It must not be the exercise of a political discretion with which the legislature is invested, for that can never become the subject of judicial cognizance. It is insisted, that the power of Congress over the militia is a concurrent, and not an exclusive power. All powers, which previously existed in the States, and which are not expressly delegated to the United States, are reserved.f The power of making laws on the subject of the militia is not prohibited to he States, and has always been exercised by them. The necessity of a concurrent jurisdiction in certain cases results from the peculiar division of the powers of sovereignty in our government, and the principle, that all authorities of which the States are not expressly devested in favour of the Union, or the exercise of which, by the States, would be repugnant to those granted to the Union, are reserved to the States, is not only a theoretical consequence of that division, but is clearly admitted by the whole tenor of the constitution. The cotemporaneous construction of the constitution,\n e Calder et ux. v. Bull et ux. 3 Dall. 399. Emerick v. Harris, 1 Binney, 416. 423. 6 Cranch, 87. Cooper v. Telfair, 4 Dall. 14. 18.\n f Livingston et al. v. Van Ingen, 9 Johns. Rep. 501. 565. 573. et seq. 1 Tuck. Bl. Com. Appx. 308. \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n by those who supported its adoption, supposes the power in question to be concurrent, and not exclusive.g The power of the States over the militia is not taken away; it existed in them before the establishment of the constitution, and there being no negative clause prohibiting its exercise by them, it still resides in the States, so far as an exercise of it by them is not absolutely repugnant to the authority of the Union. Before the militia are actually employed in the service of the United States, Congress has only a power concurrent with that of the States, to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining them. The authority of appointing the officers and training the militia, is expressly reserved to the States, because, in these respects, it was intended that they should have an exclusive power. So, also, Congress has the exclusive power of governing such part of the militia as may be actually employed in the service of the United States; but not until it is thus actually employed. The power of governing the militia, is the power of subjecting it to the rules and articles of war. But it is a principle manifestly implied in the constitution, that the militia cannot be subject to martial law, except when in actual service, in time of war, rebellion, or invasion.h It necessarily results from the circumstance of the power of making provision for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia being concurrent, that if\n g Letters of Publius, or the Federalist, Nos. 27. 32. Debates in the Virginia Convention, 272. 284. 296. 298.\n h 1 Tucker's Bl. Com. 213. Duffield v. Smith, 6 Binney, 306. \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n Congress has not legislated upon any part of the subject, the States have a right to supply the omission. This right has been exercised, in the present case, in aid of, and not in hostility to, the federal authority. The fines which are collected under the law, are not appropriated to the use of the State, but are to be paid into the treasury of the Union. The power of making uniform laws of naturalization is different from that now under consideration. The power of naturalization is an authority granted to the Union, to which a similar authority in the States would be absolutely and totally repugnant. A naturalized citizen of one State would be entitled to all the privileges of a citizen in every other State, and the greatest confusion would be produced by a variety of rules on the subject. But even naturalization has been sometimes held to be a power residing concurrently in the Union and the States, and to be exercised by the latter in such a way as not to contravene the rule established by the Union.i But in the present case, the State law is not inconsistent with the act of Congress. It comes in aid of it. It supplies its defects, and remedies its imperfections. It co-operates with it for the promotion of the same end. The offence which is made punishable by the State law, is an offence against the State, as well as the Union. It being the duty of the State to furnish its quota, it has a right to compel the drafted militia to appear and march. Calling the militia forth, and governing them after they are in actual service,\n i Collet v. Collet 2 Dall. 294. 296. \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n are two distinct things. A State law, acting upon the militia before they have entered into the actual service of the Union, is so far from interfering with the power of Congress to legislate on the same subject, that it may have, and, we contend, that it does have, in the present case, a powerful effect in aid of the national authority. But it would be almost impossible for the State to enact a law concerning the militia, after they are in the actual service of the United States, which would not be irreconcilable with the authority of the latter. Even supposing that Congress should pass a law inflicting one penalty for disobedience to the call, and the State inflict another, they would still both co-operate to the same end. In practice, the delinquent could not be punished twice for the same offence; but there would be no theoretical repugnancy between the two laws. Congress, in the statutes enacted by them, have not intended to compel citizens enrolled in the militia to enter into the actual service of the United States. It is not a conscription; but a draft, with the option to the individual to be excused from a specific performance of the duty by the payment of a pecuniary composition. The acts of Congress are defective in not providing how, or by whom, Courts Martial shall be held, for the trial of delinquents, and the collection of these pecuniary penalties. The State legislature, acting with a sincere desire to promote the objects of the national government, supplied these defects, by adding such details as were indispensably necessary to execute the acts of Congress. \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n There is, then, a perfect harmony between the two laws.\n Feb. 16th. 1820.\n\n The judgment of the Court was delivered at the present term, by Mr. Justice WASHINGTON, who, after stating the facts of the case, proceeded as follows:\n There is but one question in this cause, and it is, whether the act of the legislature of Pennsylvania, under the authority of which the plaintiff in error was tried, and sentenced to pay a fine, is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, or not?\n But before this question can be clearly understood, it will be necessary to inquire, 1. What are the powers granted to the general government, by the Constitution of the United States, over the militia? and, 2. To what extent they have been assumed and exercised?\n\n 1. \nThe constitution declares, that Congress shall have power to provide for calling forth the militia in three specified cases: for organizing, arming, and disciplining them; and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States; reserving to the States, respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. It is further provided, that the President of the United States shall be commander of the militia, when called into the actual service of the United States.\n\n 2. \nAfter the constitution went into operation, Congress proceeded by many successive acts to exercise \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n these powers, and to provide for all the cases contemplated by the constitution.\n The act of the 2d of May, 1792, which is re-enacted almost verbatim by that of the 28th of February, 1795, authorizes the President of the United States, in case of invasion, or of imminent danger of it, or when it may be necessary for executing the laws of the United States, or to suppress insurrections, to call forth such number of the militia of the States most convenient to the scene of action, as he may judge necessary, and to issue his orders for that purpose, to such officer of the militia as he shall think proper. It prescribes the amount of pay and allowance of the militia so called forth, and employed in the service of the United States, and subjects them to the rules and articles of war applicable to the regular troops. It then proceeds to prescribe the punishment to be inflicted upon delinquents, and the tribunal which is to try them, by declaring, that every officer or private who should fail to obey the orders of the President, in any of the cases before recited, should be liable to pay a certain fine, to be determined and adjudged by a Court Martial, and to be imprisoned, by a like sentence, on failure of payment. The Courts Martial for the trial of militia, are to be composed of militia officers only, and the fines to be certified by the presiding officer of the court, to the marshal of the district, and to be levied by him, and, also, to the supervisor, to whom the fines are to be paid over.\n The act of the 18th of April, 1814, provides, that Courts Martial, to be composed of militia officers \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n only, for the trial of militia, drafted, detached and called forth for the service of the United States, whether acting in conjunction with the regular forces or otherwise, shall, whenever necessary, be appointed, held, and conducted in the manner prescribed by the rules and articles of war, for appointing, holding, and conducting Courts Martial for the trial of delinquents in the army of the United States. Where the punishment prescribed, is by stoppage of pay, or imposing a fine limited by the amount of pay, the same is to have relation to the monthly pay existing at the time the offence was committed. The residue of the act is employed in prescribing the manner of conducting the trial; the rules of evidence for the government of the Court; the time of service, and other matters not so material to the present inquiry. The only remaining act of Congress which it will be necessary to notice in this general summary of the laws, is that of the 8th of May, 1792, for establishing an uniform militia in the United States. It declares who shall be subject to be enrolled in the militia, and who shall be exempt; what arms and accoutrements the officers and privates shall provide themselves with; arranges them into divisions, brigades, regiments, battalions, and companies, in such manner as the State legislatures may direct; declares the rules of discipline by which the militia is to be governed, and makes provision for such as should be disabled whilst in the actual service of the United States. The pay and subsistence of the militia, whilst in service, are provided \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n for by other acts of Congress, and particularly by one passed on the third of January, 1795.\n The laws which I have referred to, amount to a full execution of the powers conferred upon Congress by the constitution. They provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasion. They also provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States; leaving to the States respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training them according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.\n This system may not be formed with as much wisdom as, in the opinion of some, it might have been, or as time and experience may hereafter suggest. But to my apprehension, the whole ground of Congressional legislation is covered by the laws referred to. The manner in which the militia is to be organized, armed, disciplined, and governed, is fully prescribed; provisions are made for drafting, detaching, and calling forth the State quotas, when required by the President. The President's orders may be given to the chief executive magistrate of the State, or to any militia officer he may think proper; neglect, or refusal to obey orders, is declared to be an offence against the laws of the United States, and subjects the offender to trial, sentence and punishment, to be adjudged by a Court Martial, to be summoned in the way pointed out by the articles and rules of war; and the mode of proceeding to \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n be observed by these courts, is detailed with all necessary perspicuity.\n If I am not mistaken in this view of the subject, the way is now open for the examination of the great question in the cause. Is it competent to a Court Martial, deriving its jurisdiction under State authority, to try, and to punish militia men, drafted, detached, and called forth by the President into the service of the United States, who have refused, or neglected to obey the call?\n In support of the judgment of the Court below, I understand the leading arguments to be the two following: 1. That militia men, when called into the service of the United States by the President's orders, communicated either to the executive magistrate, or to any inferior militia officer of a State, are not to be considered as being in the service of the United States until they are mustered at the place of rendezvous. If this be so, then, 2dly. The State retains a right, concurrent with the government of the United States, to punish his delinquency. It is admitted on the one side, that so long as the militia are acting under the military jurisdiction of the State to which they belong, the powers of legislation over them are concurrent in the general and State government. Congress has power to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining them; and this power being unlimited, except in the two particulars of officering and training them, according to the discipline to be prescribed by Congress, it may be exercised to any extent that may be deemed necessary by Congress. But as State militia, the power of \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n the State governments to legislate on the same subjects, having existed prior to the formation of the constitution, and not having been prohibited by that instrument, it remains with the States, subordinate nevertheless to the paramount law of the general government, operating upon the same subject. On the other side, it is conceded, that after a detachment of the militia have been called forth, and have entered into the service of the United States, the authority of the general government over such detachment is exclusive. This is also obvious. Over the national militia, the State governments never had, or could have, jurisdiction. None such is conferred by the constitution of the United States; consequently, none such can exist.\n The first question then is, at what time, and under what circumstances, does a portion of militia, drafted, detached, and called forth by the President, enter into the service of the United States, and change their character from State to National militia? That Congress might by law have fixed the period, by confining it to the draft; the order given to the Chief Magistrate, or other militia officer of the State; to the arrival of the men at the place of rendezvous; or to any other circumstance, I can entertain no doubt. This would certainly be included in the more extensive powers of calling forth the militia, organizing, arming, disciplining, and governing them. But has Congress made any declaration on this subject, and in what manner is the will of that body, as expressed in the before mentioned laws, to be construed? I must be conceded, that there is \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n no law of the United States which declares in express terms, that the organizing, arming, and equipping a detachment, on the order of the President to the State militia officers, or to the militia men personally, places them in the service of the United States. It is true, that the refusal or neglect of the militia to obey the orders of the President, is declared to be an offence against the United States, and subjects the offender to a certain prescribed punishment. But this flows from the power bestowed upon the general government to call them forth; and, consequently, to punish disobedience to a legal order; and by no means proves, that the call of the President places the detachment in the service of the United States. But although Congress has been less explicit on this subject than they might have been, and it could be wished they had been, I am, nevertheless, of opinion, that a fair construction of the different militia laws of the United States, will lead to a conclusion, that something more than organizing and equipping a detachment, and ordering it into service, was considered as necessary to place the militia in the service of the United States. That preparing a detachment for such service, does not place it in the service, is clearly to be collected from the various temporary laws which have been passed, authorizing the President to require of the State executives to organize, arm, and equip their State quotas of militia for the service of the United States. Because they all provide that the requisition shall be to hold such quotas in readiness to march at a moment's waring; and some, if not all of them, authorize \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n the President to call into actual service any part, or the whole of said quotas, or detachments; clearly distinguishing between the orders of the President to organize, and hold the detachments in readiness for service, and their entering into service.\n The act of the 28th of February, 1795, declares, that the militia employed in the service of the United States, shall receive the same pay and allowance as the troops of the United States, and shall be subject to the same rules and articles of war. The provisions made for disabled militia men, and for their families, in case of their death, are, by other laws, confined to such militia as are, or have been, in actual service. There are other laws which seem very strongly to indicate the time at which they are considered as being in service. Thus, the act of the 28th of February, 1795, declares, that a militia man called into the service of the United States, shall not be compelled to serve more than three months after his arrival at the place of rendezvous, in any one year. The 8th section of the act of the 18th of April, 1814, declares, that the militia, when called into the service of the United States, if, in the President's opinion, the public interest requires it, may be compelled to serve for a term not exceeding six months, after their arrival at the place of rendezvous, in any one year; and by the 10th section, provision is made for the expenses which may be incurred by marching the militia to their places of rendezvous, in pursuance of a requisition of the President, and they are to be adjusted and paid in like manner as those incurred after their arrival at the rendezvous. \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n The 3d section of the act of the 2d of January, 1795, provides, that whenever the militia shall be called into the actual service of the United States, their pay shall be deemed to commence from the day of their appearing at the place of battalion, regimental, or brigade rendezvous, allowing a day's pay and ration for every 15 miles from their homes to said rendezvous.\n From this brief summary of the laws, it would seem, that actual service was considered by Congress as the criterion of national militia; and that the service did not commence until the arrival of the militia at the place of rendezvous. That is the terminus a quo, the service, the pay, and subjection to the articles of war, are to commence and continue. If the service, in particular, is to continue for a certain length of time, from a certain day, it would seem to follow, almost conclusively, that the service commenced on that, and not on some prior day. And, indeed, it would seem to border somewhat upon an absurdity, to say, that a militia man was in the service of the United States at any time, who, so far from entering into it for a single moment, had refused to do so, and who never did any act to connect him with such service. It has already been admitted, that if Congress had pleased so to declare, a militia man, called into the service of the United States, might have been held and considered as being constructively in that service, though not actually so; and might have been treated in like manner as if he had appeared at the place of rendezvous. But Congress has not so declared, nor have they made \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n any provision applicable to such a case; on the contrary, it would appear, that a fine to be paid by the delinquent militia man, was deemed an equivalent for his services, and an atonement for his disobedience.\n If, then, a militia man, called into the service of the United States, shall refuse to obey the order, and is, consequently, not to be considered as in the service of the United States, or removed from the military jurisdiction of the state to which he belongs, to next question is, is it competent to the State to provide for trying and punishing him for his disobedience, by a Court Martial, deriving its authority under the State? It may be admitted at once, that the militia belong to the States, respectively, in which they are enrolled, and that they are subject, both in their civil and military capacities, to the jurisdiction and laws of such State, except so far as those laws are controlled by acts of Congress constitutionally made. Congress has power to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia; and it is presumable, that the framers of the constitution contemplated a full exercise of all these powers. Nevertheless, if Congress had declined to exercise them, it was competent to the State governments to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining their respective militia, in such manner as they might think proper. But Congress has provided for all these subjects, in the way which that body must have supposed the best calculated to promote the general welfare, and to provide for the national defence. After this, can the State governments \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 22]\n\u00a0\n enter upon the same ground-provide for the same objects as they may think proper, and punish in their own way violations of the laws they have so enacted? The affirmative of this question is asserted by the defendant's counsel, who, it is understood, contend, that unless such State laws are in direct contradiction to those of the United States, they are not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.\n From this doctrine, I must, for one, be permitted to dissent. The two laws may not be in such absolute opposition to each other, as to render the one incapable of execution, without violating the injunctions of the other; and yet, the will of the one legislature may be in direct collision with that of the other. This will is to be discovered as well by what the legislature has not declared, as by what they have expressed. Congress, for example, has declared, that the punishment for disobedience of the act of Congress, shall be a certain fine; if that provided by the State legislature for the same offence be a similar fine, with the addition of imprisonment or death, the latter law would not prevent the former from being carried into execution, and may be said, therefore, not to be repugnant to it. But surely the will of Congress is, nevertheless, thwarted and opposed.\n This question does not so much involve a contest for power between the two governments, as the rights and privileges of the citizen, secured to him by the Constitution of the United States, the benefit of which he may lawfully claim. \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 23]\n\u00a0\n If, in a specified case, the people have thought proper to bestow certain powers on Congress as the safest depositary of them, and Congress has legislated within the scope of them, the people have reason to complain that the same powers should be exercised at the same time by the State legislatures. To subject them to the operation of two laws upon the same subject, dictated by distinct wills, particularly in a case inflicting pains and penalties, is, to my apprehension, something very much like oppression, if not worse. In short, I am altogether incapable of comprehending how two distinct wills can, at the same time, be exercised in relation to the same subject, to be effectual, and at the same time compatible with each other. If they correspond in every respect, then the latter is idle and inoperative; if they differ, they must, in the nature of things, oppose each other, so far as they do differ. If the one imposes a certain punishment for a certain offence, the presumption is, that this was deemed sufficient, and, under all circumstances, the only proper one. If the other legislature impose a different punishment, in kind or degree, I am at a loss to conceive how they can both consist harmoniously together.\n I admit that a legislative body may, by different laws, impose upon the same person, for the same offence, different and cumulative punishments; but then it is the will of the same body to do so, and the second, equally with the first law, is the will of that body. There is, therefore, and can be, no opposition of wills. But the case is altogether different, where \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 24]\n\u00a0\n the laws flow from the wills of distinct, co-ordinate bodies.\n This course of reasoning is intended as an answer to what I consider a novel and unconstitutional doctrine, that in cases where the State governments have a concurrent power of legislation with the national government, they may legislate upon any subject on which Congress has acted, provided the two laws are not in terms, or in their operation, contradictory and repugnant to each other.\n Upon the subject of the militia, Congress has exercised the powers conferred on that body by the constitution, as fully as was thought right, and has thus excluded the power of legislation by the States on these subjects, except so far as it has been permitted by Congress; although it should be conceded, that important provisions have been omitted, or that others which have been made might have been more extended, or more wisely devised.\n There still remains another question to be considered, which more immediately involves the merits of this cause. Admit that the legislature of Pennsylvania could not constitutionally legislate in respect to delinquent militia men, and to prescribe the punishment to which they should be subject, had the State Court Martial jurisdiction over the subject, so as to enforce the laws of Congress against these delinquents?\n This, it will be seen, is a different question from that which has been just examined. That respects the power of a State legislature to legislate upon a subject, on which Congress has declared its will. This concerns the jurisdiction of a State military tribunal \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 25]\n\u00a0\n to adjudicate in a case which depends on a law of Congress, and to enforce it.\n It has been already shown that Congress has prescribed the punishment to be inflicted on a militia man detached and called forth, but who has refused to march; and has also provided that Courts Martial for the trial of such delinquents, to be composed of militia officers only, shall be held and conducted in the manner pointed out by the rules and articles of war.\n That Congress might have vested the exclusive jurisdiction in Courts Martial to be held and conducted as the laws of the United States have prescribed, will, I presume, hardly be questioned. The offence to be punished grows out of the constitution and laws of the United States, and is, therefore, clearly a case which might have been withdrawn from the concurrent jurisdiction of the State tribunals. But an exclusive jurisdiction is not given to Courts Martial, deriving their authority under the national government, by express words:-the question then (and I admit the difficulty of it) occurs, is this a case in which the State Courts Martial could exercise jurisdiction?\n Speaking upon the subject of the federal judiciary, the Federalist distinctly asserts the doctrine, that the United States, in the course of legislation upon the objects entrusted to their direction, may commit the decision of causes arising upon a particular regulation to the federal Courts solely, if it should be deemed expedient; yet that in every case, in which the State tribunals should not be expressly excluded \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 26]\n\u00a0\n by the acts of the national legislature, they would, of course, take cognizance of the causes to which those acts might give birth.j\n I can discover, I confess, nothing unreasonable in this doctrine; nor can I perceive any inconvenience which can grow out of it, so long as the power of Congress to withdraw the whole, or any part of those cases, from the jurisdiction of the State Courts, is, as I think it must be, admitted.\n The practice of the general government seems strongly to confirm this doctrine; for at the first session of Congress which commenced after the adoption of the constitution, the judicial system was formed; and the exclusive and concurrent jurisdiction conferred upon the Courts created by that law, were clearly distinguished and marked; showing that, in the opinion of that body, it was not sufficient to vest an exclusive jurisdiction, where it was deemed proper, merely by a grant of jurisdiction generally. In particular, this law grants exclusive jurisdiction to the Circuit Courts of all crimes and offences cognizable under the authority of the United States, except where the laws of the United States should otherwise provide; and this will account for the proviso in the act of the 24th of February, 1807, ch. 75., concerning the forgery of the notes of the Bank of the United States, 'that nothing in that act contained should be construed to deprive the courts of the individual States of jurisdiction under the laws of the several States over offences made punishable by that act.' A similar proviso is to be found in the act of the 21st of April,\n j Letters of Publius, or the Federalist. No. 82. \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 27]\n\u00a0\n 1806, ch. 49., concerning the counterfeiters of the current coin of the United States. It is clear that, in the opinion of Congress, this saving was necessary in order to authorize the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction by the State Courts over those offences; and there can be very little doubt but that this opinion was well founded. The judiciary act had vested in the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction of all offences cognizable under the authority of the United States, unless where the laws of the United States should otherwise direct. The States could not, therefore, exercise a concurrent jurisdiction in those cases, without coming into direct collision with the laws of Congress. But by these savings Congress did provide, that the jurisdiction of the federal Courts in the specified cases should not be exclusive; and the concurrent jurisdiction of the State Courts was instantly restored, so far as, under State authority, it could be exercised by them.\n There are many other acts of Congress which permit jurisdiction over the offences therein described, to be exercised by State magistrates and Courts; not, I presume, because such permission was considered to be necessary under the constitution, in order to vest a concurrent jurisdiction in those tribunals; but because, without it, the jurisdiction was exclusively vested in the national Courts by the judiciary act, and consequently could not be otherwise exercised by the State Courts. For I hold it to be perfectly clear, that Congress cannot confer jurisdiction upon any Courts, but such as exist under the constitution and laws of the United States, although the State Courts \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 28]\n\u00a0\n may exercise jurisdiction on cases authorized by the laws of the State, and not prohibited by the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal Courts.\n What, then, is the real object of the law of Pennsylvania which we are considering? I answer, to confer authority upon a State Court Martial to enforce the laws of the United States against delinquent militia men, who had disobeyed the call of the President to enter into the service of the United States; for, except the provisions for vesting this jurisdiction in such a Court, this act is, in substance, a re-enactment of the acts of Congress, as to the description of the offence, the nature and extent of the punishment, and the collection and appropriation of the fines imposed.\n Why might not this Court Martial exercise the authority thus vested in it by this law? As to crimes and offences against the United States, the law of Congress had vested the cognizance of them exclusively in the federal Courts. The State Courts, therefore, could exercise no jurisdiction whatever over such offences, unless where, in particular cases, other laws of the United States had otherwise provided; and wherever such provision was made, the claim of exclusive jurisdiction to the particular cases was withdrawn by the United States, and the concurrent jurisdiction of the State Courts was eo instanti restored, not by way of grant from the national government, but by the removal of a disability before imposed upon the State tribunals.\n But military offences are not included in the act of Congress, conferring jurisdiction upon the Circuit \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 29]\n\u00a0\n and District Courts; no person has ever contended that such offences are cognizable before the common law Courts. The militia laws have, therefore, provided, that the offence of disobedience to the President's call upon the militia, shall be cognizable by a Court Martial of the United States; but an exclusive cognizance is not conferred upon that Court, as it had been upon the common law Courts as to other offences, by the judiciary act. It follows, then, as I conceive, that jurisdiction over this offence remains to be concurrently exercised by the national and State Courts Martial, since it is authorized by the laws of the State, and not prohibited by those of the United States. Where is the repugnance of the one law to the other? The jurisdiction was clearly concurrent over militia men, not engaged in the service of the United States; and the acts of Congress have not disturbed this state of things, by asserting an exclusive jurisdiction. They certainly have not done so in terms; and I do not think that it can be made out by any fair construction of them. The act of 1795 merely declares, that this offence shall be tried by a Court Martial. This was clearly not exclusive; but, on the contrary, it would seem to import, that such Court might be held under national, or State authority.\n The act of 1814 does not render the jurisdiction necessarily exclusive. It provides, that Courts Martial for the trial of militia, drafted and called forth, shall, when necessary, be appointed, held, and conducted, in the manner prescribed by the rules of war.\n If the mere assignment of jurisdiction to a particular \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 30]\n\u00a0\n Court, does not necessarily render it exclusive, as I have already endeavoured to prove, then it would follow, that this law can have no such effect; unless, indeed, there is a difference in this respect between the same language, when applied to military, and to civil Courts; and if there be a difference, I have not been able to perceive it. But the law uses the expression 'when necessary?' How is this to be understood? It may mean, I acknowledge, whenever there are delinquents to try; but, surely, if it import no more than this, it was very unnecessarily used, since it would have been sufficient to say, that Courts Martial for the trial of militia called into service, should be formed and conducted in the manner prescribed by the law. The act of 1795, had declared who were liable to be tried, but had not said with precision before what Court the trial should be had. This act describes the Court; and the two laws being construed together, would seem to mean that every such delinquent as is described in the act of 1795, should pay a certain fine, to be determined and adjudged by a Court Martial, to be composed of militia officers, to be appointed and conducted in the manner prescribed by the articles of war. These words, when necessary, have no definite meaning, if they are confined to the existence of cases for trial before the Court. But if they be construed ( as I think they ought to be) to apply to trials rendered necessary by the omission of the States to provide for State Courts Martial to exercise a jurisdiction in the case, or of such Courts to take cognizance of them, when so authorized, they have an important, and a useful \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 31]\n\u00a0\n meaning. If the State Court Martial proceeds to take cognizance of the cases, it may not appear necessary to the proper officer in the service of the United States, to summon a Court to try the same cases; if they do not, or for want of authority cannot try them, then it may be deemed necessary to convene a Court Martial under the articles of war, to take, and to exercise the jurisdiction.\n There are two objections which were made by the plaintiff's counsel, to the exercise of jurisdiction in this case, by the State Court Martial, which remain to be noticed.\n\n 1. \nIt was contended, that if the exercise of this jurisdiction be admitted, that the sentence of the Court would either oust the jurisdiction of the United States' Court Martial, or might subject the accused to be twice tried for the same offence. To this I answer, that, if the jurisdiction of the two Courts be concurrent, the sentence of either Court, either of conviction or acquittal, might be pleaded in bar of the prosecution before the other, as much so as the judgment of a State Court, in a civil case of concurrent jurisdiction, may be pleaded in bar of an action for the same cause, instituted in a Circuit Court of the United States.\n Another objection is, that if the State Court Martial had authority to try these men, the Governor of that State, in case of conviction, might have pardoned them. I am by no means satisfied that he could have done so; but if he could, this would only furnish a reason why Congress should vest the jurisdiction in these cases, exclusively in a Court Martial acting under the authority of the United States. \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 32]\n\u00a0\n Upon the whole, I am of opinion, after the most laborious examination of this delicate question, that the State Court Martial had a concurrent jurisdiction with the tribunal pointed out by the acts of Congress to try a militia man who had disobeyed the call of the President, and to enforce the laws of Congress against such delinquent; and that this authority will remain to be so exercised until it shall please Congress to vest it exclusively elsewhere, or until the State of Pennsylvania shall withdraw from their Court Martial the authority to take such jurisdiction. At all events, this is not one of those clear cases of repugnance to the Constitution of the United States, where I should feel myself at liberty to declare the law to be unconstitutional; the sentence of the Court coram non judice; and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania erroneous on these grounds.\n Two of the judges are of opinion, that the law in question is unconstitutional, and that the judgment below ought to be reversed.\n The other judges are of opinion, that the judgment ought to be affirmed; but they do not concur in all respects in the reasons which influence my opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice JOHNSON.\n It is not very easy to form a distinct idea of what the question in this case really is. An individual having offended against a law of his own State, has been cited before a Court constituted under the laws of that State, and there convicted and fined. His complaint is, that his offene was an \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 33]\n\u00a0\n offence against the laws of the United States, that he is liable to be punished under those laws, and cannot, therefore, be constitutionally punished under the laws of his own State.\n If any right secured to him under the State constitution has been violated, it is not our affair. His complaint before this Court must be either that some law, or some constitutional provision of the United States, has been violated in this instance; or he must seek elsewhere for redress. This Court can relieve him only upon the supposition that the State law under which he has been fined is inconsistent with some right secured to him, or secured to the United States, under the constitution. Now, the United States complain of nothing; the act of Pennsylvania was a candid, spontaneous, ancillary effort in the service of the United States; and all the plaintiff in error has to complain of is, that he has been punished by a State law, when he ought to have been punished under a law of the United States, which he contends he has violated.\n I really have not been able to satisfy myself that it is any case at all for the cognizance of this Court; but from respect for the opinion of others, I will proceed to make some remarks on the questions which have been raised in the argument.\n Why may not the same offence be made punishable both under the laws of the States, and of the United States? Every citizen of a State owes a double allegiance; he enjoys the protection and participates in the government of both the State and the United States. It is obvious, that in those cases in \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 34]\n\u00a0\n which the United States may exercise the right of exclusive legislation, it will rest with Congress to determine whether the general government shall exercise the right of punishing exclusively, or leave the States at liberty to exercise their own discretion. But where the United States cannot assume, or where they have not assumed, this exclusive exercise of power, I cannot imagine a reason why the States may not also, if they feel themselves injured by the same offence, assert their right of inflicting punishment also. In cases affecting life or member, there is an express restraint upon the exercise of the punishing power. But it is a restriction which operates equally upon both governments; and according to a very familiar principle of construction, this exception would seem to establish the existence of the general right. The actual exercise of this concurrent right of punishing is familiar to every day's practice. The laws of the United States have made many offences punishable in their Courts, which were and still continue punishable under the laws of the States. Witness the case of counterfeiting the current coin of the United States, under the act of April 21st, 1806, in which the State right of punishing is expressly recognized and preserved. Witness also the crime of robbing the mail on the highway, which is unquestionably cognizable as highway-robbery under the State laws, although made punishable under those of the United States.\n With regard to militia men ordered into service, there exists a peculiar propriety in leaving them subject to the coercive regulations of both governments. \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 35]\n\u00a0\n The safety of each is so worked up with that of all the States, and the honour and peculiar safety of a particular State may so often be dependant upon the alacrity with which her citizens repair to the field, that the most serious mortifications and evils might result from refusing the right of lending the strength of the State authority to quicken their obedience to the calls of the United States.\n But, it is contended, if the States can at all legislate or adjudicate on the subject, they may affect to aid, when their real object is nothing less than to embarrass, the progress of the general government.\n I acknowledge myself at a loss to imagine how this could ever be successfully attempted. Opposition, whether disguised or real, is the same thing. It is true, if we could admit that an acquittal in the State Courts could be pleaded in bar to a prosecution in the Courts of the United States, the evil might occur. But this is a doctrine which can only be maintained on the ground that an offence against the laws of the one government, is an offence against the other government; and can surely never be successfully asserted in any instances but those in which jurisdiction is vested in the State Courts by statutory provisions of the United States. In contracts, the law is otherwise. The decision of any Court of competent jurisdiction is final, whatever be the government that gives existence to the Court. But crimes against a government are only cognizable in its own Courts, or in those which derive their right of holding jurisdiction from the offended government. \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 36]\n\u00a0\n Yet, were it otherwise, I cannot perceive with what correctness we can, from the possible abuse of a power, reason away the actual possession of it in the States. Such considerations were only proper for the ears of those who established the actual distribution of powers between the States and the United States. The absurdities that might grow out of an affected co-operation in the States, with a real view to produce embarrassment, furnish the best guaranty against the probability of its ever being attempted, and the surest means of detecting and defeating it. We may declare defects in the constitution, without being justly chargeable with creating them; but if they exist, it is not for us to correct them. In the present instance, I believe the danger imaginary, and if it is not, it must pass ad aliud examen.\n But whatever be the views entertained on this question, I am perfectly satisfied that the individual in this case was not amenable to any law of the United States. Both that there was no law of the United States that reached his case, and that there was nothing done or intended to be done by the government of the United States, to bring him within their laws, before he reached the place of rendezvous.\n It is obvious that there are two ways by which the militia may be called into service; the one is under State authority, the other under authority of the United States. The power of Congress over the militia is limited but by two reservations in favour of the States, viz. the right of officering and that of training them. When distributed by the States under their own officers the general government have \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 37]\n\u00a0\n the right, if they choose to exercise it, of designating both the officer and private who shall serve, and to call him forth or punish him for not coming. But the possession of this power, or even the passing of laws in the exercise of it, does not preclude the general government from leaning upon the State authority, if they think proper, for the purpose of calling the militia into service. They may command or request; and in the case before us, they obviously confined themselves to the latter mode. Indeed, extensive as their power over the militia is, the United States are obviously intended to be made in some measure dependant upon the States for the aid of this species of force. For, if the States will not officer or train their men, there is no power given to Congress to supply the deficiency.\n The method of calling forth the militia by requisition, is, it is believed, the only one hitherto resorted to in any instance. Being partially dependant upon the integrity of the States, the general government has hitherto been satisfied to rest wholly on that integrity, and, except in very few instances, has never been disappointed. The compulsory power has been in its practice held in reserve, as only intended for use when the other shall fail. Historically it is known that the act of 1795 was passed with a view to a state of things then existing in the interior of Pennsylvania, when it became probable that the President of the United States would have to exert the authority of the general government immediately on detached portions of the officers or militia of the Union, to aid in the execution of the laws of \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 38]\n\u00a0\n the United States. And instances may still occur in which the exercise of that power may become necessary for the same purpose. But, whenever bodies of militia have been called forth for the purposes of general defence, it is believed, that in no instance has it been done otherwise than by requisition, the only mode practised toward the States from the commencement of the revolution to the present day. That it was the mode intended to be pursued in this case, is obvious from the perusal of the letter of the Secretary of War to the Governor of Pennsylvania.k The words made use of are: 'The President\n k Letter from the Secretary of War, to the Governor of Pennsylvania.\n'War Department, July 4, 1814.\n\n'SIR,\n\n'The late pacification in Europe offers to the enemy a large disposable force, both naval and military, and with it the means of giving to the war here, a character of new and increased activity and extent.\n\n'Without knowing, with certainty, that such will be its application, and still less, that any particular point or points will become objects of attack; the President has deemed it advisable, as a measure of precaution, to strengthen ourselves on the line of the Atlantic; and (as the principal means of doing this will be found in the militia) to invite the executives of certain States to organize and hold in readiness for immediate service a corps of ninety-three thousand five hundred men, under the laws of the 28th of February, 1795, and the 18th of April, 1814.\n\n'The enclosed detail will show your Excellency what, under this requisition, will be the quota of Pennsylvania. As far as volunteer uniform companies can be found, they will be preferred. The expediency of regarding (as well in the designations of the militia, as of their places of rendezvous,) the points, the importance or exposure of which will be most likely to attract the views of the enemy, need but be suggested.\n\n'A report of the organization of your quota, when completed, and of its place, or places of rendezvous, will be acceptable.\n\n'I have the honour to be, &c.\n\n (Signed) 'JOHN ARMSTRONG.\n'P. S. The points to be defended, by the quota from Pennsylvania, will be the shores of the Delaware, Baltimore, and this city.' \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 39]\n\u00a0\n has deemed it advisable to invite the Executives of certain States to organize,' &c.: Words which no military man would construe into a military command.\n\n It is true, that this letter also refers to the acts of 1795 and 1814, as the authority under which the requisition is made, and the act of 1795 authorises the President to issue his order for that purpose: but this makes no difference in the case; it only leaves him the power of proceeding by order if he thinks proper, without enjoining that mode, or depriving him of the option to pursue the other mode as long as the principles upon which the States acted were such as to render it advisable. Or, if the construction be otherwise, the result only will be, that the President has not pursued the mode pointed out by that act, and, therefore, has not brought the case within it.\n But suppose the letter of the Secretary of War was intended by him to operate as an order, (although I cannot believe that Congress ever intended an order should issue immediately to the Governor of a \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 40]\n\u00a0\n State,) how is this individual made punishable under the acts of 1795 and 1814?\n The doctrine must be admitted, that Congress might, if they thought proper, have authorized the issuing of the President's order even to the Governor. For when the constitution of Pennsylvania makes her Governor commander in chief of the militia, it must subject him in that capacity ( at least when in actual service) to the orders of him who is made commander in chief of all the militia of the Union. Yet if he is to be addressed in that capacity, and not as the general organ or representative of the State sovereignty, surely he has a right to be apprised of it. But is he then to be charged as a delinquent? Where is the law that has provided, or can provide, a Court Martial for his trial? And where is the law that would oblige him to consider such a letter as this a military order? It would then seem somewhat strange, if he, to whom this letter was immediately addressed, received no order from the President, that one to whom his order was transmitted through fifty grades, should yet be adjudged to have disobeyed the President's order.\n But the situation of the private in this case, is still more favourable. It must be recollected we are now construing a penal statute. And the criminality of the person charged, depends altogether on the 5th section of the act of 1795. The 1st section of the act of 1814, makes no difference in this particular, inasmuch as it does no more than create a tribunal for the trial of crimes, and supposes the commission of such crimes to be against the provisions of some existing law. The command of the President then, \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 41]\n\u00a0\n I hold to have been indispensable to the creation of an offence under the 5th section of this act. But how the President could, in the actual state of things, have issued such a command to the private, consistently with the provisions of this act, it is not easy to show. For, by the section immediately preceding the 5th, it is provided, 'That no officer, non- commissioned officer or private of the militia, shall be compelled to serve more than three months, after his arrival at the place of rendezvous, in any one year, nor more than in due rotation with every other able bodied man of the same rank in the battalion to which he belongs.' Now, what was meant by due rotation? and how was the President's order to reach the individual without previously establishing this due rotation? I admit, that this rotation may have been established, through the aid of a State law; but it became indispensable that such law should have been authorized or adopted by some law of Congress; and there exists no law that I know of, either authorizing or requiring the designation or distribution by the States, which this law contemplates. On a call of the whole militia, there would have been no difficulty; but in the case of a partial call, some designation legally known to the President became indispensable, before he could issue his orders with that precision which may well be required in a criminal prosecution. And this probably operated as forcibly as considerations of comity, in determining the government to proceed by the ancient mode of requisition, instead of addressing the executive of Pennsylvania in the language of command and authority; \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 42]\n\u00a0\n if, indeed, (what I will not readily admit,) the act was ever intended to apply to the case of an immediate order to the executive.\n Pursuing the same course of reasoning a little further, we shall also be led to the conclusion, that neither could there be a Court constituted by a law of the United States for the trial of this offender. I hold it unquestionable, that whenever, in the statutes of any government, a general reference is made to law, either implicitly or expressly, that it can only relate to the laws of the government making this reference. Now the only act which it is pretended vests any Court with jurisdiction of offences created by the 5th section of the act of 1795, as to persons not yet mustered into service, is the 1st section of the act of 1814. The 4th and 6th sections of the act of 1795, taken together, furnish Courts Martial for the trial of offences committed by militia employed by the United States; and the act of 1814, I admit, was intended to act upon the offences of those who were not yet in actual service, but had been called into service. Can it, on any legal principle, be so construed as to answer the end proposed? The words are, 'That Courts Martial for the trial of militia, drafted, detached and called forth for the service of the United States, shall be appointed,' &c. But how drafted, detached, and called forth? Under the laws of the United States, or of Russia? For the laws of the States, unless adopted by Congress, are no more the laws of the United States than those of any foreign power. There is nothing in this act, or any other act, that designates the drafting, and detaching, or \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 43]\n\u00a0\n calling forth, these expressed as the grounds of jurisdiction, as a drafting, &c. under the laws of a State. Nor would it have had such a drafting, &c. in view, if it was intended to provide for punishing offences against the provisions of the act of 1795; for, in that act it is required to be a calling forth by the President, not by State authority. And this suggests the only reasonable exposition that can be given it, consistent with the principle, that it must be a drafting, detaching, and calling forth under laws of the United States. If we can find a sensible and consistent exposition, we are bound to adopt it as the only one intended.\n I have no doubt, that under the powers given the President by the act of 1795, and under the restriction contained in the 4th section of that act, it was in the power of the President to have issued orders to the Adjutant General of Pennsylvania, to bring into the field this quota of militia, and to have prescribed the manner in which they should be drafted and detached; and had this been done, every thing would have been sensible and consistent, and the exigencies of both these laws would have been satisfied. It is obvious, that the act of 1814 recognizes the construction which makes the drafting, and detaching, as necessary to precede the calling forth; and if the power to call forth existed in the President alone, it would seem that the other subordinate, but necessary ancillary powers to which this act has relation, must have existed in him also, and could be exercised by him, or under his authority only. Under this view of the subject, I am of \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 44]\n\u00a0\n opinion, that a Court Martial constituted under this act of April 18th, 1814, could not legally have tried this individual, because he was not drafted and detached under the meaning of that act, taken in connexion with the act of 1795. Neither, in my opinion, was the calling forth such as was in the contemplation of that act. In addition to the reasons already given for this opinion, exists this obvious consideration. The calling forth authorized by that act is to be expressed by an order from the President. It is disobedience to such an order alone that is made punishable by that act. Now, though it be unquestionable that this order may be communicated through any proper organ, yet it must be communicated to the individual as an order from the President, or he is not brought within the enactment of the law, nor put on his guard against incurring the penalty. But, from first to last, the whole case makes out an offence against the orders of the Governor of Pennsylvania. It does not appear, that the order communicated to the individual was made to assume the form of an order from the President; and how, in that case, he could have been held guilty of having violated an order from the President, it is not easy to conceive.\n For these reasons I am very clearly of opinion, that neither the United States, nor the plaintiff in error, can complain of the infraction of any constitutional right, if the State did constitute a Court for trying offences against the laws of the United States, or ingraft those laws into its own code, and make offences against the United States punishable in its Courts; that if the individual has any cause of complaint, \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 45]\n\u00a0\n it is between him and his own State government: And that even were it otherwise, the plaintiff in error does not make out such a case here; inasmuch as the general government could not have had it in contemplation to bring into operation the penal provisions of the act of 1795, and if they had, that they did not pursue the steps indispensable for that purpose; therefore, that the Court Martial by which the plaintiff in error was tried, was really acting wholly under the authority of State laws, punishing State offences.\n But it is contended, that if the States do possess this power over the militia, they may abuse it. This is a branch of the exploded doctrine, that within the scope in which Congress may legislate, the States shall not legislate. That they cannot, when legislating within that ceded region of power, run counter to the laws of Congress, is denied by no one; but, as I before observed, to reason against the exercise of this power from the possible abuse of it, is not for a court of justice. When instances of this opposition occur, it will be time enough to meet them. The present was an instance of the most honourable and zealous co-operation with the general government. The legislature of Pennsylvania, influenced, no doubt, by views similar to those in which I have presented the subject, saw the defects in the means of coercing her citizens into the service; and, unwilling to bear the imputation of lukewarmness in the common cause, legislated on the occasion just as far as the laws of the United States were defective, or not brought into operation. And to vindicate her disinterestedness, she even gratuitously \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 46]\n\u00a0\n surrenders to the United States the fines to be inflicted. To have paused on legal subtleties with the enemy at her door, or to have shrunk from duty under shelter of pretexts which she could remove, would have been equally inconsistent with her character for wisdom and for candour.\n I will make one further observation in order to prevent myself from being misunderstood. I have observed, that the Governors of States, as military commanders, must be considered as subordinate to the President: I do not mean to intimate, nor have I the least idea, that the act of 1795 gives authority to the President to issue an order to a Governor in that capacity. I hold the opinion to be absurd; for he comes not within the idea of a militia officer in the language of that act. If he is so, what is his grade? He will not be included under any title of rank, known to the laws of the United States, from the highest to the lowest. And how is he to be tried? What is his pay?-what his punishment? An act which authorizes an order for militia, obviously authorizes a requisition. And if the purposes of the general government could as well be subserved by depending on the State authority for calling out the militia, there was no reason against resorting to that authority for the purpose. But the power of ordering out the militia is an alternative given to the President when the other is too circuitous or likely to fail. In that case, the President may address himself to the Executive; and having obtained through him the necessary information relative to the distribution and organization of the militia, may proceed, \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 47]\n\u00a0\n under his own immediate orders, to draft and detach the numbers wanted. And thus every thing in the act becomes sensible, consistent, and adequate to the purposes in view, with the sole defect intended to have been remedied by the 1st section of the act of 1814.\n In this case, it will be observed, that there is no point whatever decided, except that the fine was constitutionally imposed upon the plaintiff in error. The course of reasoning by which the judges have reached this conclusion are various, coinciding in but one thing, viz., that there is no error in the judgment of the State Court of Pennsylvania.\n\n Mr. Justice STORY.\n The only question which is cognizable by this Court upon this voluminous record, arises from a very short paragraph in the close of the bill of exceptions. It there appears that the plaintiff prayed the State Court of Common Pleas to instruct the jury, that the first, second, and third paragraphs of the 21st section of the statute of Pennsylvania of the 28th of March, 1814, 'so far as they related to the militia called into the service of the United States, under the laws of Congress, and who failed to obey the orders of the President of the United States, are contrary to the Constitution of the United States and the laws of Congress made in pursuance thereof, and are, therefore, null and void.' The Court instructed the jury that these paragraphs were not contrary to the constitution or laws of the United States, and were, therefore, not null and void. This opinion has been \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 48]\n\u00a0\n affirmed by the highest State tribunal of Pennsylvania, and judgment has been there pronounced in pursuance of it in favour of the defendant. The cause stands before us upon a writ of error from this last judgment; and the naked question for us to decide is, whether the paragraphs alluded to are repugnant to the constitution or laws of the United States; if so, the judgment must be reversed; if otherwise, it ought to be affirmed.\n Questions of this nature are always of great importance and delicacy. They involve interests of so much magnitude, and of such deep and permanent public concern, that they cannot but be approached with uncommon anxiety. The sovereignty of a State in the exercise of its legislation is not to be impaired, unless it be clear that it has transcended its legitimate authority; nor ought any power to be sought, much less to be adjudged, in favour of the United States, unless it be clearly within the reach of its constitutional charter. Sitting here, we are not at liberty to add one jot of power to the national government beyond what the people have granted by the constitution; and, on the other hand, we are bound to support that constitution as it stands, and to give a fair and rational scope to all the powers which it clearly contains.\n The constitution containing a grant of powers in many instances similar to those already existing in the State governments, and some of these being of vital importance also to State authority and State legislation, it is not to be admitted that a mere grant of such powers in affirmative terms to Congress, does, \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 49]\n\u00a0\n per se, transfer an exclusive sovereignty on such subjects to the latter. On the contrary, a reasonable interpretation of that instrument necessarily leads to the conclusion, that the powers so granted are never exclusive of similar powers existing in the States, unless where the constitution has expressly in terms given an exclusive power to Congress, or the exercise of a like power is prohibited to the States, or there is a direct repugnancy or incompatibility in the exercise of it by the States. The example of the first class is to be found in the exclusive legislation delegated to Congress over places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the State in which the same shall be, for forts, arsenals, dock-yards, &c.; of the second class, the prohibition of a State to coin money or emit bills of credit; of the third class, as this Court have already held, the power to establish an uniform rule of naturalization,l and the delegation of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.m In all other cases not falling within the classes already mentioned, it seems unquestionable that the States retain concurrent authority with Congress, not only upon the letter and spirit of the eleventh amendment of the constitution, but upon the soundest principles of general reasoning. There is this reserve, however, that in cases of concurrent authority, where the laws of the States and of the Union are in direct and manifest collision on the same subject, those of the Union being 'the supreme law of the land,' are of\n l Chirac v. Chirac, 2 Wheat. 259. 269.\n m Martin v. Hunter, 1 Wheat. 304, 337. And see The Federalist, No. 32. \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 50]\n\u00a0\n paramount authority, and the State laws, so far, and so far only, as such incompatibility exists, must necessarily yield.\n Such are the general principles by which my judgment is guided in every investigation on constitutional points. I do not know that they have ever been seriously doubted. They commend themselves by their intrinsic equity, and have been amply justified by the opinions of the great men under whose guidance the constitution was framed, as well as by the practice of the government of the Union. To desert them would be to deliver ourselves over to endless doubts and difficulties; and probably to hazard the existenc of the constitution itself. With these principles in view, let the question now before the Court be examined.\n The constitution declares, that Congress shall have power 'to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions;' and 'to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.'\n It is almost too plain for argument, that the power here given to Congress over the militia; is of a limited nature, and confined to the objects specified in these clauses; and that in all other respects, and for all other purposes, the militia are subject to the control and government of the State authorities. Nor can the reservation to the States of the appointment \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 51]\n\u00a0\n of the officers and authority of the training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress, be justly considered as weakening this conclusion. That reservation constitutes an exception merely from the power given to Congress 'to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia;' and is a limitation upon the authority, which would otherwise depend upon their own the appointment of officers. But the exception from a given power cannot, upon any fair reasoning, be considered as an enumeration of all the powers which belong to the States over the militia. What those powers are must other. Nor has Harvard College any surer title than constitutions; and what is not taken away by the Constitution of the United States, must be considered as retained by the States or the people. The exception then ascertains only that Congress have not, and that the States have, the power to appoint the officers of the militia, and to train them according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. Nor does it seem necessary to contend, that the power 'to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia,' is exclusively vested in Congress. It is merely an affirmative power, and if not in its own nature incompatible with the existence of a like power in the States, it may well leave a concurrent power in the latter. But when once Congress has carried this power into effect, its laws for the organization, arming, and discipline of the militia, are the supreme law of the land; and all interfering State regulations must necessarily be suspended in their operation. It would certainly seem reasonable, that in the absence \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 52]\n\u00a0\n of all interfering provisions by Congress on the subject, the States should have authority to organize, arm, and discipline their own militia. The general authority retained by them over the militia would seem to draw after it these, as necessary incidents. If Congress should not have exercised its own power, how, upon any other construction, than that of a concurrent power, could the States sufficiently provide for their own safety against domestic insurrections, or the sudden invasion of a foreign enemy? They are expressly prohibited from keeping troops or ships of war in time of peace; and this, undoubtedly, upon the supposition, that in such cases the militia would be their natural and sufficient defence. Yet what would the militia be without organization, arms, and discipline? It is certainly not compulsory upon Congress to exercise its own authority upon this subject. The time, the mode, and the extent, must rest upon its means and sound discretion. If, therefore, the present case turned upon the question, whether a State might organize, arm, and discipline its own militia in the absence of, or subordinate to, the regulations of Congress, I am certainly not prepared to deny the legitimacy of such an exercise of authority. It does not seem repugnant in its nature to the grant of a like paramount authority to Congress; and if not, then it is retained by the States. The fifth amendment to the constitution, declaring that 'a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,' may not, perhaps, be thought to have any important bearing \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 53]\n\u00a0\n on this point. If it have, it confirms and illustrates, rather than impugns the reasoning already suggested.\n But Congress have, also, the power to provide 'for governing such part of the militia as may be employed in the service of the United States.' It has not been attempted in argument, to establish that this power is not exclusively in Congress; or that the States have a concurrent power of governing their own militia when in the service of the Union. On the contrary, the reverse has been conceded both here and before the other tribunals in which this cause has been so ably and learnedly discussed. And there certainly are the strongest reasons for this construction. When the militia is called into the actual service of the United States, by which I understand actual employment in service, the constitution declares, that the President shall be the commander in chief. The militia of several States may, at the same time, be called out for the public defence; and to suppose each State could have an authority to govern its own militia in such cases, even subordinate to the regulations of Congress, seems utterly inconsistent with that unity of command and action, on which the success of all military operations must essentially depend. There never could be a stronger case put from the argument of public inconvenience, against the adoption of such a doctrine. It is scarcely possible, that any interference, however small, of a State under such circumstances in the government of the militia, would not materially embarrass, and directly, or indirectly, impugn the authority of the Union. In most cases there would be an utter repugnancy. \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 54]\n\u00a0\n It would seem, therefore, that a rational interpretation must construe this power as exclusive in its own nature, and belonging solely to Congress.\n The remaining clause gives Congress power 'to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.' Does this clause vest in Congress an exclusive power, or leave to the States a concurrent power to enact laws for the same purposes? This is an important question, bearing directly on the case before us, and deserves serious deliberation. The plaintiff contends, that the power is exclusive in Congress; the defendant, that it is not.\n In considering this question, it is always to be kept in view, that the case is not of a new power granted to Congress where no similar power already existed in the States. On the contrary, the States in virtue of their sovereignty, possessed general authority over their own militia; and the constitution carved out of that a specific power in certain enumerated cases. But the grant of such a power is not necessarily exclusive, unless the retaining of a concurrent power by the States be clearly repugnant to the grant. It does not strike me that there is any repugnancy in such concurrent power in the States. Why may not a State call forth its own militia in aid of the United States, to execute the laws of the Union, or suppress insurrections, or repel invasions? It would certainly seem fit that a State might so do, where the insurrection or invasion is within its own territory, and directed against its own existence or authority; and yet these are cases to which the power \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 55]\n\u00a0\n of Congress pointedly applies. And the execution of the laws of the Union within its territory may not be less vital to its rights and authority, than the suppression of a rebellion, or the repulse of an enemy. I do not say that a State may call forth, or claim under its own command, that portion of its militia which the United States have already called forth, and hold employed in actual service. There would be a repugnancy in the exercise of such an authority under such circumstances. But why may it not call forth, and employ the rest of its militia in aid of the United States, for the constitutional purposes? It could not clash with the exercise of the authority confided to Congress; and yet that it must necessarily clash with it in all cases, is the sole ground upon which the authority of Congress can be deemed exclusive. I am not prepared to assert, that a concurrent power is not retained by the States to provide for the calling forth its own militia as auxiliary to the power of Congress in the enumerated cases. The argument of the plaintiff is, that when a power is granted to Congress to legislate in specific cases, for purposes growing out of the Union, the natural conclusion is, that the power is designed to be exclusive.: That the power is to be exercised for the good of the whole, by the will of the whole, and consistent with the interests of the whole; and that these objects can no where be so clearly seen, or so thoroughly weighed as in Congress, where the whole nation is represented. But the argument proves too much; and pursued to its full extent, it would establish, that all the powers granted to Congress are \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 56]\n\u00a0\n exclusive, unless where concurrent authority is expressly reserved to the States. But assuming the States to possess a concurrent power on this subject, still the principal difficulty remains to be considered. It is conceded on all sides, and is, indeed, beyond all reasonable doubt, that all State laws on this subject are subordinate to those constitutionally enacted by Congress, and that if there be any conflict or repugnancy between them, the State laws to that extent are inoperative and void. And this brings us to a consideration of the actual legislation of Congress, and of Pennsylvania, as to the point in controversy.\n In the execution of the power to provide for the calling forth of the militia, it cannot well be denied, that Congress may pass laws to make its call effectual, to punish disobedience to its call, to erect tribunals for the trial of offenders, and to direct the modes of proceeding to enforce the penalties attached to such disobedience. In its very essence too, the offence created by such laws must be an offence exclusively against the United States, since it grows solely out of the breach of duties due to the United States, in virtue of its positive legislation. To deny the authority of Congress to legislate to this extent, would be to deny that it had authority to make all laws necessary and proper to carry a given power into execution; to require the end, and yet deny the only means adequate to attain that end. Such a construction of the constitution is wholly inadmissible.\n The authority of Congress being then unquestionable, let us see to what extent, and in what \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 57]\n\u00a0\n manner it has been exercised. By the act of the 28th of February, 1795, ch. 101., Congress have provided for the calling forth of the militia in the cases enumerated in the constitution. The first section provides, 'that whenever the United States shall be invaded, or be in imminent danger of invasion from any foreign nation, or Indian tribe, it shall be lawful for the President of the United States to call forth such number of the militia of the State or States, most convenient to the place of danger, or scene of action, as he may judge necessary to repel such invasion, and to issue his orders for that purpose, to such officer or officers of the militia as he shall think proper.' It then proceeds to make a provision, substantially the same, in cases of domestic insurrections; and in like manner, the second section proceeds to provide for cases where the execution of the laws is opposed or obstructed by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings. The fourth section provides, that 'the militia employed in the service of the United States shall be subject to the same rules and articles of war as the troops of the United States.' The fifth section (which is very material to our present purpose) provides, 'that every officer, non- commissioned officer, or private of the militia, who shall fail to obey any of the orders of the President of the United States, in the cases before recited, shall forfeit a sum not exceeding one year's pay, and not less than one month's pay, to be determined and adjudged by a Court Martial; and such officer shall, moreover, be liable to be cashiered by a sentence of a Court Martial, and be \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 58]\n\u00a0\n incapacitated from holding a commission in the militia for a term not exceeding twelve months, at the discretion of the said Court; and such non- commissioned officers and privates shall be liable to be imprisoned by a like sentence, on failure of payment of the fines adjudged against them, for one calendar month for every five dollars of such fine.' The sixth section declares, 'that Courts Martial for the trial of militia, shall be composed of militia officers only.' The seventh and eighth sections provide for the collection of the fines by the marshal and deputies, and for the payment of them when collected into the treasury of the United States.\n The 2d section of the militia act of Pennsylvania, passed the 28th of March, 1814, provides, 'that if any commissioned officer of the militia shall have neglected, or refused to serve, when called into actual service in pursuance of any order or requisition of the President of the United States, he shall be liable to the penalties defined in the act of Congress of the United States, passed on the 28th of February, 1795,' and then proceeds to enumerate them; and then declares, 'that each and every non- commissioned officer and private, who shall have neglected or refused to serve when called into actual service in pursuance of an order or requisition of the President of the United States, shall be liable to the penalties defined in the same act,' and then proceeds to enumerate them. And to each clause is added, 'or shall be liable to any penalty which may have been prescribed since the date of the passage of the said act, or which may hereafter be prescribed by any law \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 59]\n\u00a0\n of the United States.' It then further provides, that 'within one month after the expiration of the time for which any detachment of militia shall have been called into the service of the United States, by, or in pursuance of orders from the President of the United States, the proper brigade inspector shall summon a general, or a regimental Court Martial, as the case may be, for the trial of such person or persons belonging to the detachment called out, who shall have refused or neglected to march therewith, or to furnish a sufficient substitute, or who, after having marched therewith, shall have returned without leave from his commanding officer, of which delinquents, the proper brigade inspector shall furnish to the said Court Martial an accurate list. And as soon as the said Court Martial shall have decided in each of the cases which shall be submitted to their consideration, the president thereof shall furnish to the marshal of the United States, or to his deputy, and also to the comptroller of the treasury of the United States, a list of the delinquents fined, in order that the further proceedings directed to be had thereon by the laws of the United States may be completed.'\n It is apparent, from this summary, that each of the acts in question has in view the same objects, the punishment of any persons belonging to the militia of the State, who shall be called forth into the service of the United States by the President, and refuse to perform their duty. Both inflict the same penalties for the same acts of disobedience. In the act of 1795, it is the failure 'to obey the orders of the \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 60]\n\u00a0\n President in any of the cases before recited;' and those orders are such as he is authorized to give by the first and second sections of the act, viz. to 'call forth' the militia to execute the laws, to suppress insurrections, and repel invasions. In the act of Pennsylvania, it is the neglect or refusal 'to serve when called into actual service, in pursuance of any orders of the President,' which orders can only be under the act of 1795. And to demonstrate this construction more fully, the delinquent is made liable to the penalties defined in the same act; and this again is followed by a clause varying the penalties, so as to conform to those which from time to time may be inflicted by the laws of the United States for the same offence. So that there can be no reasonable doubt that the legislature of Pennsylvania meant to punish by its own Courts Martial, an offence against the United States created by their laws, by a substantial re-enactment of those laws in its own militia code.\n No doubt has been here breathed of the constitutionality of the provisions of the act of 1795, and they are believed to be, in all respects, within the legitimate authority of Congress. In the construction, however, of this act, the parties are at variance. The plaintiff contends, that from the time of the calling forth of the militia by the President, it is to be considered as ipso facto 'employed in the service of the United States,' within the meaning of the constitution, and the act of 1795; and, therefore, to be exclusively governed by Congress. On the other hand, the defendant contends, that there is no distinction between the 'calling forth,' and the 'employment \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 61]\n\u00a0\n in service' of the militia, in the act of 1795, both meaning actual mustering in service, or an effectual calling into service; that the States retain complete authority over the militia, notwithstanding the call of the President, until it is obeyed by going into service; that the exclusive authority of the United States does not commence until the drafted troops are mustered, and in the actual pay and service of the Union: and further, that the act of 1795 was never intended, by its language, to apply its penalties, except to militia in the latter predicament, leaving disobedience to the President's call to be punished by the States as an offence against State authority.\n Upon the most mature reflection, it is my opinion, that there is a sound distinction between the 'calling forth' of the militia, and their being in the 'actual service' or 'employment' of the United States, contemplated both in the constitution and acts of Congress. The constitution, in the clause already adverted to, enables Congress to provide for the government of such part of the militia 'as may be employed in the service of the United States,' and makes the President commander in chief of the militia, 'when called into the actual service of the United States.' If the former clause included the authority in Congress to call forth the militia, as being in virtue of the call of the President in actual service, there would certainly be no necessity for a distinct clause, authorizing it to provide for the calling forth of the militia; and the President would be commander in chief, not merely of the militia in actual service, but of the militia ordered into service. \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 62]\n\u00a0\n The acts of Congress, also, aid the construction already asserted. The 4th section of the act of 1795, makes the militia 'employed in the service of the United States,' subject to the rules and articles of war; and these articles include capital punishments by Courts Martial. Yet one of the amendments (art. 5.) to the constitution, prohibits such punishments, 'unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces,' or in 'the militia when in actual service, in time of war, or public danger.' To prevent, therefore, a manifest breach of the constitution, we cannot but suppose that Congress meant, (what, indeed, its language clearly imports,) in the 4th section, to provide only for cases of actual employment. The act of the 2d of January, 1795, ch. 74. provides for the pay of the militia 'when called into actual service,' commencing it on the day of their appearance at the place of rendezvous, and allowing a certain pay for every fifteen miles travel from their homes to that place. The 97th article of the rules and articles of war (act of 10th of April, 1806, ch. 20.) declares, that the officers and soldiers of any troops, whether militia or others, being mustered, and in the pay of the United States, shall, at all times, and in all places, 'when joined, or acting in conjunction with the regular forces' of the United States, be governed by these articles, and shall be subject to be tried by Courts Martial, in like manner with the officers and soldiers in the regular forces, save only that such Courts Martial shall be composed entirely of militia officers. And the act of the 18th of \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 63]\n\u00a0\n April, 1814, (ch. 141.) supplementary to that of 1795, provides for like Courts Martial for the trial of militia, drafted, detached, and called forth for the service of the United States, 'whether acting in conjunction with the regular forces or otherwise.' All these provisions for the government, payment, and trial of the militia, manifestly contemplate that the militia are in actual employment and service, and not merely that they have been 'called forth,' or ordered forth, and had failed to obey the orders of the President. It would seem almost absurd to say that these men who have performed no actual service, are yet to receive pay; that they are 'employed' when they refuse to be employed in the public service; that they are 'acting' in conjunction with the regular forces or otherwise, when they are not embodied to act at all; or that they are subject to the rules and articles of war as troops organized and employed in the public service, when they have utterly disclaimed all military organization and obedience. In my judgment, there are the strongest reasons to believe, that by employment 'in the service,' or, as it is sometimes expressed, 'in the actual service' of the United States, something more must be meant than a mere calling forth of the militia. That it includes some acts of organization, mustering, or marching done or recognised, in obedience to the call in the public service. The act of 1795 is not in its terms compulsive upon any militia to serve, but contemplates an option in the person drafted, to serve or not to serve; and if he pay the penalty inflicted \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 64]\n\u00a0\n by the law, he does not seem bound to perform any military duties.\n Besides, the terms 'call forth' and 'employed in service,' cannot, in any appropriate sense, be said to be synonimous. To suppose them used to signify the same thing in the constitution, and acts of Congress, would be to defeat the obvious purposes of both. The constitution, in providing for the calling forth of the militia, necessarily supposes some act to be done before the actual employment of the militia; a requisition to perform service, a call to engage in a public duty. From the very nature of things, the call must precede the service; and to confound them is to break down the established meaning of language, and to render nugatory a power without which the militia can never be compelled to serve in defence of the Union. For of what constitutional validity can the act of 1795 be, if the sense be not what I have stated? If Congress cannot provide for a preliminary call, authorizing and requiring the service, how can it punish disobedience to that call? The argument that endeavours to establish such a proposition, is utterly without any solid foundation. We do not sit here to fritter away the constitution upon metaphysical subtleties.\n Nor is it true that the act of 1795 confines its penalties to such of the militia as are in actual service, leaving those who refuse to comply with the orders of the President to the punishment that the State may choose to inflict for disobedience. On the contrary, if there be any certainty in language, the 5th section applies exclusively to those of the militia \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 65]\n\u00a0\n who are 'called forth' by the President, and fail to obey his orders, or, in other words, who refuse to go into the actual service of the United States. It inflicts no penalty in any other case; and it supposes, and justly, that all the cases of disobedience of the militia, while in actual service, were sufficiently provided for by the 4th section of the act, they being thereby subjected to the rules and articles of war. It inflicts the penalty too, as we have already seen, in the identical cases, and none other, to which the paragraphs of the militia act of Pennsylvania now in question pointedly address themselves; and in the identical case for which the present plaintiff was tried, convicted, and punished, by the State Court Martial. So that if the defendant's construction of the act of 1795 could prevail, it would not help his case. All the difficulties as to the repugnancy between the act of Congress and of Pennsylvania, would still remain, with the additional difficulty, that the Court would be driven to say, that the mere act of calling forth put the militia, ipso facto, into actual service, and so placed them exclusively under the government of Congress.\n In the remarks which have already been made, the answer to another proposition stated by the defendant is necessarily included. The offence to which the penalties are annexed in the 4th section of the act of 1795, is not an offence against State authority, but against the United States, created by a law of Congress, in virtue of a constitutional authority, and punishable by a tribunal which it has selected, and which it can change at its pleasure. \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 66]\n\u00a0\n That tribunal is a Court Martial; and the defendant contends, that as no explanatory terms are added, a State Court Martial is necessarily intended, because the laws of the Union have not effectually created any Court Martial, which, sitting under the authority of the United States, can in all cases try the offence. It will at once be seen that the act of 1795 has not expressly delegated cognizance of the offence to a State Court Martial, and the question naturally arises, in what manner then can it be claimed? When a military offence is created by an act of Congress to be punished by a Court Martial, how is such an act to be interpreted? If a similar clause were in a State law, we should be at no loss to give an immediate and definite construction to it, viz., that it pointed to a State Court Martial-And why? Because the offence being created by State legislation, to be executed for State purposes, must be supposed to contemplate in its execution such tribunals as the State may erect, and control, and confer jurisdiction upon. A State legislature cannot be presumed to legislate as to foreign tribunals; but must be supposed to speak in reference to those which may be reached by its own sovereignty. Precisely the same reasons must apply to the construction of a law of the United States. The object of the law being to provide for the exercise of a power vested in Congress by the constitution, whatever is directed to be done must be supposed to be done, unless the contratrary be expressed, under the authority of the Union. When, then, a Court Martial is spoken of in general terms in the act of 1795, the reasonable interpretation \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 67]\n\u00a0\n is, that it is a Court Martial to be organized under the authority of the United States-a Court Martial whom Congress may convene and regulate. There is no pretence to say, that Congress can compel a State Court Martial to convene and sit in judgment on such offence. Such an authority is no where confided to it by the constitution. Its power is limited to the few cases already specified, and these most assuredly do not embrace it; for it is not an implied power necessary or proper to carry into effect the given powers. The nation may organize its own tribunals for this purpose; and it has no necessity to resort to other tribunals to enforce its rights. If it do not choose to organize such tribunals, it is its own fault; but it is not, therefore, imperative upon a State tribunal to volunteer in its service. The 6th section of the same act comes in aid of this most reasonable construction. It declares that Courts Martial for the trial of militia shall be composed of militia officers only, which plainly shows that it supposed that regular troops and officers were in the same service; and yet, it is as plain that this provision would be superfluous, if State Courts Martial were solely intended, since the States do not keep, and ordinarily have no authority to keep, regular troops, but are bound to confine themselves to militia. It might with as much propriety be contended, that the Courts Martial for the trial of militia under the 97th article of the rules and articles of war, are to be State Courts Martial. The language of that article, so far as respects this point, is \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 68]\n\u00a0\n almost the same with the clause now under consideration.\n As to the argument itself, upon which the defendant erects his construction of this part of the act, its solidity is not admitted. It does not follow, because Congress have neglected to provide adequate means to enforce their laws, that a resulting trust is reposed in the State tribunals to enforce them. If an offence be created of which no Court of the United States has a vested cognizance, the State Court may not, therefore, assume jurisdiction, and punish it. It cannot be pretended that the States have retained any power to enforce fines and penalties created by the laws of the United States in virtue of their general sovereignty, for that sovereignty did not originally attach on such subjects. They sprung from the Union, and had no previous existence. It would be a strange anomaly in our national jurisprudence to hold the doctrine, that because a new power created by the constitution of the United States was not exercised to its full extent, therefore the States might exercise it by a sort of process in aid. For instance, because Congress decline 'to borrow money on the credit of the United States,' or 'to constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court,' or 'to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces,' or exercise either of them defectively, that a State might step in, and by its legislation supply those defects, or assume a general jurisdiction on these subjects. If, therefore, it be conceded, that Congress have not as yet legislated to the extent of organizing Courts Martial for the trial of offences created by the act of 1795, it is not conceded that \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 69]\n\u00a0\n therefore State Courts Martial may, in virtue of State laws, exercise the authority, and punish offenders. Congress may hereafter supply such defects, and cure all inconveniences.\n It is a general principle too in the policy, if not the customary law of nations, that no nation is bound to enforce the penal laws of another within its own dominions. The authority naturally belongs, and is confided, to the tribunals of the nation creating the offences. In a government formed like ours, where there is a division of sovereignty, and, of course, where there is a danger of collision from the near approach of powers to a conflict with each other, it would seem a peculiarly safe and salutary rule, that each government should be left to enforce its own penal laws in its own tribunals. It has been expressly held by this Court, that no part of the criminal jurisdiction of the United States can consistently with the constitution be delegated by Congress to State tribunals;n and there is not the slightest inclination to retract that opinion. The judicial power of the Union clearly extends to all such cases. No concurrent power is retained by the States, because the subject matter derives its existence from the constitution; and the authority of Congress to delegate it cannot be implied, for it is not necessary or proper in any constitutional sense. But even if Congress could delegate it, it would still remain to be shown that it had so done. We have seen that this cannot \n n Martin v Hunter, 1 Wheat. Rep. 304. 337. S. P. United States v. Lathrop, 17 Johns. Rep. 4. \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 70]\n\u00a0\n be correctly deduced from the act of 1795; and we are, therefore, driven to decide, whether a State can, without such delegation, constitutionally assume and exercise it.\n It is not, however, admitted, that the laws of the United States have not enabled Courts Martial to be held under their own authority for the trial of these offences, at least when there are militia officers acting in service in conjunction with regular troops. The 97th article of war gives an authority for the trial of militia in many cases; and the act of the 18th of April, 1814, ch. 141. (which has now expired,) provided, as we have already seen, for cases where the militia was acting alone. To what extent these laws applied is not now necessary to be determined. The subject is introduced solely to prevent any conclusion that they are deemed to be wholly inapplicable. Upon the whole, I am of opinion, that the Courts Martial intended by the act of 1795, are not State Courts Martial, but those of the United States; and this is the same construction which has been already put upon the same act by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.o\n What, then, is the state of the case before the Court? Congress, by a law, declare that the officers and privates of the militia who shall, when called forth by the President, fail to obey his orders, shall be liable to certain penalties, to be adjudged by a Court Martial convened under its own authority. The legislature of Pennsylvania inflict the same penalties for \n o Ex parte Bolson, 5 Hall's Amer. Law Journal, 476. \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 71]\n\u00a0\n the same disobedience, and direct these penalties to be adjudged by a State Court Martial called exclusively under its own authority. The offence is created by a law of the United States, and is solely against their authority, and made punishable in a specific manner; the legislature of Pennsylvania, without the assent of the United States, insist upon being an auxiliary, nay, as the defendant contends, a principal, if not a paramount, sovereign, in its execution. This is the real state of the case; and it is said, without the slightest disrespect for the legislature of Pennsylvania, who in passing this act were, without question, governed by the highest motives of patriotism, public honour, and fidelity to the Union. If it has transcended its legitimate authority, it has committed an unintentional error, which it will be the first to repair, and the last to vindicate. Our duty compels us, however, to compare the legislation, and not the intention, with the standard of the constitution.\n It has not been denied, that Congress may constitutionally delegate to its own Courts exclusive jurisdiction over cases arising under its own laws. It is, too, a general principle in the construction of statutes, that where a penalty is prescribed to be recovered in a special manner, in a special Court, it excludes a recovery in any other mode or Court. The language is deemed expressive of the sense of the legislature, that the jurisdiction shall be exclusive. In such a case, it is a violation of the statute for any other tribunal to assume jurisdiction. If, then, we strip the case before the Court of all unnecessary \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 72]\n\u00a0\n appendages, it presents this point, that Congress had declared that its own Courts Martial shall have exclusive jurisdiction of the offence; and the State of Pennsylvania claims a right to interfere with that exclusive jurisdiction, and to decide in its own Courts upon the merits of every case of alleged delinquency. Can a more direct collision with the authority of the United States be imagined? It is an exercise of concurrent authority where the laws of Congress have constitutionally denied it. If an act of Congress be the supreme law of the land, it cannot be made more binding by an affirmative re-enactment of the same act by a State legislature. The latter must be merely inoperative and void; for it seeks to give sanction to that which already possesses the highest sanction.\n What are the consequences, if the State legislation in the present case be constitutional? In the first place, if the trial in the State Court Martial be on the merits, and end in a condemnation or acquittal, one of two things must follow, either that the United States' Courts Martial are thereby devested of their authority to try the same case, in violation of the jurisdiction confided to them by Congress; or that the delinquents are liable to be twice tried and punished for the same offence, against the manifest intent of the act of Congress, the principles of the common law, and the genius of our free government. In the next place, it is not perceived how the right of the President to pardon the offence can be effectually exerted; for if the State legislature can, as the defendant contends, by its own enactment, make it a State offence, the pardoning power of the State \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 73]\n\u00a0\n can alone purge away such an offence. The President has no authority to interfere in such a case. In the next place, if the State can re-enact the same penalties, it may enact penalties substantially different for the same offence, to be adjudged in its own Courts. It if possess a concurrent power of legislation, so as to make it a distinct State offence, what punishments it shall impose must depend upon its own discretion. In the exercise of that discretion, it is not liable to the control of the United States. It may enact more severe or more mild punishments than those declared by Congress. And thus an offence originally created by the laws of the United States, and growing out of their authority, may be visited with penalties utterly incompatible with the intent of the national legislature. It may be said that State legislation cannot be thus exercised, because its concurrent power must be in subordination to that of the United States. If this be true, (and it is believed to be so,) then it must be upon the ground that the offence cannot be made a distinct State offence, but is exclusively created by the laws of the United States, and is to be tried and punished as Congress has directed, and not in any other manner or to any other extent. Yet the argument of the defendant's counsel might be here urged, that the State law was merely auxiliary to that of the United States; and that it sought only to enforce a public duty more effectually by other penalties, in aid of those prescribed by Congress. The repugnancy of such a State law to the national authority would, nevertheless, be manifest, since it would seek \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 74]\n\u00a0\n to punish an offence created by Congress, differently from the declared will of Congress. And the repugnancy is not in my judgment less manifest, where the State law undertakes to punish an offence by a State Court Martial, which the law of the United States confines to the jurisdiction of a national Court Martial.\n The present case has been illustrated in the argument of the defendant's counsel, by a reference to cases in which State Courts under State laws exercise a concurrent jurisdiction over offences created and punished by the laws of the United States. The only case of this description which has been cited at the bar, is the forgery of notes of the Bank of the United States, which by an act of Congress was punished by fine and imprisonment, and which under State laws has also been punished in some State Courts, and particularly in Pennsylvania.p In respect to this case, it is to be recollected, that there is an express proviso in the act of Congress, that nothing in that act should be construed to deprive the State Courts of their jurisdiction under the State laws over the offences declared punishable by that act. There is no such proviso in the act of 1795, and, therefore, there is no complete analogy to support the illustration.\n That there are cases in which an offence particularly aimed against the laws or authority of the United States may, at the same time, be directed against State authority also, and thus be within the\n p See White v. Commonwealth, 4 Binn. Rep. 418. Livingston v. Van Ingen, 9 Johns. Rep. 507. 567. \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 75]\n\u00a0\n legitimate reach of State legislation, in the absence of national legislation on the same subject, I pretend not to affirm, or to deny. It will be sufficient to meet such a case when it shall arise. But that an offence against the constitutional authority of the United States can, after the national legislature has provided for its trial and punishment, be cognizable in a State Court, in virtue of a State law creating a like offence, and defining its punishment, without the consent of Congress, I am very far from being ready to admit. It seems to me, that such an exercise of State authority is completely open to the great objections which are presented in the case before us. Take the case of a capital offence, as for instance, treason against the United States: can a State legislature vest its own Courts with jurisdiction over such an offence, and punish it either capitally or otherwise? Can the national Courts be ousted of their jurisdiction by a trial of the offender in a State Court? Would an acquittal in a State Court be a good bar upon an indictment for the offence in the national Courts? Can the offender, against the letter of the constitution of the United States, 'be subject for the same offence, to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb?' These are questions which, it seems to me, are exceedingly difficult to answer in the affirmative. The case, then, put by the defendant's counsel, clears away none of the embarrassments which surround their construction of the case at the bar of the Court.\n Upon the whole, with whatever reluctance, I feel myself bound to declare, that the clauses of the militia \n\n[18 U.S. 1, 76]\n\u00a0\n act of Pennsylvania now in question, are repugnant to the constitutional laws of Congress on the same subject, and are utterly void; and that, therefore, the judgment of the State Court ought to be reversed. In this opinion I have the concurrence of one of my brethren.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUGHBOROUGH v. BLAKE(1820)\n\nArgued: Decided: March 10, 1820\n\n\n March 7th.\n THIS case, which was an action of trespass\n March 7th. for the district of Columbia, to try the right of Congress to impose a direct tax on that district, and in which the Court below gave judgment for the defendant, was argued by Mr. Jones for the plaintiff, and by the Attorney General for the defendant.\n March 10th.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents to the consideration of the Court a single question. It is this: \n\n[18 U.S. 317, 318]\n\u00a0\n Has Congress a right to impose a direct tax on the District of Columbia?\n The counsel who maintains the negative has contended, that Congress must be considered in two distinct characters. In one character as legislating for the States; in the other, as a local legislature for the district. In the latter character, it is admitted, the power of levying direct taxes may be exercised; but, it is contended, for district purposes only, in like manner as the legislature of a State may tax the people of a State for State purposes.\n Without inquiring at present into the soundness of this distinction, its possible influence on the application in this district of the first article of the constitution, and of several of the amendments, may not be altogether unworthy of consideration. It will readily suggest itself to the gentlemen who press this argument, that those articles which, in general terms, restrain the power of Congress, may be applied to the laws enacted by that body for the district, if it be considered as governing the district in its character as the national legislature, with less difficulty than if it be considered a mere local legislature.\n But we deem it unnecessary to pursue this investigation, because we think the right of Congress to tax the district does not depend solely on the grant of exclusive legislation.\n The 8th section of the 1st article gives to Congress the 'power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises,' for the purposes thereinafter mentioned. This grant is general, without limitation as to place. It, consequently, extends to all \n\n[18 U.S. 317, 319]\n\u00a0\n places over which the government extends. If this could be doubted, the doubt is removed by the subsequent words which modify the grant. These words are, 'but all duties, imposts, and excises, shall be uniform throughout the United States.' It will not be contended that the modification of the power extends to places to which the power itself does not extend. The power then to lay and collect duties, imposts, and excises, may be exercised, and must be exercised throughout the United States. Does this term designate the whole, or any particular portion of the American empire? Certainly this question can admit of but one answer. It is the name given to our great republic, which is composed of States and territories. The district of Columbia, or the territory west of the Missouri, is not less within the United States, than Maryland or Pennsylvania; and it is not less necessary, on the principles of our costitution, that uniformity in the imposition of imposts, duties, and excises, should be observed in the one, than in the other. Since, then, the power to lay and collect taxes, which includes direct taxes, is obviously co-extensive with the power to lay and collect duties, imposts and excises, and since the latter extends throughout the United States, it follows, that the power to impose direct taxes also extends throughout the United States.\n The extent of the grant being ascertained, how far is it abridged by any part of the constitution?\n The 20th section of the first article declares, that 'representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included \n\n[18 U.S. 317, 320]\n\u00a0\n within this Union, according to their respective numbers.'\n The object of this regulation is, we think, to furnish a standard by which taxes are to be apportioned, not to exempt from their operation any part of our country. Had the intention been to exempt from taxation those who were not represented in Congress, that intention would have been expressed in direct terms. The power having been expressly granted, the exception would have been expressly made. But a limitation can scarcely be said to be insinuated. The words used do not mean, that direct taxes shall be imposed on States only which are represented, or shall be apportioned to representatives; but that direct taxation, in its application to States, shall be apportioned to numbers. Representation is not made the foundation of taxation. If, under the enumeration of a representative for every 30, 000 souls, one State had been found to contain 59,000, and another 60,000, the first would have been entitled to only one representative, and the last to two. Their taxes, however, would not have been as one to two, but as fifty-nine to sixty. This clause was obviously not intended to create any exemption from taxation, or to make taxation dependent on representation, but to furnish a standard for the apportionment of each on the States.\n The 4th paragraph of the 9th section of the same article will next be considered. It is in these words: 'No capitation, or other direct tax, shall be laid, unless in proportion to the census, or enumeration herein before directed to be taken.' \n\n[18 U.S. 317, 321]\n\u00a0\n The census referred to is in that clause of the constitution which has just been considered, which makes numbers the standard by which both representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the States. The actual enumeration is to be made 'within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct.'\n As the direct and declared object of this census is, to furnish a standard by which 'representatives, and direct taxes, may be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union,' it will be admitted, that the omission to extend it to the district or the territories, would not render it defective. The census referred to is admitted to be a census exhibiting the numbers of the respective States. It cannot, however, be admitted, that the argument which limits the application of the power of direct taxation to the population contained in this census, is a just one. The language of the clause does not imply this restriction. It is not that 'no capitation or other direct tax shall be laid, unless on those comprehended within the census herein before directed to be taken,' but 'unless in proportion to' that census. Now this proportion may be applied to the district or territories. If an enumeration be taken of the population in the district and territories, on the same principles on which the enumeration of the respective States is made, then the information is acquired by which a direct tax may be imposed on the district and territories, 'in proportion to the \n\n[18 U.S. 317, 322]\n\u00a0\n census or enumeration' which the constitution directs to be taken.\n The standard, then, by which direct taxes must be laid, is applicable to this district, and will enable Congress to apportion on it, its just and equal share of the burden, with the same accuracy as on the respective States. If the tax be laid in this proportion, it is within the very words of the restriction. It is a tax in proportion to the census or enumeration referred to.\n But the argument is presented in another form, in which its refutation is more difficult. It is urged against this construction, that it would produce the necessity of extending direct taxation to the district and territories, which would not only be inconvenient, but contrary to the understanding and practice of the whole government. If the power of imposing direct taxes be co-extensive with the United States, then it is contended, that the restrictive clause, if applicable to the district and territories, requires that the tax should be extended to them, since to omit them would be to violate the rule of proportion.\n We think, a satisfactory answer to this argument may be drawn from a fair comparative view of the different clauses of the constitution which have been recited.\n That the general grant of power to lay and collect taxes, is made in terms which comprehend the district and territories as well as the States, is, we think, incontrovertible. The subsequent clauses are intended to regulate the exercise of this power, not to withdraw from it any portion of the community. \n\n[18 U.S. 317, 323]\n\u00a0\n The words in which those clauses are expressed import this intention. In thus regulating its exercise, a rule is given in the 2d section of the first article for its application to the respective States. That rule declares how direct taxes upon the States shall be imposed. They shall be apportioned upon the several States according to their numbers. If, then, a direct tax be laid at all, it must be laid on every State, conformably to the rule provided in the constitution. Congress has clearly no power to exempt any State from its due share of the burden. But this regulation is expressly confined to the States, and creates no necessity for extending the tax to the district or territories. The words of the 9th section do not in terms require, that the system of direct taxation, when resorted to, shall be extended to the territories, as the words of the 2d section require that it shall be extended to all the States. They, therefore, may, without violence, be understood to give a rule when the territories shall be taxed, without imposing the necessity of taxing them. It could scarcely escape the members of the convention, that the expense of executing the law in a territory might exceed the amount of the tax. But be this as it may, the doubt created by the words of the 9th section, relates to the obligation to apportion a direct tax on the territories as well as the States, rather than to the power to do so.\n If, then, the language of the constitution be construed to comprehend the territories and district of Columbia, as well as the States, that language confers on Congress the power of taxing the district \n\n[18 U.S. 317, 324]\n\u00a0\n and territories as well as the States. If the general language of the constitution should be confined to the States, still the 16th paragraph of the 8th section gives to Congress the power of exercising 'exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever within this district.'\n On the extent of these terms, according to the common understanding of mankind, there can be no difference of opinion; but it is contended, that they must be limited by that great principle which was asserted in our revolution, that representation is inseparable from taxation.\n The difference between requiring a continent, with an immense population, to submit to be taxed by a government having no common interest with it, separated from it by a vast ocean, restrained by no principle of apportionment, and associated with it by no common feelings; and permitting the representatives of the American people, under the restrictions of our constitution, to tax a part of the society, which is either in a state of infancy advancing to manhood, looking forward to complete equality so soon as that state of manhood shall be attained, as is the case with the territories; or which has voluntarily relinquished the right of representation, and has adopted the whole body of Congress for its legitimate government, as is the case with the district, is too obvious not to present itself to the minds of all. Although in theory it might be more congenial to the spirit of our institutions to admit a representative from the district, it may be doubted whether, in fact, its interests would be rendered thereby \n\n[18 U.S. 317, 325]\n\u00a0\n the more secure; and certainly the constitution does not consider their want of a representative in Congress as exempting it from equal taxation.\n If it were true that, according to the spirit of our constitution, the power of taxation must be limited by the right of representation, whence is derived the right to lay and collect duties, imposts, and excises, within this district? If the principles of liberty, and of our constitution, forbid the raising of revenue from those who are not represented, do not these principles forbid the raising it by duties, imposts, and excises, as well as by a direct tax? If the principles of our revolution give a rule applicable to this case, we cannot have forgotten that neither the stamp act nor the duty on tea were direct taxes.\n Yet it is admitted, that the constitution not only allows, but enjoins the government to extend the ordinary revenue system to this district.\n If it be said, that the principle of uniformity, established in the constitution, secures the district from oppression in the imposition of indirect taxes, it is not less true, that the principle of apportionment, also established in the constitution, secures the district from any oppressive exercise of the power to lay and collect direct taxes.\n After giving this subject its serious attention, the Court is unanimously of opinion, that Congress possesses, under the constitution, the power to lay and collect direct taxes within the District of Columbia, in proportion to the census directed to be taken by the constitution, and that there is no error in the judgment of the Circuit Court.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","2":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOWINGS v. SPEED(1820)\n\nArgued: Decided: March 16, 1820\n\n\n March 13th.\n THIS cause was argued by Mr. B. Hardin, for the defendants, no counsel appearing for the plaintiff.\n March 16th.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an ejectment brought by the plaintiff in the Circuit Court of the United States, for the District of Kentucky, to recover a lot of ground lying in Bardstown. \n\n[18 U.S. 420, 421]\n\u00a0\n This town was laid off in 1780, on a tract of land consisting of 1000 acres, for which, in 1785, a patent was issued by the Commonwealth of Virginia to Bard and Owings. In 1788, the legislature of Virginia passed an act, vesting 100 acres, part of this tract, in trustees, to be laid off in lots, some of them to be given to settlers, and others to be sold for the benefit of the proprietors. The cause depends, mainly, on the validity of this act. It is contended to be a violation of that part of the Constitution of the United States, which forbids a State to pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts.\n Much reason is furnished by the record for presuming the consent of the proprietors to this law; but the Circuit Court has decided the question independently of this consent, and that decision is now to be reviewed.\n Before we determine on the construction of the Constitution in relation to a question of this description, it is necessary to inquire whether the provisions of that instrument apply to any acts of the State legislatures which were of the date with that which it is now proposed to consider.\n This act was passed in the session of 1788. Did the Constitution of the United States then operate upon it?\n In September, 1787, after completing the great work in which they had been engaged, the Convention resolved that the Constitution should be laid before the Congress of the United States, to be submitted by that body to Conventions of the several States, to be convened by their respective legislatures; \n\n[18 U.S. 420, 422]\n\u00a0\n and expressed the opinion, that as soon as it should be ratified by the Conventions of nine States, Congress should fix a day on which electors should be appointed by the States, a day on which the electors should assemble to vote for President and Vice President, 'and the time and place for commencing proceedings under this Constitution.'\n The Conventions of nine States having adopted the Constitution, Congress, in September or October, 1788, passed a resolution in conformity with the opinions expressed by the Convention, and appointed the first Wednesday in March of the ensuing year as the day, and the then seat of Congress as the place, 'for commencing proceedings under the Constitution.'\n Both Governments could not be understood to exist at the same time. The new Government did not commence until the old Government expired. It is apparent that the Government did not commence on the Constitution being ratified by the ninth State; for these ratifications were to be reported to Congress, whose continuing existence was recognised by the Convention, and who were requested to continue to exercise their powers for the purpose of bringing the new government into operation. In fact, Congress did continue to act as a government until it dissolved on the first of November, by the successive disappearance of its members. It existed potentially until the 2d of March, the day preceding that on which the members of the new Congress were directed to assemble.\n The resolution of the Convention might originally \n\n[18 U.S. 420, 423]\n\u00a0\n have suggested a doubt, whether the Government could be in operation for every purpose before the choice of a President; but this doubt has been long solved, and were it otherwise, its discussion would be useless, since it is apparent that its operation did not commence before the first Wednesday in March, 1789, before which time Virginia had passed the act which is alleged to violate the Constitution.\n In the trial of the cause, the defendant produced a witness to prove that the lot for which the suit was instituted, was a part of the 100 acres vested in trustees by the act of assembly. To this testimony the plaintiff objected, because the witness stated, that he had sold a lot in Bardstown, with warranty, and was in possession of another. He added, that no suit had been brought for the said lot, and that he was not interested in this suit. The Court admitted the witness, and to this opinion also a bill of exceptions was taken.\n It is so apparent that the witness had no interest in the suit in which he was examined, and it is so well settled that only an interest in that suit could affect his competency, as to make it unnecessary to say more, than that the Court committed no error in permitting his testimony to go to the jury.\n There was also an exception taken to the opinion of the Court in allowing the book of the board of trustees, in which their proceedings were recorded, and other records belonging to the corporation, to be given in evidence.\n The book was proved by the present clerk, who also proved the handwriting of the first clerk, and of \n\n[18 U.S. 420, 424]\n\u00a0\n the President, who were dead. The Trustees were established by the legislature for public purposes. The books of such a body are the best evidence of their acts, and ought to be admitted whenever those acts are to be proved. There was no error in the opinion admitting them.\n There is the less necessity in this case for entering more fully into this question, because the record contains other evidence of the facts, which the testimony, to which exceptions were taken, was adduced to prove.\n Judgment affirmed, with costs. \n\n\n\n","3":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. SMITH(1820)\nNo. 42\nArgued: Decided: February 25, 1820\n\n\n THIS was an indictment for piracy against the prisoner Thomas Smith, before the Circuit Court of \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 154]\n\u00a0\n Virginia, on the act of Congress, of the 3d of March, 1819, c. 76.a\n The jury found a special verdict as follows: 'We, of the jury, find, that the prisoner, Thomas Smith, in the month of March, 1819, and others, were part of the crew of a private armed vessel, called the Creollo, ( commissioned by the government of Buenos Ayres, a colony then at war with Spain,) and lying in the port of Margaritta; that in the month of March, 1819, the said prisoner and others of the crew mutinied, confined their officer, left the vessel, and in the said port of Margaritta, seized by violence a vessel called the Irresistible, a private armed vessel, lying in that port, commissioned by the government of Artigas, who was also at war with Spain; that the said prisoner and others, having so possessed themselves of the said vessel, the Irresistible, appointed their officers, proceeded to sea on a cruize, without any documents or commission whatever; and while on that cruize, in the month of April, 1819, on the high seas, committed the offence charged in the indictment, by the plunder and robbery of the Spanish vessel therein mentioned. If the plunder and robbery aforesaid be piracy under the act of the Congress of the United States, entitled, 'An act to protect the commerce of the\n a Which provides, (s. 5.) 'That if any person or persons whatsoever, shall, on the high seas, commit the crime of piracy, as defined by the law of nations, and such offender or offenders shall afterwards be brought into, or found in, the United States, every such offender or offenders shall, upon conviction thereof, before the Circuit Court of the United States for the District into which he or they may be brought, or in which he or they shall be found, be punished with death.' \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 155]\n\u00a0\n United States, and punish the crime of piracy,' then we find the said prisoner guilty; if the plunder and robbery, above stated, be not piracy under the said act of Congress, then we find him, not guilty.'\n The Circuit Court divided on the question, whether this be piracy as defined by the law of nations, so as to be punishable under the act of Congress, of the 3d of March, 1819, and thereupon the question was certified to this Court for its decision.\n Feb. 21st.\n The Attorney General, for the United States, contended, that Congress, by referring to the law of nations for a definition of the crime of piracy, had duly exercised the power given them by the constitution, 'to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and offences against the law of nations.' By this reference they adopt the definition of the offence given by the writers on public law. All these writers concur in defining it to be, depredation on the seas, without the authority of a commission, or beyond its authority.b If there be any defect of precision or slight uncertainty in the definitions of the crime of piracy given by different writers on the law of nations, it is no more than what is to be found in common law writers on the crime of murder. Yet we are constantly referred\n b Grotius de J. B. ac. P. l. 2. c. 15. s. 5. Puffendorf, l. 2. c. 2. s. 10. Vattel, Droit des Gens, l. 3. c. 15. s. 226. Bynk. Q. J. Pub. l. 1.

Transl. and the authorities there cited. \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 156]\n\u00a0\n by the legislature to the common law for the definition of murder and other felonies which are mentioned in statutory provisions. But there is no defect in the definition of piracy by the authorities to which we are referred by this act. The definition given by them is certain, consistent, and unanimous; and pirates being hostes humani generis, are punishable in the tribunals of all nations. All nations are engaged in a league against them for the mutual defence and safety of all. This renders it the more fit and proper that there should be a uniform rule as to the definition of the crime, which can only be drawn from the law of nations, as the only code universally known and recognized by the people of all countries.\n Mr. Webster, contra, argued, that the special verdict did not contain sufficient facts to enable the Court to pronounce the prisoner guilty of the offence charged. The facts found, do not necessarily infer his guilt, but, on the contrary, are consistent with his innocence; inasmuch as it appears that he was one of the crew of a vessel belonging to Buenos Ayres, although not acting at the time when the supposed offence was committed under the commission of that colony, but acting as a non-commissioned captor, and as such, seizing the property of Spanish subjects on the high seas. But even supposing the offence to be well found by the special verdict, it cannot be punished under this act, because the law is not a constitutional exercise of the power of Congress to define the crime of piracy. Congress is bound to define it \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 157]\n\u00a0\n in terms, and is not at liberty to leave it to be ascertained by judicial interpretation. To refer to the law of nations for a definition of the crime, is not a definition; for the very thing to be ascertained by the definition, is the law of nations on the subject. The constitution evidently presupposes that this crime, and other offences committed on the high seas, were not defined with sufficient precisich by the law of nations, or any other law, to form a rule of conduct; or it would merely have given Congress the power of punishing these offences, without also imposing upon it the duty of defining them. The writers on public law do not define the crime of piracy with precision and certainty. It was this very defect which rendered it necessary that Congress should define, in terms, before it proceeded to exercise the power of punishing the offence. Congress must define it as the constitution has defined treason, not by referring to the law of nations in one case, or to the common law in the other, but by giving a distinct, intelligible explanation of the nature of the offence in the act itself.\n Feb. 25th.\n\n Mr. Justice STORY delivered the opinion of the court.\n The act of Congress upon which this indictment is founded provides, 'that if any person or persons whatsoever, shall, upon the high seas, commit the crime of piracy, as defined by the law of nations, and such offender or offenders shall be brought into, or found in the United States, every such offender or offenders shall, upon conviction thereof, &c. be punished with death.' \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 158]\n\u00a0\n The first point made at the bar is, whether this enactment be a constitutional exercise of the authority delegated to Congress upon the subject of piracies. The constitution declares, that Congress shall have power 'to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and offences against the law of nations.' The argument which has been urged in behalf of the prisoner is, that Congress is bound to define, in terms, the offence of piracy, and is not at liberty to leave it to be ascertained by judicial interpretation. If the argument be well founded, it seems admitted by the counsel that it equally applies to the 8th section of the act of Congress of 1790, ch. 9. which declares, that robbery and murder committed on the high seas shall be deemed piracy; and yet, notwithstanding a series of contested adjudications on this section, no doubt has hitherto been breathed of its conformity to the constitution.\n In our judgment, the construction contended for proceeds upon too narrow a view of the language of the constitution. The power given to Congress is not merely 'to define and punish piracies;' if it were, the words 'to define,' would seem almost superfluous, since the power to punish piracies would be held to include the power of ascertaining and fixing the definition of the crime. And it has been very justly observed, in a celebrated commentary, that the definition of piracies might have been left without inconvenience to the law of nations, though a legislative definition of them is to be found in most municipal \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 159]\n\u00a0\n codes.c But the power is also given 'to define and punish felonies on the high seas, and offences against the law of nations.' The term 'felonies,' has been supposed in the same work, not to have a very exact and determinate meaning in relation to offences at the common law committed within the body of a county. However this may be, in relation to offences on the high seas, it is necessarily somewhat indeterminate, since the term is not used in the criminal jurisprudence of the admiralty in the technical sense of the common law.d Offences, too, against the law of nations, cannot, with any accuracy, be said to be completely ascertained and defined in any public code recognised by the common consent of nations. In respect, therefore, as well to felonies on the high seas as to offences against the law of nations, there is a peculiar fitness in giving the power to define as well as to punish; and there is not the slightest reason to doubt that this consideration had very great weight in producing the phraseology in question.\n But supposing Congress were bound in all the cases included in the clause under consideration to define the offence, still there is nothing which restricts it to a mere logical enumeration in detail of all the facts constituting the offence. Congress may as well define by using a term of a known and determinate meaning, as by an express enumeration of all the particulars included in that term. That is certain\n c The Federalist, No. 42. p. 276.\n d See 3 Inst. 112. Hawk. P. C. ch. 37. Moore, 576. \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 160]\n\u00a0\n which is by necessary reference made certain. When the act of 1790 declares, that any person who shall commit the crime of robbery, or murder, on the high seas, shall be deemed a pirate, the crime is not less clearly ascertained than it would be by using the definitions of these terms as they are found in our treatises of the common law. In fact, by such a reference, the definitions are necessarily included, as much as if they stood in the text of the act. In respect to murder, where 'malice aforethought' is of the essence of the offence, even if the common law definition were quoted in express terms, we should still be driven to deny that the definition was perfect, since the meaning of 'malice aforethought' would remain to be gathered from the common law. There would then be no end to our difficulties, or our definitions, for each would involve some terms which might still require some new explanation. Such a construction of the constitution is, therefore, wholly inadmissible. To define piracies, in the sense of the constitution, is merely to enumerate the crimes which shall constitute piracy; and this may be done either by a reference to crimes having a technical name, and determinate extent, or by enumerating the acts in detail, upon which the punishment is inflicted.\n It is next to be considered, whether the crime of piracy is defined by the law of nations with reasonable certainty. What the law of nations on this subject is, may be ascertained by consulting the works of jurists, writing professedly on public law; or by the general usage and practice of nations; or by judicial \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 161]\n\u00a0\n decisions recognising and enforcing that law. There is scarcely a writer on the law of nations, who does not allude to piracy as a crime of a settled and determinate nature; and whatever may be the diversity of definitions, in other respects, all writers concur, in holding, that robbery, or forcible depredations' upon the sea, animo furandi, is piracy. The same doctrine is held by all the great writers on maritime law, in terms that admit of no reasonable doubt.e The common law, too, recognises and punishes piracy as an offence, not against its own municipal code, but as an offence against the law of nations, (which is part of the common law ,) as an offence against the universal law of society, a pirate being deemed an enemy of the human race. Indeed, until the statute of 28th of Henry VIII. ch. 15. piracy was punishable in England only in the admiralty as a civil law offence; and that statute, in changing the jurisdiction, has been universally admitted not to have changed the nature of the offence.f Sir Charles Hedges, in his charge at the Admiralty sessions, in the case of Rex v. Dawson, (5 State Trials,) declared in emphatic terms, that 'piracy is\n e Santerna, (lib. 4. note 50.) for instance, says, 'Inter piratam et latronem, non sit alia differentia, nisi quia pirata depredator est in mari et potest dici fur et latro maris, quia latrocinium et furtum sicut fit in terra, sic fit in mari.' And Emerigon, (1 Emerig. Assur. ch. 12. s. 29. p. 523.) 'La piraterie est un brigandage sur mer. Le Brigandage, sur terre est appelle vol ou rapine.' So Straecha 'Piratae sunt latrones maritimi.'\n f Hawk. P. C. ch. 37 s. 2. 3 Inst. 112. \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 162]\n\u00a0\n only a sea term for robbery, piracy being a robbery committed within the jurisdiction of the admiralty.' Sir Leoline Jenkins, too, on a like occasion, declared that 'a robbery, when committed upon the sea, is what we call piracy;' and he cited the civil law writers, in proof. And it is manifest from the language of Sir William Blackstone,g in his comments on piracy, that he considered the common law definition as distinguishable in no essential respect from that of the law of nations. So that, whether we advert to writers on the common law, or the maritimo law, or the law of nations, we shall find that they universally treat of piracy as an offence against the law of nations, and that its true definition by that law is robbery upon the sea. And the general practice of all nations in punishing all persons, whether natives or foreigners, who have committed this offence against any persons whatsoever, with whom they are in amity, is a conclusive proof that the offence is supposed to depend, not upon the particular provisions of any municipal code, but upon the law of nations, both for its definition and punishment. We have, therefore, no hesitation in declaring, that piracy, by the law of nations, is robbery upon the sea, and that it is sufficiently and constitutionally defined by the fifth section of the act of 1819.\n Another point has been made in this case, which is, that the special verdict does not contain sufficient facts upon which the Court can pronounce that the\n g 4 Bl. Comm. 73. \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 163]\n\u00a0\n prisoner is guilty of piracy. We are of a different opinion. The special verdict finds that the prisoner is guilty of the plunder and robbery charged in the indictment; and finds certain additional facts from which it is most manifest that he and his associates were, at the time of committing the offence, freebooters upon the sea, not under the acknowledged authority, or deriving protection from the flag or commission of any government. If, under such circumstances, the offence be not piracy, it is difficult to conceive any which would more completely fit the definition.\n It is to be certified to the Circuit Court, that upon the facts stated, the case is piracy, as defined by the law of nations, so as to be punishable under the act of Congress of the 3d of March, 1819.h\n h To show that piracy is defined by the law of nations, the following citations are believed to be sufficient:\n Grotius (lib. 3. c. 3. s. 1.) says, 'Supra dicere incepimus justum bellum apud probos auctores dici saepe, non ex causa unde oritur, neque ut alias ex rerum gestarum magnitudine, sed ob peculiares quosdam juris effectus. Quale autem sit hoc bellum optime intelligitur ex hostium definitione apud Romanos jurisconsultos: Hostes sunt, qui nobis, aut quibus nos publice bellum decernimus; caeteri LATRONES aut PRAEDONES sunt, ait Pomponius (Dig. Lib. 50. tit. 16. l. 118.) nec aliter Ulpianus, (Dig. lib. 49. tit. 15. l. 24.) hostes sunt. quibus bellum publice populus Romanus decrevit, vel ipsi populo Romano; caeteri LATRUNCULI vel PRAEDONES appellantur. Et ideo, qui a latronibus captus est servus latronum non est, nec postliminium illi, necessarium est. Ab hostibus autem captus; puta a Germanis et Parthis et servus est hostium, et postliminio statum pristinum recuperat. Et Paulus, (Dig. lib. 49. tit. 15. l. 19. s. 2.) A piratis aut latronibus capti liberi permanent. Accedat illud Ulpiani; in civilibus dissentionibus quamvis saepe per eas respublica laedatur, non tamen in exitum reipublicae contenditur; qui in alterutras partes discedent, vice hostium non sunt eorum, inter quos jura captivitatum aut postliminiorum fuerint; et ideo captos, et venundatos, posteaque manumissos placuit supervacuo repetere a principe ingenuitatem, quam nulla captivitate amiserant. (Dig. lib. 49. tit. 15. l. 321. s. 2.')\n Grotius adds, (s. 2.) 'Illud tantum notandum, sub exemplo populi Romani quemvis intelligi, qui in civitate summum imperium habeat.'\n Again, he says, (s. 2.) 'Non autem statim respublica aut civitas esse desinit, si quid admittat injustum, etiam communiter; nec coetus PIRATARUM aut LATRONUM civitas est, etiamsi forte aequalitatem quandam inter se servent, sine qua nullus coetus posset consistere. Nam hi criminis causa sociantur; illi etsi interdum delicto non vacant juris tamen fruendi causa sociati sunt, et exteris jus reddunt, si non per omnia secundum jus naturae, quod multos apud populos ex parte quasi obliteratum alibi ostendimus, certe secundum pacta cum quibus que inita, aut secundum mores.' \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 164]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice LIVINGSTON dissented.\n In a case affecting life, no apology can be necessary for expressing \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 165]\n\u00a0\n my dissent from the opinion which has just been delivered. \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 166]\n\u00a0\n The only question of any importance in this case is, whether the act of the 3d of March, 1819, be a \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 167]\n\u00a0\n constitutional exercise of the power delegated to Congress of 'defining and punishing piracies?' \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 168]\n\u00a0\n The act declares, that any person who shall commit on the high seas the crime of piracy as defined by the \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 169]\n\u00a0\n law of nations, shall be punished with death. The special power here given to define piracy, can be attributed \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 170]\n\u00a0\n to no other cause, than to the uncertainty which it was known existed on this subject in the \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 171]\n\u00a0\n law of nations, and which it must have been the intention of the framers of the constitution to remove, \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 172]\n\u00a0\n by conferring on the national legislature the power which has been mentioned. It was well known to \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 173]\n\u00a0\n the members of the Federal Convention, that in treatises on the law of nations, or in some of them at \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 174]\n\u00a0\n least, definitions of piracy might be found; but it must have been as well known to them that there \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 175]\n\u00a0\n was not such a coincidence on this subject, as to render a reference to that code a desirable or safe mode \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 176]\n\u00a0\n of proceeding in a criminal, and espekcially in a capital case. If it had been intended to adopt the definition \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 177]\n\u00a0\n or definitions of this crime, so far as they were to be collected from the different commentators on \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 178]\n\u00a0\n this code, with all the uncertainty and difficulty attending a research for that purpose, it might as well \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 179]\n\u00a0\n at once have been adopted as a standard by the constitution itself. The object, therefore, of referring \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 180]\n\u00a0\n its definition to Congress was, and could have been no other than, to enable that body, to select from sources it might think proper, and then to declare, and with reasonable precision to define, what act or acts should constitute this crime; and having done \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 181]\n\u00a0\n so, to annex to it such punishment as might be thought proper. Such a mode of proceeding would be consonant with the universal practice in this country, and with those feelings of humanity which are ever opposed to the putting in jeopardy the life of a fellow-being, unless for the contravention of a rule which has been previously prescribed, and in language so plain and explicit as not to be misunderstood by any one. Can this be the case, or can a crime be said to be defined, even to a common intent, when those who are desirous of information on the subject are referred to a code, without knowing with any certainty, where it is to be found, and from which even those to whom it may be accessible, can with difficulty decide, in many cases, whether a particular act be piracy or not? Although it cannot be denied that some writers on the law of nations do declare what acts are deemed piratical, yet it is certain, that they do not all agree; and if they did, it would seem unreasonable to impose upon that class of men, who are the most liable to commit offences of this description, the task of looking beyond the written law of their own country for a definition of them. If in criminal cases every thing is sufficiently certain, which by reference may be rendered so, which was an argument used at bar, it is not perceived why a reference to the laws of China, or to any other foreign code, would not have answered the purpose quite as well as the one which has been resorted to. It is not certain, that on examination, the crime would not be found to be more accurately defined in the code thus referred to, than in any writer on the law \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 182]\n\u00a0\n of nations; but the objection to the reference in both cases is the same; that it is the duty of Congress to incorporate into their own statutes a definition in terms, and not to refer the citizens of the United States for rules of conduct to the statutes or laws of any foreign country, with which it is not to be presumed that they are acquainted. Nor does it make any difference in this case, that the law of nations forms part of the law of every civilized country. This may be the case to a certain extent; but as to criminal cases, and as to the offence of piracy in particular, the law of nations could not be supposed of itself to form a rule of action; and, therefore, a reference to it in this instance, must be regarded in the same light, as a reference to any other foreign code. But, it is said, that murder and robbery have been declared to be punishable by the laws of the United States, without an definition of what act or acts shall constitute either of these offences. This may be; but both murder and robbery, with arson, burglary, and some other crimes, are defined by writers on the common law, which is part of the law of every State in the Union, of which, for the most obvious reasons, no one is allowed to allege his ignorance in excuse for any crime he may commit. Nor is there any hardship in this, for the great body of the community have it in their power to become acquainted with the criminal code under which they live; not so when acts which constitute a crime are to be collected from a variety of writers, either in different languages, or under the disadvantage of translations, and from a code with whose provisions even professional \n\n[18 U.S. 153, 183]\n\u00a0\n men are not always acquainted. By the same clause of the constitution, Congress have power to punish offences against the law of nations, and yet it would hardly be deemed a fair and legitimate execution of this authority, to declare, that all offences against the law of nations, without defining any one of them, should be punished with death. Such mode of legislation is but badly calculated to furnish that precise and accurate information in criminal cases, which it is the duty, and ought to be the object, of every legislature to impart.\n Upon the whole, my opinion is, that there is not to be found in the act that definition of piracy which the constitution requires, and that, therefore, judgment on the special verdict ought to be rendered for the prisoner.\n CERTIFICATE. This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record of the Circuit Court of the United States for the district of Virginia, and on the question on which the Judges of that Court were divided in opinion, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, this Court is of opinion, that the offence charged in the indictment in this case, and found by the jury to have been committed by the prisoner, amounts to the crime of piracy, as defined by the law of nations, so as to be punishable under the act of Congress, entitled, 'an act to protect the commerce of the United States, and punish the crime of piracy.' All which is ordered to be certified to the Circuit Court for the district of Virginia.i\n i Vide APPENDIX, Note IV. for the new act of Congress on the subject of piracy, passed May 15, 1820. \n\nFootnotes\n Again, he says, (s. 2.) 'A latronibus captos capientium non fieri, supra dicentem audivimus Ulpianum. Idem captos a Germanos ait libertatem amittere. Atqui apud Germanos latrocinia, quae extra civitatis cujusque fines fiebant, nullam habebant infamiam, quae verba sunt Caesaris, etc. Idem alibi Cattos nobilem Germaniae populum latrocinia agitasse dicit. Apud eundem Garamantes latrociniis facunda gens; sed gens tamen. Illyrici sine discrimine maris proedas agere soliti; de iis tamen triumphus fuit; Pompeio de piratis non fuit. Tantum discrimen est inter populum quantumvis sceleratum et inter eos, qui, cum populus non sint, sceleris causa co iunt.' \"\"\"\"\"\"\n Again, he says, (lib. 3. c. 9. s. 16.) 'Eae vexo res quae intra presidia perductae nondum sunt, quanquam ab hostibus occupatae, ideo postliminii non egent, quia dominum nondum mutarunt, ex gentium jure. Et quae piratae aut latrones nobis eripuerunt non opus habent postliminis, ut Ulpianus et Javolenus responderunt; quia jus gentium illis non concessit ut jus domini mutare possint, &c. Itaque res ab illis captae ubicunque reperiunter vindicari possunt, nisi quod ex naturali jure alibi censuimus ei qui suo sumtu possessionem rei adeptus est tantum esse reddendum, quantum dominus ipse ad rem recuperandam libenter impensurus fuerat.'\n And (id. s. 17.) 'Potest tamen lege civili aliud constitui; sicuti lege Hispanica naves a piratis captae eorum fiunt, qui eas eripiunt piratis; neque enim iniquum est, ut privata res publicae utilitati cedat, presertim in tanta recuperandi difficultate. Sed lex talis non obstabit exteris, quo minus res suas vindicent.'\n Again; he says, (lib. 2. c. 17. s. 20.) 'Ex neglectu tenuntur reges ac magistratus, qui ad inhibenda latrocinia et piraticam non adhibent ea quae possunt ac debent remedia; quo nomine damnati olim ab Amphictionibus Scyrii. Quae potestatem predarum in maris ex hoste agendarum per codicillos plurimis dedissent, et eorum nonnulli res amicorum rapuissent, desertaque patriae mari vagarentur ac ne revocati quidem redirent, an rectores eo nomine tenerentur, aut quod malorum hominum usiessent opera, aut quod cautionem non exigissent. Dixi eos in nihil amplius teneri, quam ut noxios, si reperiri possent, punirent, aut dederent; praeterea in bona raptorum jus reddi curarent.' \n Again; he says, (Id. c. 18. s. 2, 3.) 'Piratae et latrones qui civitatem non faciunt, jure gentium niti non possunt, &c. Sed interdum tales qui sunt jus legationis nanciscuntur fide data, ut olim fugitivi in saltu Pyrenaeo.'\n Again; (lib. 3. c. 13. s. 15.) 'Repudiandus ergo Cicero (De Offic. lib. 3.cap. 29.) cum ait perjurium nullum esse predonibus pactum pro capite pretium non adservatur, nec si juratum quidem sit; quia pirata non sit ex perduellium numero desinitus, sed communis hostis omnium, eum quo nec fides esse debeat, nec jus jurandum commune, &c. Atque sicut in jure gentium constituto differe hostem a pirata verum est, et a nobis infra ostendetur; ita hic ea differentia locum habere non potest, ubi, etsi personae jus deficiat cum Deo negotium est; qua de causa juramentum voti nomine nuncupatur. Neque id quod sumit Cicero verum est, nullum esse cum praedone juris societatem. Nam depositum ex ipso gentium jure reddendum latroni, si dominus non apparet recte Tryphonino responsum est.' These passages abundantly show the opinion of Grotius, that piracy by the law of nations is the same thing as piracy by the civil law; and though he no where defines the crime, in precise terms, yet there seems to be no doubt as to what he understood to be comprehended in that crime. Piratae, latrones, praedones, are used to denote the same class of offenders; the first term being generally applied to robbers or plunderers on the sea, and the others to robbers or plunderers on land.\n The terms are, indeed, convertible in many instances in the civil law. Thus, in the title, De Lege Rhodia de Jactu, (Dig. lib. 14. tit. 2. s. 3.) it is said, 'Si navis a piratis redempta sit, Servius, Osilius, Labeo, omnes conferre debere aiunt. Quod vero praedones abstulerint, cum perdere cujus fuerit, nec conferendum ei qui suas merces redimerit.' \n Bynkershoek, (Quaest. Jur. Pub. lib. c. 17.) treating on the subject of piracy, says, 'interest scire qui piratae ac latrones sunt, nam ab his capta dominium non mutant neque adeo postliminio egent. Sic docet ratio; sic auctoritas juris in l. 19. s. 2. l. 24. and l. 27. de Capt. et Postlim. rev. (Dig. lib. 49. tit. 15.) et sic ex pactis quarandam gentium supra probavi. Non est igitur ut addam auctoritates Grotii de Jure B. et. P. l. 3. c. 9. s. 16. Alberici Gentilis de jure belli lib. 1. c. 4. Zoucheii de Jure feciali, p. 2. s. 8. qu. 15., aliorumque plurium in eandem sententiam. Qui autem nullius principis auctoritate sive mari sive terra, RAPIUNT, PIRATARUM PRAEDONUMQUE vocabulo intelliguntur.'\n Azuni (Part 2. c. 5. s. 3.) says, 'A pirate is one who roves the sea in an armed vessel without any commission or passport from any prince or sovereign state, solely on his own authority, and for the purpose of seizing by force, and appropriating to himself without discrimination, every vessel he may meet. For this reason pirates have always been compared to robbers. The only difference between them is, that the sea is the theatre of action for the one, and the land for the other.' (s. 11.) 'Thus, as pirates are the enemies of the human race, piracy is justly regarded as a crime against the universal laws of society, and is every where punished with death. As they form no national body, as they have no right to arm, nor make war, and on account of their indiscriminate plunder of all vessels are considered only as public robbers, every nation has a right to pursue, and exterminate them, without any declaration of war. For these reasons it is lawful to arrest them, in order that they may undergo the punishment merited by their crimes.' (s. 12.) 'Pirates having no right to make conquests, cannot, therefore, acquire any lawful property in what they take; for the law of nations does not authorize them to deprive the true owner of his property, who always retains the right of reclaiming it wherever it may be found. Thus, by the principles of common law, as well as the law of nature, at whatever period, or in whatever manner, things taken by a pirate may be recovered, they return again to their former owners, who lose none of their rights by such unjust usurpation.' (See Azuni, part. 2.c. 5. art. 3. p. 351. 361. Mr. Johnson's translation.) Lord Bacon, in his dialogue De Bello Sacro says, 'Indubitatum semper fuit, bellum contra piratas juste geri posse per nationem quamcumque, licet ab iis minime infestatam et laesam, &c. &c. Vera enim causa hujus rei haec est, quod piratae communes humani generis hostes sint; quos idcirco omnibus nationibus persequi incumbit, non tam propter metus proprios quam respectu faederis inter homines sociales. Sicut enim quaedam sunt foedera inscriptis et in tractatus redacta contra hostes particulares inita; its naturalis et tacita confoederatio inter omnes homines intercedit contra communes societatis humanae hostes.' (10 Bac. Works, 313, 314. edit. 1803.) \n Martens, in his Essay on Privateers, Captures and Recaptures, (c. 1. s. 1.) says, 'L'armateur differe du Pirate, (1.) Le premier est muni d'une commission ou de lattres de marque du souverain, dont le pirate est destitu e. (2.) L'armateur suppose le cas d'une guerre, (ou du moins celui de represailles,) le pirate pille au sein de la paix comme au milieu de la guerre. (3.) L'armateur s'oblige d'observer les ordonnances et les instructions qui lui ont et e donn ees, et de n'attaquer qu'en consequence de celles ci de l'ennemi, et ceux des vaisseux neutres qui font un commerce illicite, le pirate pille indistinctement les vaisseaux de toutes les nations, sands observer m eme les loix de la guerre.'\n Rutherforth (Inst. b. 2. c. 9. s. 9. p. 481.) speaking with reference to the law of nations, says, 'All wars of a nation against its external enemies are not public wars. To make a war a public one, both the contending parties must be public persons; that is, it must be a war of one nation against another, &c. Where a nation makes war upon pirates or other robbers, though these are external enemies, the war will be a mixed one; it is public on one side, because a nation or public person is one of the parties; but it is private on the other side, because the parties on this side are private persons, who act together occasionally, and are not united into a civil society. A band of robbers or a company of pirates may in fact be united to one another by compact, &c. But they are still, by the law of nature, only a number of unconnected individuals; and consequently, in the view of the law of nations they are not considered as a collective body or public person. For the compact by which they unite themselves is void, because the matter of it is unlawful, &c. &c. The common benefit which a band of robbers or a company of pirates propose to themselves consists in doing harm to the rest of mankind.' Woodeson, ( Lect. 34. vol. 2. 422.) treating on captures at sea, after stating that the law of nations is part of the laws of England, and that captures at sea may happen either by pirates, or by way of reprisal, or as prize of war, says, 'Piracy, according to the law of nations, is incurred by depredations on or near the sea, without authority from any prince or State.' He then quotes the opinion of Sir Leoline Jenkins with approbation, that it is piracy, not only when a man robs without any commission at all, but when, having a commission, he despoils those with whom he is not warranted to fight or meddle, such as are de legantia vel amicitia of the prince or state which hath given him his commission. He then adds: 'But according to the judgments of our domestic tribunals, a bare assault without taking or pillaging something away does not constitute the crime, though Molloy pretends, that by the law of nations it is otherwise. Yet it does not seem necessary that any person should be on board the pillaged yessel.' 'If these violations of property be perpetrated by any national authority, they are the commencement of a public war; if without that sanction, they are acts of piracy.' He then proceeds to state several cases which had arisen in the Admiralty of England, and sums up his remarks as follow: 'The foregoing particulars are the more deserving of consideration, because it seems agreed that when a piratical taking is ascertained, it becomes a clear and indisputable consequence that there is no transmutation of property. No right to the spoil vests in the piratical captor; no right is derivable from them to any recaptors in prejudice of the original owners. These piratical seizures being wholly unauthorized, and highly criminal by the law of nations, there is no pretence for devesting the dominion of the former proprietor. This principle, therefore, 'a piratis et latronibus capta dominium non mutant,' is the received opinion of ancient civilians and more modern writers, on general jurisprudence. \n The same doctrine was maintained in our Courts of Common Law long autecedent to the great cultivation and improvements made in the science of the law of nations. And he remarks in a note, (p. 427. note n.) 'I have looked into the indictment against Luke Ryan, tried at the Admiralty Sessions, March, 1782, for piracy, and who is alleged to have had a Dutch commission. He was indicted not for piracy generally by the law of nations, but for that, being a natural born subject, he piratically, &c. against the form of the statute.' From the whole scope of Mr. Woodeson's observations on the subject of piracy, it is very clear that he considered piracy, as punishable by the law of the admiralty, to be no other than piracy by the law of nations. The definition of piracy, and Mr. Woodeson's comments are cited with approbation by Mr. Gwillim in his late edition of Bacon's Abridgment. (5 Bac. Abr. 310. edit. 1807. London.)\nBurlamaqui (Part. 2. c. 7. s. 41.) says: 'Lastly, as to the wars of robbers and pirates, if they do not produce the effects above-mentioned, ( transmutation of property on capture,) nor give to those pirates a right of appropriating what they have taken, it is because they are robbers and enemies of mankind, and, consequently, persons whose acts of violence are manifestly unjust, which authorizes all nations to treat them as enemies.\n Thus far, the authorities cited are such as profess to treat of piracy in terms according to the law of nations, the notion of which was manifestly derived from the civil law, 'on which,' as Sir William Scott observes, (The Maria, 1 Rob. 340.) 'great part of the law of nations is founded.' Indeed, in the law of England, it is treated altogether as a civil law offence, and referred to that law for its definition and punishment. Piracies and depredations at sea, are capital offences by the civil law. (5 Bac. Abr. Piracy, 311. Edit. ubi supra, 3 Inst. 112. Hawk. P. C. c. 37. 2 East, P. C. 796. 4 Bl. Comm. 72.) The commentaries of the common law writers on the subject of piracy will be more fully considered hereafter.Let us now advert to the definitions of the civil law and maritime writers.\n In the Novels (Nov. 134. tit. 17. c. 13.) it is declared, 'Pro furto autem nolumus omnio quodlibet membrum abscindi, aut mori; sed aliter eum castigari. Fures autem vocamus qui occulte et sine armis hujusmodi delinquunt. Eos vero, qui violenter aggrediuntur aut cum armis aut sine armis in domibus aut itineribus aut IN MARI poenis eos legalibus subdi jubemus.' \n Calvinus, in his Lexicon Juridicum, says: 'Piratae dicuntur vel a Graeco ? Epavw, id a pirata, qui prius maria infestavit, vel a Graeco id est, transeo, quod conspecta insula in illam transirent, jam praedaturi. Hinc piratica ars est, quam exercent.' In the French Code des Prises, ( Edition of M. Dufriche Foulaines, Paris, 1804, tom. 1. p. 6.) the editor says: 'Le pirate est celui qui parcourt les mers avec une batiment arme sans commission ou patente d'aucune etat, dans la vue exclusive de s'approprier tous les navires par la force. La piraterie est un assassinat; tout puissance doit faire arreter et juger des pareils brigands, et en purger la terre.' Emerigon (Assur. tom. 1. c. 12. s. 28. p. 523.) says: 'Les Pirates sont ceux qui courent les mers sans commission d'aucun Prince ni Etat sonverain pour depreder les vaisseaux qu'ils rencontrent.' 'Les Ennemis sont ceux, qui autorises par un prince, on etat souverain font la guerre dans la forme etablie pan le droit des gens; au lieu que les Pirates sont de simples particuliers qui depredent le premier navire qu'ils recontrent.' 'Les hostilites se commettent de nation a nation; au lieu que la piraterie est un brigandage qui s'exerce sur mer par gens sans aveu, et d'une maniere furtive.' 'Les pirates sont ennemis du genre humain.' 'La piraterie, on le brigandage sur mer, est un delit contre la loi universelle des societies,' &c. And Emerigon fortifies his opinion on this subject, by citations from the civil law, from other maritime writers, and from Blackstone's Commentaries. It is plain, therefore, that he considered piracy as defined in the civil law, the maritime law, and the common law of England, as the same crime. \n Bouchard (cited in 1 Emerigon, c. 12. s. 28. p. 527.) 'Les pirates n'ont pas le droit des armes. Ce sont des voleurs et assassins qui ne forme pas un corps d'etat. Ennemis des toutes les nations contre lesquelles ils exercent indistinctement leurs brigandages, toutes les nations sont en droit de courir sus, et de les exterminer sans declaration de guerre.'M. Bonnemant, in his edition of the Chevalier De Habreu's treatise on maritime captures, (edit. 1802, Paris, part. 1. c. 1. s. 5. p. 15. note,) says, 'les pirates sont ceux dont la navigation, les actions et les entreprises ne sont autoris ees ni avonees par aucune puissance, qui agissent sur la propri et e publique et particuli ere contre le vaeu de toutes les nations.' And De Habreu himself (as translated by M. Bonnemant, Part 2.c. 6. s. 1. p. 100, 101.) says, 'Selon la d efinition de la prise, il par it que le droit d'armer en course n'appartient qu' a ceux qui sont ennemis autorises, appelles, en Latin, hostes. D'ou il s'ensuit que les brigands et les pirates sont exclus de ce droit; qu'ils ne peuvent pretendre aux privileges que les loix de la guerre accorde aux ennemis, et qu'au contraire ils m eritent d' etre punis rigoureusement comme les malfaiteurs, et qu'on est autoris e a se saisir de tous leurs biens.' 'De tous les tems les pirates out et e regardes comme des voleurs publics et des perturbateurs de la paix. C'est pour cela qu'il est libre a quiconque s'en saisit de leur oter la vie sans se rendre coupable d'injustice. La prejudice qu'ils causent a la tranquillit e publique, a la libert e du commerce, et a la  uret e de la navigation, a fait que toutes les nations se sont accord ees a les poursuivre et a les punir avec la plus grande rigueur.' \n Ferriere (Dict. du Droit. art. Pirates) says, 'Pirates sont des corsaires, ecumeurs de mer, qui font des courses sur mer sans aveuni autorit e du Prince ou du Souverain.'\n In the Encyclopedie des Sciences, &c. (Edit. 1765, art. Pirate,) it is said, 'On donne ce nom (Pirate) a des bandits, qui maitres d'une vaisseau vont sur mer attaquer les vaisseaux marchands pour les piller et les voler.'\n Valin (Trait e des Prises, c. 3. s. 2. p. 29.) says, 'Or la peine des pirates ou forbans est celle du dernier supplice, suivant l'opinion commune; parceque ce sont des ennemis declares de la societ e, des violateurs de la foi publique and du droit des gens, des voleurs publiques a main arm e et a force ouverte.'\n Straccha says, (De Naut. Part. 3. n. 30.) 'Inter Piratam et Latronem nulla alia est differentia nisi quia Pirata depraedator est in mari.' Casaregis (Disc. 64. n. 4.) says, 'Proprie pirata ille discitur qui sine patentibus alicujus principis ex propria tantum et privata auctoritate per mare discurrit depredendi caus a.'\n Dr. Brown (2 Civ. and Adm. Law, 461, 462.) says, 'Piracy is depredation without authority from any Prince or State, or transgression of authority by despoiling beyond its warrant.' 'Unlawful depredation is of the essence of piracy.'\n Beawes (Lex Mercatoria art. Piracy, p. 250.) says, 'A pirate is a sea thief, or an enemy of human kind, also aims at enriching himself by marine robberies committed either by force, fraud, or surprise, on merchants or other traders at sea.'\n Molloy (b. 1. c. 4. s. 1.) says, 'A pirate is a sea thief, or hostis humani generis, who, for to enrich himself either by surprise, or open force, sets upon merchants or others trading at sea, ever spoiling their lading, if by possibility they can get the mastery.'\n Marshall (Insur. c. 12. s. 11. p. 556.) says, 'The crime of piracy or robbery on the high seas, is an offence against the universal law of society.'\n It is also said in 16 Viner's Abridgment, (art. Pirate and Piracy, A. p. 556.) and in Cowell's Interpreter, (Pirate,) 'A pirate is now taken for one who maintains himself by pillage and robbery at sea.'\n Comyn's (Dig. Admiralty, E. 3.) defines piracy thus: 'Piracy is when a man commits robbery upon the sea;' and he cites as authority, 3 Inst. 113. and 1 Sir Leol. Jenk. 94. \n Lord Coke says, (3 Inst. 113. Co. Litt. 391.) 'This word pirate, in Latin, pirata, from the Greek word ?Elpa?n?, which again comes from ?Elpav, a transcendo mare, of roving upon the sea; and, therefore, in English, is called a rover and robber upon the sea.' Sir Leoline Jenkins, in his charge at the admiralty sessions in 1668, says: 'You are, therefore, to inquire of all pirates and sea rovers, they are in the law hostes humani generis, enemies, not of one nation, or of one sort of people only, but of all mankind. They are outlawed as I may say, by the laws of all nations; that is, out of the protection of all princes, and of all laws whatsoever. Every body is commissioned, and is to be armed against them as rebels and traitors to subdue and root them out. That which is called robbing upon the highway, the same being done upon the water, is called piracy. Now, robbery as it is distinguished from thieving or larceny, implies not only the actual taking away of my goods, while I am, as we say, in peace, but, also, the putting me in fear by taking them by force and arms, out of my hands, or in my sight and presence. When this is done upon the sea, without a lawful commission of war or reprisals, it is downright piracy.' Vol. 1. p. 86. \n Again; in another charge, he says, (vol. 1. p. 94.) 'The next sort of offences pointed at in the statute [28 Hen. VIII. ch. 15.] are robberies; and a robbery, when it is committed upon the sea, is what we call piracy. A robbery, when it is committed upon the land, does imply three things, 1. That there be a violent assault; 2. That a man's goods be actually taken from his person or possession; 3. That he who is despoiled be put in fear thereby. When this is done upon the sea, when one or more persons enter on board a ship with force and arms, and those in the ship have their ship carried away by violence, or their goods taken away out of their possession, and are put in fright by the assault, this is piracy; and he that does so is a pirate or a robber within the statute.'\n The statute of Henry VIII. here referred to, does not contain any description of piracy. Before that statute, piracy was only cognizable by the civil law in the Admiralty Court. But the statute gave the High Commission Court (created by that statute) jurisdiction of 'all treasons, felonies, robberies, murders, and confederacies committed in, or on the sea,' &c. The term piracy is not found in the statute, and it is only as a robbery upon the sea that the High Commission Court has jurisdiction of piracy. Sir Leoline Jenkins, therefore, refers to the civil law definition of the offence of piracy; for it is agreed on all sides, that the statute of Henry VIII. has not altered the nature of the offence. (See 1 Hawk. P. C. b. 1. c. 37.) \n Targa (as I find him quoted by his Spanish translator, Gison, Reflex. c. 61. De los Corsarios o Pyratas, for the original is not before me) says, 'Esta (depredacion) se comete de dos modos, o por causa de guerra declarada entre dos naciones, &c. o por modo de hurto violento como Ladrones del Mar y como hacen los robos en terra los salteadores de caminos; y esto se compuela con la authentica del Derecho Civil, (a) que distingue la pyrateria del robo,' &c. Again; 'A los pyratas como tambien a los salteadores de camino, enemigos comunes, opresores de la libertad y comercio, y como a violadores del derecho de las gentes, puede qualquiera oponerse y los ministros y subditos del principe pueden perseguir los y prender los aunque sea fuera del dominio y se hayan refugiado a los estados confinantes, sin que per esso quede violada la jurisdiccion; y presas que sean, se pendran en poder de la justicia de aquel Principe en cuyo estado han sido cogidos.' Again; 'Y assi concluyo, diciendo, que deben todos guardarse en el mar de Pyratas, y en la tierra de Ladrones; y todo aquel, que en el mar, playa, puerto, o otro seno de mar, o rio navigable, roba o apresa, ya sea amigo, estoes, enemigo no declarado, y tambien los paysanos, o enemigos propriamente tales, o con patente, estandarte, o sin el, o con engano, o fuerza, siemprees pyrata.' a Dig. lib. 49. tit. 15. l. 19. s. 2. \n Citations from civilians and maritime writers to the same effect might be multiplied; but they would unnecessarily swell this note. It remains only to notice the doctrines which have been held by the tribunals of Great Britain, and asserted by her common law writers on the subject of piracy.\n Hawkins (P. C. b. 1. c. 37.) says, 'A pirate at the common law is a person who commits any of those acts of piracy, robbery and depredation upon the high seas, which, if committed upon land, would have amounted to felony there.'\n From the terms of this definition, (if it may be so called,) it might be supposed, that by piracy at the common law, something was meant peculiar to that law, and not piracy by the civil law, or the law of nations. But that was certainly not the meaning of the writer. For it is perfectly well settled, that piracy is no felony at common law, being out of its jurisdiction; and before the statute of 28 Henry VIII. c. 15. it was only punishable by the civil law. That statute, however, does not (as has been already stated) alter the nature of the offence in this respect; and, therefore, a pardon of all felonies generally, does not extend to it. ( 2 East's P. C. 796. 1 Hawk. c. 37. s. 6. 8. 10. 1 Hale, 354. 2 Hale, 18. 3 Inst. 112.) And it was also determined in Rex v. Morphes, (Salk. 85.) that 'no attainder for piracy wrought corruption of blood, for it was no offence at common law. (2 East's P. C. 796. Co. Litt. 391. a.) The intention of Hawkins must have been to use the phrase 'at the common law' in its most comprehensive sense; in which sense the law of nations itself is a part of the common law; since all offences against the law of nations are punishable by the criminal jurisprudence of England. \n Blackstone, in the Commentaries, (4 Comm. 71. 73.) evidently proceeds upon this notion. He says, 'The crime of piracy, or robbery and depredation upon the high seas, is an offence against the universal law of society, a pirate being, according to Sir Edward Coke, hostis humani generis.' He goes on to remark, that every community hath a right to punish it, for it is a war against all mankind. He then gives the definition of piracy by Hawkins, as the definition of the common law; and then states the several statutes made in England on the subject of piracy, concluding thus: 'These are the principal cases in which the statute law of England interposes to aid and enforce the law of nations as a part of the common law, by inflicting an adequate punishment for offences against that universal law committed by private persons.'\n The state trials for piracy in the reign of William III. are entitled to great consideration, both from the eminent talents of the Judges who constituted the tribunal, and the universal approbation of the legal principles asserted by them. It is, also, worthy of remark, that in none of these indictments was there any averment that the prisoners were British subjects; and most of them were for piracies committed on foreign subjects and vessels. They were all framed as indictments at common law, or for general piracy, without reference to any British statute. \n In Rex v. Dawson and others, (8 William III. 1696. 5 State Trials, 1 edit. 1742.) the Court was composed of Sir Charles Hedges, Judge of the High Court of Admiralty, (as President,) Lord Chief Justice Holt, Lord Chief Justice Treby, Lord Chief Baron Ward, Mr. Justice Rookby, Mr. Justice Turton, Mr. Justice Eyre, Mr. Baron Powis, and Doctors Lane, King, and Cook, (Civilians.) Sir Charles Hedges delivered the charge to the grand jury, and among other things, directed them as follows: 'Now piracy is only a sea term for robbery, piracy being a robbery committed within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty. If any man be assaulted within that jurisdiction, and his ship or goods violently taken away without legal authority, this is robbery and piracy. If the mariners of a ship shall violently dispossess the master, and afterwards carry away the ship itself, or any of the goods, or tackle, apparel or furniture, with a felonious intention, in any place where the Lord Admiral hath, or pretends to have, jurisdiction, this is also robbery and piracy. The intention will, in these cases, appear, by considering the end for which the fact is committed, and the end will be known, if the evidence show you what hath been done. The King of England hath not only an empire or sovereignty over the British seas for the punishment of piracy, but in concurrence with other Princes and States, an undoubted jurisdiction and power in the most remote parts of the world. If any person, therefore, native or foreigner, Christian or Infidel, Turk or Pagan, with whose country we are in amity, trade or correspondence, shall be robbed or spoiled, in the narrow or other seas, whether the Mediterranean, Atlantic, r Southern, or any branches thereof, either on this or the other side of the line, IT IS A PIRACY, within the limits of your inquiry, and cognizable by this Court.' It seems impossible to doubt, that Sir Charles Hedges here understood piracy to be punishable by all nations, as a crime against the law of nations, and that its true definition is the same in the civil and common law, as in the law of nations, viz. robbery upon the seas; and that, as such, it was punishable by the British Courts in virtue of their general concurrent jurisdiction on the seas. \n In Rex v. Dawson and others, there were several indictments. 1. The first was for piracy in robbing and plundering the ship Gunsway, belonging to the Great Mogul and his subjects, in the Indian seas. 2. The second for piracy, in forcibly seizing and feloniously taking, stealing, and carrying away a merchant ship called the Charles 2d. belonging to certain of his majesty's subjects unknown, on the high seas, about three leagues from the Groyne in Spain. 3. The third was for piracy on two Danish ships. 4. The fourth for piracy on a Moorish ship. Dawson pleaded guilty; and the other prisoners not guilty, and were upon trial convicted, and all sentenced to death accordingly. It appeared in evidence that the prisoners were part of the crew of the Charles the 2d, and rose upon her near the Groyne, and afterwards ran away with her, and committed the piracies. The Solicitor General, in stating the case to the jury, said, 'They (the prisoners) are arraigned for a very high crime, a robbery upon the seas.' 'These are crimes against the law of nations, and worse than robbery on land.' Lord Chief Justice Holt, in delivering the charge to the jury, said, 'that there was a piracy committed on the ship Charles in most apparent by the evidence that hath been given; that is, a force was put upon the master, and some of the seamen on board her, who because they would not agree to go on a piratical expedition, had liberty to depart and be set ashore, &c. & c. So that I must tell you beyond all contradiction, the force put upon the captain, and taking away this ship, called the Charles 2d, is piracy.' \n On the trial of Kidd and others for piracy, &c. in 13th of William III. 1713, (5 State Trials, edit. 1742.) there were several indictments. 1. The first was against William Kidd for the murder of one W. Moore, on the high seas, near the coast of Malabar, in a vessel called the Adventure Galley, of which Kidd was commander. 2. The second was against all the prisoners for piracy in seizing and running away with a certain merchant ship called the Quedash Merchant, then being a ship of certain persons to the jurors unknown, (not stated to be British subjects,) upon the high seas about ten leagues from Cutsbeen in the East Indies. In fact, the vessel and cargo appeared by the evidence to belong to Armenian merchants, and then on a voyage from Bengal to Surat. Lord Chief Baron Ward, in charging the jury on this indictment said, 'the crime charged upon them ( the prisoners) is piracy, that is, seizing and taking this ship and the goods in it piratically and feloniously. This ship belonged to people in amity with the king of England.' 'If this was a capture on the high seas, and these were the goods of persons in amity with the king, and had no FRENCH PASS, then it is a plain piracy; and if you believe the witnesses, here is the taking of the goods and ship of persons in amity, and converting them to their own use. Such a taking as this would be felony; and being at sea, it will be piracy.' The prisoners were convicted and sentenced to death. There were four other indictments, three for piracy on Moorish ships, and one for piracy on a Portuguese ship; and all the prisoners were convicted and sentenced. Mr. Justice Turton in charging the jury on one of these indictments, said, 'pirates are called hostes humani generis, the enemies to all mankind.' \n The case of Rex v. Green (4 Anne, 1704. 5 State Trials, 573. edit. 1742.) was a libel or indictment in the Court of Admiralty in Scotland for piracy, manifestly treated both in the libel and the arguments as a crime against the law of nations, and as such, also against the law of Scotland.\n In Erskine's Institutes of the law of Scotland, in treating of the crime of piracy, the author says, 'piracy is that particular kind of robbery which is committed on the seas.' (Ersk. Inst. b. 4. tit. 4. s. 65.) He had in the preceding section, (64) declared that, 'robbery is truly a species of theft; for both are committed on the property of another, and with the same view of getting gain; but robbery is aggravated by the violence with which it is attended.' The definition of both these crimes seems not at all different from that of the common law.\n The foregoing collection of doctrines, extracted from writers on the civil law, the law of nations, the maritime law, and the common law, in the most ample manner confirms the opinion of the Court in the case in the text; and it is with great diffidence submitted to the learned reader to aid his future researches in a path, which, fortunately for us, it has not been hitherto necessary to explore with minute accuracy. \n\n\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. WILTBERGER(1820)\n\nArgued: Decided: February 18, 1820\n\n\n THIS was an indictment for manslaughter, in the Circuit Court of Pennsylvania. The jury found the defendant guilty of the offence with which he \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 77]\n\u00a0\n stood indicted, subject to the opinion of the Court, whether this Court has jurisdiction of the case, which was as follows:\n The manslaughter charged in the indictment, was committed by the defendant, on board of the American ship the Benjamin Rush, on a seaman belonging to the said ship, whereof the defendant was master, in the river Tigris, in the empire of China, off Wampoa, and about 100 yards from the shore, in four and a half fathoms water, and below the low water mark, thirty-five miles above the mouth of the river. The water at the said place where the offence was committed, is fresh, except in very dry seasons, and the tide ebbs and flows at, and above the said place. At the mouth of the Tigris, the government of China has forts on each side of the river, where customhouse officers are taken in by foreign vessels to prevent smuggling. The river at the mouth, and at Wampoa, is about half a mile in breadth.\n And thereupon, the opinions of the Judges of the Circuit Court, being opposed as to the jurisdiction of the Court, the question was by them stated, and directed to be certified to this Court.\n Feb. 14th.\n Mr. C. J. Ingersoll, for the United States, argued, that by the Constitution the judicial power extends to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, and Congress is invested with authority to define and punish piracies and other felonies committed on the high seas. The judiciary act of 1789, c. 20. s. 11. gives jurisdiction over these offences to the Circuit Court. The act of April 30th. 1790. c. 36. for \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 78]\n\u00a0\n the punishment of certain crimes against the United States, s. 12 provides for the punishment of manslaughter committed on the high seas.a But it is understood\n a The sections of this act commented on in the argument, are as follows:\n SEC.

The distinctions of homicide, as marked out by the common law, are unknown to the civil or Roman law. But when jurisdiction is given of murder committed on the high seas, &c. to a Court of Admiralty, the law defining the crime is to be derived from the common, and not from the civil law.d It is also objected, 2. That the local jurisdiction of the Chinese empire over the offence charged by the indictment, if found by the jury to have been committed within its territorial limits, necessarily excludes the jurisdiction of the Courts of this country over the offence.\n c The United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 626.\n d The United States v. M'Gill, 4 Dall. 426. 429. \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 82]\n\u00a0\n To this objection, it is answered, that by the principles of universal law, a qualified national jurisdiction and immunity extends to the ships of the nation, public and private, wherever they may be. As to public vessels, this immunity is unquestionable.e And even private vessels, though from the necessity of the case, subject to the revenue laws of the country where they may be, are yet in many respects exempted from the local jurisdiction. Minor crimes, which do not offend the safety or dignity of the local sovereignty, are usually left to the cognizance of the government to whose subjects the vessel belongs. Nor does this, in the slightest degree, affect the eminent domain and sover ignty of the foreign nation over its harbours and rivers.f But China herself disclaims jurisdiction in such cases, and renvoys them to the forum of the offending party.g The offence here, being\n e Vattel, L. 1. c. 19, s. 216.

The following extracts from this work were read at the argument, and it is thought their insertion here will not be unacceptable to the learned reader. \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 83]\n\u00a0\n committed by a citizen of the United States upon another citizen, on board a merchant vessel of this \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 84]\n\u00a0\n country, lying in the waters of a foreign country, which expressly disclaims jurisdiction of the case, it is dispunishable, unless it be punishable in the Courts of this country; and it appears at least questionable, whether there is any constitutional power in Congress to punish it, except in the mode already provided for, as an offence committed on the high seas. This brings us to the 3d objection, which is, that the offence was not committed 'on the high seas,' within the true intent and meaning of the act of April, 1790. c. 36. s. 12. In answer to this objection, it is insisted, that before the adoption of the present \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 85]\n\u00a0\n constitution, the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction extended every where on tide waters below low water mark.h The same extension has been given to the admiralty jurisdiction under the constitution.i The opposite argument is founded on the expression 'high seas,' as contradistinguished from that portion of the sea, where the tide ebbs and flows, but which is enclosed by head lands, or forms parts of rivers above their mouths. But the celebrated statutes of Richard II., regulating the admiralty jurisdiction, allow the Admiral to have cognizance of things done on the sea, 'sur le meer,' without the addition of high. The stat. 27 Eliz. uses the expression 'main sea.' The 28 Hen. VIII. c. 15., concerning the trial of crimes committed within the admiralty jurisdiction, uses the terms, 'in and upon the sea, or in any other haven, creek, river, or place, where the Admiral hath, or pretends to have, power, authority, or jurisdiction.'j The act of Congress of 1790. c. 9. uses the terms promiscuously, 'high seas,' (s. 8. s. 9.) 'the seas,' (s. 10.) 'the sea,' (s. 11.) 'high seas and seas,' (s. 12.) The term 'sea' is water, as contradistinguished from land. The term 'high sea,' does not necessarily import deep sea; although the classical writers frequently use the correspondent Latin word in that figurative \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 86]\n\u00a0\n sense; as altum aequor, altissimum flumen, &c. It is a common expletive applied, in both languages, to 'sea,' 'road,' 'crime,' and many other things. The contrary acceptation of the term 'high sea,' would exclude bays, arms of the sea, coves, belts, straits, estuaries, great rivers, and lakes. There is no other limit to the sea, but that where the tide ceases to ebb and flow, whether on the sea coast, or in bays and rivers. Even the English statutes of Richard II., made to restrict the admiralty jurisdiction, and in derogation of its ancient authority, give it cognizance of murders, &c. committed on board great ships in the streams of great rivers below the first bridges. So the French law gives the admiralty the same jurisdiction, as to rivers, for which we contend.k The case of the United States v. Bevans,l does not stand in our way, for the point now in question was not determined in that case.\n Mr. Sergeant, contra, stated, that the indictment in this case, pursuing the words of the act, charges the offence to have been committed upon the 'high seas.' It is of no consequence what may be the extent of the power given by the constitution to the government of the Union. The question is, to what extent has the power so given been exercised? It is not necessary, therefore, to inquire whether this was an offence within the admiralty jurisdiction. The only question is, whether it is within the true meaning \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 87]\n\u00a0\n of the act of Congress.m The offence in question, if committed at all, was not committed upon the high seas: whether these terms be considered in their ordinary sense; as used in foreign authorities of the law; as employed in acts of Congress; as used in the act in question; or as expounded by our own judicial decisions. 1. The national character of the ship or vessel in which the offence was committed, makes no difference in this case. A public armed vessel is a part of the national sovereign force, clothed with the sovereign character, and wherever she goes entitled to immunity. She is subject only to the jurisdiction of her sovereign, and is a part of his territory;n is exempt from visition and search, and governed by such laws as her sovereign may choose to give her. The immunity she enjoys does not depend upon the civil or admiralty law; but, like the privilege of an ambassador, or the immunity of troops on their passage, depends upon the law of nations. Every sovereign may refuse admission, but having admitted, is bound to respect. Still, it does not follow, that the Courts of her own country have jurisdiction on board of her. Be this as it may, a private ship has no such immunity. On the ocean she is bound to submit to visitation and search. In port, she is bound to submit to the local jurisdiction, and entitled to the benefit of the laws of the place. Those who are on board of her, incur the obligation\n m The United States v. Bevans, 3 Wheat. 336. 386.\n n The Exchange, 7 Cranch, 116. Speech of Mr. (now Chief Justice) MARSHALL, in the case of Nash alias Robbins APPENDIX, Note I. \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 88]\n\u00a0\n of a temporary allegiance, and are, in all respects, amenable to the laws of the country in which they are found; to its penal laws especially. The ocean, the high seas, are a common domain; and every ship, private as well as public, is there upon the territory the her sovereign; and amenable to no laws, but the laws of her sovereign, and the law of natious. It is from this principle that every nation derives its jurisdiction over the persons on board its ships: the spot they occupy in the common domain, is its own territory, and it has a right to give the law to it.o 2. The national character of the offender, or of the person offended, makes no difference. If the crew had all shipped in England, and been English subjects, they would have been equally entitled to protection, and equally amenable to our laws. If, upon the ocean, or high seas, a foreigner had been murdered, his death would have been equally avenged by our laws. If a foreigner on board this ship, had committed an offence, he would equally have been liable. It is not correct, then, to say, that personal jurisdiction is universal, as to citizens; nor that it does in no case extend to foreigners. 3. In the next place, the extent or true nature of the constitutional power is wholly immaterial in this case. That instrument had in view, 1st. To partition powers between the Union and the States; 2dly. To distribute powers among the different branches of the national government. The judicial power, in its exercise, is subordinate and auxiliary to the power of Congress. The whole\n o 1 Sir L. Jenkins' Works, 91. \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 89]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction has never been exercised. But the principle, in its application to the very case, has been decided in the case of the United States v. Bevans.p It follows, therefore, that the judicial authority is of no avail, unless there be a corresponding power in Congress; that as the judicial authority is unavailing without a legislative act, it is to the act of Congress alone we must look for the extent of the jurisdiction. When, therefore, the authority of the judiciary is declared to extend to all cases of 'admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,' it is to be extended only to such cases as Congress have power to provide for. The same power might be exercised through the medium of the State Courts, or omitted altogether. It follows, also, most indubitably, that the powers exercised by Congress, can receive no illustration from the powers given to the judiciary by the constitution; and we are thus happily relieved from the necessity of exploring the distant speculation of the ancient jurisdiction of the admiralty. 4. What, then, is the true meaning of the terms, on the 'high seas,' as used in the act of Congress? In their ordinary sense, they mean the open ocean, as distinguished from creeks, rivers, ports, and other bodies of water, inclosed and infra-territorial. The flow of the tide cannot be the true test; for then the sea would flow to the falls of Schuylkill and Delaware, and would comprehend a vessel moored at the wharf. If we refer to the authorities\n p 3 Wheat. 336. 386. \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 90]\n\u00a0\n of the English law, they are clear and uniform. The common lawyers never at any period denied the admiralty jurisdiction upon the 'high seas.' The civilians claimed a jurisdiction beyond what was conceded to them by the common lawyers, beyond the 'high seas;' in rivers, bays, &c. Thus, the very contest, in its origin, admitted that the 'high seas' were distinguishable from other waters. The statute 13 Richard II. confined the admiralty to things done upon the 'sea.'q The 15 Richard II. gave it criminal jurisdiction in homicide and mayhem on great rivers, &c.r The 27 Eliz. c. 11. is conclusive of the question.s Sir Leoline Jenkins makes the distinction expressly.t So, also, we have the authority of Lord Hale in many places;u and all the authorities agree that the divisum imperium is only upon the sea coast. The distinction is also perfectly understood and maintained in our own legislation; and the act now in question furnishes the clearest recognition of it, as will appear by a comparison of the 8th with the 12th section. In the 8th section, the distinction is made between the 'high seas,' and 'a river, haven, basin, or bay.' The latter expressions can never, by any fair rule of construction applied to penal statutes, be transferred from the 8th to the 12th section. In criminal cases, a strict construction is always to be preferred; and if there be \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 91]\n\u00a0\n doubt, that is of itself conclusive. In Bevan's case, the distinction between the high seas and other enclosed parts of the sea, was not denied by the counsel for the United States, and the Court do not even mention it as at all doubtful.v But, it is asked, whether the criminal jurisdiction of the admiralty is not as extensive as the civil? To which it is answered, that the criminal jurisdiction depends upon the place where the offense is committed; the civil, upon the nature of the subject; and there can, therefore, be no comparison of their extent.\n The Attorney General, in reply, insisted, that although penal laws are, to be construed strictly, the intention of the legislature must govern in their construction. If a case be within the intention and reason, it must be considered as within the letter, of the statute. This act having been passed by Congress on the first organization of the government, it must have been their intention to make the exercise of their power co- extensive with their jurisdiction; and to punish all the crimes enumerated, in every place within their jurisdiction. The act must, therefore, be construed so as to engraft the words of the 8th section, descriptive of the place in which murder may be committed, on the 12th section, which describes the place in which manslaughter may be committed. After expressing themselves fully in the previous section as to the places in which one of the crimes intended to be punished by the act must be committed, it was natural that the legislature \n\n\n[18 U.S. 76, 92]\n\u00a0\n should suppose the language engrafted into a subsequent section on a subject of the same class. Thus, the 1st section of the act defines the crime of treason, and provides, 'that if any person or persons owing allegiance to the United States of America, shall levy war,' &c. 'such person or persons shall be adjudged guilty of treason,' &c. The 2d section defines misprison of treason, and in specifying the persons who may commit the crime, omits the words 'owing allegiance to the United States,' and uses without limitation or restriction the general terms 'any person or persons.' Yet these general terms were obviously intended to be restrained by the words 'owing allegiance to the United States,' which are used in the preceding section. The crimes of murder and manslaughter are kindred offences, and are parts of the same general offence of homicide. Congress must have intended to make the same provision for their punishment, as to the places within which they must be committed in order to give jurisdiction to the Courts of the Union. Thus, the 3d section of the act describes the places on land in which murder must be committed in order to give those Courts jurisdiction of the offence; and the 7th section describes in the very same terms the places on land in which manslaughter must be committed in order to give them jurisdiction. Observe the consequences of a contrary construction as to murder alone. The 9th section extends the guilt of the offences enumerated in it to a citizen of the United States committing them under colour of a foreign commission. But this section, in describing \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 93]\n\u00a0\n the place where the offence may be committed, omits the words 'in any river, haven, basin, or bay,' and uses the words 'high seas' only. It is incredible that it was the legislative intention to distinguish between the same crime, committed under the pretext of authority by a foreign commission, on the high seas, and on the waters of a foreign State, or of the United States. So, also, the 10th section provides, 'that every person who shall, either upon the land or the seas, knowingly and wittingly aid and assist, procure, command, counsel, or advise, any person or persons, to do or commit any murder or robbery, or other piracy, aforesaid, upon the seas, which shall affect the life of such person, shall,' &c. Here Congress cannot have intended to exempt from punishment those persons who shall be accessaries before the fact to a murder or robbery committed 'in a river, haven, basin, or bay,' &c. A similar argument is applicable to the 11th section. As to the 12th section, beside the offence of manslaughter, the other offences which it enumerates are all accessorial to those mentioned in the 8th. It is, therefore, evidently connected with the 8th.\n Feb. 18th.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The indictment in this case is founded on the 12th section of the act, entitled, 'an act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States.' That section is in these words: 'And be it enacted, that if any seaman, or other person, shall commit manslaughter on the high seas, or confederate,' &c. 'such person or persons so offending, \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 94]\n\u00a0\n and being thereof convicted, shall be imprisoned not exceeding three years, and fined not exceeding one thousand dollars.'\n The jurisdiction of the Court depends on the place in which the fact was committed. Manslaughter is not punishable in the Courts of the United States, according to the words which have been cited, unless it be committed on the high seas. Is the place described in the special verdict a part of the high seas?\n If the words be taken according to the common understanding of mankind, if they be taken in their popular and received sense, the 'high seas,' if not in all instances confined to the ocean which washes a coast, can never extend to a river about half a mile wide, and in the interior of a country. This extended construction of the words, it has been insisted, is still farther opposed, by a comparison of the 12th with the 8th section of the act. In the 8th section, Congress has shown its attention to the distinction between the 'high seas,' and 'a river, haven, basin, or bay.' The well known rule that this is a penal statute, and is to be construed strictly, is also urged upon us.\n On the part of the United States, the jurisdiction of the Court is sustained, not so much on the extension of the words 'high seas,' as on that construction of the whole act, which would engraft the words of the 8th section, descriptive of the place in which murder may be committed, on the 12th section, which describes the place in which manslaughter may be committed. This transfer of the words of one section to the other, is, it has been contended, in pursuance \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 95]\n\u00a0\n of the obvious intent of the legislature; and in support of the authority of the Court so to do, certain maxims, or rules for the construction of statutes, have been quoted and relied on. It has been said, that although penal laws are to be construed strictly, the intention of the legislature must govern in their construction. That if a case be within the intention, it must be considered as if within the letter of the statute. So if it be within the reason of the statute.\n The rule that penallaws are to be construed strictly, is perhaps not much less old than construction itself. It is founded on the tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals; and on the plain principle that the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department. It is the legislature, not the Court, which is to define a crime, and ordain its punishment.\n It is said, that notwithstanding this rule, the intention of the law maker must govern in the construction of penal, as well as other statutes. This is true. But this is not a new independent rule which subverts the old. It is a modification of the ancient maxim, and amounts to this, that though penal laws are to be construed strictly, they are not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature. The maxim is not to be so applied as to narrow the words of the statute to the exclusion of cases which those words, in their ordinary acceptation, or in that sense in which the legislature has obviously used them, would comprehend. The intention of the legislature is to be collected from the words they employ. Where there is no ambiguity in \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 96]\n\u00a0\n the words, there is no room for construction. The case must be a strong one indeed, which would justify a Court in departing from the plain meaning of words, especially in a penal act, in search of an intention which the words themselves did not suggest. To determine that a case is within the intention of a statute, its language must authorise us to say so. It would be dangerous, indeed, to carry the principle, that a case which is within the reason or mischief of a statute, is within its provisions, so far as to punish a crime not enumerated in the statute, because it is of equal atrocity, or of kindred character, with those which are enumerated. If this principle has ever been recognized in expounding criminal law, it has been in cases of considerable irritation, which it would be unsafe to consider as precedents forming a general rule for other cases.\n Having premised these general observations, the Court will proceed to the examination of the act, in order to determine whether the intention to incorporate the description of place contained in the 8th section, into the 12th, be so apparent as to justify the Court in so doing. It is contended, that throughout the act the description of one section is full, and is necessarily to be carried into all the other sections which relate to place, or to crime.\n The 1st section defines the crime of treason, and declares, that if any person or persons owing allegiance to the United States of America shall levy war,' & c. 'such person or persons shall be adjudged guilty of treason,' &c. The second section defines misprision of treason; and in the description of the \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 97]\n\u00a0\n persons who may commit it, omits the words 'owing allegiance to the United States,' and uses without limitation, the general terms 'any person or persons.' Yet, it has been said, these general terms were obviously intended to be limited, and must be limited, by the words 'owing allegiance to the United States,' which are used in the preceding section.\n It is admitted, that the general terms of the 2d section must be so limited; but it is not admitted, that the inference drawn from this circumstance, in favour of incorporating the words of one section of this act into another, is a fair one. Treason is a breach of allegiance, and can be committed by him only who owes allegiance either perpetual or temporary. The words, therefore, 'owing allegiance to the United States,' in the first section, are entirely surplus words, which do not, in the slightest degree, affect its sense. The construction would be precisely the same were they omitted. When, therefore, we give the same construction to the second section, we do not carry those words into it, but construe it as it would be construed independent of the first. There is, too, in a penal statute, a difference between restraining general words, and enlarging particular words.\n The crimes of murder and of manslaughter, it has been truly said, are kindred crimes; and there is much reason for supposing, that the legislature intended to make the same provision for the jurisdiction of its Courts, as to the place in which either might be committed. In illustration of this position, the 3d and 7th sections of the act have been cited. \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 98]\n\u00a0\n The 3d section describes the places in which murder on land may be committed, of which the Courts of the United States may take cognizance; and the 7th section describes, in precisely the same terms, the places on land, if manslaughter be committed in which, the offender may be prosecuted in the federal Courts.\n It is true, that so far as respects place, the words of the 3d section concerning murder, are repeated in the 7th, and applied to manslaughter; but this circumstance suggests a very different inference from that which has been drawn from it. When the legislature is about to describe the places in which manslaughter, cognizable in the Courts of the United States, may be committed, no reference whatsoever is made to a prior section respecting murder; but the description is as full and ample, as if the prior section had not been in the act. This would rather justify the opinion, that in proceeding to manslaughter, the legislature did not mean to refer us to the section on murder for a description of the place in which the crime might be committed, but did mean to give us a full description in the section on that subject.\n So, the 6th section, which punishes those who have knowledge of the commission of murder, or other felony, describes the places on land in which the murder is to be committed, to constitute the crime, with the same minuteness which had been before employed in the 3d, and was, afterwards, employed in the 7th section.\n In the 8th section, the legislature takes up the subject \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 99]\n\u00a0\n of murder, and other felonies, committed on the water, and is full in the description of place. 'If any person or persons, shall commit upon the high seas, or in any river, haven, basin or bay, out of the jurisdiction of any particular State, murder,' &c.\n The 9th section of the act applies to a citizen who shall commit any of the offences described in the 8th section, against the United States, or a citizen thereof, under colour of a commission from any foreign Prince or State.\n It is observable, that this section, in its description of place, omits the words, 'in any river, haven, basin, or bay,' and uses the words 'high seas' only. It has been argued, and, we admit, with great force, that in this section the legislature intended to take from a citizen offending against the United States, under colour of a commission from a foreign power, any pretence to protection from that commission; and it is almost impossible to believe that there could have been a deliberate intention to distinguish between the same offence, committed under colour of such commission, on the high seas, and on the waters of a foreign State, or of the United States, out of the jurisdiction of any particular State. This would unquestionably have been the operation of the section, had the words, 'on the high seas,' been omitted. Yet it would be carrying construction very far to strike out those words. Their whole effect is to limit the operation which the sentence would have without them; and it is making very free with legislative language, to declare them totally useless, when they are sensible, and are calculated to have a decided \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 100]\n\u00a0\n influence on the meaning of the clause. That case is not directly before us, and we may perhaps be relieved from ever deciding it. For the present purpose, it will be sufficient to say, that the determination of that question in the affirmative, would not, we think, be conclusive with respect to that now under consideration. The 9th section refers expressly, so far at least as respects piracy or robbery, to the 8th; and its whole language shows that its sole object is to render a citizen who offends against the United States or their citizens, under colour of a foreign commission, punishable in the same degree as if no such commission existed. The clearness with which this intent is manifested by the language of the whole section, might perhaps justify a latitude of construction which would not be allowable where the intent is less clearly manifested; where we are to be guided, not so much by the words in which the provision is made, as by our opinion of the reasonableness of making it.\n But here, too, it cannot escape notice, that the legislature has not referred for a description of the place to the preceding section, but has inserted a description, and by that insertion has created the whole difficulty of the case.\n The 10th section declares the punishment of accessories before the fact. It enacts, 'that every person who shall either upon the land or the seas, knowingly and wittingly, aid and assist, procure, command, counsel, or advise any person or persons to do or commit any murder or robbery, or other piracy, \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 101]\n\u00a0\n aforesaid, upon the seas, which shall affect the life of such persons, shall,' &c.\n Upon this section, also, as on the preceding, it has been argued, that the legislature cannot have intended to exclude from punishment those who shall be accessories before the fact to a murder or robbery committed 'in a river, haven, basin, or bay, out of the jurisdiction of any State;' and now, as then, the argument has great weight. But it is again to be observed, that the legislature has not referred for a description of place to any previous parts of the law, but has inserted a description, and by so doing, has materially varied the obvious sense of the section. 'Every person who shall, either upon the land or the seas, knowingly and wittingly aid,' &c. The probability is, that the legislature designed to punish all persons amenable to their laws, who should, in any place, aid and assist, procure, command, counsel, or advise, any person or persons to commit any murder or piracy punishable under the act. And such would have been the operation of the sentence, had the words, 'upon the land or the seas' been omitted. But the legislature has chosen to describe the place where the accessorial offence is to be committed, and has not referred to a description contained in any other part of the act. The words are, 'upon the land or the seas.' The Court cannot reject this description. If we might supply the words 'river, haven,' &c. because they are stated in the 8th section, must we supply 'fort, arsenal,' &c. which are used in the 3d section, describing the place in which murder may be committed on land? In doing so, we should \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 102]\n\u00a0\n probably defeat the will of the legislature. Yet if we depart from the description of place given in the section, in which Congress has obviously intended to describe it, for the purpose of annexing to the word 'seas,' the words 'river, haven, basin, or bay,' found in the 8th section, there would be at least some appearance of reason in the argument, which would require us to annex also to the word 'land,' the words 'fort, arsenal,' &c. found in the 3d section.\n After describing the place in which the 'aid, assistance, procurement, command, counsel, or advice,' must be given, in order to give to the Courts of the United States jurisdiction over the offence, the legislature proceeds to describe the crime so to be commanded or procured, and the place in which such crime must be committed. The crime is, 'any murder or robbery, or other piracy, aforesaid.' The place is 'upon the seas.'\n In this section, as in the preceding, had the words 'upon the seas' been omitted, the construction would have been that which, according to the argument on the part of the United States, it ought now to be. But these words are sensible and are material. They constitute the description of place which the legislature has chosen to give us; and Courts cannot safely vary that description, without some sure guide to direct their way.\n The observations made on this section apply so precisely to the 11th, that they need not be repeated.\n The legal construction of those sections is doubtful, and the Court is not now, and may perhaps never \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 103]\n\u00a0\n be, required to make it. It is sufficient to say, that should it even be such as the Attorney General concends it ought to be, the reasons in favour of that construction do not apply conclusively to the 12th section. They both contain a direct reference to the 8th section. They describe accessorial offences, which from their nature are more intimately connected with the principal offence, than distinct crimes are with each other.\n The 12th section takes up the crime of manslaughter, which is not mentioned in the 8th; and, without any reference to the 8th, describes the place in which it must be committed, in order to give jurisdiction to the Courts of the United States. That place is 'on the high seas.' There is nothing in this section which can authorize the Court to take jurisdiction of manslaughter committed elsewhere.\n To prove the connection between this section and the 8th, the attention of the Court has been directed to the other offences it recapitulates, which are said to be accessorial to those enumerated in the 8th. They are admitted to be accessorial; but the Court draws a different inference from this circumstance. Manslaughter is an independent crime distinct from murder, and the legislature annexes to the offence, a description of the place in which it must be committed in order to give the Court jurisdiction. The same section then proceeds to enumerate certain other crimes which are accessorial in their nature, without any description of places. To manslaughter, the principal crime, the right to punish which depends on the place in which it is committed, Congress has annexed a description of place. To the other crimes enumerated \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 104]\n\u00a0\n in the same section, which are accessorial in their nature, and some of which at least may be committed any where, Congress has annexed no description of place. The conclusion seems irresistible, that Congress has not in this section inserted the limitation of place inadvertently; and the distinction which the legislature has taken, must of course be respected by the Court.\n It is the object of the law, among other things, to punish murder and manslaughter, on land, in places within the jurisdiction of the United States; and also to punish murder and manslaughter, committed on the ocean. The two crimes of murder and manslaughter, when committed on land, are described in two distinct sections, as two distinct offences; and the description of place in the one section, is complete in itself, and makes no reference to the description of place in the other. The crimes of murder and manslaughter, when committed on water, are also described as two distinct offences, in two sections, each containing a description of the place in which the offence may be committed, without any reference in the one section to the other. That section which affixes the punishment to manslaughter on the seas, proceeds to describe other offences which are accessorial in their nature, without any limitation of place. In every section throughout the act, describing a crime, the right to punish which depends on place, and in some instances where the right of punishment does not depend upon place, the legislature has, without any reference to a preceding section, described the place in which it must be committed, in order to bring the offender within the act. This characteristic feature \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 105]\n\u00a0\n of the law now to be expounded, deserves great consideration, and affords a powerful reason for restraining the Court from annexing to the description contained in one section, parts of the description contained in another. From this review of the examination made of the act at the bar, it appears that the argument chiefly relied on, to prove that the words of one section descriptive of the place ought to be incorporated into another, is the extreme improbability that Congress could have intended to make those differences with respect to place, which their words import. We admit that it is extremely improbable. But probability is not a guide which a court, in construing a penal statute, can safely take. We can conceive no reason why other crimes which are not comprehended in this act, should not be punished. But Congress has not made them punishable, and this Court cannot enlarge the statute.\n After giving the subject an attentive consideration, we are unanimously of opinion, that the offence charged in this indictment is not cognizable in the Courts of the United States; which opinion is to be certified to the Circuit Court for the district of Pennsylvania.\n CERTIFICATE. This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record of the Circuit Court for the district of Pennsylvania, and on the question on which the Judges of that Court were divided, and was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof, the Court is of opinion, that manslaughter committed in a river such as the river Tigris is described \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 106]\n\u00a0\n to be, is not punishable by the laws of the United States, and that the Circuit Court of the United States, for the district of Pennsylvania, has no jurisdiction over the offence. All which is ordered to be certified to the Circuit Court of the United States for the district of Pennsylvania.w\n w The Constitution of the United States declares, that the judicial power of the Union shall extend, (among other things,) 'to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction;' and this Court has determined, that the power thus granted belongs exclusively to the Courts of the United States. (Martin v. Hunter, ante, vol. 1. p. 333. 337.) It is not the purpose of this note to consider what cases of a civil nature are properly included within the terms, 'cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.' As to the criminal jurisdiction of the admiralty, there is no doubt that it is defined by local limits; and in order to ascertain these, it becomes necessary to inquire into the extent of the admiralty jurisdiction of England, from which ours was derived, as that was from the maritime States on the continent of Europe.\n Both in England and the other countries of Europe, the Court of Admiralty is a branch which has sprung from that ancient and venerable stock, the office of admiral. The etymology of the word serves to indicate the origin of the office, and the time when it was introduced, at least under that name, into Europe. The word admiral or ammiral, is doubtless derived from the Arabic word emir or amira, signifying a general officer or commander in chief, dominum vel praefectum. (Du Cange. Glossary. Verbo Admiralius. In the time of the crusades, by means of which so many oriental usages were brought into the west of Europe, it was introduced into France as the title of a commander in chief, either of land or sea forces. Accordingly, we find that the office, with that title, was unknown until the third race of French kings, under Charles IV., about the end of the thirteenth century, and it appeared in England about the same period in the reign of Edward I. After the term thus came to be exclusively applied to the commander in chief of naval forces \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 107]\n\u00a0\n in France, the station was filled with several illustrious characters, and in the scale of civil and military dignities ranked immediately after the office of constable. The person who filled this high station had jurisdiction by himself or his deputies, of all crimes and offences committed on the sea, its ports, harbours, and shores. (Valin. Com. sur l'Ordon. l. 1. tit. 2. art. 10. De la Comp etence.)\n In England, the office subsisted with the same title of high admiral, until the reign of Charles II., when it was filled by his brother, the Duke of York, (afterwards James II.) who being excluded from office as a Catholic by the test act in 1673, it was executed by commissioners, with the same power and authority as belonged to the Lord High Admiral: and since the accession of the house of Hanover, the office has also been vested in commissioners, who are styled the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. But the king is said still to hold, for certain purposes, the office of Lord High Admiral, though in a capacity distinguishable from his regal character; a distinction of practical importance in the law of prize, but immaterial to the present purpose. The judge of the High Court of Admiralty in England formerly held his place by patent from the Lord High Admiral, but since that office has only existed in contemplation of law, he holds it by direct commission from the crown. The ancient criminal jurisdiction of the Court was modified by the statute of the 28th of Henry VIII. c. 15. which enacted, that offences upon the seas, and in havens, rivers, &c. should be tried by the admiral or his deputy, and three or four more, among whom two common law judges are usually appointed, the judge of the High Court of Admiralty presiding. (2 Bro. Civ. and Adm. Law, 458.) In Scotland, the Court is held before the delegate of the High Admiral, who may also name other inferior local deputies, and who is declared to be the king's Justice General upon the seas, or fresh water within flood and mark, and in all harbours and creeks. (2 Bro. Civ. and Adm. Law. 30.)\n This remarkable conformity between the origin, history, and nature of the Courts of Admiralty in France and Great Britain, renders it highly probable that their jurisdiction, both civil and criminal, however it may have been shifted from its ancient \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 108]\n\u00a0\n foundations, was originally the same; and this supposition derives additional strength from the manner in which the history of the two countries is blended together during the middle ages, and from the circumstance of both having derived their maritime institutions from the shores of the Mediterranean.\n There appears to be no question, that the admiralty jurisdiction of England originally extended to all crimes and offences committed upon the sea, and in all ports, rivers, and arms of the sea, as far as the tide ebbs and flows. This is established by the ancient inquisitions, the records of which still remain in the black book of the admiralty, and by the articles given in charge at the admiralty sessions, as early as the reign of Edward III. (Clerk's Praxis. Roughton's articles, passim. Exton, c. 11, 12, 13. Selden, de Dom. Mar. l. 2. c. 24. p. 209.) But Lord Coke, in 4 Inst. 135.et seq. after admitting, that the admiralty had jurisdiction of all things done upon the sea, endeavours to establish the doctrine, that the sea, ex vi termini, did not include any navigable waters within the body of any county of the realm; and for proof of this, he mainly relies on certain authorities in Fitzherbert's Abridgment, ( Avowry, 192. Corone, 399.) which, when carefully considered, will not support his position. The hostility of Lord Coke to the admiralty, and indeed to every other jurisdiction rivalling the common law Courts, is well known; and Mr. Justice Buller has observed, that 'with respect to what is said relative to the admiralty jurisdiction in 4 Inst. 135. that part of Lord Coke's work has been always received with great caution, and frequently contradicted. He seems to have entertained not only a jealousy of, but an enmity against, that jurisdiction.' All the authorities cited by Lord Coke, will be satisfactorily disposed of upon the supposition ( which Lord Hale asserts to be the fact,) that before the thirty-fifth year of Edward III. the common law exercised, even upon the narrow seas, as well as in ports and havens within the ebb and flow of the tide, a concurrent jurisdiction with the admiralty. (2 Hale's, P. C. 13. et seq.) Neither does the case itself in Fitz. Abr. Corone, 399. 8 Edw. 2. warrant Lord Coke's assertion. Stanton, J. is there reported to have said, that it is not an arm of the sea where a man can see \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 109]\n\u00a0\n what is done on the one side of the water and the other; and that the coroner, in such cases, shall exercise his jurisdiction there. This dictum, taken literally, cannot be considered as law, for in the year books (22 Assisarum, 93.) it is expressly held, that every water which flows and reflows, is called an arm of the sea, so far as it flows. 'Que chescun ewe, que flow et reflow, est appelle bras de mer cy tantaunt come el flowe.' The same doctrine is quoted and confirmed by Lord Hale, who states, that the sea is either that which lies within the body of a county, or without; and that an arm or branch of the sea which lies within the fauces terrae, where a man may reasonably discern between shore and shore, is, or at least may be, within the body of a county. (Hale, De Jure Mar. c. 4. p. 10 .) So that there is the strongest reason to question Lord Coke's authority in this respect, and to adhere to the evidence furnished by the records of the admiralty, of its ancient jurisdiction in ports and havens within the ebb and flow of the tide.\n How far this ancient jurisdiction has been altered by statutes, is another question. The statute 13 Richard II. c. 5. enacts, 'that the admirals, and their deputies, shall not meddle henceforth of any thing done within the realm, but only of a thing done upon the sea, according as it hath been duly used in the time of the noble King Edward, (III.) grandfather of our Lord the King that now is.' The statute 15 Richard II. c. 3. enacts, 'that of all manner of contracts, pleas and quereles, and of all other things done, or arising within the bodies of counties, as well by land as by water, and also of wreck of the sea, the Admiral's Court shall have no manner of cognizance, power, nor jurisdiction; but all manner of contracts, pleas and quereles, and all other things rising within the bodies of counties, as well by land as by water, as afore, and also wreck of the sea, shall be tried, determined, discussed, and remedied, by the laws of the land, and not before, or by the admiral, nor his lieutenants, in any wise. Nevertheless, of the death of a man, and of a maihem done in great ships, being hovering on the main stream of great rivers, only, beneath the bridges of the same rivers nigh to the sea, and in none other places of the same rivers, the admiral shall have cognizance; and also, to \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 110]\n\u00a0\n arrest ships in the great flotes for the great voyages of the King, and of the realm; saving always to the King all manner of forfeitures and profits thereof coming; and he shall also have jurisdiction upon the said flotes during the said voyages, only saving always to the lords, cities, and boroughs, their liberties and franchises.' The true limit of the admiralty jurisdiction under these statutes was long a subject of angry contention between the civilians and the common lawyers. But it is admitted on all sides, that on the main or high seas, (which, as Blackstone states, begin at the low water mark, (1 Bl. Comm. 110.) the admiralty has jurisdiction exclusive of the common law; and that, between high water mark and low water mark, where the sea ebbs and flows, (which is technically the shore of the sea, or littus maris,) (Hale de Jure Mar. c. 4. p. 12.) the common law and the admiralty have a divided empire (divisum imperium) or alternate jurisdiction, one upon the water when it is full sea, the other upon the land, when it is an ebb. (1 Bl. Comm. 110. Constable's case, 5 Co. Rep. 106, 107. Barber v. Whanton, 2 Lord Raym. 1452. 2 East's P. C. 803. 4 Bl. Comm. 268.) Upon the sea coast, therefore, it is incontestible, that the body of every county bordering on such coast, is bounded by the shore of the sea, and at no time extends below low water mark.\n But what constitutes the boundary of counties bordering on arms of the sea, and navigable rivers, is a question concerning which great differences of opinion have been expressed. It has been strenuously insisted by the judges of the admiralty, that, notwithstanding the statutes of Richard, the admiralty still continues to possess jurisdiction in all ports, havens, and rivers, where the sea ebbs and flows, below the first bridges. (1 Sir L. Jenkins' Life, xcii. Exton, b. 2. c. 3. et seq. Zouch, 92.) And Sir Henry Spelman adopts the same opinion. (Spelm. Reliq. 226.) The ground of this opinion is, that the same rule exists at the common law in respect to the bounds of counties on navigable waters and arms of the sea as is applied by the same law to the sea coast, viz. that they are limited by the ebb and flow of the tide; and that the \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 111]\n\u00a0\n statute of Richard was intended no further to restrict the admiralty, than as to crimes committed above the first bridges. (1 Sir L. Jenkins' Life, xcii. Exton, c. 10. to 20. Zouch, 92.) And it cannot be denied, that the agreement of the twelve judges in 1632, (cited at large, ante, vol. III. p. 365. Note a.) strongly countenances this pretension. In Rex v. Soleguard ( Andrew's Rep. 231.) also, Sir Edmund Isham cited an opinion delivered as recently as 1713, on a reference to all the judges, in which ten of them ( against Ward, C. B. and Gould, J.) held, 'that the admiralty hath a jurisdiction in all great navigable rivers from the bridges to the sea.' And in that case, the Court did not deny the jurisdiction, but founded their judgment upon a supposed concurrent jurisdiction of the common law. On the other hand, Lord Coke, principally on the authority of the two cases before cited, (4 Inst. 140. Fitz. Abr. Avowry, 192. and Corone, 399.) maintains that the bodies of counties comprehend all navigable waters where persons can see from one side to the other; or rather, as other authorities, with more accuracy, state it, the point, where a man standing on one side of the land, may see what is done on the other side. (Hawkins' P. C. c. 9. s. 14. 2 East, P. C. 804.) Lord Hale appears to speak with great doubt and hesitation on this subject, merely asserting that 'an arm or branch of the sea, where a man may reasonably discern between shore and shore, is, or at least may be, within the body of a county.' And it may fairly be inferred as well from this cautious expression, as from his commentary on the statute of the 28th Hen. VIII. c. 15. (2 Hale's P. C. 16, 17.) that Lord Hale was not satisfied with Lord Coke's exposition of the common law boundary of counties. The whole question, however, became in a great degree unimportant in England after the enactment of the statute of the 28 Hen. VIII. c. 15. which gave to the High Commission Court, (of which the admiral or his deputy is the presiding judge,) cognizance of 'all treasons, felonies, robberies, murders and confederacies committed in or upon the sea, or in any other haven, river, creek, or place, where the admiral or admirals have, or pretend to have, jurisdiction.' In the exposition of this statute, Lord Hale says, 'this seems to me to extend to great rivers where the sea flows and reflows below \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 112]\n\u00a0\n the first bridges, and also, in creeks of the sea at full water, where the sea flows and reflows, and upon high water upon the shore; though these possibly be within the body of the country, for there at least by the statute of 15 Rich. II. they [the admirals] have a jurisdiction; and thus accordingly it has been held at all times even when the Judges of the common law have been named, and sat in the commission; but we are not to extend the words (pretend to have) to such a pretence as is without any right at all; and, therefore, although the admiral pretend to have jurisdiction upon the shore, when the tide is reflowed, yet he hath no cognizance of a felony committed there.' (2 Hale's P. C. 16, 17.) This construction of the statute, in opposition to Lord Coke's, was solemnly adopted in a very recent case by the twelve judges; and sentence of death accordingly passed upon the prisoner upon a conviction under the statute. ( Rex v. Bruce, 2 Leach's C. C. 1093. 4th Ed. cited at large, ante, vol. III. p. 371. Note a.) Sir Leoline Jenkins, in his charge given at the Admiralty Sessions at the Old Bailey, speaking of the commission given to the Judges under the statute, says: 'But the commission itself explains the word ( pretend) in a more particular manner in directing the inquiry to be of things done, not only upon the sea, and in havens, creeks, and rivers, as in the statute, but also in all places whatsoever within the flowing of the water, to the full sea mark; and in all great rivers from those bridges downwards that are next the sea: which words, being in the commission, are the best comment upon the statute, it having so often passed the great seal in these last seven score years, under the view and approbation of so many Lords Chancellors and Keepers, and of so many Attorney Generals, men of the greatest eminency in the laws of the land, so that the words of the statute, and the commission, being taken together, do not only ascertain the power of this Court to hear and determine offences done in all, or any of those places, but do also declare all, and every of the places themselves, to be within the jurisdiction of the admiralty; for otherwise, the jurisdiction of the commissioners since the statute, would be of larger extent, and in more places than the jurisdiction of the Admiral was before the statute, \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 113]\n\u00a0\n which it is clear was not intended by the law markers.' (1 Sir. L. Jenkins, xci.) But where such havens, creeks, and rivers, &c. are within the body of a county, it seems now generally agreed, that the Courts of Common Law have a concurrent jurisdiction over the same offences. (2 Hale's P. C. 15. 16. Rex v. Bruce, 2 Leach's C. C. 1093, 4th ed.)\n Supposing, however, Lord Coke's view of this matter to be correct, the limits of a county will still be confined to places in rivers, creeks, and arms of the sea, which are so narrow as that a person on one side can reasonably discern and attest upon oath any thing done on the other side; for the reason assigned for this rule of limitation is, that the pais may there come and take inquisition of the facts. (4 Inst. 140. 2 East's P. C. 804.) And, in England, the Admiralty hath by the express provisions of the statute 15 Rich. II. c. 3. cognizance of every description of homicide and mayhem, 'happening in great ships being and hovering in the main stream of great rivers below the bridges of the same rivers, which, (as Blackstone observes,) are then a sort of port or haven; such (to use his own illustration,) as are the ports of London and Gloucester, though they lie at a great distance from the sea, (4 Bl. Comm. 268.) and though they be within the body of a county. (2 Hale's P. C. 16.)\n But it is certainly very questionable how far the statutes of Richard II. are to be considered as restrictive of the grant of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction contained in the constitution of the United States. These statutes were never designed to apply to the colonies, for at that time the colonies did not exist; and in point of fact, the admiralty jurisdiction in the colonies has always depended entirely upon the royal commission, and upon acts of parliament expressly extending to them. Hence, the colonial Vice Admiralty Courts have constantly exercised jurisdiction in many cases, such as revenue cases, of which the High Court of Admiralty in England has not recently taken jurisdiction. I say, recently, because it seems that formerly the Admiralty in England did take jurisdiction of the breaches of the navigation laws, and other laws of trade; either by the express provisions of those statutes, or in virtue of its original \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 114]\n\u00a0\n maritime jurisdiction. (1 Sir L. Jenkins' Life, lxxii. xcv. et seq. 2 Sir L. J. p. 745, 746.) But it appears that the colonial Vice Admiralty Courts have uniformly exercised a jurisdiction over revenue cases upon their original inherent powers by virtue of their commissions, independent of any statute. (See a case cited in the Fabius, 6 Rob. 245.) Beside the restrictions contained in the statutes of 13 and 15 Rich. II. as to criminal jurisdiction, are purely arbitrary, and cannot be considered as declaratory of the pre-existing law. What reason is there why the Admiralty should have jurisdiction of homicide and mayhem in rivers, ports, and creeks of the sea, and not of other crimes in the same places? Such a limitation has no foundation in the ancient constitution of the Court, and never at any time existed independent of the statute. It is also a well established rule in the construction of English statutes, that they are not to be considered as extending to the colonies, unless included by express words, or by inevitable implication; (1 Bl. Comm. 107, 108.) and it cannot be pretended, that the colonies are within the purview or the words of the statutes of the 13 and 15 Richard II. Why, then, should they be considered as extending to the colonies, which did not then exist, any more than to Scotland, which was not then united to the crown, but in which country the Admiralty still retains its ancient jurisdiction undiminished?\n The commissions issued by the crown to the Vice Admiralty Courts in the colonies, were entirely inconsistent with the limitations imposed upon the Admiralty in England. One of the latest, which is probably copied from the others, is that issued to the Governor of New Hampshire, in 6 Geo. III. It empowers him 'to take cognizance of, and proceed in, all causes, civil and maritime, and in complaints, contracts, offences or suspected offences, crimes, pleas, debts, exchanges, accounts, charter parties, agreements, suits, trespasses, inquiries, extortions, and demands, and all business, civil and maritime, whatsoever, &c. throughout all and every the sea shores, public streams, ports, fresh waters, rivers, creeks, and arms, as well of the sea, as of the rivers and coasts, whatsoever, of the province, & c. and territories dependent thereon, and maritime ports, what- \n\n[18 U.S. 76, 115]\n\u00a0\n soever of the same, and thereto adjacent;' and in this commission those places are referred to as within 'our maritime jurisdiction.' (De Lovio v. Boit, 2 Gallis. 470. Note 47.) It seems highly probable that the expression 'maritime jurisdiction,' in the constitution, was borrowed from the language of those commissions, and was introduced ex abundanti cautel a, and superadded to the term 'admiralty,' in order to obviate any doubt as to the full extent of the authority meant to be conferred.\n Indeed it has already been, in effect, decided by this Court, that the statutes of Richard are not in force in the United States, as limitations of the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction granted in the constitution. By the judiciary act of 1789, c. 20. s. 9. seizures under laws of impost, navigation, and trade, on waters navigable from the sea by vessels of ten or more tons burthen, as well as seizures on the high seas, are expressly included in the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the District Courts. It is evident that Congress could not give the District Courts, acting as Courts of Admiralty, cognizance of any causes which were not 'of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,' within the true meaning of the constitution; because, it would deprive the parties of their constitutional right of trial by jury. The objection was, therefore, very early taken, that seizures in ports, and in such navigable waters, as above stated, were not causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, because those places were not, according to the common law interpretation in England of the statutes of Richard II. within the jurisdiction of the admiralty. But this Court has repeatedly overruled the objection, (La Vengeance, 3 Dall. 297. The Sally, 2 Cranch, 406. The Betsey and Charlotte, 4 Cranch, 443. The Samuel, Ante, vol. I. p. 9. The Octavia, lb. p. 20.) and thereby established the doctrine that the constitutional admiralty jurisdiction includes ports, arms, and creeks of the sea, as far as the tide ebbs and flows.\n The learned reader will observe, that this position is not disturbed by the decision of this Court in the case in the text, (The U. S. v. Wiltberger,) or by that of the United States v. Bevans; (Ante, vol. III. p. 336. Bevans; (Ante, vol. III. p. 336. 387.) the only question in those cases being, not what was the constitutional authority of Congress, but how far it had been exercised; not what was the extent of the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction granted in the constitution, but how far it had been conferred by Congress upon any particular Court of the Union. \n\nFootnotes\n 'Offences committed by foreigners.(*) In general all foreigners who come to submit themselves to the government of the empire, shall, when guilty of offences, be tried and sentenced according to he established laws.

The situation of Europeans in China is certainly by no means so satisfactory on the whole as might be desired, or even as it may be reasonably expected to become in the progress of time, unless some untoward circumstance should occur to check the gradual course of improvement.

FURLONG(1820)\n\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1820\n\n\n The UNITED STATES v. JOHN FURLONG, alias HOBSON.\n THE prisoner was indicted before the Circuit Court of Georgia, for the piratical murder of Thomas Sunley, on the act of Congress of the 30th April, 1790, c. 36. Verdict, guilty. The offence was committed on a vessel and crew, all English. The person murdered was an English subject. The piratical vessel was a vessel of the United States, and run away with by the captain and crew. The prisoner is an Irishman, and a subject of the king of Great Britain. It was moved by the prisoner's counsel, that the judgment be arrested on the following grounds, via.:- \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 186]\n\u00a0\n 1st. Because the indictment does not charge the prisoner as a citizen of the United States.\n 2d. Because the indictment does not charge the act, as committed on board of an American vessel, but charges it as committed on board of a foreign vessel, or vessel of owners unknown.\n 3d. Because the 8th section of the act of 30th April, 1790, c. 36. is virtually repealed by the act of 3d March, 1819, c. 76. to protect the commerce of the United States, and punish the crime of piracy.\n Upon which grounds, the judges being divided in opinion, at the request of the counsel for the prisoner, it was ordered, that the indictment and proceedings thereon, together with the grounds of the defendant's motion in arrest of judgment, be transcribed by the clerk of the Circuit Court, and certified by him, under the seal of the court, and sent to this Court, for their decision.\n The UNITED STATES v. JOHN FURLONG, alias HOBSON.\n THIS was another indictment against the same prisoner, before the same Court, on the act of Congress, of the 30th of April, 1790, c. 36. for the piratical murder of David May. Verdict, guilty. The same statement appears in the record, as in the case of the indictment of Furlong, for the murder of Thomas Sunley. \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 187]\n\u00a0\n The UNITED STATES v. JOHN FURLONG, alias HOBSON.\n THIS was another indictment against the same prisoner, before the same Court, on the act of the 3d of March, 1819, c. 76. for the piratical seizure of an unknown vessel. Verdict, guilty. The offence was committed on a foreign vessel, by a foreigner, from a vessel of the United States, which had been run away with by the captain and crew. It was moved by the prisoner's counsel, that the judgment be arrested on the ground that, as the constitution of the United States gives the power to Congress, to define and punish the crime of piracy, it is necessary that Congress define before it can punish, and that a reference to the law of nations is not such a definition as the constitution requires. Upon which ground, the Judges being divided in opinion, upon request of counsel for prisoner, it was ordered, that the indictment and proceedings thereon, together with the ground of the defendant's motion in arrest of judgment, be transcribed by the clerk of the Circuit Court, and certificed by him, under the seal of the Court, and sent to this Court for their decision.\n The UNITED STATES v. JOHN FURLONG, alias HOBSON.\n THIS was another indictment against the same prisoner, before the same Court, on the act of the 30th \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 188]\n\u00a0\n of April, 1790, c. 36. for a piratical robbery, committed on an American ship. Verdict, guilty. The offence was committed on a vessel of the United States, from a vessel of the United States, which had been run away with by the captain and crew. The prisoner is an English subject. It was moved by the prisoner's counsel, that the judgment be arrested, on the ground, that the 8th section of the act of 30th of April, 1790, c. 36. on which the indictment is founded, is virtually repealed by the act of the 3d of March, 1819, c. 76. entitled, 'an act to protect the commerce of the United States, and punish the crime of piracy.' Upon which ground the Judges being divided in opinion, upon the request of the counsel for the prisoner, it was ordered, that the indictment and proceedings thereon, together with the grounds of the defendant's motion in arrest of judgment, be transcribed by the clerk of the Circuit Court, and certified by him, under the seal of the Court, and sent to this Court for their decision.\n The UNITED STATES v. BENJAMIN BRAILSFORD and JAMES GRIFFEN.\n THE prisoners were indicted before the Circuit Court of South Carolina, for piracy on an American ship, under the act of Congress of the 30th of April, 1790, c. 36. The Court divided on the following questions:\n 1st. Whether an American citizen, fitting out a vessel in an American port, really to cruize against a power at peace with the United States, is protected by a commission from a belligerent from punishment \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 189]\n\u00a0\n for any offence committed by him against vessels of the United States.\n 2d. Whether it is competent for a jury to find, that a vessel within a marine league of the shore, at anchor in an open roadstead, where vessels only ride under shelter of the land at a season when the course of the winds is invariable, is upon the high seas.\n 3d. Whether the words, out of the jurisdiction of any particular State, in the 8th section of the act of Congress, of the 30th of April, 1790, c. 36. entitled, an act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States, must be construed to mean, out of the jurisdiction of any particular State of the United States.\n 4th. Whether the said 8th section of the said act is virtually repealed by the 5th section of the act of Congress, of March 3d, 1819, c. 76.\n 5th. Whether the said 5th section of the said act of March 3d, 1819, c. 76. furnishes any, and what definition of the crime of piracy.\n The UNITED STATES v. DAVID BOWERS and HENRY MATHEWS.\n THE prisoners were indicted before the Circuit Court of Georgia, under the act of 30th of April, 1790, c. 36. for a piratical robbery committed on an American ship. Verdict, guilty. The prisoners were part of the crew of the Louisa privateer, who rose upon their officers in October, 1818, and putting them out of the ship, proceeded on a piratical cruize. The Louisa was commissioned by the republic of \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 190]\n\u00a0\n Buenos Ayres, and commanded by Captain Almeida. There is no proof of her being American owned. The prisoners are American citizens, and the piracy for which they are convicted, was committed on the ship Asia, bearing the American flag. The captain asserted himself and vessel to be American; and on her stern was painted 'New-York.' The ship Asia, at the time of the robbery, was at anchor in an open roadstead, at the Island of Bonavista. The register of the ship Asia was not produced in evidence. Verdict, guilty.\n The prisoner's counsel moved that the judgment be arrested on the following grounds, viz.\n 1st. That it is not competent to prove the national character of an American vessel, without evidence of her register.\n 2d. It is not competent for the jury to find that the piracy was sommitted on the high seas, when the evidence ascertained the Asia, at the time she was boarded, to have been at anchor in an open roadstead, at the island of Bonavista.\n 3d. That the prisoners are not punishable under the 8th section of the act of 30th of April, 1790, c. 36. entitled, 'An act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States;' the same having been virtually repealed by the act of 1819, c. 76. to protect the commerce of the United States, and to punish the crime of piracy.\n 4th. That there are two counts in the indictment, the first charging the offence to have been committed on the high seas, out of the jurisdiction of any particular State; the second, charging the offence to \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 191]\n\u00a0\n have been committed in a certain haven, near the island of Bonavista, out of the jurisdiction of any particular State, and that it is not competent for a jury to find a general verdict of guilty on both counts.\n Upon which grounds, the Judges being divided in opinion, it was ordered, that the indictment and proceedings thereon, together with the grounds of the motion in arrest of judgment, be transcribed by the clerk of the Circuit Court, and certified by him, under the seal of the Court, and sent to this Court for their decision.\n The UNITED STATES v. DAVID BOWERS and HENRY MATHEWS.\n THE prisoners were indicted before the Circuit Court of Georgia, under the act of the 30th of April, 1790, c. 36. for a piratical robbery committed on a ship, the property of British subjects, and called the Sir Thomas Hardy, upon the high seas. The prisoners were citizens of the United States, and part of the crew of the Louisa privateer, mentioned in the preceding case. The prisoners were found guilty, and their counsel moved that the judgment be arrested upon the following grounds, viz.:\n 1st. That the act of the 30th of April, 1790, c. 36. eighth section, does not extend to piracy committed by the crew of a foreign vessel on a vessel exclusively owned by persons not citizens of the United States.\n 2d. That the eighth section of the act of the 30th \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 192]\n\u00a0\n of April, 1790, c. 36. entitled, 'an act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States,' has been virtually repealed by the act of the 3d of March, 1819, c. 76. entitled, 'an act to protect the commerce of the United States, and to punish the crime of piracy.'\n Upon which grounds, the Judges being divided in opinion, it was ordered, that the indictment and proceedings thereon, together with the grounds of the motion in arrest of judgment, be transcribed by the clerk of the Circuit Court, and certified by him, under the seal of the Court, and sent to this Court for their decision.\n Feb. 21st.\n These causes were argued by the Attorney General for the United States, and by Mr. Webster and Mr. Winder, for the prisoners.a\n March 1st.\n\n Mr. Justice JOHNSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A variety of questions have been referred to this Court in these cases, and in the decisions to be certified to the Circuit Court, it will be necessary to notice each question in every case; but in the opinion now to be expressed, the whole may be considered in connexion, as they all depend upon the construction of the same laws.\n In the two cases of Smith and Klintock, it has been already adjudged, that the 8th section of the act of 1790 was not repealed by the 5th section of that of 1819, and that the decision in Palmer's case does not apply to the case of a crew, whose conduct\n a The substance of their arguments will be found in the preceding cases of the United States v. Klintock, ante, p. 144. and the United States v. Smith, ante, p. 153. \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 193]\n\u00a0\n is such as to set at nought the idea of thus acting under allegiance to any acknowledged power. From which it follows, that when embarked on a piratical cruize, every individual becomes equally punishable under the law of 1790, whatever may be his national character, or whatever may have been that of the vessel in which he sailed, or of the vessel attacked.\n This decision furnishes an answer to all those questions made in the above cases, which are founded on distinctions in the national character of the prisoner, or in that of the vessels, in relation to the piracies committed by the crew of the Louisa. The moment that ship was taken from her officers, and proceeded on a piratical cruize, the crew lost all claim to national character, and whether citizens or foreigners, became equally punishable under the act of 1790. It also furnishes an answer to all the exceptions taken in the case of piracy charged against Furlong. For whatever the Court might have thought on the effect of the act of 1819, he would have been still punishable under the act of 1790. The indictment against him is general, against the form of the statute in such case made and provided, and it matters not that his offence was committed subsequent to passing the act of 1819, since the other act still remains in force, and reaches his case.\n It would seem to be unnecessary to go further in the cases against Furlong, as this conclusion decides his fate; but this Court cannot foresee how far it may be necessary to the administration of justice, against accessories or otherwise, that the question in the cases of murder should also be decided. \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 194]\n\u00a0\n The question whether murder committed at sea on board a foreign vessel be punishable by the laws of the United States, if committed by a foreigner upon a foreigner, is one which involves a variety of considerations, and which, in the two cases before us, is presented under an obvious distinction; on the one indictment it appears as having been committed simply on board the Anne of Scarborough, a foreign vessel, by a foreigner upon a foreigner; on the other, as committed on board the Anne of Scarborough, from an American vessel by a mariner of the American vessel. It is obvious that neither case comes within the express words of the decision in Palmer's case. And with regard to the case in which the American vessel is brought in view, there can exist but one difficulty.\n No difference can be supposed to exist between the case of a murder committed on the seas by means of a gun discharged from a vessel, and by means of a boat's-crew despatched for that purpose, as was actually the case here. And as to the right of the United States to punish all offences committed on or from on board their own vessels, it cannot be doubted, nor has it been doubted that the act of 1790 extends to such offences when committed on the seas. But, we have decided, that in becoming a pirate, the Mary of Mobile, from which the prisoner committed this offence, lost her national character. Could she then be denominated an American vessel?\n We are of opinion, that the question is immaterial; for, whether as an American or a pirate ship, the offence \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 195]\n\u00a0\n committed from her was equally punishable, and the words of the act extend to her in both characters. But if it were necessary to decide the question, we should find no difficulty in maintaining, that no man shall, by crime, put off an incident to his situation which subjects him to punishment. A claim to protection may be forfeited by the loss of national character, where no rights are acquired, or immunity produced by that cause. The other case presents a question of more difficulty. It includes the case of a murder committed by one of a crew upon another, on board a foreign vessel on the high seas. The prisoner is a British subject, the deceased was the same, and the ship also British.\n This, though not in all its circumstances the same, is in principle precisely that of the United States v. Palmer. The only difference is, that the case of Palmer supposes the prisoner and the deceased to belong to different vessels, and the certificate of the Court would seem to cover the case of an American as well as a foreigner, who commits an offence on board a foreign vessel.\n So far as relates to the point now under consideration, I have no objection to accede to the decision in the case of Palmer. I did not unite in the opinion of the Court in that case, on this point, because I thought it was carried too far in being extended to piracy as well as murder, and to American citizens as well as foreigners. To me it appears, that the only fair deduction from the obvious want of precision in language and in thought, discoverable in the act of 1790, and insisted on in the case of Palmer, is, that in \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 196]\n\u00a0\n construing it we should test each case by a reference to the punishing powers of the body that enacted it. The reasonable presumption is, that the legislature intended to legislate only on cases within the scope of that power; and general words made use of in that law, ought not, in my opinion, to be restricted so as to exclude any cases within their natural meaning. As far as those powers extended, it is reasonable to conclude, that Congress intended to legislate, unless their express language shall preclude that conclusion.\n It is true, that the 8th section declares murder as well as robbery to be piracy; but, in my view, if any thing is to be inferred from this association, it is only that they meant to assert the right of punishing murder to the same extent that they possessed the right of punishing piracy; which would be carrying the construction beyond what I contend for. The contrary conclusion, viz. that they meant to limit the cases of piracy made punishable under that act, to the cases in which they might, upon principle, punish murder, is rebutted by the generality of the terms used; and it would seem that, with this object in view, they ought to have taken the contrary course, and declared piracy to be murder.\n It is obvious that the penman who drafted the section under consideration, acted from an indistinct view of the divisions of his subject. He has blended all crimes punishable under the admiralty jurisdiction in the general term of piracy. But there exist well-known distinctions between the crimes of piracy and murder, both as to constituents and \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 197]\n\u00a0\n incidents. Robbery on the seas is considered as an offence within the criminal jurisdiction of all nations. It is against all, and punished by all; and there can be no doubt that the plea of autre fois acquit would be good in any civilized State, though resting on a prosecution instituted in the Courts of any other civilized State. Not so with the crime of murder. It is an offence too abhorrent to the feelings of man, to have made it necessary that it also should have been brought within this universal jurisdiction. And hence, punishing it when committed within the jurisdiction, or, (what is the same thing,) in the vessel of another nation, has not been acknowledged as a right, much less an obligation. It is punishable under the laws of each State, and I am inclined to think that an acquittal in this case would not have been a good plea in a Court of Great Britain. Testing my construction of this section, therefore, by the rule that I have assumed, I am led to the conclusion, that it does not extend the punishment for murder to the case of that offence committed by a foreigner upon a foreigner in a foreign ship. But otherwise as to piracy, for that is a crime within the acknowledged reach of the punishing power of Congress. As to our own citizens, I see no reason why they should be exempted from the operation of the laws of the country, even though in foreign service. Their subjection to those laws follows them every where; in our own Courts they are secured by the constitution from being twice put in jeopardy of life or member, and if they are also made amenable to the \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 198]\n\u00a0\n laws of another State, it is the result of their own act in subjecting themselves to those laws.\n Nor is it any objection to this opinion, that the law declares murder to be piracy. These are things so essentially different in their nature, that not even the omnipotence of legislative power can confound or identify them. Had Congress, in this instance, declared piracy to be murder, the absurdity would have been felt and acknowledged; yet, with a view to the exercise of jurisdiction, it would have been more defensible than the reverse, for, in one case it would restrict the acknowledged scope of its legitimate powers, in the other extend it. If by calling murder piracy, it might assert a jurisdiction over that offence committed by a foreigner in a foreign vessel, what offence might not be brought within their power by the same device? The most offensive interference with the governments of other nations might be defended on the precedent. Upon the whole, I am satisfied that Congress neither intended to punish murder in cases with which they had no right to interfere, nor leave unpunished the crime of piracy in any cases in which they might punish it: and tnis view of the subject appears to me to furnish the only sufficient key to the construction of the 8th section of the act of 1790\n\n\n As to piracy, since the decision that a vessel, by assuming a piratical character, is no longer included in the description of a foreign vessel, no case of difficulty can occur, unless the piracy be committed by the crew of a foreign vessel upon their own vessel, or by persons issuing immediately from shore. If \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 199]\n\u00a0\n such cases occur under the act of 1790, I shall respectfully solicit a revision of Palmer's case, if it be considered as including those cases. And shall do the same in the case of murder committed by an American in a foreign ship, if it ever occur; under the belief that it never could have been the intention of Congress that such an offender should find this country a secure assylum to him.\n There are a few minor points presented in these cases, which it is necessary to notice.\n It was moved in favour of the prisoners, that the only legal testimony of the character of the ships plundered, must have relation to their register, or rather, to the documentary papers which establish their national character. But this we think wholly indefensible. It is obvious, that such testimony might be suppressed in various ways by the aggressors. Nor is it at all decisive of the real ownership of a vessel. Our laws recognize the possibility of the register's existing in the name of one, whilst the property is really in another person. The laws that require such documents to be on board a vessel, have relation to financial, commercial, or inter-national objects, but are not decisive or necessary in a prosecution for this offence. Property or character is a matter in pais, and so to be established. However, it is unnecessary to examine the question farther, as we have decided, that the national character of the vessels plundered was, in these cases, wholly immaterial to the crime.\n It was also moved, in two of the cases of piracy, that as the offences charged were committed on vessels \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 200]\n\u00a0\n then lying at anchor near the shore of the islands of Mayo and Bonavista, in a road, and within a marine league of the shore, the prisoners could not be convicted:\n\n 1. \nBecause the words, 'out of the jurisdiction of any particular State,' in the 8th section of the act of 1790, includes foreign, as well as domestic States.\n\n 2. \nBecause a vessel at anchor in a road, is not a vessel on the high seas, as charged in the indictment.\n On the first point, we think it obvious, that out of any particular State, must be construed to mean 'out of any one of the United States.' By examining the context, it will be seen, that particular State is uniformly used in contradistinction to United States. For what reason, it is not easy to imagine; but it is obvious, that the only piracies omitted to be punished by that act, are land piracies, and piracies committed in our waters.\n On the second point, we are of opinion, that a vessel in an open road may well be found by a jury to be on the seas. It is historically known, that in prosecuting trade with many places, vessels lie at anchor in open situations, (and especially where the trade winds blow) under the lee of the land. Such vessels are neither in a river, haven, basin or bay, and are no where, unless it be on the seas. Being at anchor is immaterial, for this might happen in a thousand places in the open ocean, as on the Banks of Newfoundland. Nor can it be objected that it was within the jurisdictional limits of a foreign State; \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 201]\n\u00a0\n for, those limits, though neutral to war, are not neutral to crimes.\n It was also moved, in the same cases, that as there were two counts in the indictment, the one charging the offences as committed on the high seas, the other in a haven, basin or bay, a general verdict of guilty could not be sustained on account of repugnancy and inconsistency, as both facts could not be true. But, on this, it is only necessary to remark, that each count is a distinct substantive charge. Internal repugnancy in any one is a good exception, but non constat as to the whole, taken severally, but each may be for a distinct offence.\n There is, finally, another question certified to this Court, in one of the cases which arose under the captures made by the Louisa. It is, whether an American citizen, fitting out a vessel in an American port, really to cruize against a power at peace with the United States, is protected by a commission from a power belligerent as to the power against which he undertakes to cruize, from offences committed by him against the United States?\n It will be seen, that the object of this question is to bring the whole crew of the Louisa under the immunities which it is supposed Almeida might have claimed by virtue of his commission. But, having decided that the vessel and crew had forfeited all pretensions to national or belligerent character, this question is anticipated. Yet, lest the ingenious views on this point, presented to the Court by one of the gentlemen who argued it, should tempt the unwary into practices that may be fatal to them, we think it \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 202]\n\u00a0\n proper to remark, that in Klintock's case it has been decided, that a belligerent character may be put off, and a piratical one assumed, even under the most unquestionable commission. And if the laws of the United States declare those acts piracy in a citizen, when committed on a citizen, which would be only belligerent acts when committed on others, there can be no reason why such laws should not be enforced. For this purpose the 9th section of the act of 1790 appears to have been passed. And it would be difficult to induce this Court to render null the provisions of that clause, by deciding either that one who takes a commission under a foreign power, can no longer be deemed a citizen, or that all acts committed under such a commission, must be adjudged belligerent, and not piratical acts.\n The UNITED STATES v. JOHN FURLONG, alias JOHN HOBSON.\n CERTIFICATE.-This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record of the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Georgia, and on the question on which the Judges of that Court were divided in opinion, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, this Court is of opinion, that the 8th section of the act of the 30th of April, 1790, on which the indictment is founded, is not repealed by the act of the 3d of March, 1819, entitled, 'an act to protect the commerce of the United States, and to punish the crime of piracy.' \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 203]\n\u00a0\n The UNITED STATES v. JOHN FURLONG, alias JOHN HOBSON.\n CERTIFICATE.-This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record of the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Georgia, and on the questions on which the Judges of that Court were divided in opinion, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, this Court is of opinion, as to the first and second questions stated by said Circuit Court, that it was not necessary the indictment should charge the prisoner as a citizen of the United States, nor the crime as committed on board an American vessel, inasmuch as it charges it to have been committed from on board an American vessel, by a mariner sailing on board an American vessel. And as to the third question, That the act of the 30th of April, 1790, is not virtually repealed by the act of the 3d of March, 1819, entitled, 'an act to protect the commerce of the United States, and punish the crime of piracy.'\n The UNITED STATES v. GRIFFEN and BRAILSFORD.\n CERTIFICATE.-This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record of the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of South Carolina, and on the questions on which the Judges of that Court were divided in opinion, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, this Court \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 204]\n\u00a0\n is of opinion, 1. That an American citizen fitting out a vessel in an American port, really to cruize against a power at peace with the United States, is not protected by a commission from a belligerent from punishment for any offence committed by him against vessels of the United States.\n\n 2. \nIt is competent for a jury to find that a vessel within a marine league of the shore, at anchor in an open roadstead where vessels only ride under the shelter of the land, at a season when the course of the winds is invariable, is upon the high seas.\n\n 3. \nThat the words, out of the jurisdiction of any particular State, in the 8th section of the act of Congress of the 30th of April, 1790, entitled, 'an act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States,' must be construed to mean, out of the jurisdiction of any particular State of the United States.\n\n 4. \nThat the 8th section of the act of the 30th of April, 1790, entitled, 'an act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States,' is not repealed by the 8th section of the act of the 3d of March, 1819, entitled, 'an act to protect the commerce of the United States, and to punish the crime of piracy.'\n\n 5. \nThat the 5th section of the act of the 3d of March, 1819, furnishes a sufficient definition of piracy, and that it is defined 'robbery on the seas.'\n\n 6. \nThat considering this question, with reference to the case stated, the 8th section of the act of 1790 comprises the case of piracy committed by a foreigner in a foreign vessel upon any vessel, so as to \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 205]\n\u00a0\n make him punishable with death, in as much as both vessel and crew no longer retained any pretention to national character after assuming that of a pirate.\n\n 7. \nThat the national character of a vessel is a fact which a jury may find upon such evidence as will satisfy their minds, without production of the register, or proof of its having been on board of her.\n\n 8. \nThat the 8th question is answered in the answer given to the fourth question.\n The UNITED STATES v. DAVID BOWERS and HENRY MATHEWS.\n CERTIFICATE.-This eause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record of the Circuit Court of the United States, for the District of Georgia, and on the questions on which the Judges of that Court were divided in opinion, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, this Court is of opinion, 1. That the act of the 30th of April, 1790, entitled, &c. section 8th, does extend to piracy committed by the crew of a foreign vessel on a vessel exclusively owned by persons not citizens of the United States, in the case of these prisoners, in which it appears that the crew assumed the character of pirates, whereby they lost all claim to national character or protection.\n\n 2. \nThat the 8th section of the act of the 30th of April, 1790, entitled, &c. has not been repealed by the 8th section of the act of March 3, 1819, entitled, &c. \n\n[18 U.S. 184, 206]\n\u00a0\n The UNITED STATES v. DAVID BOWERS and HENRY MATHEWS.\n CERTIFICATE.-This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record of the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Georgia, and on the questions on which the Judges of that Court were divided in opinion, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, this Court is of opinion, 1. That it is competent to prove the national character of an American vessel without evidence of her register.\n\n 2. \nThat it is competent for the jury to find that the piracy was committed on the high seas, upon evidence that the Asia, at the time she was boarded, was at anchor in an open roadstead at the island of Bonavista.\n\n 3. \nThat the 8th section of the act of the 30th of April, 1790, entitled, &c. is not repealed by the 8th section of the act of March 3, 1819, entitled, &c.\n\n 4. \nThat each count in an indictment is a substantive charge, and if the finding conform to any one of them which in itself will support the verdict, it is sufficient to give judgment. \n\n\n\n"}}
