States Supreme Court\nA G SPALDING & BROS v. EDWARDS(1923)\nNo. 710\nArgued: Decided: April 23, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. Frank Davis, Jr., of Washington, D. C., and Franklin Grady, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error. \n\n[262 U.S. 66, 67]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover the amount of taxes collected by duress under color of the War Revenue Act of October 3, 1917, c. 63,  600 (f). 40 Stat. 300, 316 (Comp. St. 1918,  6309 3\/4 a). The plaintiff, a corporation, manufacturer of the goods in question, says that the tax was laid on articles exported from a State, (New York,) in violation of Article 1,  9, of the Constitution of the United States. Upon demurrer the complaint was dismissed by the District Court on the merits.\n The tax is 'upon all baseball bats, ... balls of all kinds ... sold by the manufacturer, producer, or importer' and was levied on three occasions admitted to be similar, so that the statement of one transaction will be enough. Delgado & Cia., a firm in the city of La Guaira, Venezuela, ordered Scholtz & Co., commission \n\n[262 U.S. 66, 68]\n\u00a0\n merchants in New York, to buy for their account and risk a certain number of baseballs and baseball bats, etc., at an agreed price and to mark the packages D & C  La Guaira #36 to indicate the purchasers and their place. Scholtz & Co. thereupon sent to the plaintiff in writing, dated December 10, 1918, this:\n'Export order from Scholtz & Co., Shipping and Commission Merchants . ... Please ship on or before the _____ per steamer _____. Rush . ... Errors in weight often entail heavy fines in Foreign Customs Houses, therefore be careful when weighing and marking Goods, as we shall hold you responsible for any fines caused through your errors. Cases or crates must be made to fit Goods as duty is paid by Gross weight. Shipping mark and number to be put on packages. [As above, with statement of the goods wanted.] Please send Memo. Invoice at once so we can apply for license and clear at Custom House.'\n\n Scholtz & Co. Instructed the plaintiff to deliver the packages so marked to the Atlantic & Carribbean Steam Navigation Co., an exporting carrier in New York. The plaintiff marked and delivered the goods as directed and was given a receipt by the carrier which it sent to Scholtz & Co. and which was exchanged by them for an export bill of lading in their name, dated February 10, 1919. The goods were transported and delivered in due time to Delgado & Cia. Scholtz & Co. paid the plaintiff on February 1 and were paid their commission by Delgado & Cia. in ninety days from date of shipment. The transaction from start to finish was understood and intended by he plaintiff and Scholtz & Co. to be for the purpose of exporting the goods to Delgado & Cia. in Venezuela. The question is whether the sale was a step in exportation, assuming as appears to be the fact, that the title \n\n[262 U.S. 66, 69]\n\u00a0\n passed at the moment when the goods were delivered into the carrier's hands.\n The fact that the law under which the tax was imposed was a general law touching all sales of the class, and not aimed specially at exports, would not help the defendant if in this case the tax was 'laid on Articles exported from any State,' because that is forbidden in terms by the Constitution. Article 1,  9. United States v. Hvoslef, \n237 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 459, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 286; Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 U.S. 292\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 126. Articles in course of transportation cannot be taxed. William E. Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165, 173\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 432. So we return to the question that we have stated. To answer it with regard to any transaction we have to fix a point at which, in view of the purpose of the Constitution, the export must be said to begin. As elsewhere in the law there will be other points very near to it on the other side, so that if the necessity of fixing one definitely is not remembered any determination may seem arbitrary. In this case, for instance, while the goods were in process of manufacture they were none the less subject to taxation if they were intended for export and made with specific reference to foreign wants. Cornell v. Coyne, \n192 U.S. 418\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 383; Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., \n260 U.S. 245\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 83, 67 L. Ed. --, November 27, 1922. On the other hand no one would doubt that they were exempt after they had been loaded upon the vessel for Venezuela and the bill of lading issued. It seems to us that the facts recited are closer to the latter than to the former side, and that the export had begun.\n The very act that passed the title and that would have incurred the tax had the transaction been domestic, committed the goods to the carrier that was to take them across the sea, for the purpose of export and with the direction to the foreign port upon the goods. The expected and accomplished effect of the act was to start them for that port. The fact that further acts were to be done before the goods would get to sea does not matter \n\n[262 U.S. 66, 70]\n\u00a0\n so long as they were only the regular steps to the contemplated result. Getting the bill of lading stands no differently from putting the goods on board ship. Neither does it matter that the title was in Scholtz & Co. and that theoretically they might change their mind and retain the bats and balls for their own use. There was not the slightest probability of any such change and it did not occur. The purchase by Scholtz & Co. was solely for the purpose of Delgado & Cia. and for their account and risk. Theoretical possibilities may be left out of account. In Railroad Commission of Louisiana v. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co., \n229 U.S. 336\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 837, the consignees might have retained the goods at New Orleans instead of shipping them abroad. The fact that they came to New Orleans by rail from another place in the State made no difference. The same principle was applied in Texas & New Orleans R. R. Co. v. Sabine Tram Co., \n227 \nU.S. 111, 123\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 229. The overt act of delivering the goods to the carrier marks the point of distinction between this case and Cornell v. Coyne, \n192 U.S. 418\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 383. To put it at any later point would fail to give to exports the liberal protection that hitherto they have received; of which an example may be seen in Thames & Mersey Marine Ins. Co., Ltd., v. United States, \n237 U.S. 19\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 496, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 1087\n\n\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nA. BOURJOIS & CO. v. KATZEL(1923)\nNo. 190\nArgued: January 18, 1923Decided: January 29, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 689, 690]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Hans v. Briesen, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. John B. Doyle, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill to restrain the infringement of the trade-marks 'Java' and 'Bourjois' registered in the Patent Office of the United States. A preliminary injunction was granted by the District Court (274 Fed. 856), but the order was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, one Judge dissenting (275 Fed. 539). A writ of certiorari was granted by this court. \n257 U.S. 630\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 92. In 1913 A. Bourjois & Cie., E. Wertheimer & Cie. Successeurs, doing business in France and also in the United States, sold to the plaintiff for a large sum their business in the United States, with their good will and their trade-marks registered in the Patent Office. The latter related particularly to face powder, and included the above words. The plaintiff since its purchase has registered them again and goes \n\n[260 U.S. 689, 691]\n\u00a0\n on with the business that it bought, using substantially the same form of box and label as its predecessors and importing its face powder from France. It uses care in selecting colors suitable for the American market, in packing and in keeping up the standard, and has spent much money in advertising, etc., so that the business has grown very great and the labels have come to be understood by the public here as meaning goods coming from the plaintiff. The boxes have upon their backs:\n'Trade-Marks Reg. U. S. Pat. Off. Made in France-Packed in the U. S. A. By A. Bourjois & Co. Inc. of New York, Succ'rs in the U. S. to A. Bourjois & Cie. and E. Wertheimer & Cie.'\n\n The defendant, finding that the rate of exchange enabled her to do so at a profit, bought a large quantity of the same powder in France and is selling it here in the French boxes which closely resemble those used by the plaintiff except that they have not the last quoted statement on the backs, and that the label reads 'Poudre de riz de Java' whereas the plaintiff has found it advisable to strike out the suggestion of rice powder and has 'Poudre Java' instead. There is no question that the defendant infringes the plaintiff's rights unless the fact that her boxes and powder are the genuine product of the French concern gives her a right to sell them in the present form.\n We are of opinion that the plaintiff's rights are infringed. After the sale the French manufacturers could not have come to the United States and have used their old marks in competition with the plaintiff. That plainly follows from the statute authorizing assignments. Act of February 20, 1905, c. 592,  10, 33 Stat. 727 (Comp. St.  9495). If for the purpose of evading the effect of the transfer it had arranged with the defendant that she should sell with the old label, we suppose that no one would doubt that the contrivance must fail. There is no such conspiracy here, \n\n[260 U.S. 689, 692]\n\u00a0\n but apart from the opening of a door to one, the vendors could not convey their goods free from the restriction to which the vendors were subject. Ownership of the goods does not carry the right to sell them with a specific mark. It does not necessarily carry the right to sell them at all in a given place. If the goods were patented in the United States a dealer who lawfully bought similar goods abroad from one who had a right to make and sell them there could not sell them in the United States. Boesch v. Graff, \n133 U.S. 697\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 378. The monopoly in that case is more extensive, but we see no sufficient reason for holding that the monopoly of a trade-mark, so far as it goes, is less complete. It deals with a delicate matter that may be of great value but that easily is destroyed, and therefore should be protected with corresponding care. It is said that the trade-mark here is that of the French house and truly indicates the origin of the goods. But that is not accurate. It is the trade-mark of the plaintiff only in the United States and indicates in law, and, it is found, by public understanding, that the goods come from the plaintiff although not made by it. It was sold and could only be sold with the good will of the business that the plaintiff bought. Eiseman v. Schiffer, 157 Fed. 473.

In determining the divisions, the Commission is directed to give due consideration, among other things, to the importance to the public of the transportation service rendered by the several carriers; to their revenues, taxes, and operating expenses; to the efficiency with which the carriers concerned are operated; to the amount required to pay a fair return on their railway property; to the fact whether a particular carrier is an original, intermediate, or delivering line; and to any other fact which would, ordinarily, without regard to the mileage haul, entitle one carrier to a greater or less proportion than another of the joint rate.\n Invoking this power of the Commission, the railroads of New England1 instituted, in August, 1920, proceedings to \n\n[261 U.S. 184, 187]\n\u00a0\n secure for themselves larger divisions from the freight moving between that section and the rest of the United States, the joint rates on which had just been increased pursuant to the order entered in Ex parte 74, Increased Rates, 1920, 58 I. C. C. 220. More than 600 carriers of the United States, mostly railroads, were made respondents. The case was submitted on voluminous evidence. On July 6, 1921, a report was filed. The relief sought was not then granted; but no order was entered. Instead, the parties were directed by the report to proceed individually to readjust their divisional arrangements, and the record was held open for submission of the readjustment. New England Divisions, 62 I. C. C. 513. This direction was not acted on. Five months later the case was reargued upon the same evidence. On January 30, 1922, the Commission modified its findings and made an order (amended March 28, 1922) which directed, in substance, that the divisions, or shares, of the several New Engl nd railroads2 in the joint through freight rates be increased 15 per cent. New England Divisions, 66 I. C. C. 196. Since it did not increase any rate, it necessarily reduced the aggregate amounts receivable from each rate by carriers operating west of Hudson river. The order was limited to joint class rates and those joint commodity rates which are divided on the same basis as the class rates. \n3\n It related only to transportation wholly within the United States. It was to continue in force only until further order of the Commission, and it left the door open for correction upon application of any carrier in respect to any rate. \n\n[261 U.S. 184, 188]\n\u00a0\n Prior to the effective date of that order, there was in force between each of the New England carriers and substantially each of the railroads operating west of the Hudson, a series of contracts providing for the division of all joint class rates upon the basis of stated percentages. \n4\n These agreements were in the form of express contracts. Section 208(b) of Transportation act of 1920 provided that all divisions of joint rates in effect at the time of its passage should continue in force until thereafter changed either by mutual agreement between the interested carriers or by state or federal authorities. The second report enjoined upon all parties the necessity for proceeding, as expeditiously as possible, with a revision of divisions upon a more legical and systematic basis, made specific suggestions as to the character of the study to be pursued, and invited carriers to present to the Commission any cases of inability to agree upon such revision. No further application was, however, made to the Commission.\n In March, 1922, this suit was commenced in the federal court for the Southern District of New York to enjoin enforcement of the order and to have it set aside as void. The Akron, Canton & Youngstown Railway and 43 other carriers5 joined as plaintiffs, suing on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated. The United States alone was named as defendant. But the Interstate Commerce Commission and 10 New England carriers intervened as such and filed answers. The case was then heard, on application for an interlocutory injunction, by \n\n[261 U.S. 184, 189]\n\u00a0\n three judges, under the provisions of Urgent Deficiencies Act Oct. 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219 (Comp. St.  998). The full record of the proceedings before the Commission, including all the evidence, was introduced. The injunction was denied ([D. C.] 282 Fed. 306), and the case is here by direct appeal. Plaintiffs urge six reasons why the order of the Commission should be held void.\n First. It is contended that the order is void, because its purpose was not to establish divisions just, reasonable, and equitable, as between connecting carriers, but, in the public interest, to relieve the financial needs of the New England lines, so as to keep them in effective operation. The argument is that Congress did not authorize the Commission to exercise its power to accomplish that purpose. An order, regular on its face, may, of course, be set aside if made to accomplish a purpose not authorized. Compare Southern Pacific Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 \nU.S. 433, 443\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 288. But the order here assailed is not subject to that infirmity.\n Transportation Act 1920, introduced into the federal legislation a new railroad policy. Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563, 585\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 232. Theretofore, the effort of Congress had been directed mainly to the prevention of abuses, particularly those arising from excessive or discriminatory rates. The 1920 act sought to insure, also, adequate transportation service. That such was its purpose Congress did not leave to inference. The new purpose was expressed in unequivocal language. \n6\n And, to attain it, new \n\n[261 U.S. 184, 190]\n\u00a0\n rights, new obligations, new machinery, were created. The new provisions took a wide range. \n7\n Pro inent among them are those specially designed to secure a fair return on capital devoted to the transportation service. \n8\n Upon the Commission new powers were conferred, and new duties were imposed.\n The credit of the carriers, as a whole, had been seriously impaired. To preserve for the nation substantially the whole transportation system was deemed important. By many railroads funds were needed, not only for improvement and expansion of facilities, but for adequate maintenance. On some, continued operation would be impossible, unless additional revenues were procured. A general rate increase alone would not meet the situation. \n\n[261 U.S. 184, 191]\n\u00a0\n There was a limit to what the traffid would bear. A 5 per cent. increase had been granted in 1914, The Five Per Cent. Case, 31 I. C. C. 351; Id., 32 I. C. C. 325; 15 per cent. in 1917, The Fifteen Per Cent. Case, 45 I. C. C. 303; 25 per cent. in 1918, General Order of Director General, No. 28. Moreover, it was not clear that the people would tolerate greatly increased rates (although no higher than necessary to produce the required revenues of weak lines), if thereby prosperous competitors earned an unreasonably large return upon the value of their properties. The existence of the varying needs of the several lines and of their widely varying earning power was fully realized. It was necessary to avoid unduly burdensome rate increases and yet secure revenues adequate to satisfy the needs of the weak carriers. To accomplish this two new devices were adopted: The group system of rate making and the division of joint rates in the public interest. Through the former, weak roads were to be helped by recapture from prosperous competitors of surplus revenues. Through the latter, the weak were to be helped by preventing needed revenue from passing to prosperous connections. Thus, by marshaling the revenues, partly through capital account, it was planned to distribute augmented earnings, largely in proportion to the carrier's needs. This, it was hoped, would enable the whole transportation system to be maintained, without raising unduly any rate on any line. The provision concerning divisions was, therefore, an integral part of the machinery for distributing the funds expected to be raised by the new ratefixing sections. It was, indeed, indispensable.\n Raising joint rates for the benefit of the weak carriers might be the only feasible method of obtaining currently the needed revenues. Local rates might already be so high that a further increase would kill the local traffic. The through joint rates might be so low that they could be raised without proving burdensome. On the other \n\n[261 U.S. 184, 192]\n\u00a0\n hand the revenues of connecting carriers might be ample; so that any increase of their earnings from joint rates would be unjustifiable. Where the through traffic would, under those circumstances, bear an increase of the joint rates, it might be proper to raise them, and give to the weak line the whole of the resulting increase in revenue. That, to some extent, may have been the situation in New England, when, in 1920, the Commission was confronted with the duty, under the new section 15a, of raising rates so as to yield a return of substantially 6 per cent. on the value of the property used in the transportation service. Ex parte 74, Increased Rates, 1920, 58 I. C. C. 220.9\n The deficiency in income of the New England lines in 1920 was so great that (even before the raise in wages ordered by the Railroad Labor Board) an increase in freight revenues of 47.40 per cent. was estimated to be necessary to secure to them a fair return. On a like estimate, the increased revenues required to give the same return to carriers in Trunk Line Territory was only 29.76 per cent. and to carriers in Central Freight Association Territory 24.31 per cent. \n10\n To have raised the additional revenues needed by the New England lines wholly by raising the rates within New England-particularly when rates west of the Hudson were raised much less-might have killed New England traffic. Rates there had already been subjected (besides the three general increases mentioned above) to a special increase, applicable only to New England, of about 10 per cent. in 1918. Proposed \n\n[261 U.S. 184, 193]\n\u00a0\n Increases in New England, 49 I. C. C. 421. A further large increase in rates local to New England would, doubtless, have provoked more serious competition from auto trucks and water carriers. For hauls are short and the ocean is near. Instead of erecting New England into a separate rate group, the Commission placed it, with the other two subdivisions of Official Classification Territory, into the Eastern Group, and ordered that freight rates in that group be raised 40 per cent. At that rate level the revenues of the carriers in Trunk Line and Central Freight Association territories would, it was asserted, exceed by 1.48 per cent. what they would have received if they had been a separate group. It was estimated that the excess would be about $25,000,000.11 Substantially that amount ( besides the additional revenue to be raised otherwise) was said to be necessary to meet the needs of the New England lines.\n Plaintiffs insist that Transportation Act 1920, did not, by its amendment of section 15(6) change, or add to, the factors to be considered by the Commission in passing upon divisions; that it had theretofore been the Commission's practice to consider all the factors enumerated in section 15(6);12 that this enumeration merely put into statutory form the interpretation theretofore adopted; that the only new feature was the grant of authority to enter upon the inquiry into divisions on the Commission's initiative; that this authority was conferred in order to \n\n[261 U.S. 184, 194]\n\u00a0\n protect the short lines, which, because of their weakness, might refrain from making complaint, for fear of giving offense;13 and that the power conferred upon the Commission is coextensive only with the duty imposed on the carriers by section 400 of Transportation Act 1920, which declares that they shall establish 'in case of joint rates ... just, reasonable, and equitable divisions thereof as between the carriers subject to this act participating therein which shall not unduly prefer or prejudice any of such participating carriers.' It is true that section 12 of the Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539, 551, 552 (Comp. St.  8583), which first conferred upon the Commission authority to establish or adjust divisions,14 did not, in terms, confer upon the Commission power to act on its own initiative. The language of the act seemed to indicate that the authority was to be exercised only when the parties failed to agree among themselves, and only in supplement to some order fixing the rates. \n15\n The extent of the Commission's power was a subject of doubt, and Transportation Act 1920 undertook by section 15(6) to remove doubts which had arisen. But Congress had, also, the broad purpose explained above. This is indicated, among other things, by expressions used in dealing with joint rates. By new section 15(6), p. 486, the Commission is directed to give due consideration, in determining divisions, to 'the importance to the public of the transportation services of \n\n[261 U.S. 184, 195]\n\u00a0\n such carriers;'16 just as by new section 15(3), p. 45, the Commission is authorized upon its own initiative when 'desirable in the public interest' to establish joint rates and 'the divisions of such rates.'\n Second. It is contended that if the act be construed as authorizing such apportionment of a joint rate on the basis of the greater needs of particular carriers it is unconstitutional. There is no claim that the apportionment results in confiscatory rates, nor is there in this record any basis for such a contention. The argument is that the division of a joint rate is essentially a partition of property; that the rate must be divided on the basis of the services rendered by the several carriers; that there is no difference between taking part of one's just share of a joint rate and taking f om a carrier part of the cash in its treasury; and, thus, that apportionment according to needs is a taking of property without due process. But the argument begs the question. What is its just share? It is the amount properly apportioned out of the joint rate. That amount is to be determined, not by an agreement of the parties or by mileage. It is to be fixed by the Commission; fixed at what that board finds to be just, reasonable, and equitable. Cost of the service is one of the elements in rate making. It may be just to give the prosperous carrier a smaller proportion of the increased rate than of the original rate. Whether the rate is reasonable may depend largely upon the disposition which is to be made of the revenues derived therefrom. \n\n[261 U.S. 184, 196]\n\u00a0\n What the Commission did was to raise the additional revenues needed by the New England lines, in part, directly, through increase of all rates 40 per cent. and, in part, indirectly, through increasing their divisions on joint rates. In other words, the additional revenues needed were raised partly by a direct, partly by an indirect tax. It is not true, as argued, that the order compels the strong railroads to support the weak. No part of the revenues needed by the New England lines is paid by the western carriers. All is paid by the community pursuant to the single rate increase ordered in Ex parte 74. If, by a single order, the Commission had raised joint rates throughout the Eastern group 40 per cent., and, in the same order, had declared that 90 per cent. of the whole increase in the joint rates should go to the New England lines (in addition to what they would receive under existing divisions), clearly nothing would have been taken from the Trunk Line and Central Freight Association carriers, in so ordering. The order entered in Ex parte 74 was at all times subject to change. The special needs of the New England lines were at all times before the Commission. That these needs were met by two orders, instead of one, is not of legal significance. The order here in question may properly be deemed a supplement to, or modification of, that entered in Ex parte 74.\n Third. It is asserted that the order is necessarily based upon the theory that, under section 15(6), the Commission has authority to fix divisions as between groups of carriers without considering the carriers individually; that Congress did not confer such authority; and that, hence, the order is void. Whether Congress did confer that authority we have no occasion to consider; for it is clear that the Commission did not base its order upon any such theory. The order directs a 15 per cent. increase in the divisions to the several New England lines. It is comprehensive. But it is based upon evidence which the \n\n[261 U.S. 184, 197]\n\u00a0\n Commission assumed was typical in character, and ample in quantity, to justify the finding made in respect to each division of each rate of every carrier. Whether the assumption was well founded will be discussed later. Here we are to consider merely, whether Congress authorized the method of proof and of adjudication pursued, and whether it could authorize it, consistently with the Constitution.\n Obviously, Congress intended that a method should be pursued by which the task, which it imposed upon the Commission, could be performed. The number of carriers which might be affected by an order of the Commission, if the power granted were to be exercised fully, might far exceed 600; the number of rates involved, many millions. The weak roads were many. The need to be met was urgent. To require specific evidence, and separate adjudication, in respect to each division of each rate of each carrier, would be tantamount to denying the possibility of granting relief. We must assume that Congress knew this; and that it knew, also, that the Commission had been confronted with similar situations in the past and how it had dealt with them.\n For many years before the enactment of Transportation Act, 1920, it had been necessary, from time to time, to adjudicate comprehensively upon substantially all rates in a large territory. When such rate changes were applied for, the Commission made them by a single order, and, in large part, on evidence deemed typical of the whole rate structure. \n17\n This remained a common practice after the burden of proof to show that a proposed increase of any rate was reasonable had been declared, by Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309,  12, 36 Stat. 539, 551, 552, to be upon \n\n[261 U.S. 184, 198]\n\u00a0\n the carrier. \n18\n Thus, the practice did not have its origin in the group system of rate making provided for in 1920 by the new section 15(6). It was the actual necessities of procedure and administration which had led to the adoption of that method, in passing upon the reasonableness of proposed rate increases. The necessity of adopting a similar course when multitudes of divisions were to be passed upon was obvious. The method was equally appropriate in such inquiries,19 and we must assume that \n\n[261 U.S. 184, 199]\n\u00a0\n Congress intended to confer upon the Commission power to pursue it. \n20\n\u00a0\n\n That there is no constitutional obstacle to the adoption of the method pursued is clear. Congress may, consistently with the due process clause, create rebuttable presumptions. Mobile, Jackson & Kansas City R. R. Co. v. Turnipseed, \n219 U.S. 35\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 136, 32 L. R. A . (N. S.) 226, Ann. Cas. 1912A. 463; Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas. Co., \n220 U.S. 61\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160; and shift the burden of proof, Minneapolis & St. Louis R. R. Co. v. Railroad & Warehouse Commission, \n193 U.S. 53\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 396. It might, therefore, have declared in terms that, if the Commission finds that evidence introduced is typical of traffic and operating conditions, and of the joint rates and divisions, of the carriers of a group, it may be accepted as prima facie evidence bearing upon the proper divisions of each joint rate of every carrier in that group. Congress did so provide, in effect, when it imposed upon the Commission the duty of determining the divisions. For only in that way could the task be performed. As pointed out in Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563, 579\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 232, serious injustice to any carrier could be avoided, by availing of the saving clause which allows anyone to except itself from the order, in whole or in part, on proper showing.\n Fourth. It is asserted that the order directs a transfer of revenues of the Western carriers to the New England \n\n[261 U.S. 184, 200]\n\u00a0\n carriers, pending a decision in the matter of divisions; that Congress has not granted authority to take such provisional action; and that, hence, the order is void. The argument is, that under section 15(6), the Commission may prescribe divisions only when, upon full hearing, it is of opinion that those existing are, or will be, unjust, unreasonable or inequitable; that in such event it shall prescribe divisions which are just, reasonable and equitable; and that the provisional character of the order demonstrates that the hearing has not been a full one. Whether a hearing was full, must be determined by the character of the hearing, not by that of the order entered thereon. A full hearing is one in which ample opportunity is afforded to all parties to make, by evidence and argument, a showing fairly adequate to establish the propriety or impropriety, from the standpoint of justice and law, of the step asked to be taken. The Commission recognized, and observed, these essentials of a full hearing.\n The complaint before it was filed in August, 1920. The hearings did not begin until December 15, 1920. The parties had, therefore, ample time to prepare to present their evidence and arguments. The case was not submitted until April 23, 1921. There was thus ample time for, and every carrier was, in fact, afforded the opportunity of, introducing any and all evidence it desired. The record made is voluminous. That the evidence left in the minds of the Commission many doubts, is true. But it had brought conviction that the New England lines were entitled to relief; that the divisional arrangements of the carriers required a thorough revision to put them upon a more logical and systematic basis; that a horizontal increase of the New England lines' divisions, made before such revision, would leave some divisions too high and others too low; that the comprehensive revision proposed would necessarily take a long time; and that, meanwhile, the New England lines should be accorded 'a \n\n[261 U.S. 184, 201]\n\u00a0\n portion of the relief to which ... they are entitled and which the public interest clearly requires.' The Commission further concluded that, on the evidence before it, no substantial injustice would be done to the carriers west of the Hudson by an order which increased by 15 per cent. the existing divisions of the New England lines, and reduced, by the amount required for this purpose, the divisions of the several carriers west of the Hudson, in the proportions in which they then shared the balance of each joint rate, or as otherwise might be agreed between them or determined by the Commission upon application.\n A hearing may be a full one, although the evidence introduced does not enable the tribunal to dispose of the issues completely or permanently, and although the tribunal is convinced, when entering the order thereon, that, upon further investigation, some changes in it will have to be made. To grant under such circumstances immediate relief, subject to later readjustments, was no more a transfer of revenues pending a decision, than was the like action, in cases involving general increases in rates, a transfer of revenues from the pockets of the shippers to the treasury of the carriers. That the order is not obnoxious to the due process clause, because provisional, is clear. If this were not so, most temporary injunctions would violate the Constitution.\n Fifth. It is contended that the order is void, because it confines itself to dealing with the main, or primary, divisions of the joint rates at the Hudson river, and fails to prescribe the subdivisions of that part of the rate which goes to the several carriers. The argument is that, if the Commission acts at all in apportioning the joint rate, its action is invalid unless it prescribes the proportion to be received by each of the connecting carriers. For this contention there is no warrant either in the language of the act, in the practice of carriers, or in reason. The duty imposed upon the Commission does not extend beyond \n\n[261 U.S. 184, 202]\n\u00a0\n the need for its action. If the real controversy is merely how much of the joint rate shall go to carriers east of Hudson river and how much to carriers west, there is nothing in the law which prevents the Commission from letting the parties east of the river, and likewise those west of it, apportion their respective shares among themselves. It is obviously of no interest to the Western carriers how those of New England decide to apportion their share; nor is it of interest to the Eastern carriers how those west of the Hudson divide the share apportioned to that territory. If on these matters the carriers interested can reach an agreement and no public interest is prejudiced, clearly, there is no occasion for the Commission to act.\n But there is a further answer to this contention. The Commission has fixed the subdivisions east and also those west of the river. The divisions of the several New England lines are definitely fixed; for the amount receivable by each carrier from each joint rate is ordered increased 15 per cent. What remains of each joint rate goes to the Western lines. This balance, the order recites, shall be divided among them 'in the same proportions as at present, or otherwise as they may agree, or failing such agreement, as may be determined by the Commission upon application therefor.' That fixes the divisions by reference. The fact that they are fixed provisionally and by reference, does not invalidate the order. It is urg d that this disposition demonstrates failure by the Commission to consider the several factors which the statute declares shall be taken into consideration in determining divisions. But this is not true. This feature in the order indicates rather that the Commission has considered the question, concluded that the apportionment by the Western lines of their share on existing proportions, was not inconsistent with the public interest, and that, in the absence of complaint, it might be assumed to be satisfactory to all parties. This objection presents in a different form largely \n\n[261 U.S. 184, 203]\n\u00a0\n what has been more fully discussed above. There was, thus, on the part of the Commission neither usurpation of power, nor neglect of duty, in limiting its definite decision to the primary divisions at the Hudson river gateways, and leaving the interested parties to deal, in the first instance, with the subdivisions among the carriers in their respective territories. \n21\n\u00a0\n\n Sixth. It is contended that the order is void, because it is unsupported by evidence. An order of the Commission fixing rates, if unsupported by evidence, is clearly invalid. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n222 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 108. Florida East Coast Ry. Co. v. United States, \n234 U.S. 167\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 867. The rule must, of course, be the same in respect to an order fixing divisions. The contention that the order is unsupported by the evidence rests largely upon arguments which assume a construction of the statute which we hold to be erroneous, or upon expressions in the first report of the Commission, which, in view of the second report and order thereon, must be deemed to have been withdrawn. That the evidence was \n\n[261 U.S. 184, 204]\n\u00a0\n ample to support the order made, is shown in the opinion of the lower court (282 Fed. 306, 308, 309), and in the reports of the Commission. To consider the weight of the evidence, or the wisdom of the order entered, is beyond our province. Manufacturers' Railway Co. v. United States, \n246 U.S. 457\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 383; Skinner & Eddy Corporation v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 557, 562\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 375; Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 57, 62\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 24. But the way is still open to any carrier to apply to the Commission for modification of the order, if it is believed to operate unjustly in any respect.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Except the Boston & Albany, which is leased to the New York Central, one of the trunk lines which was a respondent before the Commission, and branches of two Canadian systems, the Grand Trunk and the Canadian Pacific. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Other than the Bangor & Aroostook, which had been a complainant before the Commission, and the Boston & Albany, which had not. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Thus the order does not include traffic passing through Canada. Nor does it apply to rates on coal (which constitutes about two-fifths of the total interchanged tonnage), nor to those on certain other commodities. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Compare St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n245 U.S. 136\n, 139, note 2, 38 Sup. Ct. 49; Central R. R. Co. of New Jersey v. United States, \n257 U.S. 247\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 80. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] The number of carriers named as respondents in the order entered by the Commission is 617. Only 44 of these originally joined as plaintiffs in this suit. One of these, the Illinois Central, withdrew; 39 intervened later as plaintiffs. Leading trunk lines-the New York Central, the Pennsylvania, and the Baltimore & Ohio-by which a large part of all traffic interchanged with the New England railroads was carried, acquiesced in the Commission's order. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Thus: To enable the carriers 'properly to meet the transportation needs of the public,' section 422, p. 491; to give due consideration to 'the transportation needs of the country, and the necessity ... of enlarging [transportation] facilities,' section 422, p. 488; to 'best meet the emergency and serve the public interest ' section 402, p. 477; to 'best promote the service in the interest of the public and the commerce of the people,' section 402, pp. 476, 477; 'that the public interest will be promoted,' section 407, p. 482. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Among them are the establishment of the Railroad Labor and the Adjustment Boards.

The Commission has, since 1920, also reduced rates in broad group proceedings upon consideration of typical conditions throughout the entire region involved in the reduction. Reduced Rates, 1922, 68 I. C. C. 676; Rates on Grain, etc., 64 I. C. C. 85. Referring to the latter case the Commission said in their second report in this case (66 I. C. C. 203): 'In all such general rate cases we have realized and have held that if we were required to consider the justness and reasonableness of each individual rate, the law would in effect be nullified and the Commission reduced to a state of administrative paralysis.' \n[\nFootnote 19\n] Plaintiffs argue that there is a difference, because all interstate rates are required to be filed with the Commission and published, and hence appear specifically in the record; whereas divisions are not required to be filed or published. The difference is without legal significance. Papers on the Commission files are not a part of the record in a case, unless they are introduced as evidence It is the nature of the inquiry, not the accident whether papers are on file or published, which determines whether facts can be proved by evidence which is typical. The Commission could, of course, require carriers to introduce all their division sheets. To a proceeding of this character the rule acted on in Florida East Coast Line v. United States, \n234 U.S. 167\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 867, is not applicable. Compare United States v. L. & N. R. R. Co., \n235 U.S. 314\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 113. \n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] Since Transportation Act 1920, the Commission has on several occasions modified the divisions of a carrier without considering each individual joint rate.

C. 47. \n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] The junction points on which are based the divisions between the New England lines and the lines operating west of the Hudson River were fully set forth in the report of the Commission. To fix divisions on the percentage basis with a basic dividing line was what had been commonly done in the agreements of carriers through their freight associations. In leaving to the respondent carriers, in the first instance, the apportionment among themselves of that part of the joint rate receivable by the carriers operating west of the Hudson River the Commission followed a long established practice. Brownsville Texas Class and Commodity Rates, 30 I. C. C. 479, 484; Pacific Fruit Exchange v. Southern Pacific Co., 31 I. C. C. 159, 161, 162, 163; Grain Rates from Milwaukee, 33 I. C.

U S(1923)\nNo. 300\nArgued: February 28, 1923Decided: April 9, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[261 U.S. 581, 582]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. Howard McCaleb, of New Orleans, La., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States instituted condemnation proceedings in the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana to acquire the so-called Hanson Conal, and a strip of land 300 feet wide including the canal. Plaintiff in error was the owner and objected to the taking on grounds hereinafter stated. Judgment was given condemning the property and vesting title in the United States when the amount found in favor of the owner shall have been paid. The case was taken by the owner to the Circuit Court of \n\n[261 U.S. 581, 583]\n\u00a0\n Appeals, and there the judgment was affirmed. The case is here on writ of error to that court.\n The owner contends that the District Court and Circuit Court of Appeals erred in holding that the acts of Congress relied upon by the government confer authority to condemn the canal proper and the land adjacent to and outside the limits thereof within a strip of a total width of 300 feet inclusive of the canal.\n The property is sought to be taken to constitute a part of the intracoastal canal projected by the government extending from Boston to the Rio Grande. A number of acts of Congress1 must be considered. Prior to the Act \n\n[261 U.S. 581, 584]\n\u00a0\n approved July 25, 1912, it was contemplated that the right of way necessary for the enterprise would be secured to the United States free of cost. That act authorized the Secretary of War to purchase the Hanson Canal for use as a part of the waterway from Franklin to Mermentau, La., included in the intracoastal project, at a cost not to exceed $65,000. September 29, 1913, the board of directors of the owning company adopted resolutions which referred to the pertinent provisions of the Acts of Congress respectively approved March 2, 1907, and July 25, 1912, and recited that 'it is necessary for the United States to have and own a right of way three hundred feet in width in order to improve and enlarge said canal and make the same a part of the said inland waterway'; that the United States has proposed and agreed to purchase the canal, including a 300 feet wide strip of right of way and certain locks and other constructions thereon, and authorized and empowered the vice president, who was the chief executive officer of the corporation, upon the payment of $65,000 as compensation, to convey the property to the United States.\n These resolutions and the other circumstances disclosed by the record make it sufficiently clear that the land on either side of the canal is essential to the enterprise. It \n\n[261 U.S. 581, 585]\n\u00a0\n follows that, if the condemnation of the canal proper is authorized, the land may also be taken.\n For authority to condemn, the United States relies on the Acts of July 25, 1912 and August 1, 1888. The pertinent provisions are:\n'Improving waterway from Franklin to Mermentau, Louisians: The Secretary of War is hereby authorized to purchase, for use as a part of said waterway, the so-called Hanson Canal ... at a cost not to exceed $65,000. ...' 37 Stat. c. 253, p. 212.\n\n'That in every case in which the Secretary of the Treasury or any other officer of the government has been, or hereafter shall be, authorized to procure real estate for the erection of a public building or for other public uses he shall be, and hereby is, authorized to acquire the same for the United States by condemnation, under judicial process, whenever in his opinion it is necessary or advantageous to the government to do so, ...' and jurisdiction is conferred upon the District Courts of proceedings for such condemnation, and the practice, pleadings, forms and proceedings are made to conform as near as may be to those existing in like cases in the courts of the state within which such District Courts are held. 25 Stat. c. 728, p. 357. $Plaintiff in error argues that the Act of April 24, 1888, cited in the margin, conferring power upon the Secretary of War to condemn land, right of way and material needed to enable him to carry on work in connection with improvement of rivers and harbors, is exclusive and evidences an intention that the Act of August 1, 1888, shall not apply in that field, and that the acts of 1907, 1909, 1911, and 1912 engraft an exception on the Act of April 24, 1888, to the effect that, as to the Hanson Canal property here sought to be taken, no power to condemn exists, and that it must be acquired, if at all, by contract of purchase at a price not in excess of the sum specified. It is \n\n[261 U.S. 581, 586]\n\u00a0\n true that the authority granted by the Act of August 1, 1888, to some extent overlaps that granted by the earlier statute (April 24, 1888), but there is no conflict between them. The earlier does not operate to limit the effect of the later act. The act of 1912 specifically authorizes the purchase of the property because deemed necessary for public use. It would have been futile to authorize the purchase of an essential part of a great project, withholding power to condemn, and so leave it within the power of the owner to defeat the program by demanding a price in excess of $65,000 or by refusing to sell at all. The argument is without force.\n\n Another contention of plaintiff in error is that the provision of the Act of July 25, 1912, limiting the authorized purchase price to $65,000, negatives and necessarily excludes authority to condemn. This is not a case where attempt is made by legislation to fix or limit the just compensation to be paid for private property condemned. It is not like Monougahela Navigation Co. v. United States, \n148 U.S. 312\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 622, where Congress sought to exclude the value of the owner's franchise right to exact tolls for service performed, thereby violating the Fifth Amendment. The provision authorizing the Secretary to purchase at a cost not to exceed a specified amount has nothing to do with the judicial ascertainment of just compensation for the property condemned. Shoemaker v. United States, \n147 \nU.S. 282, 302\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 361. Neither the right of the owner to be put in as good position pecuniarily as he would have been if his property had not been taken,2 nor the right to have ascertainment and payment of just compensation as a condition of the taking3 is attempted to be impaired by \n\n[261 U.S. 581, 587]\n\u00a0\n legislation here under consideration. It is not necessary that the exact amount required shall be appropriated or that legislation shall indicate no limit upon the expenditure for property to be taken. There is no declaration or evidence of legislative purpose to violate the just compensation clause or to secure the property in question for less than the full amount to which the owner was entitled. \n4\n The power of eminent domain is not dependent upon any specific grant; it is an attribute o sovereignty, limited and conditioned by the just compensation clause of the Fifth Amendment. The owner is protected by the rule that title does not pass until compensation has been ascertained and paid, nor a right to the possession until reasonable, certain and adequate provision is made for obtaining just compensation.

Patterson, \n98 U.S. 403\n, 406.5 The authority to condemn is not negatived or affected by the limit set upon cost in the authorization of the Secretary to purchase.\n The Acts of July 25, 1912, and of August 1, 1888, make it obvious that the Secretary of War was authorized to acquire the property by purchase or condemnation. The authority to condemn conferred by the last- mentioned act extends to every case in which an officer of the government is authorized to procure real estate for public uses. See United States v. Beaty (D. C.) 198 Fed. 284 (reviewed in 203 Fed. 620, 122 C. C. A. 16) but not overruled on this point, and writ of error dismissed in \n232 U.S. 463\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 392; United States v. Graham & Irvine (D. C.) 250 Fed. 499.6 \n\n[261 U.S. 581, 588]\n\u00a0\n Plaintiff in error contends that the court erred in receiving in evidence the resolutions of the directors, in giving to the jury the instructions following:\n'Coming to consider the value. You have heard what it cost to dig, what it would cost to dig it now, this contract that they made to sell it, and the reasons that induced them to make the contract. All that evidence you will consider.\n\n'Now you are not bound by the $65,000 that they agreed to; if you think they ought to get more than that why you can award them more than that. If you think they ought to get less than that, you can award them less,'\n\n -and also in holding that the verdict is supported by the evidence.\n There were two principal issues of fact: (1) The necessity of taking the strip of land 300 feet wide, inclusive of the canal; and (2) the amount of compensation to which the owner was entitled.\n The resolutions hereinbefore mentioned stated that it is necessary for the United States to have and own a right of way 300 feet in width in order to improve and enlarge said canal and make the same a part of the said inland waterway, that the United States had agreed to purchase the property from the company for $65,000, and authorized the conveyance of the same to the United States upon payment of that sum, possession to be retained until the purchase price was actually paid, and the right to cut trees thereon for a specified time, and right of ingress and egress from lateral canals to be reserved.\n Two grounds of objection are urged: (1) That the issue of necessity was cognizable in equity and that the court, sitting as a chancellor, should have determined the equity issue prior to the trial of the law issue; and (2) that the resolutions offered in evidence constitute, and tend \n\n[261 U.S. 581, 589]\n\u00a0\n merely to prove, an attempt to compromise. The resolutions contained a distinct admission of fact that it was necessary to take the strip of land in question. This admission was made for the purpose of showing the right of the Secretary of War to purchase the property. They were admissible in evidence for that purpose. The judge rightly decided at the trial that the taking was for a public purpose and the government had a right to take.\n The only question submitted to the jury was the amount the owner was entitled to receive for the property. At the time of the adoption of the resolutions, condemnation proceedings had not been commenced; they were voluntarily adopted; the specified price was fixed with perfect freedom; they show a completed agreement of purchase and sale; an there is no reason why they should not be considered as the owner's admission of the then value of the property. The company had opportunity to and did introduce evidence in explanation of the circumstances attending the adoption and the fixing of the price therein. The court did not err in receiving the evidence on the question of fact submitted to the jury. Seaboard Air Line v. Chamblin, 108 Va. 42, 60 S. E. 727; O'Malley v. Commonwealth, 182 Mass. 196, 65 N. E. 30; Montana Tonopah Mining Co. v. Dunlap, 196 Fed. 612, 617, 116 C. C. A. 286; Suring Valley Waterworks v. City and County of San Francisco (D. C.) 192 Fed. 137, 164; City of Springfield v. Schmook, 68 Mo. 394; Froysell v. Lewelyn (Eng.) 9 Price 122, 147 Reprint 41.\n The court instructed the jury to consider what it did cost, and what it would cost now, to dig the canal, the reasons that induced the company to make the contract, and that in reaching a verdict they were not bound by the $65,000 agreed upon and might find an amount greater or less than that. The objections urged against the charge are not well founded.\n The evidence tended to show that the original cost of the canal was $ 65,000, and that it would cost $152,000 to \n\n[261 U.S. 581, 590]\n\u00a0\n reproduce it. There was evidence disclosing the size of the canal, and its suitability for use, together with the condition of the property. It cannot be said the verdict for $65,000 is without support.

FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ATLANTA(1923)\nNo. 717\nArgued: Decided: June 11, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 643, 644]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Alexander W. Smith, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellants and petitioners.\n Mr. John W. Davis, of New York City, for respondents and appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n After the decision in this case reported in \n256 U.S. 350\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 499, an answer was filed which denied, in large part, the allegations of the bill. Then, by an amended answer, the Federal Reserve Bank disclaimed any intention of demanding payment in cash, when presenting checks at the banks, and averred its willingness to accept payment in drafts, either on the drawee's Atlanta correspondent or on any other solvent bank, if collectible at par. The District Court heard the case upon the evidence. It found that the Federal Reserve Bank was not inspired by any ulterior purpose to coerce or to injure any nonmember bank which refused to remit at par. It found that the evidence was insufficient to sustain any charge that the Federal Reserve Bank was exercising its rights so as to injure or oppress plaintiff banks. And it found, specifically, that the evidence did not sustain the charge that the Federal Reserve Bank accumulated checks upon nonmenber country banks until they reached a large amount and then caused the checks to be presented for payment over the counter, in order to compel plaintiff banks to keep in their vaults so much cash that they would be obliged either to agree to remit at par or to go out of business. With regard to publication on the par list of the names of nonassenting banks, the District Court held that the evidence did not justify a finding that such publication was made in order to injure or oppress plaintiff \n\n[262 U.S. 643, 645]\n\u00a0\n banks. But it was of opinion that insertion of their names might lead to the belief that the plaintiff banks had agreed to remit at par. An injunction was, therefore, granted against inclusion of their names on the par list. The relief sought was in all other respects denied. The decree left the Federal Reserve Bank free to publish that it would make collection at par of checks upon any bank in any town, thus including those in which plaintiffs had their respective places of business. 280 Fed. 940. These findings were approved by the Circuit Court of Appeals, and the decree was affirmed. 284 Fed. 424.\n The case is here on an appeal taken by the plaintiffs. The evidence was conflicting. No adequate reason is shown why the concurrent findings of fact made by the two lower courts should not be accepted by us. Luckenbach v. W. J. McCahan Sugar Refining Co., \n248 \nU.S. 139, 145\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 53, 1 A. L. R. 1522. Whether on the undisputed facts plaintiffs were entitled to additional relief is the main question for decision. In order to decide that question it is necessary to consider the course of business formerly prevailing and the changes wrought by the attempt to introduce universal par clearance and collection of checks through the Federal Reserve Banks.\n A large part of the checks drawn on country banks are sent to payees who reside in places other than that in which the drawee bank is located. Payment of such a check is ordinarily secured through the payee's depositing it in his local bank for collection. This bank ordinarily used, as the means for presenting the check to the drawee, a clearing house and\/or correspondent banks. Formerly when he check was so presented, the drawee ordinarily paid, not in cash, but by a remittance drawn on his balance in some reserve city or by a credit with some correspondent. This process of collection yielded to the country bank a twofold profit. It earned some profit by the small service charge called exchange, which \n\n[262 U.S. 643, 646]\n\u00a0\n it made for the remittance or the credit. And it earned some profit by using the depositor's money during the period (sometimes weeks) in which the check was traveling the often circuitous route, with many stops, from the payee's bank to its own, and also while the exchange draft was being collected. These avenues to profit are, in large measure, closed by the Federal Reserve Banks' course of action. These banks do not pay any exchange charges to the drawee. And their superior facilities so shorten the time required to collect checks that the drawee bank's balances available for loans are much reduced. Largely because of the fact that the reserve banks thus make the collection without any deduction for exchange, most checks on country banks are now routed through the reserve banks. Although there is, as the District Court found, no intentional accumulation or holding of checks in order to embarrass, the advantages offered by the Federal Reserve Banks have created a steady flow in increased volume of checks on country banks so routed. That the action contemplated by the Federal Reserve Bank will subject the country banks to certain losses is clear. \n1\n In order to protect them from the resulting loss it would be necessary to prevent the Federal Reserve Banks from accepting the checks for collection. For these banks cannot be compelled to pay exchange charges or to abandon superior facilities.\n The contention is that the injunction should issue, because it is ultra vires the Federal Reserve Banks to collect checks on banks which are not members of the system or affiliated with it, through establishing an exchange balance, and which have definitely refused to assent to clearance at par. It is true that Congress has created in the reserve banks institutions special in character, with limited \n\n[262 U.S. 643, 647]\n\u00a0\n functions and with duties and powers carefully prescribed. Those in respect to the collection of checks are clearly defined. The original act ( Act Dec. 23, 1913, c. 6,  13, 38 Stat. 251, 263) authorized the reserve banks to--\n'receive from any of its member banks, and from the United States, deposits of ... checks ... upon solvent member banks, payable upon presentation; or, solely for exchange purposes, may receive from other Federal Reserve Banks deposits of ... checks ... upon solvent member or other Federal Reserve Banks, payable upon presentation.'\n\n By the amendment to section 13 by Act Sept. 7, 1916, c. 461, 39 Stat. 752, the class of checks receivable was extended to 'checks payable upon presentation within the district.' By the amendment to section 13 by Act June 21, 1917, c. 32,  4, 40 Stat. 232, 235, the class of banks from which checks might be received 'solely ... for collection' was extended. Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  9796. By the latter amendment the facilities offered by the Federal Reserve Banks were made available also to such nonmembers as became affiliated with the Federal Reserve system by establishing the required balance 'to offset items in transit.' It is true, also, that in practice this amendment might result in excluding checks on particular banks from the class collectible through the Federal Reserve Banks. For it enacted the clause which prohibits payment of exchange charges by Federal Reserve Banks. And as this prohibition would prevent Reserve Banks from using the usual channels in making collection of checks drawn on those country banks which insist upon exchange charges, the Reserve Bank might find it impossible or unwise, as a matter of banking practice, to collect such checks at all. But the class of checks to which the Reserve Bank's collection service might legally be applied, was le t by the amendment as those 'payable upon presentation within its district.' Wherever collection can be made by the Federal Reserve Bank, without paying exchange, neither \n\n[262 U.S. 643, 648]\n\u00a0\n the common law, nor the Federal Reserve Act precludes their undertaking it, if it can be done consistently with the rights of the country banks already determined in this case. \n256 U.S. 350\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 499.\n Federal Reserve Banks are, thus, authorized by Congress to collect for other Reserve Banks, for members, and for affiliated nonmembers, checks on any bank within their respective districts, if the check is payable on presentation and can in fact be collected consistently with the legal rights of the drawee without paying an exchange charge. Within these limits Federal Reserve Banks have ordinarily the same right to present a check to the drawee bank for payment over the counter, as any other bank, state or national, would have. For section 4 (38 Stat. 251, 254 [Comp. st .  9788]) provides that the Federal Reserve Banks shall have power:\n'Seventh. To exercise by its board of directors, or duly authorized officers or agents, all powers specifically granted by the provisions of this act and such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking within the limitations prescribed by this act.'\n\n The findings of fact negative the charges of wrongful intent and of coercion. The Federal Reserve Bank has formally declared that it is willing, when presenting checks, to accept in payment a draft of the drawee bank upon its Atlanta correspondent or a draft upon any other solvent bank-if collectible at par. Country banks are not entitled to protection against legitimate competition. Their loss here shown is of the kind to which business concerns are commonly subjected when improved facilities are introduced by others, or a more efficient competitor enters the field. It is damnum absque injuria. As the course of action contemplated by the Federal Reserve Bank is not ultra vires, we need not consider whether lack of power, if it had existed, would have entitled plaintiffs to relief. Compare National Bank v. Matthews, \n98 U.S. 621\n; Blair v. Chicago, \n201 \nU.S. 400, 450\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 427. \n\n[262 U.S. 643, 649]\n\u00a0\n Some minor objections are urged. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta serves, directly, only the Sixth Reserve District, which includes Georgia. It is contended that the decree should be reversed because the District Court refused to allow the intervention as plaintiffs of banks located outside of that district; because that court refused to admit evidence of the activities engaged in by other Federal Reserve Banks in other districts under the approval of the Federal Reserve Board; and because the court admitted certain joint answers to interrogatories propounded under equity rule 58 (33 Sup. Ct. xxxiv). We cannot say that the trial court abused the discretion vested in it, or erred, in so ruling.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It is said that introduction of a universal system of par clearance and collection of checks through the Federal Reserve Banks would bring compensatory advantages to the country banks. \n\n\n\n\n","6":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN RY. EXP CO. v. LEVEE(1923)\nNo. 54\nArgued: October 8, 1923Decided: October 22, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. A. A. Moreno, H. Garland Dupre, and Hunter C. Leake, all of New Orleans, La., and A. M. Hartung, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Charles T. Wortham, of Donaldsonville, La., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court. \n\n[263 U.S. 19, 20]\n\u00a0\n This is a suit brought by the respondent in a court of Louisiana to recover the actual value of a trunk and its contents, weighing one hundred pounds or less, delivered to the petitioner for carriage from Madisonville, Texas, to Thibodaux, Louisiana, but not delivered by the latter. The plaintiff's petition set forth the receipt given by the Company, which was in the usual form approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and by which, 'in consideration of the rate charged for carrying said property, which is dependent upon the value thereof and is based upon an agreed valuation of not exceeding fifty dollars for any shipment of 100 pounds or less ... the shipper agrees that the company shall not be liable in any event for more than fifty dollars for any shipment of 100 pounds or less,' with other language to the same effect. At the trial the defendant relied upon this limitation of its liability. But the Court following article 2754 of the Revised Civil Code of Louisiana held that the burden was on the carrier to 'prove that [the] loss or damage had been occasioned by accidental and uncontrollable events,' and gave the plaintiff judgment for $ 863.75 and interest. The Court of Appeal took the same view and said that failure to make that proof was equivalent to an admission of converting the property to its own use. The defendant applied to the Supreme Court of the State for a writ of certiorari, but the writ was 'refused for the reason that the judgment is correct.'\n A preliminary objection is urged that the present writ of certiorari was addressed to the Court of Appeal and not to the Supreme Court. But under the Constitution of the State the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is discretionary, article 7,  11, and although it was necessary for the petitioner to invoke that jurisdiction in order to make it certain that the case could go no farther, Stratton v. Stratton, \n239 U.S. 55\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 26, when the jurisdiction was declined the Court of Appeal was shown to be the highest Court \n\n[263 U.S. 19, 21]\n\u00a0\n of the State in which a decision could be had. Another section of the article cited required the Supreme Court to give its reasons for refusing the writ, and therefore the fact that the reason happened to be an opinion upon the merits rather than some more technical consideration, did not take from the refusal its ostensible character of declining jurisdiction. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Crovo, \n220 \nU.S. 364, 366\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 399; Norfolk & Suburban Turnpike Co. v. Virginia, \n225 \nU.S. 264, 269\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 828. Of course the limit of time for applying to this Court was from the date when the writ of certiorari was refused.\n Coming to the merits, the limitation of liability was valid, whatever may be the law of the State in cases within its control. Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 491\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 148, 44 L. R. A. ( N. S.) 257; Union Pacific R. R. Co. v. Burke, \n255 \nU.S. 313, 317\n, 321 S., 41 Sup. Ct. 283; American Ry. Express Co. v. Lindenburg, \n260 U.S. 584\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 206. The effect of the stipulation could not have been escaped by suing in trover and laying the failure to deliver as a conversion if that had been done. Georgia, Florida & Alabama Ry. Co. v. Blish Milling Co., \n241 \nU.S. 190, 197\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 541. No more can it be escaped by a state law or decision that a failure to deliver shall establish a conversion unless explained. The law of the United States cannot be evaded by the forms of local practice. Rogers v. Alabama, \n192 \nU.S. 226, 230\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 257. Under the law of the United States governing interstate commerce the stipulation constituted as defense to liability beyond fifty dollars, unless the plaintiff should prove some facts that took the case out of the protection of the contract. It had that scope in whatever Court it came up. The local rule applied as to the burden of proof narrowed the protection that the defendant had secured, and therefore contravened the law.

Davis, Jr., of Charleston, W. Va., for petitioner.\n Messrs. E. B. Dyer and Morgan Owen, both of Charleston, W. Va., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On July 22, 1918, at Indianapolis, Ind., respondent caused to be delivered to petitioner two trunks weighing 200 pounds and 100 pounds, respectively, and a package weighing 10 pounds, for transportation to him at Charleston, W. Va. A receipt was given for the property, which recited that its terms and conditions were agreed to by the shipper. The receipt, among other things, stipulated that in no event--\n'shall this company be held liable or responsible, nor shall any demand be made upon it beyond the sum of fifty dollars upon any shipment of 100 pounds or less, and for not exceeding 50 cents per pound upon any shipment weighing more than 100 pounds, and the liability of the express company is limited to the value above stated unless the just and true value is declared at time of shipment, and the declared value in excess of the value above specified is paid for, or agreed to be paid for, under this company's schedule of charges for excess value.'\n\n This receipt was produced at the trial and put in evidence by the respondent in support of his action. At the time of the shipment the value of the property was neither stated by the respondent nor demanded by the petitioner. The charges paid were on the basis of the limited liability set forth in the receipt. One of the trunks when delivered \n\n[260 U.S. 584, 586]\n\u00a0\n at destination was in bad order, some of the goods therein being damaged and others destroyed. Respondent alleged damages in the sum of $1,500. Petitioner answered, admitting liability for $110, under the terms of the receipt. The trial court gave judgment for $916.15, which the state appellate court affirm d. 88 W. Va. 439, 106 S. E. 884. The case is here on certiorari.\n The case is governed by the provisions of the Cummins Amendment, Act of March 4, 1915, c. 176, 38 Stat. 1196, as amended by the Act of August 9, 1916, c. 301, 39 Stat. 441 (Comp. St.  8604a). The amendment requires every common carrier receiving property for interstate transportation to issue a receipt or bill of lading, and makes it liable for the full, actual loss, damage or injury to such property caused by it or any connecting carrier participating in the transportation on a through bill of lading, notwithstanding any limitation of liability of the amount of recovery or representation or agreement as to value. Any such attempted limitation is declared to be unlawful and void. The follows a proviso, which appears in full in the margin,1 and the question for determination is whether, under the facts, the case is within its terms.\n The Interstate Commerce Commission on April 2, 1917, in a proceeding wherein the Adams Express Company and a number of other express companies ( but not including \n\n[260 U.S. 584, 587]\n\u00a0\n this petitioner) were parties, made an order in conformity with this proviso, authorizing the express companies to maintain rates dependent upon the value declared in writing by the shipper or agreed upon in writing as the released value of the property. The basic rate to be established was upon a valuation not exceeding $50 for any shipment of 100 pounds or less, or not exceeding 50 cents per pound for any shipment in excess of 100 pounds, the rates to be progressively increased with increased valuations. The express companies were further authorized, after notice, to amend the terms and conditions of the uniform express receipt in accordance with a form prescribed.\n The new form, so prescribed, contained a provision to the effect that 'in consideration of the rate charged for carrying the property, which rate is dependent upon the value thereof and is based upon an agreed valuation of not exceeding $50 for a shipment of 100 pounds or less, and not exceeding 50 cents per pound for any shipment in excess of 100 pounds,' the shipper agrees, unless a greater value be declared at the time of shipment, that the company shall not be liable in any event for more than these amounts. At the time of the shipment, the evidence shows there was in effect a tariff of petitioner governing transportation between Indianapolis and Charleston, duly published and filed \n\n[260 U.S. 584, 588]\n\u00a0\n with the Interstate Commerce Commission, setting forth the form of receipt prescribed by the Commission, and that the charges made were in accordance with this tariff. The receipt issued by petitioner, it will be seen, limits the liability of the petitioner, not in the precise words of, but substantially in accordance with, the provision contained in the receipt authorized by the Commission; but it was upon an old form which had been used previous to the order of the Commission and contained some conditions which were contrary to and declared to be void by the Cummins Amendment ( Comp. St.  8592, 8604a). Neither the receipt nor any declaration or agreement was signed by respondent or by any one in his behalf.\n The judgment of the state appellate court is made to rest upon the sole ground that petitioner did not take from the shipper a written declaration of value or a written agreement as to value signed by him. Respondent here seeks to justify the judgment upon other grounds as well, and these we first consider.\n In the first place, it is said that petitioner was never expressly authorized or required by the Interstate Commerce Commission to establish or maintain rates dependent upon declared or agreed values. It is true the order of the Commission, hereinbefore referred to, was made in a proceeding in which petitioner's name did not appear, but petitioner subsequently published and filed with the Commission a tariff, specifically referring to the order of the Commission in that proceeding and containing the form of receipt therein authorized, which tariff was in effect at the time of the shipment, and had been in effect for more than a year prior thereto. The transportation charges were in conformity with the tariff, and the receipt issued, in so far as the limitation of liability is concerned, was in substantial accord with the authorized receipt. The petitioner appears to have proceeded upon the assumption that the publication and filing of the tariff were \n\n[260 U.S. 584, 589]\n\u00a0\n authorized by the Commission's order, and there is nothing in the record to indicate that the Commission did not so regard it. A copy of the tariff, certified by the secretary of the Commission, was put in evidence. If these facts do not warrant the logical inference of a grant of authority they do afford the basis for a legal presumption to that effect, for, if petitioner was not duly authorized by the Commission, its action in attempting to limit its liability was unlawful, and, as this court said in Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific Railway Co. v. Rankin, \n241 \nU.S. 319, 327\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 555, 558 (60 L. Ed. 1022, L. R. A. 1917A, 265):\n'It cannot be assumed, merely because the contrary has not been established by proof, that an interstate carrier is conducting its affairs in violation of law. Such a carrier must comply with strict requirements of the federal statutes or become subject to heavy penalties, and in respect of transactions in the ordinary course of business it is entitled to the presumption of right conduct.'\n\n It is a rule of general application that:\n'Where an act is done which can be done legally only after the performance of some prior act, proof of the later carries with it a presumption of the due performance of the prior act.' Knox County v. Ninth National Bank, \n147 \nU.S. 91, 97\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 267. See also New York Central, etc., R. R. v. Beaham, \n242 \nU.S. 148, 151\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 43; Young v. South Tredegar Iron Co., 85 Tenn. 189, 2 S. W. 202, 4 Am. St. Rep. 752; Insurance Co. v. Plummer, 70 Me. 540, 544.\n\n In the absence of proof to the contrary, we therefore indulge the presumption that in basing its transportation charges upon the values recited in the receipt, the petitioner had due authority.\n It is next contended that the receipt which was issued was unlawful and void because it contained conditions forbidden by the Cummins Amendment and prior statutes, the principal condition being a limitation of the carrier's liability to its own routes or lines. But it does not appear \n\n[260 U.S. 584, 590]\n\u00a0\n that the shipment in question came within the terms of any of these conditions or that the obligations of petitioner in respect of the matter were in any way affected thereby. Assuming their unlawful character, there is no difficulty in separating them from the condition limiting the liability by the declared valuation. We do not, therefore, deem it necessary to inquire in respect of the nature or extent of these alleged unlawful conditions, since, in any event, their presence would not have the effect of rendering unenforceable the severable, valid provision here relied upon. McCullough v. Virginia, \n172 \nU.S. 102, 113\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 134; United States v. Bradley, 10 Pet. 343, 260; Chicago, etc. Co. v. Pullman Car Co., \n139 \nU.S. 79, 91\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 490. In Pickering v. Ilfracombe Railway Company, L. R. 3, C. P. C. 235, 250, the rule is stated by Willes, J., as follows:\n'The general rule is that where you cannot sever the illegal from the legal part of a covenant, the contract is altogether void; but, where you can sever them, whether the illegality be created by statute or by the common law, you may reject the bad part and retain the good.'\n\n See also Cincinnati Packet Co. v. Bay, \n200 \nU.S. 179, 185\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 208.\n We come now to the point on which the judgment of the state appellate court is grounded. That court held that the petitioner should have given the shipper--\n'a receipt specifying the value fixed by himself, a d evidenced by his signature. ... A writing not signed by him, although specifying value, was not a declaration or agreement in writing by him.' 88 W. Va. 439, 443, 444, 106 S. E. 884, 886.\n\n Neither the statute nor the order of the Commission requires the signature of the shipper. The pertinent words of the statute are:\n'... Rates dependent upon the value declared in writing by the shipper or agreed upon in writing as the released value. ...'\n\n It is not to be supposed that the Commission would attempt to add anything to the substantive requirements of the stat- \n\n[260 U.S. 584, 591]\n\u00a0\n ute, and its order does not purport to do so; but the form of receipt which the express companies were authorized to adopt contains a recital to the effect that as evidence of the shipper's agreement to the printed conditions he 'accepts and signs this receipt,' and a blank space is provided for his signature. Naturally, such signature would be desirable as constituting the most satisfactory evidence of the shipper's agreement, but it is not made a prerequisite without which no agreement will result, and a subsequent report of the Commission on the subject of bills of lading is persuasive evidence that there was no such intention. Bills of Lading, 52 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 681, where it is said:\n'It is sufficient if the shipper accepts the carrier's bill of lading without himself signing it. It becomes binding upon him by his acceptance, he being presumed to know and accept the conditions of the written bill of lading.'\n\n The respondent, by receiving and acting upon the receipt, although signed only by the petitioner, assented to its terms and the same thereby became the written agreement of the parties. McMillan v. Railroad Co., 16 Mich. 79, 93 Am. Dec. 208; The Henry B. Hyde (D. C.) 82 Fed. 681. In the absence of a statutory requirement, signing by the respondent was not essential. Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway v. McCann, \n174 \nU.S. 580, 590\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 755; Inman & Co. v. Seaboard Air Line Ry. (C. C.) 159 Fed. 960, 966. His signature, to be sure, would have brought into existence additional evidence of the agreement but it was not necessary to give it effect. See Girard Life Insurance Co. v. Cooper, \n162 \nU.S. 529, 543\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 879. And his knowledge of its contents will be presumed. Cau v. Texas & Pacific Railway Co., \n194 \nU.S. 427, 431\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 663; Kansas City Southern Railway Co. v. Carl, \n227 \nU.S. 639, 652\n, 653 S., 656, 33 Sup. Ct. 391. 'The receipt which was accepted showed that the charge made was based upon a valuation of $50 unless a greater value should be stated therein. The knowledge of the shipper \n\n[260 U.S. 584, 592]\n\u00a0\n that the rate was based upon the value is to be presumed from the terms of the bill of lading and of the published schedules filed with the Commission.' Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, \n226 \nU.S. 491, 508\n, 509 S., 510, 33 Sup. Ct. 148, 153 (57 L. Ed. 314, 44 L. R. A. [N. S.] 257). Having accepted the benefit of the lower rate dependent upon the specified valuation, the respondent is estopped from asserting a higher value. To allow him to do so would be to violate the plainest principles of fair dealing. Hart v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., \n112 \nU.S. 331, 340\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 151; Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, supra. In Kansas City Southern Railway Co. v. Carl, supra, this court said:\n'To permit such a declared valuation to the overthrown by evidence aliunde the contract, for the purpose of enabling the shipper to obtain a recovery in a suit for loss or damage in excess of the maximum valuation thus fixed, would both encourage and reward undervaluations and bring about preferences and discriminations forbidden by the law. Such a result would neither be just nor conducive to sound morals or wise policies.'\n\n The judgment of the state appellate court is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Provided, however, that the provisions hereof respecti g liability for full actual loss, damage, or injury, notwithstanding any limitation of liability or recovery or representation or agreement or release as to value, and declaring any such limitation to be unlawful and void, shall not apply, first, to baggage carried on passenger trains or boats, or trains or boats carrying passengers; second, to property, except ordinary live stock, received for transportation concerning which the carrier shall have been or shall hereafter be expressly authorized or required by order of the Interstate Commerce Commission to establish and maintain rates dependent upon the value declared in writing by the shipper or agreed upon in writing as the released value of the property, in which case such declaration or agreement shall have no other effect than to limit liability and recovery to an amount not exceeding the value so declared or released, and shall not, so far as relates to values, be held to be a violation of section 10 of this act to regulate commerce, as amended; and any tariff schedule which may be filed with the Commission pursuant to such order shall contain specific reference thereto and may establish rates varying with the value so declared or agreed upon; and the Commission is hereby empowered to make such order in cases where rates dependent upon and varying with declared or agreed values would, in its opinion, be just and reasonable under the circumstances and conditions surrounding the transportation.' \n\n\n\n\n","8":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN STEEL FOUNDRIES v. ROBERTSON(1923)\nNo. 291\nArgued: April 19, 1923Decided: May 21, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 209, 210]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Geo. L. Wilkinson, of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n Mr. Nathan Heard, of Boston, Mass., for certain appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a direct appeal under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215) from a decree of the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois dismissing a bill in equity. The District Judge certifies that the motion to dismiss the bill was sustained solely for lack of jurisdiction.\n The bill was filed by the appellant, the American Steel Foundries, against the Commissioner of Patents to secure an adjudication that the appellant is entitled to have its trade-mark 'Simplex' registered and authorizing the Commissioner of Patents to register the same. The Commissioner appeared as defendant and by stipulation the Simplex Electric Heating Company was allowed to intervene as the real party in interest. The bill averred that the American Steel Foundries had duly filed an application in the Patent Office for the registration, that the Examiner of Trade-Marks had refused the application, that the Commissioner of Patents had affirmed this refusal, and that on appeal the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia had affirmed the action of the Commissioner, that a petition for certiorari had been filed in this court and granted, and that thereafter the cause \n\n[262 U.S. 209, 211]\n\u00a0\n was dismissed by this court for lack of jurisdiction, on the ground that the decree of the Court of Appeals was not a final one.\n The appellant then filed this bill under section 9 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905 (33 Stat. 724, c. 592 [Comp. St.  9494]), and section 4915, Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  9460). The intervener based its motion to dismiss on the lack of jurisdiction 'over the subject-matter or alleged cause of action,' and the motion was granted without opinion.\n Section 9 of the Trade-Mark Act reads as follows:\n'Sec. 9. That if an applicant for registration of a trade-mark, or a party to an interference as to a trade-mark, or a party who has filed opposition to the registration of a trade-mark or party to an application for the cancellation of the registration of a trade-mark, is dissatisfied with the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, he may appeal to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, on complying with the conditions required in case of an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner by an applicant for a patent, or a party to an interference as to an invention, and the same rules of practice and procedure shall govern in every stage of such proceedings, as far as the same may be applicable.'\n\n Section 4915 of the Revised Statutes reads as follows:\n'Sec. 4915. Patents obtainable by bill in equity. Whenever a patent on application is refused, either by the Commissioner of Patents or by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia upon appeal from the Commissioner, the applicant may have remedy by bill in equity; and the court having cognizance thereof, on notice to adverse parties and other due proceedings had, may adjudge that such applicant is entitled, according to law, to receive a patent for his invention, as specified in his claim, or for any part thereof, as the facts in the case may appear. And such adjudication, if it be in favor of the right of the applicant, shall authorize the \n\n[262 U.S. 209, 212]\n\u00a0\n Commissioner to issue such patent on the applicant filing in the Patent Office a copy of the adjudication, and otherwise complying with the requirements of law. In all cases, where there is no opposing party, a copy of the bill shall be served on the Commissioner; and all the expenses of the proceeding shall be paid by the applicant, whether the final decision is in his favor or not.'\n\n The question in this case is whether the closing words of section 9, 'and the same rules of practice and procedure shall govern in every stage of such proceedings, as far as the same may be applicable,' are broad enough in their scope to include 'the remedy by bill in equity' granted to unsuccessful applicants for a patent in section 4915\n\n\n In Gandy v. Marble, \n122 U.S. 432\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 1290, an unsuccessful applicant for a patent who had carried his application by appeal to the Supreme Court of the District, which was dismissed on its merits January 30, 1880, on May 3, 1883, filed a bill of equity in the District Supreme Court under section 4915 against the Commissioner of Patents. That court dismissed the bill on the ground that the applicant had failed to prosecute his application within two years after the dismissal of his appeal from the Commissioner by the Supreme Court of the District, basing it on section 4894 of the Revised Statutes, reading as follows:\n'Sec. 4894. All applications for patents shall be completed and prepared for examination within two years after the filing of the application, and in default thereof, or upon failure of the applicant to prosecute the same within two years after any action therein, of which notice shall have been given to the applicant, they shall be regarded as abandoned by the parties thereto, unless it be shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Patents that such delay was unavoidable.'\n\n This section applies to proceedings in the Patent Office and before the Commissioner, and it was pressed upon this court that it could not apply to such an independent \n\n[262 U.S. 209, 213]\n\u00a0\n proceeding as the bill in equity provided for in section 4915. But this court held that section 4894 did apply. Mr. Justice Blatchford, speaking for the court, admitted (\n122 U.S. 439\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 1292), following Butterworth v. Hoe, \n112 \nU.S. 50, 61\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 25, that the proceeding by bill in equity, under section 4915, 'intends a suit according to the ordinary course of equity practice and procedure, and is not a technical appeal from the Patent Office, nor confined to the case as made in the record of that office but is prepared and heard upon all competent evidence adduced and upon the whole merits,' but continued, 'yet the proceeding is, in fact and necessarily, a part of the application for the patent.' He summed up the conclusion of the court as follows (\n122 U.S. 440\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 1293):\n'The presumption of abandonment, under section 4894, unless it is shown that the delay in prosecuting the application for two years and more after the last prior action, of which notice was given to the applicant, was unavoidable, exists as fully in regard to that branch of the application involved in the remedy by bill in equity as in regard to any other part of the application, whether so much of it as is strictly within the Patent Office, or so much of it as consists of an appeal to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia under section 4911. The decision of the court on a bill in equity becomes, equally with the judgment of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia on a direct appeal under section 4911, the decision of the Patent Office, and as to govern the action of the Commissioner. It is, therefore, clearly a branch of the application for the patent, and to be governed by the rule as to laches and delay declared by section 4894 to be attendant upon the application.'\n\n This view of the intimate relation of the bill in equity allowed in section 4915 to the application for a patent and the practice and procedure provided in due course thereof is of much assistance in giving proper scope to the words of section 9 of the Trade-Mark Act. After making provision for \n\n[262 U.S. 209, 214]\n\u00a0\n an appeal to the District Court of Appeals from a simple refusal of registration, and from decisions of the Patent Office in three different kinds of adversary proceedings therein in respect of such egistration, on complying with the conditions required in case of an appeal from refusal of a patent or a decision in a patent interference proceeding, the words are 'and the same rules of practice and procedure shall govern in every stage of such proceedings as far as the same may be applicable.' If the bill in equity of section 4915 is only a part of the proceeding for an application for a patent as held in Gandy v. Marble, it is no straining of the language to make these words include a bill in equity for the registration of a trade-mark. This court has taken exactly this view in Atkins v. Moore, \n212 U.S. 285\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 390. In that case it was held that a decision of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia affirming the decision of the Commissioner of Patents refusing registration of a trade-mark on an appeal under section 9 of the Trade- Mark Act was not a final judgment of the Court of Appeals which could be appealed to this court, and in the argument to show that it was not, Chief Justice Fuller, who spoke for the court, said:\n'Under section 4914 of the Revised Statutes no opinion or decision of the Court of Appeals on appeal from the Commissioner precludes 'any person interested from the right to contest the validity of such patent in any court wherein the same may be called in question,' and by section 4915 a remedy by bill in equity is given where a patent is refused, and we regard these provisions as applicable in trade-mark cases under section 9 of the Act of February 20, 1905.'\n\n This language is quoted with approval in the opinion of this court in Baldwin Co. v. Howard Co., \n256 U.S. 35\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 405, in which it was held that there could be no review in this court, by appeal or certiorari, of a decision of the District Court of Appeals in respect to the registration of a trade-mark under section 9 of the Trade- Mark Act. \n\n[262 U.S. 209, 215]\n\u00a0\n It is pressed upon us, however, that this language in Atkins v. Moore and in Baldwin Co. v. Howard Co. was not necessary to the conclusion in those cases and is to be regarded as obiter dictum. It was used in arguendo and was the unanimous expression of the court in both cases. It may be that the conclusion that the decision of the Court of Appeals was not final and appealable to this court could have been reached without this argument; but, however this may be, the construction put by the court on section 9 is most persuasive and follows so clearly from the decision in Gandy v. Marble, that we find no reason to question its correctness.\n An argument has been made to us against giving such an effect to section 9 based on the intrinsic differences between the nature of the patent right, and that in a trade-mark. We do not regard such differences as important in interpreting section 9 when it is obvious from that section and the whole of the Trade-Mark Act that Congress intended to produce a parallelism in the mode of securing these two kinds of government monopoly from the Patent Office.\n The decree of the District Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings. \n\n\n\n","9":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nANDERSON v. CORALL(1923)\nNo. 44\nArgued: October 4, 1923Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On November 25, 1914, Corall was convicted of the crime of breaking into a post office and was sentenced to \n\n[263 U.S. 193, 194]\n\u00a0\n be confined in the Leavenworth penitentiary for three years From that date. He served in prison until February 24, 1916, when he was allowed to go out on parole under the Act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 819), as amended by the Act of January 23, 1913 (37 Stat. 650 [Comp. St.  10535-10544]), portions of which are printed in the margin. \n1\n On June 25, 1916 the warden, in accordance with section 4 (Comp. St.  10538) issued a warrant for the retaking of Corall as a parole violator. Before he was retaken, and in October, 1916, he was convicted at Chicago of another crime and sentenced therefor to the Illinois state penitentiary at Joilet, where he was confined until some time in December, 1919. After his release from that prison he was retaken, December 17, \n\n[263 U.S. 193, 195]\n\u00a0\n 1919, on the warden's warrant to the Leavenworth penitentiary. In January, 1920, the parole board, pursuant to section 6 (Comp. St.  10540), took action appropriate to revoke and terminate the parole. The validity of that action is the only question involved.\n Corall claims that, allowing deductions for good conduct (Act of June 21, 1902, 32 Stat. 397 [Comp. St.  10532-10534]), the term of his sentence actually ended before the expiration of three years from the date it began and on or about March 17, 1917. The warden contends that the time elapsing between February 24, 1916, when he was paroled, and December 17, 1919, when he was retaken, cannot be taken into account; that when the board acted to revoke his\n___ shall have been returned to said prison, he shall be given an opportunity to appear before said board of parole, and the said board may then or at any time in its discretion revoke the order and terminate such parole or modify the terms and conditions thereof. If such order of parole shall be revoked and the parole so terminated, the said prisoner shall serve the remainder of the sentence originally imposed; and the time the prisoner was out on parole shall not be taken into account to diminish the time for which he was sentenced.'\n Section 7 provides for a parole officer for each penitentiary, and makes it the duty of such officer to aid paroled prisoners in securing employment and to visit and exercise supervision over them while on parole and provides that the supervision of paroled prisoners may also be devolved upon the United States marshals when the board of parole may deem it necessary. \n\n[263 U.S. 193, 196]\n\u00a0\n parole, the sentence had not been served, and he was bound to serve that part of it which remained unexpired when parole was granted. February 4, 1921, Corall made application for a writ of habeas corpus to the District Court for the District of Kansas. That court decided he was illegally held and ordered his discharge. The warden appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, where the judgment was affirmed.\n Mere lapse of time without imprisonment or other restraint contemplated by the law does not constitute service of sentence. Escape from prison interrupts service, and the time elapsing between escape and retaking will not be taken into account or allowed as a part of the term. Dolan's Case, 101 Mass. 219, 222; Petition of Moebus, 73 N. H. 350, 352, 62 Atl. 170. The parole authorized by the statute does not suspend service or operate to shorten the term. While on parole the convict is bound to remain in the legal custody and under the control of the warden until the expiration of the term, less allowance, if any, for good conduct. While this is an amelioration of punishment, it is in legal effect imprisonment. The sentence and service are subject to the provision of section 6 that if the parole be terminated the prisoner shall serve the remainder of the sentence originally imposed without deduction for the time he was out on parole.\n Corall's violation of the parole, evidenced by the warden's warrant and his conviction, sentence to and confinement in the Joliet penitentiary, interrupted his service under the sentence here in question, and was in legal effect on the same plane as an escape from the custody and control of the warden. His status and rights were analogous to those of an escaped convict. Drinkall v. Spiegel. Sheriff, 68 Conn. 441, 449, 450, 36 Atl. 830, 36 L. R. A. 486. The term of his sentence had not expired in October, 1916, when, at Chicago, he was convicted of another crime and sentenced to the Joliet penitentiary. Then-if not earlier-he ceased to be in \n\n[263 U.S. 193, 197]\n\u00a0\n the legal custody and under the control of the warden of the Leavenworth penitentiary, as required by section 3 of the act and the terms of the parole authorized thereby. His claim that his term expired in 1917 before he was retaken and while he was serving sentence at Joliet cannot be sustained, and we hold that it had not expired in January, 1920, at the time of the action of the board. Under section 6, the board was authorized at any time during his term of sentence in its discretion to revoke the order and terminate the parole, and to require him to serve the remainder of the sentence originally imposed without any allowance for the time he was out on parole.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court, with directions that the respondent, Arthur Corall, be restored to the custody of the warden of the United States penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kan. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1 is to the effect that prisoners may be released on parole as provided in the act.\n Section 2 provides that the superintendent of prisons of the Department of Justice and the warden and physician of each United States penitentiary shall constitute a board of parole for such prison which shall establish rules and regulations for its prodedure subject to the approval of the Attorney General.\n Section 3: 'That if it shall appear to said board of parole ... that there is a reasonable probability that such applicant will live and remain at liberty without violating the laws, and if in the opinion of the board such release is not incompatible with the welfare of society, then said board of parole may in its discretion authorize the release of such applicant on parole, and he shall be allowed to go on parole outside of said prison, and, in the discretion of the board, to return to his home, upon such terms and conditions, including personal reports from such paroled person, as said board of parole shall prescribe, and to remain, while on parole, in the legal custody and under the control of the warden of such prison from which paroled, and until the expiration of the term or terms specified in his sentence, less such good time allowance as is or may hereafter be provided for by act of Congress; and the said board shall, in every parole, fix the limits of the residence of the person paroled, which limits may thereafter be changed in the discretion of the board . ... '\n Section 4: 'That if the warden of the prison or penitentiary from which said prisoner was paroled or said board of parole or any member thereof shall have reliable information that the prisoner has violated his parole, then said warden, at any time within the term or terms of the prisoner's sentence, may issue his warrant to any officer hereinafter authorized to execute the same, for the retaking of such prisoner.'\n Section 5: 'That any officer of said prison or any federal officer authorized to serve criminal process within the United States, to whom such warrant shall be delivered, is authorized and required to execute such warrant by taking such prisoner and returning him to said prison within the time specified in said warrant therefor. ...

ARKANSAS RAILROAD COMMISSION(1923)\nNo. 500\nArgued: February 21, 1923Decided: March 19, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. W. B. Smith and John M. Moore, both of Little Rock, Ark., for appellant.\n Messrs. E. J. Dimock, of New York City, and Ashley Cockrill, of Little Rock, Ark., \n\n[261 U.S. 379, 380]\n\u00a0\n for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant brought suit in the District Court, alleging that an order of the Arkansas Railroad Commission was invalid, as establishing confiscatory rates for natural gas furnished to its consuming customers and as maintaining certain divisional rates (alleged to be wholly inadequate), fixed by contracts between appellant and the Little Rock Gas & Fuel Company and the Consumers' Gas Company. An interlocutory injunction was sought under section 266 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243). The court granted the injunction in respect of the rates to consumers but denied it as to the divisional rates. The appeal brings here for review only the action of the lower court in the later respect.\n By the divisional contracts referred to, appellant, in consideration of the payment to it of a stated proportion of the rates collected, agreed to furnish gas to the two companies named, to be by them distributed to their customers in the cities of Little Rock and Hot Springs, respectively. The gas was to be delivered at the intake of the distributing systems for these cities. Appellant asserts that the income afforded by the rates prescribed by these contracts is so inadequate as to have the effect of a virtual confiscation of its property, and that this result is in large part due to improper and wasteful methods of distribution on the part of the two distributing companies.\n The commission was asked to fix a flat rate, called a city gate rate, for the gas delivered at the city borders, the effect of which, of course, would have been to abrogate the contract rates based upon a percentage of the collections. Appellant's application was made to the Arkansas Corporation Commission, but was decided by the Railroad \n\n[261 U.S. 379, 381]\n\u00a0\n Commission, to whom the Legislature in the meantime had transferred jurisdiction. There is no claim that rates to consumers were affected by these contracts; nor does it appear that the public interest is involved in the action which the commission was asked to take.\n The Railroad Commission denied the application primarily upon the ground that the power to grant it had been expressly withheld by the act of the Legislature, known as Act 443, passed on March 25, 1921 (Acts Ark. 1921, p. 429), transferring to it the jurisdiction theretofore possessed by the Corporation Commission and providing that the Railroad Commission 'shall have no jurisdiction or power to modify or impair any existing contracts for supplying gas to persons, firms, corporations, municipalities or distributing companies, and such contracts shall not be affected by this act or the act or which this is an amendment.' The act is copied in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[261 U.S. 379, 382]\n\u00a0\n The question whether in the absence of the statute-it being made to appear that the stipulated consideration was grossly inadequate-the commission, under the circumstances disclosed by the record, would have been under a duty to fix gas rates in contravention of the contracts, may be put aside with brief consideration. While a state may exercise its legislative power to regulate public utilities and fix rates, notwithstanding the effect may be to modify or abrogate private contracts ( Union Dry Goods Co. v. Georgia P. S. Corp., \n248 \nU.S. 372, 375\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 117, 9 A. L. R. 1420; Producers' Transp. Co. v. R. R. Comm., \n251 \nU.S. 228, 232\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 131), there is, quite clearly, no principle \n\n[261 U.S. 379, 383]\n\u00a0\n which imposes an obligation to do so merely to relieve a contracting party from the burdens of an improvident undertaking. The power to fix rates, when exerted, is for the public welfare, to which private contracts must yield; but it is not an independent legislative function to vary or set aside such contracts, however unwise and unprofitable they may be. Indeed the exertion of legislative power solely to that end is precluded by the contract impairment clause of the Constitution. The power does not exist per se. It is the intervention of the public interest which justifies and, at the same time conditions its exercise.\n But the appellant contends that the statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment because it imposes restrictions upon the rate-making power of the commission in respect of the particular contracts of appellant here involved, which, it is said, are not imposed in the case of contracts of other utility corporations. In others words, it is urged that the act singles out the appellant for special restrain in this respect and is, therefore, unequal. While its meaning is not free from doubt, we do not so construe the act. The rule is fundamental that, if a statute admits of two constructions, the effect of one being to render the statute unconstitutional and of the other to establish its validity, the courts will adopt the latter. Railway Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 369\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 99. The language of this act is general. By its terms jurisdiction over all proceedings and hearings then pending before the Corporation Commission is transferred to the Railroad Commission. There follows a provision particularizing certain petitions numbered 417, 418 and 423, being the cases of appellant, as to which the Railroad Commission is directed to consider the testimony theretofore taken by the Corporation Commission and to hear such further testimony as may be appropriate to fully present such cases. The paragraph then concludes with \n\n[261 U.S. 379, 384]\n\u00a0\n the exception, already quoted, to the effect that the Railroad Commission shall have no power to modify or impair existing contracts for supplying gas, etc. Considering the several provisions of the act together, its terms fairly justify the conclusion that the exception was meant to apply to all proceedings pending before the Corporation Commission transferred to the Railroad Commission and not alone to the three specified cases. The record contains nothing to indicate the character or number of these proceedings and nothing to suggest that their grouping or subjection to the rule of the exception constitutes an unreasonable or arbitrary classification. The reasons which influenced the classifi ation are not disclosed on the face of the act, but the mere absence of such disclosure will not justify the court in assuming that appropriate reasons did not in fact exist. The presumption is that the action of the Legislature-which applies alike to all falling within the class-was with full knowledge of the conditions and that no arbitrary selection of persons for subjection to the prescribed rule was intended. See Atchison, Topeka, etc., Railroad Co. v. Mattews, \n174 \nU.S. 96, 106\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 609.\n The state Legislature is vested with a wide discretion in the matter and interference by this court may not be had merely because its exercise has produced inequality-every selection of subjects or persons for governmental regulation does that-but only where it has produced an inequality which is actually and palpably unreasonable and arbitrary.

U S FOR USE OF W B GUIMARIN & CO(1923)\nNo. 31\nArgued: February 27, 1923Decided: December 10, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. H. White and Elwood P. Morey, both of Washington, D. C., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Frank G. Tompkins, of Columbia, S. C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought by a subcontractor, in the name of the United States, in a Federal District Court in South Carolina, under the Materialmen's Act Aug. 13, 1894, c. 280, 28 Stat. 278, as amended by the \n\n[263 U.S. 427, 428]\n\u00a0\n Act Feb. 24, 1905, c. 778, 33 Stat. 811 (Comp. St.  6923) to recover on a contractor's bond for the construction of a naval storehouse. Judgment was had against the contractor and his surety for the full penalty of the bond. The Circuit Court of Appeals modified this judgment and remanded the cause to the District Court for further proceedings. 280 Fed. 338.\n The case has been brought here by writ of error, and many errors have been assigned going to the merits of the controversy. The record, however, presents the preliminary question whether the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals has such finality and completeness that it may be reviewed by this court under the writ.\n The Materialmen's Act, as amended, provides1 that the usual penal bond executed by anyone entering into a contract with the United States for the construction of any public work shall contain an additional obligation for the payment by the contractor of all persons supplying labor and materials in the prosecution of the work. Any such person not thus paid may intervene in any action instituted by the United States on the bond and obtain judgment pro rata with other intervenors, subject to the priority of the claim of the United States. And if no suit is brought by the United States within six months from the completion and final settlement of the contract, any such person shall have a right of action upon the bond, and may, within a specified time, bring suit against the contractor and his surety, in the name of the United States, for his use and benefit, in the Federal court of the district in which the contract was performed and prosecute the same to final judgment and execution. Where suit is so instituted by a creditor, only one action shall be brought, and any creditor may file his claim therein and be made a party thereto within \n\n[263 U.S. 427, 429]\n\u00a0\n a specified time. And if the recovery on the bond is inadequate to pay the amount due to all of said creditors, judgment shall be given to each creditor pro rata of the amount of the recovery.\n The independent right of action given a materialman or laborer by the amended Act, is to be enforced in a proceeding at law, and not in equity. Illinois Surety Co. v. Peeler, \n240 \nU.S. 214, 224\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 321. All claims under the bond are to be presented in a single action, in which every claimant may intervene and be heard as a party; and this action is to proceed as a single case, in which the several claimants are not entitled to separate trials as of right, although in exceptional instances, for special and persuasive reasons, the distinct causes of action asserted by them may be made the subject of separate trials. Miller v. Bonding Co., \n257 \nU.S. 304, 307\n, 308 S., 42 Sup. Ct. 98.\n The situation presented in the instant case is this: Arnold, one of the plaintiffs in error, in October, 1917, entered into a contract with the United States to construct a storehouse in the Navy Yard at Charleston, South Carolina. He executed a bond for $65,190 in conformity to the act with the Globe Indemnity Co., the other plaintiff in error, as surety.\n In November, 1920, the firm of Guimarin & Co., as use plaintiff, brought this action on the bond in the Federal District Court at Charleston, against Arnold and the Indemnity Company, to recover a balance of $7,725.52, with interest, alleged to be due it from Arnold under a subcontract for supplying the plumbing and other material in the storehouse. The complaint alleged that Arnold's contract with the United States had been completely performed and finally settled on April 17, 1920, and that the United States had not entered suit on the bond. The defendants answered, denying liability on \n\n[263 U.S. 427, 430]\n\u00a0\n various grounds, specifically denying that Arnold's contract had been finally settled on April 17, or that more than six months had elapsed since its completion or final settlement, and averring that the court was without jurisdiction because no such final settlement had been made. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Various other creditors filed intervening petitions in the case, setting up their claims; but neither the number nor the amount of these claims appears in the record.\n At the hearing, in June, 1921, the court held, over the defendant's objection, that the principal cause should be tried first, and that 'if a breach of the bond was established' judgment could then be rendered and other claimants permitted to assert their several claims 'to share in the fund thus created.' \n3\n The case was then tried upon the issues relating to the claim of Guimarin & Co., and a verdict rendered by direction, finding that Arnold's contract had been completely performed and finally settled on April 16, 1920, and that Guimarin & Co. was entitled to recover under its subcontract $7,693.31, with interest. The court thereupon without entering any separate judgment upon this verdict in favor of Guimarin & Co ., ordered that the cause be referred to a special master to take proof and report as to the claims of intervening creditors, and entered a judgment that the United States recover of the defendants $65,190, the penalty of the bond, with costs. \n\n[263 U.S. 427, 431]\n\u00a0\n Arnold and the Indemnity Company, before execution of the order of reference, sued out a writ of error for the review of this judgment by the Circuit Court of Appeals. There appears to have been no citation under this writ to the intervening creditors and no appearance by them in the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, after disposing, adversely to Arnold and the Indemnity Company, of various assignments of error relating to the alleged prematurity of the suit and the claim of Guimarin & Co., said:\n'Considering the action to be taken upon the judgment in this case, it seems to us, the same having been fully tried so far as the plaintiffs are concerned, ... that the action of the lower court should not be disturbed in its ascertainment of the amount due plaintiffs. The court instructed the jury to find for the plaintiffs, and properly so, ... and the judgment should be treated as that of a judgment on the bond, along with other petitioners, when judgments are rendered in their favor. The judgment ... directing the reference to a master to pass upon the claims of the several petitioners, should be modified, and a jury trial awarded, to determine in a single trial the amounts due the several petitioners . ... The court's idea, manifestly, in entering this judgment for the full penalty, was that, under South Carolina practice, such action constituted a forfeiture of the bond, and enabled persons in the position of the plaintiffs and the petitioners to come in and assert their claims, the aggregate not to exceed the amount of the bond, so far as the surety was concerned. ... It is evident ... that \n\n[263 U.S. 427, 432]\n\u00a0\n the court held, and meant to hold, that the contract between R. H. Arnold & Co. and the United States ... had been fully performed, and final settlement made on the 16th day of April, 1920, and that there was due to the plaintiffs from the general contractor the sum of $7,693.31, with interest, ... and that, suit having been instituted upon the bond in the name of the United States, suing for the use of W. B. Guimarin & Co., judgment should be entered in favor of the United States for the sum of $65,190, the penal sum of the bond, ... to be discharged by the payment to the said Guimarin & Co. of $7,693.31, with interest ... until paid, together with costs ; ... it appearing5 that the plaintiffs' and petitioners' claims combined do not exceed the penal sum of said bond. We think the judgment as thus understood is correct and should be so modified, and that the several petitioners, upon ascertainment of the amounts respectively due them, should be entitled to like judgments; the total judgments, including that of the plaintiffs herein, not to exceed the penalty of the bond. The decision of the lower court, as herein modified, will be approved and affirmed.'\n\n Judgment was thereupon entered modifying the judgment of the District Court 'as set forth in the opinion,' affirming it as modified, and remanding the cause for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion.\n It is evident that this judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals does not finally and completely dispose of the subject-matter of the litigation, either as to the parties or the causes of action involved. Looking to its substance, it adjudges, at the most, that the action was not prematurely brought and is to be sustained for the benefit of Guimarin & Co. and of the intervening creditors; and that \n\n[263 U.S. 427, 433]\n\u00a0\n the defendants are liable on the bond for the amount found by the verdict to be due Guimarin & Co. and for such additional amounts as may hereafter be found, on the jury trial awarded, to be due the intervening creditors, the aggregate amount of such recoveries, however, not to exceed the penalty of the bond. It does not adjudge the amounts which either Guimarin & Co. or the intervening creditors will ultimately be entitled to recover on the bond; but for these purposes remands the cause to the District Court for further proceedings. If upon the ascertainment of the amounts due the intervening creditors, the aggregate amount of the claims of Guimarin & Co. and of the intervening creditors are less than the penalty of the bond it is adjudged that they will be entitled to recoveries for the full amount of their claims; but if the aggregate amount exceeds the penalty of the bond they can only recover, under the express provision of the statute, pro rata of the amount of such penalty. In short, this judgment does not determine the ultimate amount which Guimarin & Co. may recover on the bond, the amounts which the intervening creditors may recover, or the amount of the ultimate liability of the defendants on the bond; it adjudicates neither the amount of the claims which are to be finally allowed against the fund created by the bond, nor the proportionate share of each creditor in such fund if inadequate to pay the amounts due all the creditors.\n In La Bourgogne, \n210 \nU.S. 95, 112\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 664, a proceeding in admiralty by the owner of a vessel for limitation of liability arising from a collision, it was held that a decree adjudging that the owner was entitled to the limitation sought, declaring that one class of claims could not be proved against the fund and remitting all questions concerning other claims for proof prior to final decree, was not a decree from which an appeal lay to this court, since the case not only involved primarily the owner's raight to limitation of lia- \n\n[263 U.S. 427, 434]\n\u00a0\n bility, but 'further involved the nature and amount of claims which would be allowed against the fund,' which had not been finally disposed of by the decree. So here, the action brought by Guimarin & Co. involves not merely the liability of the defendants on the bond, but also the amount of the claims which may be allowed against the fund created by the bond, which cannot be determined until after further proceedings are had in the District Court on the remanding of the cause pursuant to the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n It is well settled that a case may not be brought here by writ of error or appeal in fragments; that to be reviewable a judgment or decree must be not only final, but complete, that is, final not only as to all the parties, but as to the whole subject-matter and as to all the causes of action involved; and that if the judgment or decree be not thus final and complete, the writ of error or appeal must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Hohorst v. Packet Co., \n148 \nU.S. 262, 264\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 590; Collins v. Miller, \n252 \nU.S. 364, 370\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 347; Oneida Navigation Corporation v. Job, \n252 \nU.S. 521, 522\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 657; and cases therein cited.\n And it is clear that the present case does not come within the seeming exception to this rule that an adjudication final in its nature as to a matter distinct from the general subject of the litigation and affecting only the parties to the particular controversy, may be reviewed without awaiting the determination of the general litigation. See Williams v. Morgan, \n111 \nU.S. 684, 699\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 638, and Collins v. Miller, supra, \n252 U.S. 371\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 347. There has been no final adjudication of the amount which Guimarin & Co. is entitled to recover on the bond; and, furthermore, its right to a recovery is not distinct from the general subject of the litigation, but involves the determination of questions affecting the intervening creditors, who are likewise parties to the suit, as well as itself, and which, under the statute, are to be determined in a single action. \n\n[263 U.S. 427, 435]\n\u00a0\n For these reasons-although, as in Oneida Navigation Corporation v. Job, supra, the objection was not raised by the defendant in error6-the writ of error to the Circuit Court of Appeals is\n Dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The amended Act is set forth in full in the margin of the opinion in Texas Cement Co. v.

C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Constitution of North Carolina (article 5, section 3, as amended January 7, 1921) authorizes the General Assembly to tax incomes at a rate not exceeding 6 per cent. The Income Tax Act of March 8, 1921 (Revenue Act, c. 34, schedule D,  100-904, as amended by chapter 35, Public Laws 1921), laid upon corporations a tax equal to 3 per cent. of the entire net income as therein defined and upon individuals a progressive tax not exceeding that percentage. For the purpose of ascertaining the taxable income, the statute divides taxpayers into three classes-individuals, ordinary corporations, and public service corporations (including railroads). The statute, in terms, taxes only net income. For railroads and other public service corporations required to keep accounts according to the method established by the Interstate Commerce Commission, it makes those accounts the basis for determining the 'net operating income' (section 202 as amended), and it directs that, in order to ascertain the 'net income,' there shall be deducted from the net operating income (a) uncollectible revenue; (b) taxes for \n\n[262 U.S. 413, 416]\n\u00a0\n the income year, other than income taxes, and war profits and excess profits taxes; (c) amounts paid for car hire. Whether the statute is unconstitutional, ecause it fails to include among the deductions from income allowed public service corporations the capital charges, including other rentals paid, is the main question for decision.\n The first year's tax under the act was payable in 1922, with respect to the net income received during the calendar year 1921. To enjoin its enforcement these four corporations brought suit in the federal court for the Eastern district of North Carolina against the commissioner of revenue and others. Each plaintiff owns and operates a line of railroad within the state, and is an interstate carrier. Each assails the statute on the grounds that it violates the commerce clause, the Fourteenth Amendment, and the state Constitution, and only on these grounds. Each case was heard upon the merits, and in each a final decree was entered dismissing the bill. Appeals were taken under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St .  1215), and orders of the District Court stayed collection of the taxes pending the determination of the appeals. Since the cases are properly here on federal questions, all questions presented by the record, whether involving federal law or state law, must be considered. Southern Railway Co v. Watts, \n260 U.S. 519\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 192, 67 L. Ed. --.\n It is conceded by appellants that taxation of the net income of an interstate carrier does not violate the commerce clause, United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 U.S. 321\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 499, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 748; Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 57\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 221; Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 U.S. 113\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 45; and by the state, that taxation of gross receipts would be void as burdening interstate commerce, Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Ry. Co. v. Texas, \n210 U.S. 217\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 638. It is conceded by appellants that classification of public service corporations, and specifically of railroads, for purposes of taxation does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, \n\n[262 U.S. 413, 417]\n\u00a0\n Bell's Gap Railroad Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 533: Southern Railway Co. v. Watts, \n260 U.S. 519\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 192, 67 L. Ed. --; and by the state, that an arbitrary classification is obnoxious to the equal protection clause, Southern Ry. Co. v. Greene, \n216 U.S. 400\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 287, 17 Ann. Cas. 1247. The contentions are that the statute, in fact, taxes gross income; that the classification as made by it is unreasonable; and that for these and other reasons it violates both the federal and the state Constitution. All the contentions are, in our opinion, unsound. To appreciate the objections urged, and to present the reasons for holding them groundless, it is necessary to show the incidence of the tax. This may be done by examining how the assessment of $13,133.09 made upon the Seaboard Air Line, and here assailed, was calculated.\n The Seaboard being an interstate carrier, the accounts were kept as required by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Interstate business was apportioned, as customary, according to mileage. The results of operations within the state calculated according to the statute were these:\n Operating revenues $8,457,328 52 Operating expenses 7,308,823 29 ___ Net operating income $1,148,505 23\n From the net operating income were deducted:\n Uncollectible revenue $ 6,342 32 Taxes paid 410,043 38 Car hire 294,350 02 ___ Additional deductions $710,735 71 ___ Net taxable income $437,769 52 Tax on $437,769.52, at 3 per cent. $13,133.09.\n Thus, about 1\/20 of the operating revenues of the Seaboard was subjected to taxation. To this one-twentieth the 3 per cent. income tax was applied. \n\n[262 U.S. 413, 418]\n\u00a0\n The tax assessed ($13,133.09) is about 1\/650 of the total operating revenues $8,457,328.52.\n That the calculation is correct, in accordance with the statute, is not disputed; that s, the net income earned, in 1921, by the Seaboard's lines in North Carolina was as calculated $437,769.52. The Seaboard insists that it had no net income taxable in North Carolina, but, on the contrary, a loss, of which $254,290.22 was apportionable to North Carolina. The loss is figured in this way:\n Net income as calculated33 under the statutes $437,769 52 Non-operating income-not taken into account under the statute1 539,643 30 ___ Total net income $977,412 82 From which deduct: Capital charges (including rents paid) not taken into account under the statute2 $1,231,703 04 ___ Net loss or deficit $ 254,290 223 \n\n[262 U.S. 413, 419]\n\u00a0\n Thus the state takes, as the entity to be taxed, the railroad property operated by the Seaboard within the state. Therefore it takes, as the primary basis for the tax, only operating revenues; that is, the gross receipts from operating such property. The Seaboard, on the other hand, assumes, as the entity which should be taxed, the company in respect to its North Carolina interests. Therefore the Seaboard takes, as the primary basis for the tax, in addition to the operating revenues of the lines within the state, North Carolina's proportion of the nonoperating income of the company derived from other property owned by it, wherever situated. For the Seaboard, like \n\n[262 U.S. 413, 420]\n\u00a0\n most other railroad systems, is, to some extent, a holding company, as well as an operating company, and, as holding company, receives dividends from other concerns, interest on bonds of other concerns, and rental from property owned but not operated. As the state treats the operated property as the entity, it does not concern itself with interest charges and the rentals paid, just as it does not concern itself with a mortgage upon the real estate when it lays the ad valorem tax. On the other hand, as the Seaboard treats the company-the person-as the entity to be taxed, it undertakes to ascertain the net income of the company. This includes as gross income, a proportion of the receipts from property not within the state and includes among the deductions from the gross income of the company, the capital charges.\n That a state may, consistently with the federal Constitution, impose a tax upon the net income of property, as distinguished from the net income of him who owns or operates it, although the property is used in interstate commerce, was settled in Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 44\n, 52 S., 40 Sup. Ct. 221. There an Oklahoma statute was sustained which laid the tax upon the net income of Oklahoma oil property owned by a citizen and resident of Illinois. The federal Constitution which permits to be taxed the net income of property owned by an individual although a citizen of another state, obviously does not preclude such a tax where the property is owned or operated by a corporation. It is a common provision in state income tax laws to tax the net income of property within the state which is owned, or operated, by nonresidents. \n4\n The differences between the parties arise, in the main, not from difference \n\n[262 U.S. 413, 421]\n\u00a0\n in the method of determining what is net income, but from difference as to what is the subject of the tax. In other words, they differ as to the thing of which the net income is to be ascertained. This will appear from an examination of the several grounds on which the validity of the statute is assailed.\n First. The contention that the statute is obnoxious to the commerce clause rests upon the argument that the state's definition of net income differs from that adopted by the Interstate Commerce Commission; that the state is without power to depart from the Commission's definition so far as concerns interstate commerce; and that, since the statutory definition differs, the act is unconstitutional. A conclusive answer to that argument is found in the fact that the state adopts (without modification) the Commission's definition for the net income of that which it taxes; for, treating as the entity to be taxed the railroad property operated by the company within the state, it appears that every item which the railroad claims the statute wrongly disallowed as a deduction is of such a character, that it is either clearly a capital charge (as distinguished from an operating charge) or reasonably may be deemed such as a matter of accounting. \n5\n The question of law thus presented is not one which involves inquiry into the intricacies of railroad accounting. \n\n[262 U.S. 413, 422]\n\u00a0\n Under the commerce clause it is essential that a state tax shall not directly burden interstate commerce and that it shall not discriminate against interstate commerce. With these essentials the North Carolina act complies. It is not assessed on gross receipts. \n6\n Compare Peck & Co., Inc., v. Lowe, \n247 U.S. 165\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 432; Pullman Co. v. Richardson, \n261 U.S. 330\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 366, 67 L. Ed. --. It does not discriminate against interstate commerce. For the taxable net income of other public service corporations which are wholly intrastate is determined also without allowing capital charges as a deduction. That there is no basis for the claim that the commerce clause is violated by the burden resulting from the aggregate of the several North Carolina railroad road taxes was settled in Southern Ry. Co. v. Watts, supra.\n Another, and more technical, argument in support of the contention that the statute violates the commerce clause as applied to interstate carriers is based upon the cases which sustain the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to prescribe a uniform system of accounting. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[262 U.S. 413, 423]\n\u00a0\n It is said that, since the statute in ascertaining net income purports to follow the standard form of accounts prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission, but in fact departs therefrom, the statute invades the province of Congress and conflicts with the policy expressed in Transportation Act of 1920. There is in fact no such divergence in the accounting. But if there had been, it would not follow that every departure from the Commission's standard classification would render unconstitutional a state income tax act. The function of determining whether a tax burdens interstate commerce was not conferred upon the Commission. Its sole function is the regulation of carriers. For this purpose it has been empowered by Congress to require of them a uniform system of accounting. The financial results of their operations as therein disclosed are useful for many purposes. But they are not made conclusive for all. Moreover, the Commission's standard form is not immutable. Railway accounting is in process of development. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The contention that the statute is obnoxious to the equal protection clause rests upon the argument that the state's definition of net income of public service corporations (including railroads) is arbitrary. It is alleged to be arbitrary because it allows to other corporations and to individuals, certain deductions which \n\n[262 U.S. 413, 424]\n\u00a0\n are denied to public service corporations; namely, interest on funded debt, rentals, and certain worthless debts. Section 306, pars. 2, 3, 6, and 7. That the differentiation results from the difference in the subject of the tax and, hence, is not arbitrary has been pointed out above. But, in any event, the differentiation would not render the statute unconstitutional. The state might, consistently with the equal protection clause, have subjected only public service corporations to the income tax, or it might have laid upon them a higher income tax than upon others, as it laid upon railroads a higher franchise tax than it did upon other corporations. Compare Southern Railway Co. v. Watts, \n260 U.S. 519\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 192, 67 L. Ed. --.\n The classification is also assailed as arbitrary on the ground that section 202 defining net income applies only to corporations required to keep records 'according to the standard classification of accounting of the Interstate Commerce Commission'; that there are in the state corporations which are not required by law to keep their accounts according to the Commission's form, but which own railroads of standard gauge operated by steam, and have obtained authority to act as limited common carriers. In support of this contention, two railroads with short lines are instanced. They are owned by lumber companies and are taxed, not as railroads, but as if part of the lumber corporation. So far as appears the North Carolina authorities might require them to file accounts according to the Commission's classification, if they deemed this advisable. But obviously the state might reasonably classify such railroads differently from ordinary carriers.\n Third. The claim that the statute violates the state Constitution rests mainly on the contention that the tax is not upon the net income. \n9\n As shown above, the assumption \n\n[262 U.S. 413, 425]\n\u00a0\n is erroneous. Only the net income of the property operated as a utility is taxed. There is nothing in the Constitution of the state which precludes taxing the net income of the property so operated, as distinguished from the net income of the company. There is no inconsistency between sections 101 and 202 of the statute. It would seem from the decisions of the Supreme Court of North Carolina that the uniformity clause applies to incoem taxation; but that court has repeatedly held that the uniformity clause does not prevent reasonable classification. \n10\n The contention that the uniformity clause is violated because the permissible deductions in the case of public service corporations are different from (and not so great as) those allowed individuals or other defendants11 is unfounded, for reasons stated above. So is the contention that the statute is retroactive and void, because it was not enacted until March, 1922, but lays a tax based upon the net income of the calendar year.\n On behalf of the state it was urged that the bill was properly dismissed by the District Court because there is under the laws of North Carolina a plain, adequate, and \n\n[262 U.S. 413, 426]\n\u00a0\n complete remedy at law by which a taxpayer may recover the amount of an illegal tax paid by him under protest. Our attention has been called to several North Carolina cases and statutes bearing upon this contention. But the statute mainly relied upon is a recent one which appears not to have been construed and applied by the highest court of the state. In the absence of such decision, we cannot say the remedy at law is plain and adequate. Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries, \n255 \nU.S. 288, 296\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 272; Wallace v. Hines, \n253 \nU.S. 66, 68\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 435; Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 47\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 221; Union Pacific R. R. Co. v. Weld County, \n247 U.S. 282\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 510; Davis v. Wakelee, \n156 \nU.S. 680, 688\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 555. We have therefore passed upon the merits.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The items of the above nonoperating income are these: Dividend income $113,350 45 Income from funded securities 97,257 47 Income from unfunded securities 13,781 90 Income from lease of road 259,525 95 Joint facility rent income 12,664 17 Rent from work equipment 5,047 23 Rent from floating equipment 18 22 Rent from locomotives 6,767 21 Miscellaneous rent income 22,387 79 Miscellaneous nonoperating physical property 7,685 69 Miscellaneous income 1,157 22 ___ $539,643 30 \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The items of the above capital charges are these: Interest on funded debt $1,179,252 20 Interest on unfunded debt 43,823 64 Annual allotment of discount on bonds 24,494 16 Rent of leased roads 10,448 12 Rent of joint facility 34,480 98 Rent of locomotives 19,860 91 Rent for floating equipment 2,599 96 Rent for working equipment 510 24 Rents, miscellaneous 3,194 86 Income charges, miscellaneous 685 25 ___ $1,231,703 04\n If the above items were added, the total would be $1,319,350.32. There is apparently some error in the items, which is not, however, material to the result. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] For the Atlantic Coast Line the calculation in accordance with the statute shows a net income of $1,389,565.25. According to the the company's contention the net income was $333,205.09. \n For the Norfolk Southern the calculation in accordance with the statute, it is said, shows a net income of $653,882.17. (The correct figures would seem to be $603,003.51.) According to the company's contention there was a deficit of $424,338.92.\n For the Southern Railway the calculation in accordance with the statute shows a net income of $2,384,068.71. According to the company's contention, the net income on one calculation was $554,724.41, and on another calculation was $456,798.56. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The federal government taxes the net income of property owned or business carried on within the United States by a citizen resident abroad.

Ct. 228, taxes the net income 'from all property owned ... by natural persons not residents of the state.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] To prove that the statute, in fact, taxes some part of the gross earnings, attention is called specifically to some minor items which the statute does not allow as deductions. But these stand in no different position than the major items-interest on funded debt and leased line rentals-discussed above. Prominent mong these lesser items is 'joing facility rents' which, in the case of the Seaboard, amounted net to $21, 816.81. Joint facility rents paid were $34,480.98; those received ( credited as nonoperating income) were $12,664.17. This is rental paid for railroad facilities-like tracks, terminals and roundhouses. They are needed by the carrier as a part of the plant and, not being owned, are rented from others. The fact that they are used jointly with others, is, of course, immaterial. This rent, like the rent of a leased line, is paid to secure control of the property operated. Hire of freight cars might have been treated in the same way, but the state, for reasons satisfactory to it, permitted that financial charge to be deducted, and to that extent reduced the tax. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The term 'net income,' in law or in economics, has not a rigid meaning. Every Income Tax Act necessarily defines what is included in gross income; what deductions are to be made from the gross to ascertain net income; and what part, if any, of the net income, is exempt from taxation. These details are largely a matter of governmental policy. As to them states differ; and there is apt to be difference of view in the same states at different times; and at the same time a different definition of taxable net income for different classes of taxpayers. Obviously such differences in detail do not render obnoxious to the commerce clause a state income tax which is otherwise unobjectionable. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v.

Power to prescribe a mandatory accounting system was first conferred upon the, commission by Hepburn Act June 29, 1906, c. 3591,  7 (34 Stat. 584, 593 [ Comp. St.  8592]). In 1888 a recommendatory classification of operating revenues, expenses and charges was issued by the Commission, and between that date and 1908 the form was revised from time to time. On June 1, 1908, the Commission ordered carriers to make reports in the form prescribed and furnished by the Commission. Thereafter changes continued to be made from time to time. A comprehensive and detailed classification of income accounts was issued effective July 1, 1912. This was superseded by the revised classification effective July 1, 1914, which is now in orce. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The provision is: 'The General Assembly may also tax ... incomes provided the rate ... shall not ... exceed six per cent., and there ... may be allowed ... deductions ... so that only net incomes are taxed.' \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Smith v.

Keeling, of Mexia, Tex., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in a state court of Texas by the receivers of a Texas corporation, the International & Great Northern Railway, against the taxing authorities for Harris county. It seeks to enjoin the collection of the tax assessed for the year 1915 upon the so-called intangible property of the company within that county. The trial court denied the relief prayed; and, on defendants' cross action and a plea in reconvention, entered judgment against the plaintiffs for the amount of the tax. The Court of Civil Appeals reversed this judgment and granted the injunction. 197 S. W. 1043. Its judgment was in turn reversed by the Supreme Court of the state, \n\n[263 U.S. 137, 139]\n\u00a0\n which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. 229 S. W. 493. The case comes here on writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code as amended (Comp. St.  1214), and also on a petition for a writ of certiorari, consideration of which was postponed until the hearing on the writ of error. The claims are that the statute under which the taxes were assessed is obnoxious to the Fourteenth Amendment, and that rights guaranteed by it have been denied in the administration of the statute.\n Under the laws of Texas ad valorem taxes for both state and county purposes, are laid upon the property of a railroad in every county in which its line is located. The value is determined separately for tangible and for intangible property. The assessment of the tangible property is made by county officials. The assessment of the intangible property is fixed by the state tax board. It values the intangible property of the company as a whole; and then apportions the amount among the several counties on a mileage basis. Upon the aggregate of the assessments of the tangivle and the intangible property so made for each county, the tax is laid by the county officials at the rate found to be necessary and collected by the county's tax collector. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Intangible values of a railroad company have been declared by the highest court of the state to mean 'the values of the railroad properties above the value of its physical assets.' Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Shannon, 100 Tex. 379, 390, 100 S. W. 138, 10 L. R. A. (N. S.) 681. Under the statute the value of the intangible is to be determined by deducting the value of the tangivle from the value of the entire railroad property. Article 7420. To enable the state board to determine the values, the company is required to furnish data. Articles 7415-7419. The board, on the other \n\n[263 U.S. 137, 140]\n\u00a0\n hand, is required to submit a preliminary estimate of the valuation and to give the company an opportunity to be heard thereon, so that changes may be made before the valuation is declared defective. Some methods of calculation are set forth in the statute; but it is provided that these are not to be deemed mandatory; that all available evidence must be considered; and that the method of calculation which will best bring about a fair valuation shall be adopted. Article 7419\n\n\n The board duly submitted its preliminary estimate. This it later amended upon the discovery of an error. Thereupon a hearing was held at which the company introduced evidence. The board adhered to its own estimate as amended. The aggregate assessment for the year 1915 upon this railroad's property within Harris county was $1,709,332. Of this amount, $ 603,227.44 was on intangible property. The tax rate was $1.09 1\/2 per $100 of valuation. The amount of the tax so laid was $6,605.34. The trial court found that the actual value of the tangible property alone in Harris county was $3,205,202.09; and that the assessment upon this was only 34 per cent. of that value.\n The contention that the statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment is wholly without merit. It has long been settled that the due process clause does not preclude a state from taxing the intangible property of a railroad, or from ascertaining its value substantially in the manner prescribed by the statute herein assailed; that the equal protection clause is not violated by prescribing different rules of taxation for railroad companies than for concerns engaged in other lines of business;2 and that the federal \n\n[263 U.S. 137, 141]\n\u00a0\n Constitution does not afford protection against double taxation by a state, which is here alleged. \n3\n The writ of error is dismissed. The contention that the due process and equal protection clauses have been violated in administering the statute is rested upon many claims. Two of them are substantial. The writ of certiorari is, therefore, granted. But, for the reasons to be stated, the judgment below must be affirmed.\n The company has 1,106 miles of road and extends into 37 counties. The alleged cost of its 'road and equipment' to June 30, 1915, was $46,502,041. 55; its alleged depreciated value (as of June 30, 1914), $37,243,133.44; its value as fixed by the Railroad Commission, $34,013,092.07. A foreclosure was effected in 1911. The reorganization largely reduced the capitalization, leaving outstanding a mortgage debt of only $25,239,000, and capital stock of $4,822,000. The net earnings of the company in 1911 to 1914 were so small that, if the property were capitalized on the basis of 7 per cent., it would appear to have been worth less than $30,000,000 in 1912, and in 1914 less than $1,000,000. In the latter year the company, unable to pay its fixed charges, again passed into receivers' hands. The state tax board fixed the value of the physical property in 1915 at $28, 372,810, and of the intangibles at $10,743,233; making the value of the entire property $39,116,033.\n The receivers contend that, even if the value of the entire property was as found by the state board, the physical property was undervalued, resulting in an overvaluation of the intangibles so gross as to amount to a denial of due process of law. There was evidence, including statements made by the receivers, which supports the state board's valuation. The trial court, upholding this valuation, found that it represented the honest judgment \n\n[263 U.S. 137, 142]\n\u00a0\n of the state board; and that there was no evidence of arbitrary action or of improper motives on its part. This holding of the trial court was approved by the highest court of the state. There is no evidence of arbitrary action, of fraud, or of gross error in the system on which the valuation was made, to justify the claim of denial of due process. Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Ry. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 421, 434\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 1114; Maish v. Arizona, \n164 U.S. 599\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 193, 610. Mere errors of judgment are not subject to review in this proceeding. Southern Ry. Co. v. Watts, \n260 \nU.S. 519, 527\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 192.\n The receivers also contend that the tax is void, under the equal protection clause, because the tangibles were intentionally and systematically assessed, by the county authorities, at not more than 38 per cent. of their actual value, while intangibles were assessed, by the state board, at their full value. Where illegal discrimination was practiced, it is immaterial whether it was effected by a single assessing board or through the action of two independent boards. Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 513\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88; Southern Ry. Co. v. Watts, \n260 \nU.S. 519, 526\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 192. Under the laws of Texas the assessments are made by the separate action of two independent boards using different methods, but the taxes upon the tangible and the intangible property if railroads are laid at the same rate, and are collected by the same county officers. It is the settled law of the state that equitable relief will not be granted, on the ground of discrimination, against an excessive assessment of either one, if, taking the tax on tangible and the tax on intangible property together, the taxpayer is not called upon to pay, on the average, on a higher percentage of the actual value than are other persons and property. Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Hassell, 57 Tex. Civ. App. 522, 123 S. W. 190; Druesdow v. Baker (Tex. Com. App.) 229 S. W. 493. Thus, the taxes on the two kinds of property are treated by its courts as parts \n\n[263 U.S. 137, 143]\n\u00a0\n of a single ad valorem tax on railroads. Their construction of the state statutes is binding upon us. The trial court found on adequate evidence that the aggregate assessment placed upon the tangible and the intangible property of the railroad in Harris county was about 45 per cent. of their aggregate true value, whereas the other property in the county was assessed at about 50 per cent. of its true value. Thus the railroad was not, in essence, subjected to any discrimination. Compare Davenport Bank v. Board of Equalization, \n123 U.S. 83\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 73.

McCarron, both of Washington, D. C., and R. Marsden Smith, of Baltimore, Md., for appellant.\n Messrs. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., and Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for the United States. \n\n[260 U.S. 565, 566]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant brought an action in the Court of Claims against the United States to recover the sum of $55,158.00, alleged to have been illegally exacted as stamp taxes upon 13 deeds of conveyance made and delivered to appellant by its subsidiary companies. The deeds were without valuable consideration, and were executed for the sole purpose of transferring legal title, to enable appellant to mortgage the property conveyed. On February 11, 1915, before the delivery of these deeds, appellant exhibited three of them to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and asked for a ruling, thereby making what it alleges was a claim in abatement. The Commissioner held that the Stamp Tax Act (38 Stat. 745) applied, and the appellant, without protest, affixed to the thirteen deeds the requisite amount of stamps.\n Four years later the Commissioner, in construing a similar act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057), held that 'where no valuable consideration passed stamps were not required on conveyances.'\n Appellant thereupon filed with the commissioner a claim for refund of the taxes paid, which was rejected, because barred by the statute of limitations.\n Appellant now alleges that its claim for a refund constitutes an amendment of its original so-called claim in abatement. The Court of Claims sustained a demurrer to appellant's petition alleging the foregoing, upon the ground that the original request to the Commissioner for a ruling was not a claim either for abatement or refund, but that the claim for a refund was in effect first made in 1919, and therefore, that the Commissioner's ruling was right.\n The Act of May 12, 1900, c. 393, 31 Stat. 177, as amended by the Act of June 30, 1902, c. 1327, 32 Stat. 506 (Comp. St.  6346), provides in part: \n\n[260 U.S. 565, 567]\n\u00a0\n 'That the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, subject to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, may, upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of the facts, make allowance for or redeem such of the stamps, issued under authority of law, to denote the payment of any internal revenue tax, as may have been spoiled ... or in any manner wrongfully collected: ... Provided further, that no claim for the redemption of or allowance for stamps shall be allowed unless presented within two years after the purchase of said stamps from the government.'\n By section 3226, Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  5949), no suit can be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally collected until appeal has been made to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, as provided by law, and the decision of the Commissioner thereon has been had.\n The preliminary request to the Commissioner for an informal ruling was in no sense a claim for abatement or refund. Appellant affixed the stamps to the deeds without protest and after that no effort was made to secure redemption of or allowance for the stamps until long after the two- year period had expired.\n On the facts alleged in the petition the Court of Claims could not have done otherwise than sustain the demurrer.

C., for appellant.\n Mr. Blackburn Esterline, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Railroad Company filed its petition in the Court of Claims asking judgment for the amount of certain 'extraordinary expenses' which it claimed to have incurred in constructing a branch railroad to the Ordnance Depot at Curtis Bay, Maryland, under 'an informal or implied agreement' with officers of the War Department for the reimbursement of such expenses by the United States. The Dent Act, March 2, 1919, c. 94, 40 Stat. 1272 ( Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 14\/15 a-3115 14\/15 e). A demurrer to this petition was sustained. 56 Ct. Cl. 377. \n\n[261 U.S. 385, 386]\n\u00a0\n The allegations of the petition setting forth specifically 'the nature, terms and conditions' of the 'agreement', may be thus summarized: Having previously determined to build a branch railroad into the Curtis Bay region, for the purpose of developing new territory, the Railroad Company, in the summer of 1917, at the request of the War Department, changed in part the location of the proposed line so as to pass alongside the Ordnance Depot which the War Department planned to build. The company then contracted with a construction company for the building of the railroad to the site of the Depot, on a unit-price basis. The work was greatly delayed by the relocation of the line, and carried into the winter months. After numerous conferences as to means of expediting the work, the officers of the Department, in December, insisted that the operations at the Depot would be seriously hampered unless the company could greatly increase progress on the construction of the railroad, and that, in order to furnish track facilities for handling construction materials and freight at the Depot, it was very urgent that the railroad be completed at the earliest possible moment. Thereupon, in order to meet the urgent needs of the Department, the company, in January, 1918, determined to and did cancel the contract for constructing the railroad on a unit-price basis, and made a contract with another construction company for completing it on a cost plus basis. By working continuously, day and night, the new contractor completed the railroad to the Depot in the latter part of February, before it would have been completed under the original contract. The excess cost of thus constructing the railroad under the cost plus plan and the extraordinary expense incurred in hurrying its completion, amounted to $85,474.06; for which judgment was prayed.\n These allegations show no 'agreement, express or implied' for the payment of these expenses, which is essential \n\n[261 U.S. 385, 387]\n\u00a0\n to an award in plaintiff's favor under the provisions of the Dent Act. No express agreement is alleged. And manifestly the mere fact that, on the urgent insistence of the officers of the Department that the construction of the railroad be hastened so as to handle construction materials for the Depot and other freight (necessarily yielding revenue to the railroad), the company, on its own determination, substituted the cost plan of construction for the unit-price plan, without any notice to the Department of its intention so to do or of the increased expenses that would result, does not, in the absence of any intimation that it would look to the United States for reimbursement of such increased expenses or of any suggestion by the Department that such reimbursement would be made, afford any substantial basis upon which an agreement for the payment of such expenses can be implied.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims dismissing the petition is accordingly\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","16":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBALTIMORE & O. R. CO. v. U S(1923)\nNo. 305\nArgued: March 12, 1923Decided: April 9, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[261 U.S. 592, 593]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John F. McCarron and Geo. E. Hamilton, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Railway Company filed its petition, under the Dent Act (March 2, 1919, c. 94, 40 Stat. 1272 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 14\/15 a- 3115 14\/15 e]), to recover compensation for constructing temporary barracks for the use of United States troops under an 'implied agreement' alleged to have been entered into by it with the United States, in December, 1917, through Col. Kimball, Expeditionary Quartermaster of the War Department, at Locust Point, Baltimore, Maryland, acting under the authority of the Secretary of War. The Court of Claims, after a hearing on the merits, and upon its findings of fact, dismissed the petition (57 Ct. Cl. 140).\n The material facts shown by the findings are these: The Railroad Company owned at Locust Point, a suburb of Baltimore, eight piers, which were guarded by its civilian employes. At the request of Col. Kimball, who was \n\n[261 U.S. 592, 594]\n\u00a0\n in charge of the expeditionary depot at Baltimore and of the supplies arriving for shipment to Europe, the company, in October, 1917, leased one of these piers to the Government. Two of the other piers with much other property belonging to the company were destroyed or damaged by a fire supposed to be of incendiary origin. Thereupon Col. Kimball and the president of the company separately requested the Secretary of War to send a guard; the vice president of the company offering to supply a wrecking train as quarters for them. Two companies of the National Guard were sent to Locust Point, with sufficient tentage. They were quartered for a time in the wrecking train furnished by the company. Their duty was primarily to protect the government property and the piers leased by it, sending patrols throughout the railroad yard to guard cars containing its property, and generally to guard all the piers and property at Locust Point. The company, however, also maintained the civilian guards and a fire department for all of its property, whether leased or not. Later, the wrecking train having been moved away by the company, the troops moved into tents. The weather during the fall and winter was very cold and inclement. Most of the soldiers were Baltimoreans and were frequently visited by their relatives. There was some sickness among them. Their relatives complained to the railroad officials of hardships they had to undergo in the tents; and these officials were anxious to make them as comfortable as possible. Several times in very cold weather Col. Kimball remarked to the company's agent at Locust Point, whose duty it was to confer with him on railroad matters, that the troops ought to have better quarters. On one occasion this agent suggested fitting up an unused transfer shed belonging to the company, standing near the pier that had been leased to the Government. Col. Kimball agreed that it would be a fine thing to make the men as comfortable \n\n[261 U.S. 592, 595]\n\u00a0\n as possible. He did not, however, ask that this work be done; and nothing was said about compensation. This agent having taken up with the company's officials the matter of fitting up the transfer shed, its chief engineering draftsman was directed to see as to the adaptability of the transfer shed for barracks. He made blue print plans for remodeling the shed; which he showed to the officer in command of the troops, to learn whether, in his opinion, they would satisfactorily house the troops. This officer, which not undertaking to approve the plans, suggested the amount of facilities that would be required. Nothing was said to him, however, about expense or compensation for the work. The construction of the temporary barracks was completed in the latter part of December; and the troops moved in. Two more piers were afterwards leased by the company to the Government. The barracks were occupied by the troops until May, 1919 and the piers were returned to the company in June, 1919. No government officials connected with the work at Locust Point had any authority to order the construction of the temporary barracks; and no orders were given by any of them for such construction. The subject of compensation was not mentioned in any conversations between these officers and the railroad officials until more than a week after the barracks had been completed, when the chief draftsman told the officer in command of the troops that he thought the Government should reimburse him for some of his trouble.\n The Court of Claims made no finding as to the amount expended by the company in constructing the temporary barracks; the company having, as the court stated, submitted no evidence to establish the different items of its claim. In the absence o a finding as to the amount of the expenditures, as to which the company had the burden of proof, the judgment of the Court of Claims might be properly affirmed upon that ground. Crocker v. United \n\n[261 U.S. 592, 596]\n\u00a0\n States, \n240 \nU.S. 74, 82\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 245. However, as the Government does not here question the amount of the claim, we pass to its further consideration upon the merits.\n Upon the findings of fact we conclude that the petition was rightly dismissed, without reference to the amount of the claim, for two reasons:\n\n 1. \nThe Dent Act authorizes the award of compensation for expenditures connected with the prosecution of the war when they were made by the claimant upon the faith of an 'agreement, express or implied,' entered into by him with an officer or agent acting under the authority of the Secretary of War or of the President, and such agreement was not executed in the manner provided by law. 40 Stat. 1272, 1273; American Smelting Co. v. United States, \n259 \nU.S. 75, 79\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 420. The act was intended to remedy irregularities and informalities in the mode of entering into such agreements; not to enlarge the authority of the agents by whom they were made. To entitle the claimant to compensation under such an agreement it is essential that the officer or agent with whom it was entered into should not merely have been holding under the Secretary of War or the President, but that he should have been acting within the scope of his authority. It was not intended, for example, that an officer in one branch of the military service or one of inferior rank could bind the Government by an agreement as to matters relating to an entirely different branch of the service or within the control of his superior officers, as to which he had no authority whatever; or that an agreement into which he entered, although beyond his authority, should become binding upon the Government because it was made in the form of an express agreement not executed within the legal manner or of an implied agreement merely-that is, that his authority should be enlarged by the irregularity or informality with which it was exercised. See United States v. North American Transportation \n\n[261 U.S. 592, 597]\n\u00a0\n & Trading Co., \n253 \nU.S. 330, 333\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 518, and Portsmouth Harbor Land Co. v. United States, \n260 U.S. 327\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 135, 67 L. Ed. --, decided by this Court, December 4, 1922\n\n\n Here, however, there is no finding that Col. Kimball had any authority to enter into the alleged agreement; and, on the contrary, such authority is negatived by the finding that none of the government officials connected with the work at Locust Point had any authority to order the construction of a temporary barracks.\n Hence an essential element in the establishment of the company's claim is lacking.\n\n 2. \nThe 'implied agreement' contemplated by the Dent Act as the basis of compensation is not an agreement 'implied in law,' more aptly termed a constructive or quasi contract, where, by fiction of law, a promise is imputed to perform a legal duty, as to repay money obtained by fraud or duress, but an agreement 'implied in fact,' founded upon a meeting of minds, which, although not embodied in an express contract, is inferred, as a fact, from conduct of the parties showing, in the light of the surrounding circumstances, their tacit understanding. See, by analogy, as to the construction of similar jurisdictional statutes, United States v. Berdan Firearms Co., \n156 \nU.S. 552, 566\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 420; Russell v. United States, \n182 \nU.S. 516, 530\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 899; Harley v. United States, \n198 \nU.S. 229, 234\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 634; United States v.

United States, \n248 \nU.S. 121, 129\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 56; and Sutton v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 575, 581\n, 41 S. Sup. t. 563, 19 A. L. R. 403; and, generally, Railway Co. v.

Law Dict. (Rawle's 3d Rev.) 660. That this provision of the Dent Act relates only to such actual agreements, implied in fact from the circumstances, is not only indicated by its purpose, as expressed in the caption, of providing relief in cases of 'contracts' connected \n\n[261 U.S. 592, 598]\n\u00a0\n with the prosecution of the war, but is conclusively shown by the fact that the 'agreement' is described as one 'entered into, in good faith,' by the claimant, with an officer or agent of the Government, upon the faith of which expenditures have been made or obligations incurred, and which has not been executed as prescribed by law; this language aptly describing an actual agreement implied in fact, but being manifestly inapplicable to a constructive agreement implied in law.\n Such an agreement will not be implied unless the meeting of minds was indicated by some intelligible conduct, act or sign. Woods v. Ayres, 39 Mich. 351, 33 Am. Rep. 396, and cases there cited. And so an agreement to pay for services rendered by the plaintiff will not be implied when they were rendered spontaneously, without request, as an act of kindness (Woods v. Ayres, 39 Mich. 351, 33 Am. Rep. 396); when the plaintiff did not expect payment, or under the circumstances did not have reason to entertain such expectation (Coleman v. United States, \n152 \nU.S. 96, 99\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 473; Lafontain v. Hayhurst, 89 Me. 388, 391); when the defendant understood that the plaintiff would neither expect nor demand remuneration (Harley v. United States, \n198 U.S. 235\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 634); when unusual expenses were incurred, without special request or previous notice, and without any intimation or suggestion that compensation would be looked for or made (Baltimore & Ohio Railroad v. United States, \n261 U.S. 385\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 384, 67 L. Ed. -- decided by this court March 19, 1923); when the defendant neither requested the services nor assented to receiving their benefit under circumstances negativing any presumption that they would be gratuitous (Railway Co. v. Gaffney, 65 Ohio St. p. 116, 61 N. E. 152; 2 Abb. Tr. Ev. [3d Ed.] 912, and cases there cited;1 and \n\n[261 U.S. 592, 599]\n\u00a0\n when the circumstances account for the transaction on a ground more probable than that of a promise of recompense. Wood v. Ayres, 39 Mich. 351, 33 Am. Rep. 396.2\n In the present case the findings of fact show that Col. Kimball did not order the construction of the barracks, which was voluntarily undertaken by the company, without saying anything whatever about compensation, apparently from its own desire to provide for the comfort of the troops, who were guarding its property as well as that of the Government, after it had removed the wrecking train which it had offered to supply as their quarters. It does not appear from the findings that Col. Kimball requested the construction of the barracks; that the company intimated that it would expect payment from the Government or that Col. Kimball suggested that such payment would be made; or that the company in fact expected compensation. It is clear that these findings furnish no substantial basis for implying an agreement that the Government would pay the cost of the construction.\n Hence, a second essential element in the establishment of the company's claim is lacking.\n And the judgment of the Court of Claims is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] But an agreement to compensate the plaintiff for the use of his property will be implied when it was used by the defendant without claim of right, and the plaintiff consented to such use with the expectation of receiving compensation.

WHITNEY CENT NAT BANK(1923)\nNo. 205\nArgued: January 15, 1923Decided: February 19, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. Henry Root Stern, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. J. Blanc Monroe, of New Orleans, La., and Martin Conboy, of Riverdale on Hudson, N. Y., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Bank of America, a New York corporation, brought this action in the federal court for the Southern district of New York, against the Whitney Central National Bank, which has its banking house and usual place of business at New Orleans, La. Service of process was made solely by delivering a summons to its president while temporarily in New York. Defendant appeared specially, challenged the jurisdiction of the court, and moved that the service be set aside. The questions of fact arising on the motion were referred to a special master to take proofs and make findings. The motion was heard upon his report, and the service was set aside \n\n[261 U.S. 171, 172]\n\u00a0\n on the ground that defendant was not amenable to process within the district. The case is here under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215); the question of jurisdiction having been duly certified. The sole question for decision is whether, at the time of the service of the process, defendant was doing business within the district in such manner as to warrant the inference that it was present there. Philadelphia & Reading Ry. Co. v. McKibbin, \n243 \nU.S. 264, 265\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 280; Rosenberg Bros. & Co., Inc., v. Curtis Brown Co. (No. 102, Jan. 2, 1923) \n260 U.S. 516\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 170, 67 L. Ed.--.\n The facts relied upon to establish presence of the defendant within the district consist wholly of its relations to the Hanover National Bank and five other banks, whose places of business are located in New York, and of transactions conducted through them. Each of these six banks is what is commonly called a correspondent of the defendant. In each the Whitney Central carries continuously an active, regular deposit account. But its transactions with these banks are not limited to making deposits and drawing against them. Superimposed upon the simple relation of bank and depositor are numerous other transactions which necessarily involve also the relationship of principal and agent. These additional transactions conducted by the correspondent banks include: Payment in New York of drafts drawn, with accompanying documents, against letters of credit issued by defendant at New Orleans; the receipt in New York from brokers and others of securities in which the Whitney Central or its depositors are interested, and the delivery of such securities; the making of payment to persons in New York for such securities; the holding of such securities on deposit in New York for long periods and arranging substitution of securities; the cashing, under specific instructions from defendant given in New Orleans, of checks drawn on it by third parties with whom it had no banking or deposit relations; t e receipt in New York \n\n[261 U.S. 171, 173]\n\u00a0\n from third parties, with whom defendant apparently had no banking relations, of deposits of moneys for account of its customers.\n The Whitney Central had what would popularly be called a large New York business. The transactions were varied, important and extensive. But it had no place of business in New York. None of its officers or employees was resident there. Nor was this New York business attended to by any one of its officers or employees resident elsewhere. Its regular New York business was transacted for it by its correspondents-the six independent New York banks. They, not the Whitney Central, were doing its business in New York. In this respect their relationship is comparable to that of a factor acting for an absent principal. The jurisdiction taken of foreign corporations, in the absence of statutory requirement or express consent, does not rest upon a fiction of constructive presence, like 'qui facit per alium facit per se.' It flows from the fact that the corporation itself does business in the state or district in such a manner and to such an extent that its actual presence there is established. That the defendant was not in New York, and hence was not found within the district, is clear.\n Whether a national bank could under any circumstances be subjected. without its consent, to suit in a state or district, other than that in which it is authorized to locate its banking house, we have no occasion to consider in this case. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Revised Statutes,  5190 (Comp.

Comley and Daniel Davenport, both of Bridgeport, Conn., for plaintiffs in error. \n\n[260 U.S. 647, 648]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By section 1190 of a statute of the state of Connecticut passed in 1915 it is provided that:\n'All taxable property of any estate upon which no town or city tax has been assessed ... or upon which no tax has been paid to the state during the year preceding the date of the death of the decedent, shall be liable to a tax of two per centum per annum on the appraised inventory value of such property for the five years next preceding the date of the death of such decedent, provided, the executor or administrator of any estate may, by furnishing evidence to the satisfaction of the tax commissioner that a state, town or city tax has been paid on any of such property for a portion of said five years or that the ownership of such property has not been in the decedent for a portion of said period, obtain a proportionate deduction from the tax hereby imposed. ...'\n\n It is further provided (section 1192) that:\n'Any executor, administrator or representative of such an estate aggrieved by the action of the tax commissioner in determining such tax, if unable to agree with the tax commissioner upon the amount of such tax as provided in section 1190, may, within ninety days from the time of the filing by the tax commissioner of such statement or corrected statement with the judge of probate, make application in the nature of an appeal therefrom to the superior court of the county in which such probate court is located which shall be accompanied by a citation to said tax commissioner to appear before such court.'\n\n Lena McMullen died in 1919, and the information required by an act passed in that year, amendatory of an act concerning inventories of estates,1 having been filed by plaintiffs in error as her executors, and sent, as required, \n\n[260 U.S. 647, 649]\n\u00a0\n by the probate judge to the tax commissioner, that officer filed with the state treasurer a statement that there was due from the estate of the decedent to the state of Connecticut by virtue of its statutes, $10,286.39, and made claim for such sum.\n Plaintiffs in error, within the time provided in section 1192, made, to quote from the language of the section, 'application in the nature of an appeal' from the claim to the superior court of the county in which the probate court was located, in accordance with section 1192\n\n\n The tax commissioner, acting for the state, demurred 'to the reasons of application and appeal,' and the superior court, by consent of the parties, reserved the questions of law arising upon the demurrer 'for the advice of the Supreme Court of Errors ... as to what judgment should be entered' on the demurrer. In fulfillment of the 'reservation' the Supreme Court of Errors took the case, adjudged the statute to be valid, and advised the superior court 'to sustain the demurrer and to dismiss the application.'\n The superior court, in execution of that direction, sustained the demurrer and entered judgment dismissing the 'application in the nature of an appeal.' To review that judgment is the purpose of this writ of error. Manifestly, however, it is the views and reasoning of the Supreme Court of Errors that must engage our attention, as they constituted the foundation of the judgment of the superior court.\n In description of the statute the Court of Errors said its purpose is 'to compel estates to pay to the state a sum which shall approximately equal the taxes which the property of the estate has escaped paying while in the hands of the decedent,' and 'the single point raised by the demurrer,' the court further said, 'is that the statutes which authorize this action of the commissioner are unconstitutional.' \n\n[260 U.S. 647, 650]\n\u00a0\n The specifications of the ground of offense urged by plaintiffs in error against the Fourteenth Amendment (and with this we are only concerned) were said by the court to be that the statute deprived--\n'creditors and distributees of this estate of their property without due process of law (a) by exacting a penalty from them for the failure of the decedent to list his property for taxation; and (b) by creating against them a presumption of guilt for such omission.'\n\n The comment of the court upon the specifications was that both--\n'rest on the unfounded premise that the property of this estate upon the decease of the owner passed to the distributees subject to the payment of the just debts of the estate.'\n\n And the court further said:\n'The right to dispose of one's property by will and the right to have it disposed of by law after decease is created by statute and therefore the state may impose such conditions upon the exercise of this right as it may determine. Stone et al. Appeal, 74 Conn. 301, 302, 50 Atl. 734; Hatheway v. Smith, 79 Conn. 506, 65 Atl. 1058, 9 L. R. A. (N. S.) 310, 9 Ann. Cas. 99.'\n\n See also Plumber v. Coler, \n178 \nU.S. 115, 134\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 829; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 U.S. 41\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 747.\n The conclusion of the court is of such authoritative effect as not to need much comment. The attack upon it by plaintiffs in error is based upon a confusion of rights. As pointed out by the Supreme Court of Errors, executors and administrators do not own the property committed to them for administration. It goes to them subject to the liabilities and burdens upon it in the hands of its owner, and whatever interest distributees or creditors may have is subject to the same liabilities and burdens. Subject, we may say, as the court decided, to the tax which the state has imposed on its disposition or devolution, and the tax does not take on a different quality or incident because it is, or has the effect of a penalty. And the court, construing the statute, declared it was a provision for penalizing a delinquency-the delinquency \n\n[260 U.S. 647, 651]\n\u00a0\n of the decedent, and made to survive 'by statutory sanction.' 'In effect,' the court said, 'this statute is a penalty imposed upon the estate because of the delinquency of the decedent, and no less permissible than the penalty tax against the decedent kept alive by statutory sanction.'\n Plaintiffs in error do not contest the principle expressed but deny its application by asserting: (1) There was no debt owed by decedent, (2) no action under the statute arose against her; (3) no penalty had been incurred by her because as long as she lived the statute was inapplicable to her; (4) it is not a tax for its primary object is punishment, not revenue.\n The assertions are unjustified. There was an evasion of duty by decedent, and the obligation she incurred, and should have discharged, w  imposed upon her estate, and legally imposed, for out of her estate it can only be discharged. The payment of taxes is an obvious and insistent duty, and its sanction is usually punitive. The Connecticut statute is not, therefore, in its penal effects, unique, nor are they out of relation or proportion to a decedent's delinquency.\n The Court of Errors recognized that the tax of the statute 'may not represent what the decedent would have been required to pay, had' she 'paid the state or local tax.' And, as we have seen, the tax may be upon the appraised inventory value for the five years next preceding the death of the decedent, with a proportionate deduction if a tax has been paid on any of the property for a portion of the five years, or that the ownership of the property has not been in the decedent for a portion of the period. The provision, however, is but a way of fixing a penalty for the delinquency, which it is competent for the state to do. We said in Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Indiana, \n165 \nU.S. 304, 310\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 345 41 L. Ed. 725, that the amount of a penalty is a matter for the Legislature of a state to determine \n\n[260 U.S. 647, 652]\n\u00a0\n in its discretion, and in accordance with the principle we sustained a penalty of 50 per cent. of the taxes assessed against the telegraph company and unpaid by it.\n Section 1190 was passed in 1915 and went into effect August 1st of that year. Decedent died in May, 1919, plaintiffs in error contend, therefore, that in one of the years (1914) of the five of omission to pay taxes 'the only penalty provided by law therefor was the addition of 10 per cent. to the assessed valuation of the omitted property.' Therefore, it is the further contention, the attempt of the section is 'to reach into the past and provide 'greater punishment than the law did when the crime was committed,\" and hence incurs constitutional prohibition as an ex post facto law.\n The contention is untenable. The penalty of the statute was not in punishment of a crime, and it is only to such that the constitutional prohibition applies. It has no relation to retrospective legislation of any other description. Johannessen v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 227, 242\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 613.\n The final contention of plaintiffs in error is that the statute can only be sustained on the assumption that 'in the last analysis the property of deceased persons belongs to the state.'\n The contention is extreme. The power of taxation, with its accessorial sanctions, is a power of government, and all property is subject to it; and it is a proper exercise of it to satisfy out of his estate the delinquency of a property owner. It is so complete that it does not need the assumption of universal ownership by the state to justify it.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Public Acts of Conn. 1919, chapter 50, page 2713. \n\n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBARTELS v.

Plaintiff in error was convicted of teaching pupils in a parochial school below the eighth grade to read German, contrary to 'An act requiring the use of the English language as the medium of instruction in all secular subjects in all schools within the state of Iowa,' approved April 10, 1919 (Acts 1919, c. 198).1 He used English for teaching the common school branches, but taught young pupils to read German. The Supreme Court of the state held:\n'The manifest design of this language statute is to supplement the compulsory education law by requiring that the branches enumerated to be taught shall be taught in the English language, and in no other. The evident purpose is that no other language shall be taught in any school, public or private, during the tender years of youth, that is, below the eighth grade.' 191 Iowa, 1060, 181 N. W. 508.\n\n Nos. 181 and 182.

An injunction is sought against the Governor and Attorney General of the state and the attorney for Platte county to prevent enforcement of 'An act to declare the English language the official language of this state, and to require all official proceedings, records and publications to be in such language and all school branches to be taught in said language in public, private, denominational and parochial schools,' etc., approved April 14, \n\n[262 U.S. 404, 411]\n\u00a0\n 1921 (Laws 1921, c. 61).3 This statute is subject to the same objections as those offered to the act of 1919 and sustained in Meyer v. Nebraska, supra. The purpose of the later enactment as stated by counsel for the state, is 'to place beyond the possibility for legal evasion a prohibition against the teaching in schools of foreign languages to children who have not passed the eighth grade.' The Supreme Court considered the merits of the cause, upheld the statute, and refused an injunction. (Neb.) 187 N. W. 927 (April 19, 1922).\n McKelvie and Davis, formerly Governor and Attorney General, no longer occupy those offices. The cause is dismissed as to them. Otto F. Walter is now the coun y attorney and the judgment below as to him must be reversed.\n Reversed. \n\n[262 U.S. 404, 412]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES.\n We all agree, I take it, that it is desirable that all the citizens of the United States should speak a common tongue, and therefore that the end aimed at by the statute is a lawful and proper one. The only question is whether the means adopted deprive teachers of the liberty secured to them by the Fourteenth Amendment. It is with hesitation and unwillingness that I differ from my brethren with regard to a law like this but I cannot bring my mind to believe that in some circumstances, and circumstances existing it is said in Nebraska, the statute might not be regarded as a reasonable or even necessary method of reaching the desired result. The part of the act with which we are concerned deals with the teaching of young children. Youth is the time when familiarity with a language is established and if there are section in the State where a child would hear only Polish or French or German spoken at home I am not prepared to say that it is unreasonable to provide that in his early years he shall hear and speak only English at school. But if it is reasonable it is not an undue restriction of the liberty either of teacher or scholar. No one would doubt that a teacher might be forbidden to teach many things, and the only criterion of his liberty under the Constitution that I can think of is 'whether, considering the end in view, the statute passes the bounds of reason and assumes the character of a merely arbitrary fiat.' Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, \n226 \nU.S. 192, 204\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 44, 47 (57 L. Ed. 184); Hebe Co. v. Shaw, \n248 \nU.S. 297, 303\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 125; Jacob Ruppert v. Caffey, \n251 U.S. 264\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 141. I think I appreciate the objection to the law but it appears to me to present a question upon which men reasonably might differ and therefore I am unable to say that the Constitution of the United States prevents the experiment being tried. \n\n[262 U.S. 404, 413]\n\u00a0\n I agree with the Court as to the special proviso against the German language contained in the statute dealt with in Bohning v.

CITY OF NEW YORK(1923)\n\nArgued: Decided: May 7, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 196, 197]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Lindley M. Garrison and Charles A. Frueauff, both of New York City, for appellants.\n Mr. Vincent Victory, of New York City, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On the threshold of the hearing the appellees moved to dismiss this appeal, upon the ground that jurisdiction depends entirely upon diversity of citizenship and the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is therefore final.\n The appellants were appointed receivers of the Manhattan & Queens Traction Corporation in a suit in equity brought against it in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York by a judgment creditor, for the administration of its assets. The jurisdiction depended entirely upon diversity of citizenship of the parties. The receivers, after taking possession of the Corporation's railway in the City of New York, which had been partly completed, filed a petition in this equity cause, alleging that the City, through its Board of Estimate and Apportionment, was threatening to adopt a resolution declaring a forfeiture of the franchise contract of the Corporation and of the completed portion of the railway for failure to complete the railway within the \n\n[262 U.S. 196, 198]\n\u00a0\n prescribed time. This, it was averred, would deprive the Corporation of its property in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States and Article First of the Constitution of New York, and cause irreparable injury to the Corporation, its creditors, and the property in the custody of the receivers. Upon this petition the court granted the receivers ex parte a temporary injunction and an order to show cause why it should not be continued during the receivership; and thereafter, upon a summary hearing, the temporary injunction was made permanent and the City and the Board were enjoined until further order of the court from passing a resolution forfeiting or affecting the franchise contract of the Corporation or declaring its railway and property in the hands of the receivers to be the property of the City or otherwise interfering therewith in any manner. Upon appeal by the City and the Board, the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the order of the District Court granting this injunction. Gas & Elec. Securities Co. v. Traction Corporation, 266 Fed. 625, 641. And the receivers have appealed to this Court.\n Section 128 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1120) provides that, with certain exceptions not here involved, 'the judgments and decrees of the circuit courts of appeals shall be final in all cases in which the jurisdiction is dependent entirely upon the opposite parties to the suit or controversy being ... citizens of different States.' This refers to the jurisdiction of the Federal court of first instance; and if the jurisdiction of the District Court depended entirely upon diversity of citizenship the appeal must be dismissed. Shulthis v. McDougal, \n225 \nU.S. 561, 568\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 704\n\n\n It is well settled that jurisdiction of a petition in intervention asserting a claim upon the property or fund being administered by the court is determined by the jurisdiction originally invoked in the main cause, by \n\n[262 U.S. 196, 199]\n\u00a0\n virtue of which the intervening petition is entertained; and hence that if the jurisdiction in the main cause is such that a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals would be final in respect thereto it is likewise final in respect to the intervening petition. St. Louis Railroad v. Wabash Railroad, \n217 \nU.S. 247, 250\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 510; Rouse v. Letcher, \n156 \nU.S. 47, 49\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 266; Gregory v. Van Ee, \n160 \nU.S. 643, 645\n, 16 S. Sup.

Worthington, \n225 \nU.S. 101, 104\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 653; Shulthis v. McDougal, supra, 225 U. S. at page 568, 32 Sup. Ct. 704. And this is true even although the intervening petition discloses an independent ground of Federal jurisdiction; the jurisdiction by virtue of which it is entertained as an intervention being ascribed entirely to that which is invoked and exercised in the main cause. Rause v. Letcher, supra, 156 U. S. at pages 49 and 50, 15 Sup. Ct. 266; Gregory v. Van Ee, supra, 160 U. S. at page 646, 16 Sup. Ct. 431. Manifestly the reason of the foregoing rule in reference to an affirmative petition of intervention, as set forth in the cases cited, applies with equal or greater force to a petition filed in a cause to protect the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court itself and prevent interference with property in its custody; which necessarily depends upon that jurisdiction and partakes directly of its character. This is recognized in Railroad Commission v. Worthington, supra, 225 U. S. at page 104, 32 Sup. Ct. 653, in which the distinction is pointed out between petitions filed in the main cause, taking their jurisdiction from it alone, and plenary suits of an ancillary character in which Federal jurisdiction is invoked, not merely as ancillary to that in the main suit, but also upon independent grounds.\n In the present case the jurisdiction of the District Court to entertain the summary proceedings against the City and the Board was dependent entirely upon the jurisdiction in the main cause and cannot be ascribed to the Federal constitutional grounds upon which the claim for \n\n[262 U.S. 196, 200]\n\u00a0\n relief was partly predicated, which in no wise enlarged the summary jurisdiction of the court, and could only have been relied upon as independent grounds of Federal jurisdiction in a plenary suit.\n It results that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals as to the petition of the receivers has the same finality as would a decree in the main cause; jurisdiction of the one as of the other depending entirely upon the diversity of citizenship in the main cause.\n The appellees' motion is accordingly granted, and the appeal.\n Dismissed. \n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBIANCHI v.

That law gives a summary suit in which, speaking broadly, no defence is open except payment, Mortgage Law Regulations, Art. 175; and it is contended that this deprives the plaintiffs, appellants,) of their property without due process of law. The statutes give a separate action to annul the mortgage in which any defense to it may be set up, and also provided for a cautionary notice, Mortgage Law, Art. 42; Mortgage Law Regulations, Art. 91, which the Supreme Court of Porto Rico regards as a sufficient substitute for an injunction. American Trading Co. v. Monserrat, 18 Porto Rico, 268. See Romeu v. Todd, \n206 U.S. 358\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 724. The bill was dismissed by the District Court for want of jurisdiction.

Apart from other matters urged by the appellees the constitutional objection is simply another form of the objection to the separation between possessory and petitory suits familiar to countries that inherit Roman law and not wholly unfamiliar in our own. The United States, the States, and equally Porto Rico, may exclude all claims of ultimate right from possessory actions, consistently with due process of law. Grant Timber & Manufacturing Co. v.

Van Dusen, of Omaha, Neb., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 291, 295]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. M. Seabury, of Los Angeles, Cal., and Arthur F. Mullen, of Omaha, Neb., for defendants in error.\n\n\n[263 U.S. 291, 301]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought under the provisions of section 7 of the Act of Congress of July 2, 1890, commonly called the Anti-Trust Act, c. 647, 26 Stat. 210 (Comp. St.  8829). The complaint is long, but the allegations necessary to be considered here may be summarized as follows:\n Plaintiff in error, a resident of the state of Nebraska, hereafter called the 'exhibitor,' owned a moving picture theater at Minden, in that state, and operated as lessee theaters in other places, to all of which, including his own, he supplied moving picture films and advertising \n\n[263 U.S. 291, 302]\n\u00a0\n matter connected therewith. In addition, he was in the business of selecting and distributing to a circuit of moving picture theaters, films and advertising matter accompanying them, under agreements with the various operators, some 20 or more in number, in various parts of the state.\n The corporations named as defendants in error, hereafter called the 'distributors,' were located in the state of New York, and were there engaged in manufacturing motion picture films and distributing them throughout the United States. The method of distribution was to make public announcement from time to time that films, which had been manufactured and approved, would be released, and thereupon send them from New York, by express or parcel post, to agencies in numerous cities for delivery to exhibitors who hired and paid for their use.\n Some of these distributors entered into contracts with the exhibitor, by the terms of which they leased motion pictures to him with the right and license to display them publicly at the theater or theaters named. The individual defendants named were managers of branch offices or agencies for the various distributors at Omaha, Neb., through which films were distributed to exhibitors in the states of Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Minnesota. These contracts by their terms were deemed made in New York, were to be construed according to the laws of that state, and provided that deliveries should be made to the exhibitor through the Omaha branch offices. The exhibitor, upon his part, agreed to accept and publicly exhibit the motion pictures for the periods of time fixed for which right he was to pay specified sums. When the use of the pictures was completed according to the contract, they were to be reshipped on advices given by the distributors.\n The complaint further alleged that these distributors control the distribution of all films in the United States \n\n[263 U.S. 291, 303]\n\u00a0\n and that the films cannot be procured from others. The Omaha Film Board of Trade is a Nebraska corporation, organized for the purpose of promoting good will among those engaged in the motion picture business and for other purposes, its membership being limited to one representative from each company or person engaged in the film business. It is alleged that the exhibitor's business was successful and profitable and that, the cupidity of the distributors being thereby aroused, some of them requested a share of his patronage, and, upon his refusal, made threats to put him out of business by underbidding and supplying the various theaters constituting his circuit; that the Omaha Film Board of Trade was organized for the purpose of enabling these distributors to control prices and dicate terms to their patrons in Nebraska and other states. It is further alleged that the business of the exhibitor had grown to large proportions; that he was procuring films from some of the members of the Omaha Film Board of Trade, but had refused to buy from others, and that thereby a spirit of hostility was aroused against him on the part of the latter who thereupon brought great pressure to induce those with whom he was dealing to cease doing business with him; that all the defendants in error thereupon unlawfully combined and conspired in restraint of trade and commerce among the states, with the purpose and intent of preventing him from carrying on his said business and with the intent to ruin him; that they caused false charges to be made against him before the Film Board of Trade, and, without his knowledge or an opportunity to be heard, placed him upon its blacklist, of which notice was given to distributors who thereupon refused to transact further business with him; that those distributors who were not members of the Film Board of Trade cooperated with and approved the action of the board and conspired with the others to ruin the business, credit, and reputation of the exhibitor; \n\n[263 U.S. 291, 304]\n\u00a0\n that, in furtherance of the combination and conspiracy, the distributors have ever since refused to deal with him or furnish him with film service and have caused the unexpired contracts which he held with some of the distributors to be illegally and unlawfully canceled and that he has ever since been and still is deprived of such service. As a result of the foregoing, the exhibitor asked judgment for three times the amount of damages which he had suffered as alleged.\n Upon this complaint and an answer the case went to trial before a jury. After counsel for the exhibitor had made his opening statement to the jury the defendants in error moved the court for a directed verdict in their favor, upon the ground 'that the petition and opening fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action arising under the Sherman Act, or any act amendatory thereof.' The court sustained the motion and instructed the jury to return a verdict for the defendants, which was done. Thereupon judgment was entered upon the verdict dismissing the cause. In a memorandum opinion the trial judge states that he had reached the conclusion that the motion should be sustained upon the grounds: (1) That the petition does not show with sufficient clearness that the complaint is one over which the court has jurisdiction; (2) that it fails to show with sufficient clearness any combination or conspiracy sufficient to justify the court in proceeding further with the trial.\n The case was taken by writ of error to the Circuit Court of Appeals where the judgment was affirmed for want of jurisdiction in the District Court. 280 Fed. 301.\n First. Defendants in error have submitted a motion to dismiss the writ of error here. The statement of the ground is somewhat ambiguous, but it is, in substance, that the motion in the trial court attacked the complaint for a failure to state a cause of action under the Sherman Act ( Comp. St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830); that this constituted a challenge to the jurisdiction \n\n[263 U.S. 291, 305]\n\u00a0\n and, consequently, the writ of error should have been taken directly to this court. But the motion below in terms was put upon the ground that the complaint and the opening statement failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action-not that the court was without jurisdiction- and it is this motion that was sustained. The memorandum, it is true, indicates that the trial judge was of opinion that the motion for a directed verdict went to the jurisdiction; but it is apparent that, as to this, he assumed that an unsuccessful attempt to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action under a federal statute constitutes a jurisdictional defect.\n Section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215) provides that appeals and writs of error may be taken from the District Court direct to this court 'in any case in which the jurisdiction of the [District] Court is in issue.' As it has been many times decided, the jurisdiction meant by the statute is that of the court as a federal court only, and not its jurisdiction upon general grounds of law or procedure. See, for example, Louisville Trust Co. v. Knott, \n191 U.S. 225\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 119. The contention here seems to be broadly, that where the cause of action is based upon an act of Congress, unless the complaint states a case within the terms of the act the federal court is without jurisdiction.\n Jurisdiction is the power to decide a justiciable controversy, and includes questions of law as well as of fact. A complaint, setting forth a substantial claim under a federal statute presents a case within the jurisdiction of the court as a federal court, and this jurisdiction cannot be made to stand or fall upon the way the court may chance to decide an issue as to the legal sufficiency of the facts alleged any more than upon the way it may decide as to the legal sufficiency of the facts proven. Its decision either way upon either question is predicated upon the existence of jurisdiction, not upon the absence of it. Jurisdiction, \n\n[263 U.S. 291, 306]\n\u00a0\n as distinguished from merits, is wanting only where the claim set forth in the complaint is so unsubstantial as to be frivolous, or, in other words, is plainly without color of merit.

In that event the claim of federal right under the statute, is a mere pretense and, in effect, is no claim at all. Plainly there is no such want of substance asserted here. In the case last cited court said (228 U. S. at page 25, 33 Sup. Ct. at page 411 [57 L. Ed. 716]):\n'We are speaking of a case where jurisdiction is incident to a federal statutory cause of action. Jurisdiction is authority to decide the case either way. Unsuccessful as well as successful suits may be brought upon the act, and a decision that a patent is bad, whether on the facts or the law, is as binding as one that it is good. See Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 U.S. 230\n, 235. No doubt if it should appear that the plaintiff was not really relying upon the patent law for his alleged rights, or if the claim of right were frivolous, the case might be dismissed. In the former instance the suit would not really and substantially involve a controversy within the jurisdiction of the court (Excelsior Wooden Pipe Co. v. Pacific Bridge Co., \n185 \nU.S. 282, 287\n, 288 S.), and in the latter the jurisdiction would not be denied, except possibly in form (Deming v. Carlisle Packing Co., \n226 U.S. 102\n, 109). But if the plaintiff really makes a substantial claim under an act of Congress there is jurisdiction whether the claim ultimately be held good or bad.'\n\n In Lamar v. United States, \n240 U.S. 60\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 255, this court dealt with the question whether the failure of an indictment \n\n[263 U.S. 291, 307]\n\u00a0\n to charge a crime against the United States presented a question of jurisdiction within the meaning of section 238 of the Judicial Code. The court held in the negative, saying (\n240 U.S. 64\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 256 [60 L. Ed. 526]):\n'Jurisdiction is a matter of power and covers wrong as well as right decisions. Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230, 234\n, 235 S.; Burnet v. Desmornes, \n226 U.S. 145\n, 147. There may be instances in which it is hard to say whether a law goes to the power or only to the duty of the court; but the argument is pressed too far. A decision that a patent is bad, either on the facts or on the law, is as binding as one that it is good. The Fair v. Kohler Die Co., \n228 U.S. 22\n, 25. And nothing can be clearer than that the District Court, which has jurisdiction of all crimes cognizable under the authority of the United States (Judicial Code March 3, 1911, c. 231,  24, second), acts equally within its jurisdiction whether it decides a man to be guilty or innocent under the criminal law, and whether its decision is right or wrong. The objection that the indictment does not charge a crime against the United States goes only to the merits of the case.'\n\n Our attention is directed to certain decisions of this court which are said to support the contention of defendants in error. We think their effect is misapprehended. In The Steamship Jefferson, \n215 U.S. 130\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 54, 17 Ann. Cas. 907, the case had been dismissed below expressly for want of jurisdiction. It was asserted in support of a motion to dismiss the appeal that while in form of expression the suit was so dismissed, the action of the lower court was 'in substance alone based on the conclusion that the facts alleged were insufficient to authorize recovery, even allthough to authorize recovery, even although of the court.' It was held, however, that the conclusion of the District Court was one which went to the jurisdiction, not to the sufficiency of the allegations of the bill, and there is no suggestion in the opinion that the two propositions \n\n[263 U.S. 291, 308]\n\u00a0\n are equivalent. In The Ira M. Hedges, \n218 U.S. 264\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 17, 20 Ann. Cas. 1235, where the same condition was presented, this court, after pointing out the difficulty of sometimes distinguishing between matters going to the jurisdiction and those determining the merits and suggesting that it might be said that there the two considerations coalesced, rested its decision upon the form of the decree, saying (\n218 U.S. 270\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 18 [54 L. Ed. 1039, 20 Ann. Cas. 1235]):\n'At all events, the form of the decree must be taken to express the meaning of the judge. If the decree was founded, as it purports to be, on a denial of jurisdiction in the court, this court has jurisdiction of the appeal. For all admiralty jurisdiction belongs to courts of the United States as such, and therefore the denial of jurisdiction brings the appeal within the established rule. See The Steamship Jefferson, \n215 U.S. 130\n, 138.'\n\n In Blumenstock Brothers v. Curtis Publishing Co., \n252 \nU.S. 436, 441\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 385, 387 (64 L. Ed. 649), it is said:\n'In any case alleged to come within the federal jurisdiction, it is not enough to allege that questions of a federal character arise in the case, it must plainly appear that the averments attempting to bring the case within federal jurisdiction are real and substantial.'\n\n The only authority cited in support of this statement is Newburyport Water Co. v. Newburyport, supra, where, at page 576 of 193 U. S., at page 556 of 24 Sup. Ct. (48 L. Ed. 795), the rule is stated thus:\n'... It is settled that jurisdiction does not arise simply because an averment is made as to the existence of a constitutional question, if it plainly appears that such averment is not real and substantial, but is without color of merit.'\n\n While the Blumenstock Case seems to put the emphasis of the test in the opposite way, it cannot be supposed that it was meant to modify the doctrine of the Newburyport Case, since its citation as authority is made without qualification.\n It follows that the motion to dismiss the writ of error must be denied. \n\n[263 U.S. 291, 309]\n\u00a0\n Second. We come, then, to consider whether the averments of the complaint are sufficient to constitute a cause of action under the Anti- Trust Act, and this inquiry involves two questions: (1) Are the alleged transactions in which the exhibitor was engaged matters of interstate commerce? And (2) do the alleged acts of the defendants in error constitute a combination or conspiracy in restraint thereof?\n\n 1. \nThe film contracts were between residents of different states, and contemplated the leasing by one to the other of a commodity manufactured in one state and transported and to be transported to and used in another. The business of the distributors of which the arrangement with the exhibitor here was an instance, was clearly interstate. It consisted of manufacturing the commodity in one state, finding customers for it in other states, making contracts of lease with them, and transporting the commodity leased from the state of manufacture into the states of the lessees. If the commodity were consigned directly to the lessees, the interstate character of the commerce throughout would not be disputed. Does the circumstance that in the course of the process the commodity is consigned to a local agency of the distributors, to be by that agency held until delivery to the lessee in the same state, put an end to the interstate character of the transaction and transform it into one purely intrastate? We think not. The intermediate delivery to the agency did not end and was not intended to end the movement of the commodity. It was merely halted as a convenient step in the process of getting it to its final destination. The general rule is that where transportation has acquired an interstate character 'it continues at least until the load reaches the point where the parties originally intended that the movement should finally end.' Ill. Cent. R. Co. v. Louisiana R. R. Com., \n236 \nU.S. 157, 163\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 275, 276 (59 L. Ed. 517). And see, Western Union Tel. Co. v. Foster, \n247 U.S. 105\n, \n\n[263 U.S. 291, 310]\n\u00a0\n 113, 38 Sup. Ct. 438, 1 A. L. R. 1278; Western Oil Refining Co. v. Lipscomb, \n244 \nU.S. 346, 349\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 623\n\n\n In Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 398\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 276, it was held that where cattle were sent for sale from a place in one state, with the expectation that the transit would end after purchase in another state, the only interruption being that necessary to find a purchaser at the stockyards, and this was a typical, constantly recurring course, the whole transaction was one in interstate commerce and the purchase a part and incident of it. It further appeared in that case that Swift & Co. were also engaged in shipping fresh meats to their respective agents at the principal markets in other cities for sale by such agents in those markets to dealers and consumers, and these sales were held to be part of the interstate transaction upon the ground 'that the same things which are sent to agents are sold by them, and ... some at least of the sales are of the original packages. Moreover, the sales are by persons in one state to persons in another.' In the same case in the court below ([C. C.] 122 Fed. 529, 533), upon this branch of the case, it is said:\n'I think the same is true of meat sent to agents, and sold from their stores. The transaction in such case, in reality, is between the purchaser and the agents' principal. The agents represent the principal at the place where the exchange takes place; but the transaction, as a commercial entity, includes the principal, and includes him as dealing from his place of business.'\n\n The most recent expression of this court is in Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495, 516\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 397, 402 (66 L. Ed. 735, 23 A. L. R. 229), where, after describing the process by which live stock are transported to the stockyards and thence to the purchasers, it is said:\n'Such transactions cannot be separated from the movement to which they contribute and necessarily take on its character. The commission men are essential in making the sales without which the flow of the current would be \n\n[263 U.S. 291, 311]\n\u00a0\n obstructed, and this, whether they are made to packers or dealers. The dealers are essential to the sales to the stock farmers and feeders. The sales are not in this aspect merely local transactions. They create a local change of title, it is true, but they do not stop the flow; they merely change the private interests in the subject of the current, not interfering with, but, on the contrary, being indispensable to its continuity.'\n\n The transactions here are essentially the same as those involved in the foregoing cases, substituting the word 'film' for the word 'live stock,' or 'cattle,' or 'meat.' Whatever difference exists is of degree and not in character.\n The cases cited by defendants in error, upholding state taxation as not constituting an interference with interstate commerce, are of little value to the inquiry here. It does not follow that because a thing is subject to state taxation it is also immune from federal regulation under the Commerce Clause. Stafford v. Wallace, supra, \n258 U.S. 525\n-527, 42 Sup. Ct. 397, 23 A. L. R. 229; Addyston Pipe Line Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 211, 245\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 96.\n\n 2. \nThe distributors, according to the allegations of the complaint, controlled the distribution of all films in the United States and the exhibitor could not procure them from others. The direct result of the alleged conspiracy and combination not to sell to the exhibitor, therefore, was to put an end to his participation in that business. Interstate commerce includes the interstate purchase, sale, lease, and exchange of commodities and any combination or conspiracy which unreasonably restrains such purchase, sale, lease or exchange is within the terms of the Anti- Trust Act, denouncing as illegal every contract, combination or conspiracy 'in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states.' The allegation of the complaint is that the exhibitor had been procuring films from some of the distributors but had refused to buy from \n\n[263 U.S. 291, 312]\n\u00a0\n others, who thereupon induced the former to cease dealing with him, and that all then combined and conspired, in restraint of interstate trade and commerce, to prevent him from carrying on his said business; that they have ever since refused to furnish him with film service and have caused unexpired contracts which he held with some of them to be illegally canceled. It is difficult to imagine how interstate trade could be more effectively restrained than by suppressing it and that, in effect, so far as the exhibitor is concerned, is what the distributors in combination are charged with doing and intending to do. It is doubtless true that each of the distributors, acting separately could have refused to furnish films to the exhibitor without becoming amenable to the provisions of the act, but here it is alleged that they combined and conspired together to prevent him from leasing from any of them. The illegality consists, not in the separate action of each, but in the conspiracy and combination of all to prevent any of them from dealing with the exhibitor. See United States v. Schrader's Son, Inc., \n252 \nU.S. 85, 99\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 251; Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus (C. C.) 139 Fed. 155, 191. The contracts with these distributors contemplated and provided for transactions in interstate commerce. The business which was done under them-leasing, transportation, and delivery of films-was interstate commerce. The alleged purpose and direct effect of the combination and conspiracy was to put an end to these contracts and future business of the same character and 'restricts, in that regard, the liberty of a trader to engage in business' ( Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 \nU.S. 274, 293\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 301, 303 [52 L. Ed. 488, 13 Ann. Cas. 815]) and, as a necessary corollary, to restrain interstate trade and commerce, in violation of the Anti-Trust Act.\n The judgments of the courts below are reversed, and the case remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBLAMBERG BROS. v. U.S.(1923)\nNo. 165\nArgued: December 5, 1922Decided: January 2, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 452, 453]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. D. Roger Englar and Harold V. Amberg, both of New York City, for appellant.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 452, 456]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., for the United states.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from the District Court of Maryland on a question of jurisdiction duly certified by the District Judge.\n The appellant, a corporation of Maryland, February 26, 1921, filed a libel in personam against the United States under the suits in Admiralty Act, approved March 9, 1920 (41 Stat. 525). The libel alleged that on October 6, 1920, the libelant had shipped 1,500 bags of corn from Baltimore to Havana, Cuba, to its own order, upon the barge Catskill, that the corn had never been delivered in accordance with the terms of the bills of lading, and that due to the delay the corn had greatly deteriorated in value, whereby libelant had been damaged in the sum of $15, 000. The libel contained this averment:\n'Third, That said barge Catskill is now, or will be, during the pendency of process hereunder, within this district and within the jurisdiction of this honorable court.'\n\n The United States made answer April 22, 1921, through the district attorney. It admitted that it was the qualified owner of the Catskill, but denied that it was, or had ever been, in charge of the operation of the barge. It alleged that it entered into a contract for the sale of the barge July 26, 1920, for $60,000, $6,000 in cash and the balance in monthly installments of $3,000, that the vendee had defaulted in all the monthly payments, that the \n\n[260 U.S. 452, 457]\n\u00a0\n barge was delivered to the vendee June 30, 1920, and the United States had no control over her management or operation, and did not make the contract of affreightment described in the libel. In answer to the third paragraph of the libel the respondent alleged that it was advised that the barge was in Havana and had no knowledge when it would arrive in the jurisdiction of the court. On May 3, 1921, having obtained leave of court, the United States as respondent filed a suggestion of want of jurisdiction in which it averred positively that the barge was then in the port of Havana, Cuba, where it had been libeled in the sum of $3,725 for wage claims. It turther averred that libels in personam had been filed against it in three other District Courts of the United States for claims aggregating a sum in excess of the value of the barge, which was alleged not to exceed $50,000. The suggestion concludes that the respondent cannot be proceeded against by a libel in personam, or by a libel in the nature of an in rem proceeding as provided for by the Suits in Admiralty Act, for the reason that at the time of filing the libel, and at all times thereafter the barge Catskill was and had been at the port of Havana, Cuba, and without the jurisdiction of the court. The libelant answering the suggestion alleged that, although under the facts as alleged, no direct personal liability arose against the respondent under the general law, yet under the Suits in Admiralty Act, a right to bring a libel in personam was created as a substitute for an ordinary libel in rem, and that the presence of the barge in the jurisdiction of the court was not essential to such jurisdiction in personam.\n The first section of the Suits in Admiralty Act provides that no vessel or cargo owned by the United States--\n'shall hereafter, in view of the provision herein made for a libel in personam, be subject to arrest or seizure by judicial process in the United States or its possessions.' \n\n[260 U.S. 452, 458]\n\u00a0\n The second section provides that in cases where, if such vessel were privately owned, a proceeding in admiralty could be maintained, a libel in personam may be brought against the United States, provided the vessel is employed as a merchant vessel or a tugboat. The suits are to be brought in the United States District Court where the libelants live or have their principal place of business in the United States, or in which the vessel or cargo charged with liability may be found. Provision is made for manner of service and upon application of either party for the transfer of such libels to any other district in the discretion of the court.\n\n By the seventh section of the act, if any vessel or cargo of the United States is seized by process of a court of any country other than the United States, the Secretary of State of the United States in his discretion, upon request of the Attorney General, may direct the United States consul residing near the part of seizure to claim immunity from such suit and seizure or to execute a bond on behalf of the United States as the court may require for the release of the vessel or cargo.\n The District Court on the facts stated held that it was without jurisdiction under this statute to entertain a libel in personam against the United States. We agree with that holding. The first section of the act is limited in its inhibition of seizures of vessels and cargoes of the United States to ports of the United States and its possessions. The second section is in pari materia, and the same limitation must be implied in its construction. This act was passed to avoid the embarrassment to which the Government found itself subjected by the Act of September 7, 1916 (39 Stat. 728), by the ninth section of which (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  8146e) vessels in which the United States had an interest and which were employed as merchant vessels were made liable as such to arrest or seizure for enforcement of maritime liens. The Lake Monroe, 250 U. S. \n\n[260 U.S. 452, 459]\n\u00a0\n 246, 39 Sup. Ct. 460. It was intended to substitute this proceeding in personam, as the first section of the act expressly indicates, in lieu of the previous unlimited right of claimants to libel such vessels in rem in the ports of the United States and its possessions. Congress had no power, however, to enact immunity from seizure in respect of such vessels when in foreign ports, and therefore the embarrassment of seizures was to be mitigated in another way; i. e., by claiming immunity on international grounds and, if that failed, by stipulation or bound in the name of the United States. The provisions of the seventh section confirm the construction by which provisions of the second section are limited in their application to vessels within the jurisdiction of the United States.\n A number of important questions as to the construction of this statute have arisen in other cases, and the argument before us has taken a wide range. Those questions do not require decision here, and we do not decide them. All we hold here is that the District Court was right in construing the second section of the Suits in Admiralty Act not to authorize a suit in personam against the United States as a substitute for a libel in rem when the United States vessel is not in a port of the United States or of one of her possessions.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","24":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBLUEFIELD WATER WORKS CO. v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION(1923)\nNo. 256\nArgued: January 22, 1923Decided: June 11, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 679, 680]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Alfred G. Fox and Jos. M. Sanders, both of Bluefield, W. Va., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Russell S. Ritz, of Bluefield, W. Va., for defendants in error.\n\n\n[262 U.S. 679, 683]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error is a corporation furnishing water to the city of Bluefield, W. Va., and its inhabitants. September 27, 1920, the Public Service Commission of the state, being authorized by statute to fix just and reasonable rates, made its order prescribing rates. In accordance with the laws of the state (section 16, c. 15-O, Code of West Virginia [sec. 651]), the company instituted proceedings in the Supreme Court of Appeals to suspend and set aside the order. The petition alleges that the order is repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment, and deprives the company of its property without just compensation and without due process of law, and denies it equal protection of the laws. A final judgment was entered, denying the company relief and dismissing its petition. The case is here on writ of error.\n\n 1. \nThe city moves to dismiss the writ of error for the reason, as it asserts, that there was not drawn in question the validity of a statute or an authority exercised under the state, on the ground of repugnancy to the federal Constitution.\n The validity of the order prescribing the rates was directly challenged on constitutional grounds, and it was held valid by the highest court of the state. The prescribing of rates is a legislative act. The commission is an instrumentality of the state, exercising delegated powers. Its order is of the same force as would be a like enactment by the Legislature. If, as alleged, the prescribed rates are confiscatory, the order is void. Plaintiff in error is entitled to bring the case here on writ of error and to have that question decided by this court. The motion to dismiss will be denied. See Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. \n\n[262 U.S. 679, 684]\n\u00a0\n Russell, \n261 U.S. 290\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 353, 67 L. Ed. --, decided March 5, 1923, and cases cited; also Ohio Valley Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, \n253 U.S. 287\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 527.\n\n 2. \nThe commission fixed $460,000 as the amount on which the comp ny is entitled to a return. It found that under existing rates, assuming some increase of business, gross earnings for 1921 would be $80,000 and operating expenses $53,000 leaving $27,000, the equivalent of 5.87 per cent., or 3.87 per cent. after deducting 2 per cent. allowed for depreciation. It held existing rates insufficient to the extent of 10,000. Its order allowed the company to add 16 per cent. to all bills, excepting those for public and private fire protection. The total of the bills so to be increased amounted to $64,000; that is, 80 per cent. of the revenue was authorized to be increased 16 per cent., equal to an increase of 12.8 per cent. on the total, amounting to $10,240.\n As to value: The company claims that the value of the property is greatly in excess of $460,000. Reference to the evidence is necessary. There was submitted to the commission evidence of value which it summarized substantially as follows:\n a. Estimate by company's engineer on basis of reproduction new, less depreciation, at prewar prices $ 624,548 00 b. Estimate by company's engineer on basis of reproduction new, less depreciation, at 1920 prices 1,194,663 00 c. Testimony of company's engineer fixing present fair value for rate making purposes 900,000 00 d. Estimate by commissioner's engineer on basis of reproduction new, less depreciation at 1915 prices, plus additions since December 31, 1915, at actual cost, excluding Bluefield Valley waterworks, water rights, and going value 397,964 38 \n\n[262 U.S. 679, 685]\n\u00a0\n e. Report of commission's statistician showing investment cost less depreciation 365,445 13 f. Commission's valuation, as fixed in case No. 368 ($360,000), plus gross additions to capital since made ($92,520.53) 452,520 53\n It was shown that the prices prevailing in 1920 were nearly double those in 1915 and pre-war time. The company did not claim value as high as its estimate of cost of construction in 1920. Its valuation engineer testified that in his opinion the value of the property was $900,000-a figure between the cost of construction in 1920, less depreciation, and the cost of construction in 1915 and before the war, less depreciation.\n The commission's application of the evidence may be stated briefly as follows:\n As to 'a,' supra: The commission deducted $204,000 from the estimate ( details printed in the margin),1 leaving approximately $421,000, which it contrasted with the estimate of its own engineer, $397,964.38 (see 'd,' supra). It found that there should be included $25,000 for the Bluefield Valley waterworks plant in Virginia, 10 per cent. for going value, and $10, 000 for working capital. If these be added to $421,000, there results $500, 600. This may be compared with the commission's final figure, $460,000. \n\n[262 U.S. 679, 686]\n\u00a0\n As to 'b' and 'c,' supra: These were given no weight by the commission in arriving at its final figure, $460,000. It said:\n'Applicant's plant was originally constructed more than twenty years ago, and has been added to from time to time as the progress and development of the community required. For this reason, it would be unfair to its consumers to use as a basis for present fair value the abnormal prices prevailing during the recent war period; but, when, as in this case, a part of the plant has been constructed or added to during that period, in fairness to the applicant, consideration must be given to the cost of such expenditures made to meet the demands of the public.'\n\n As to 'd,' supra: The commission, taking $400,000 (round figures), added $25,000 for Bluefield Valley waterworks plant in Virginia, 10 per cent. for going val e, and $10,000 for working capital, making $477,500. This may be compared with its final figure, $460,000.\n As to 'e,' supra: The commission, on the report of its statistician, found gross investment to be $500,402.53. Its engineer, applying the straight line method, found 19 per cent. depreciation. It applied 81 per cent. to gross investment and added 10 per cent. for going value and $10, 000 for working capital, producing $455,500.2 This may be compared with its final figure, $460,000.\n As to 'f,' supra: It is necessary briefly to explain how this figure, $ 452,520.53, was arrived at. Case No. 368 was a proceeding initiated by the application of the company for higher rates, April 24, 1915. The commission made a valuation as of January 1, 1915. There were presented two estimates of reproduction cost less depreciation, one by a valuation engineer engaged by the company, \n\n[262 U.S. 679, 687]\n\u00a0\n and the other by a valuation engineer engaged by the city, both 'using the same method.' An inventory made by the company's engineer was accepted as correct by the city and by the commission. The method 'was that generally employed by courts and commissions in arriving at the value of public utility properties under this method.' and in both estimates 'five year average unit prices' were applied. The estimate of the company's engineer was $540,000 and of the city's engineer, $392,000. The principal differences as given by the commission are shown in the margin. \n3\n The commission disregarded both estimates and arrived at $360,000. It held that the best basis of valuation was the net investment, i. e., the total cost of the property less depreciation. It said:\n'The books of the company show a total gross investment, since its organization, of $407,882, and that there has been charged off for depreciation from year to year the total sum of $83,445, leaving a net investment of $324,427. ... From an examination of the books ... it appears that the records of the company have been remarkably well kept and preserved. It therefore seems that, when a plant is developed under these conditions, the net investment, which, of course, means the total gross investment less depreciation, is the very best basis of valuation for rate making purposes and that the other methods above referred to should \n\n[262 U.S. 679, 688]\n\u00a0\n be used only when it is impossible to arrive at the true investment. Therefore, after making due allowance for capital necessary for the conduct of the business and considering the plant as a going concern, it is the opinion of the commission that the fair value for the purpose of determining reasonable and just rates in this case of the property of the applicant company, used by it in the public service of supplying water to the city of Bluefield and its citizens, is the sum of $360,000, which sum is hereby fixed and determined by the commission to be the fair present value for the said purpose of determining the reasonable and just rates in this case.'\n\n In its report in No. 368, the commission did not indicate the amounts respectively allowed for going value or working capital. If 10 per cent. be added for the former, and $10,000 for the latter (as fixed by the commission in the present case), there is produced $366,870, to e compared with $360,000, found by the commission in its valuation as of January 1, 1915. To this it added $92,520.53, expended since, producing $ 452,520.53. This may be compared with its final figure, $460,000.\n The state Supreme Court of Appeals holds that the valuing of the property of a public utility corporation and prescribing rates are purely legislative acts, not subject to judicial review, except in so far as may be necessary to determine whether such rates are void on constitutional or other grounds, and that findings of fact by the commission based on evidence to support them will not be reviewed by the court. City of Bluefield v. Waterworks, 81 W. Va. 201, 204, 94 S. E. 121; Coal & Coke Co. v. Public Service Commission, 84 W. Va. 662, 678, 100 S. E. 557, 7 A. L. R. 108; Charleston v. Public Service Commission, 86 W. Va. 536, 103 S. E. 673.\n In this case (89 W. Va. 736, 738, 110 S. E. 205, 206) it said:\n'From the written opinion of the commission we find that it ascertained the value of the petitioner's property for rate making [ then quoting the commission] 'after \n\n[262 U.S. 679, 689]\n\u00a0\n maturely and carefully considering the various methods presented for the ascertainment of fair value and giving such weight as seems proper to every element involved and all the facts and circumstances disclosed by the record.\"\n\n The record clearly shows that the commission, in arriving at its final figure, did not accord proper, if any, weight to the greatly enhanced costs of construction in 1920 over those prevailing about 1915 and before the war, as established by uncontradicted evidence; and the company's detailed estimated cost of reproduction new, less depreciation, at 1920 prices, appears to have been wholly disregarded. This was erroneous. Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission of Missouri, \n262 U.S. 276\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 544, 67 L. Ed . --, decided May 21, 1923. Plaintiff in error is entitled under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the independent judgment of the court as to both law and facts. Ohio Valley Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, \n253 \nU.S. 287, 289\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 527, and cases cited.\n We quote further from the court's opinion (89 W. Va. 739, 740, 110 S. E. 206):\n'In our opinion the commission was justified by the law and by the facts in finding as a basis for rate making the sum of $460,000.00 . ... In our case of Coal & Coke Ry. Co. v. Conley, 67 W. Va. 129, it is said: 'It seems to be generally held that, in the absence of peculiar and extraordinary conditions, such as a more costly plant than the public service of the community requires, or the erection of a plant at an actual, though extravagant, cost, or the purchase of one at an exorbitant or inflated price, the actual amount of money invested is to be taken as the basis, and upon this a return must be allowed equivalent to that which is ordinarily received in the locality in which the business is done, upon capital invested in similar enterprises. In addition to this, consideration must be given to the nature of the investment, a higher rate \n\n[262 U.S. 679, 690]\n\u00a0\n being regarded as justified by the risk incident to a hazardous investment.'\n\n'That the original cost considered in connection with the history and growth of the utility and the value of the services rendered constitute the principal elements to be considered in connection with rate making, seems to be supported by nearly all the authorities.'\n\n The question in the case is whether the rates prescribed in the commission's order are confiscatory and therefore beyond legislative power. Rates which are not sufficient to yield a reasonable return on the value of the property used at the time it is being used to render the service are unjust, unreasonable and confiscatory, and their enforcement deprives the public utility company of its property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is so well settled by numerous decisions of this court that citation of the cases is scarcely necessary:\n'What the company is entitled to ask is a fair return upon the value of that which it employs for the public convenience.' Smyth v. Ames (1898) \n169 \nU.S. 467, 547\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 418, 434 (42 L. Ed. 819).\n\n'There must be a fair return upon the reasonable value of the property at the time it is being used for the public. ... And we concur with the court below in holding that the value of the property is to be determined as of the time when the inquiry is made regarding the rates. If the property, which legally enters into the consideration of the question of rates, has increased in value since it was acquired, the company is entitled to the benefit of such increase.' Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co. (1909) \n212 \nU.S. 19, 41\n, 52 S., 29 Sup. Ct. 192, 200 (53 L. Ed. 382, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034, 48 L. R. A. [N. S.] 1134).\n\n'The ascertainment of that value is not controlled by artificial rules. It is not a matter of formulas, but there must be a reasonable judgment having its basis in a proper consideration of all relevant facts.' Minnesota Rate Cases (1913) \n230 \nU.S. 352, 434\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 729, 754 (57 L. Ed. 1511, 48 L. R. A. [N. S.] 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18). \n\n[262 U.S. 679, 691]\n\u00a0\n 'And in order to ascertain that value, the original cost of construction, the amount expended in permanent improvements, the amount and market value of its bonds and stock, the present as compared with the original cost of construction, the probable earning capacity of the property under particular rates prescribed by statute, and the sum required to meet operating expenses, are all matters for consideration, and are to be given such weight as may be just and right in each case. We do not say that there may not be other matters to be regarded in estimating the value of the property.' Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S., 546, 547, 18 Sup. Ct. 434.\n\n'... The making of a just return for the use of the property involves the recognition of its fair value if it be more than its cost. The property is held in private ownership and it is that property, and not the original cost of it, of which the owner may not be deprived without due process of law.'\n\n Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 U.S. 454\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 762, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18.\n In Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., v. Public Service Commission of Missouri, supra, applying the principles of the cases above cited and others, this court said:\n'Obviously, the commission undertook to value the property without according any weight to the greatly enhanced costs of material, labor, supplies, etc., over those prevailing in 1913, 1914, and 1916. As matter of common knowledge, these increases were large. Competent witnesses estimated them as 45 to 50 per centum. ... It is impossible to ascertain what will amount to a fair return upon properties devoted to public service, without giving consideration to the cost of labor, supplies, etc., at the time the investigation is made. An honest and intelligent forecast of probable future values, made upon a view of all the relevant circumstances, is essential. If the highly important element of present costs is wholly disregarded, such a forecast becomes impossible. Estimates for to-morrow cannot ignore prices of to-day.' \n\n[262 U.S. 679, 692]\n\u00a0\n It is clear that the court also failed to give proper consideration to the higher cost of construction in 1920 over that in 1915 and before the war, and failed to give weight to cost of reproduction less depreciation on the basis of 1920 prices, or to the testimony of the company's valuation engineer, based on present and past costs of construction, that the property in his opinion, was worth $900,000. The final figure, $460,000, was arrived at substantially on the basis of actual cost, less depreciation, plus 10 per cent. for going value and $10, 000 for working capital. This resulted in a valuation considerably and materially less than would have been reached by a fair and just consideration of all the facts. The valuation cannot be sust ined. Other objections to the valuation need not be considered.\n\n\n 3. \nRate of return: The state commission found that the company's net annual income should be approximately $37,000, in order to enable it to earn 8 per cent. for return and depreciation upon the value of its property as fixed by it. Deducting 2 per cent. for depreciation, there remains 6 per cent. on $460,000, amounting to $27,600 for return. This was approved by the state court.\n The company contends that the rate of return is too low and confiscatory. What annual rate will constitute just compensation depeds upon many circumstances, and must be determined by the exercise of a fair and enlightened judgment, having regard to all relevant facts. A public utility is entitled to such rates as will permit it to earn a return on the value of the property which it employs for the convenience of the public equal to that generally being made at the same time and in the same general part of the country on investments in other business undertakings which are attended by corresponding, risks and uncertainties; but it has no constitutional right to profits such as are realized or anticipated in \n\n[262 U.S. 679, 693]\n\u00a0\n highly profitable enterprises or speculative ventures. The return should be reasonably sufficient to assure confidence in the financial soundness of the utility and should be adequate, under efficient and economical management, to maintain and support its credit and enable it to raise the money necessary for the proper discharge of its public duties. A rate of return may be reasonable at one time and become too high or too low by changes affecting opportunities for investment, the money market and business conditions generally.\n In 1909, this court, in Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n212 U.S. 19\n, 48-50, 29 Sup. Ct. 192, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1134, held that the question whether a rate yields such a return as not to be confiscatory depends upon circumstances, locality and risk, and that no proper rate can be established for all cases; and that, under the circumstances of that case, 6 per cent. was a fair return on the value of the property employed in supplying gas to the city of New York, and that a rate yielding that return was not confiscatory. In that case the investment was held to be safe, returns certain and risk reduced almost to a minimum-as nearly a safe and secure investment as could be imagined in regard to any private manufacturing enterprise.\n In 1912, in Cedar Rapids Gas Co. v. Cedar Rapids, \n223 \nU.S. 655, 670\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 389, this court declined to reverse the state court where the value of the plant considerably exceeded its cost, and the estimated return was over 6 per cent.\n In 1915, in Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, \n238 \nU.S. 153, 172\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 811, this court declined to reverse the United States District Court in refusing an injunction upon the conclusion reached that a return of 6 per cent. per annum upon the value would not be confiscatory.\n In 1919, this court in Lincoln Gas Co. v. Lincoln, \n250 \nU.S. 256, 268\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 454, 458 (63 L. Ed. 968), declined on the facts of that case to approve a finding that no rate yielding as much as 6 per cent. \n\n[262 U.S. 679, 694]\n\u00a0\n on the invested capital could be regarded as confiscatory. Speaking for the court, Mr. Justice Pitney said:\n'It is a matter of common knowledge that, owing principally to the World War, the costs of labor and supplies of every kind have greatly advanced since the ordinance was adopted, and largely since this cause was last heard in the court below. And it is equally well known that annual returns upon capital and enterprise the world over have materially increased, so that what would have been a proper rate of return for capital invested in gas plants and similar public utilities a few years ago furnishes no safe criterion for the present or for the future.'\n\n In 1921, in Brush Electric Co. v. Galveston, the United States District Court held 8 per cent. a fair rate of return. \n4\n\u00a0\n In January, 1923, in City of Minneapolis v. Rand, the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit (285 Fed. 818, 830) sustained, as against the attack of the city on the ground that it was excessive, 7 1\/2 per cent ., found by a special master and approved by the District Court as a fair and reasonable return on the capital investment-the value of the property.\n Investors take into account the result of past operations, especially in recent years, when determining the terms upon which they will invest in such an undertaking. Low, uncertain, or irregular income makes for low prices for the securities of the utility and higher rates of interest to be demanded by investors. The fact that the company may not insist as a matter of constitutional right that past losses be made up by rates to be applied in the present and future tends to weaken credit, and the fact that the utility is protected against being compelled to serve for confiscatory rates tends to support it. In \n\n[262 U.S. 679, 695]\n\u00a0\n this case the record shows that the rate of return has been low through a long period up to the time of the inquiry by the commission here involved. For example, the average rate of return on the total cost of the property from 1895 to 1915, inclusive, was less than 5 per cent.; from 1911 to 1915, inclusive, about 4.4 per cent., without allowance for depreciation. In 1919 the net operating income was approximately $24,700, leaving $15,500, approximately, or 3.4 per cent. on $460,000 fixed by the commission, after deducting 2 per cent. for depreciation. In 1920, the net operating income was approximately $25,465, leaving $16,265 for return, after allowing for depreciation. Under the facts and circumstances indicated by the record, we think that a rate of return of 6 per cent. upon the value of the property is substantially too low to constitute just compensation for the use of the property employed to render the service.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia is reversed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in the judgment of reversal, for the reasons stated by him in Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission of Missouri, supra. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \n Difference in depreciation allowed $ 49,000 Preliminary organization and development cost 14,500 Bluefield Valley waterworks plant 25,000 Water rights 50,000 Excess overhead costs 39,000 Paving over mains 28,500 ___ $204,000\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] As to 'e': $365,445.13 represents investment cost less depreciation.

The appeal is under section 238 of the Judicial Code (as amended Act January 28, 1915, c. 22,  2, 38 Stat. 803, 804 [Comp. St.  1215]), the case being one in which the constitutionality of the Grain Futures Act (enacted by Congress September 21, 1922 (42 Stat. 998, c. 369), is drawn in question.\n The bill was brought by the Board of Trade of the city of Chicago, and a number of its members representing each class of traders on the exchange of the Board, to enjoin the United States district attorney at Chicago, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the United States postmaster at Chicago from taking steps to enforce the provisions of the act against them, on the ground that it violates their rights under the federal Constitution.\n The purpose of the act is expressed in its title to be for the prevention of obstructions and burdens upon interstate commerce in grain by regulating transactions on grain future exchanges and for other purposes. Its second section, par. (a), is one of definitions. Its definition of interstate commerce, in the sense of the act, is as follows:\n'The words 'interstate commerce' shall be construed to mean commerce between any state, ter- \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n ritory, or possession, or the District of Columbia, and any place outside thereof; or between points within the same state, territory, or possession, or the District of Columbia, but through any place outside thereof, or within any territory or possession, or the District of Columbia.'\n\n Paragraph (b) contains the following addition to the foregoing definition:\n'(b) For the purposes of this act (but not in any wise limiting the foregoing definition of interstate commerce) a transaction in respect to any article shall be considered to be in interstate commerce if such article is part of that current of commerce usual in the grain trade whereby grain and grain products and by-products thereof are sent from one state with the expectation that they will end their transit, after purchase, in another, including, in addition to cases within the above general description, all cases where purchase or sale is either for shipment to another state, or for manufacture within the state and the shipment outside the state of the products resulting from  ch manufacture. Articles normally in such current of commerce shall not be considered out of such commerce through resort being had to any means or device intended to remove transactions in respect thereto from the provisions of this act. For the purpose of this paragraph the word 'state' includes territory, the District of Columbia, possession of the United States, and foreign nation.'\n\n Section 3 is in the nature of a recital and finding as follows:\n'Sec. 3. Transactions in grain involving the sale thereof for future delivery as commonly conducted on Boards of Trade and known as 'futures' are affected with a national public interest; that such transactions are carried on in large volume by the public generally and by persons engaged in the business of buying and selling grain and the products and by- products thereof in inter- \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n state commerce; that the prices involved in such transactions are generally quoted and disseminated throughout the United States and in foreign countries as a basis for determining the prices to the producer and the consumer of grain and the products and by-products thereof and to facilitate the movements thereof in interstate commerce; that such transactions are utilized by shippers, dealers, millers, and others engaged in handling grain and the products and by-products thereof in interstate commerce as a means of hedging themselves against possible loss through fluctuations in price; that the transactions and prices of grain on such boards of trade are susceptible to speculation, manipulation, and control, and sudden or unreasonable fluctuations in the prices thereof frequently occur as a result of such speculation, manipulation, or control, which are detrimental to the producer or the consumer and the persons handling grain and products and by-products thereof in interstate commerce, and that such fluctuations in prices are an obstruction to and a burden upon interstate commerce in grain and the products and by-products thereof and render regulation imperative for the protection of such commerce and the national public interest therein.'\n\n The act in section 4 forbids all persons to use mails or interstate telephone, telegraphic, wireless, or other communication, in offering or accepting sales of grain for future delivery or to disseminate prices or quotations thereof, excepting the man who holds the grain he is offering for sale, and the owner or renter of land on which the grain offered for sale is to be grown, and excepting also members of Boards of Trade located at a terminal market on which cash sales occur in sufficient volume and under such conditions as to reflect the general value of grain and its different grades, and which have been designated by the Secretary of Agriculture as 'contract markets.'\n The act puts these boards of trade under supervision of the Secretary of Agriculture and imposes conditions \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n precedent and subsequent on his power to designate or continue them as 'contract markets.'\n The conditions are:\n\n\n (a)\n The keeping of a record with prescribed details of every transaction of cash and future sales of grain of the Board or its member in permanent form for three years, open to inspection of representatives of the Departments of Agriculture and of Justice.\n\n\n (b)\n The prevention of the dissemination by the Board or any member of misleading prices.\n\n\n (c)\n The prevention of manipulation of prices or the cornering of grain by the dealers or operators on the Board.\n\n\n (d)\n The adoption of a rule permitting the admission as members of authorized representatives of lawfully formed co-operative associations of producers having adequate responsibility engaged in the cash grain business, complying with and agreeing to comply with, the rules of the Board applicable to other members, provided that no rule shall prevent the return to its members on a pro rata patronage basis the money collected by such association in the business, less expenses.\n The Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Attorney General are made a commission to hear and determine after due notice, whether any board of trade has failed or is failing by rule to do the things required above, and, if found in default, to suspend its functions as a contract market for a period not to exceed six months, or to revoke its designation as such, with an appeal on the record to the Circuit Court of Appeals within the circuit where the board is situate. Such commission, too, is to hear appeals from the Secretary's action in refusing to designate any Board of Trade as a contract market.\n There is a further provision for excluding from all contract markets and trading privileges any person violating \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n the provisions of the act or the regulations in pursuance thereof.\n Section 9 declares any one trading in futures in violation of section 4, or sending intentionally or carelessly false or misleading quotations or information as to the prices of grain, guilty of a misdemeanor.\n The bill of the plaintiffs describes the organization of the Chicago, Board of Trade as a corporation under a special act of the Legislature of Illinois, passed in 1859 (Priv. Laws 1859, p. 13), with a membership of 1, 600 and a board of 18 directors, of whom one is president. It avers that the Board does no business in selling or buying grain, but only furnishes an exchange and offices where such business can be done by its members; that it does not deliver any market quotation through interstate means, but it does cause to be collected the first price and each change of price on its exchange in cash and future sales during the regular hours in the exchange hall, and delivers them to certain telegraph companies, who pay the Board for this information.\n The bill further avers that it is sustained only by the initiation fees and dues of its members, the former being $25,000 for each member, and the latter being in the form of annual assessments; that it has from these sources accumulated funds with which to provide a large building and offices for the exchange, from some of which it receives rental and so has property worth $2,000,000 or more; that its existence depends on keeping its memberships valuable; that it does this by requiring character and financial responsibility as qualifications for its membership and by a requirement that a member shall charge for every sale a fixed minimum commission to a nonmember principal, and a less minimum to a member who shall be his principal; that corporations are not permitted to be members, but that, when two of the stockholders and officers are members, the corporation \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n is permitted as a member to make contracts on the exchange. The bill further avers that, if the Board were required to admit representatives of co-operative associations of producers, with the privilege of dividing with their members the proceeds of commissions, less expenses, it would greatly impair the value of its memberships to other members.\n The bill further avers that the members of its exchange engage only in three kinds of trading:\n\n\n (1)\n Many act as commission merchants, and receive from producers and country grain dealers grain in cars and boats consigned to them, which as agents they sell for immediate delivery and account to their principals for the proceeds of such sales, less their commissions and other expenses, and many members, as principals or agents, purchase and sell grain in Chicago which is in cars or elevators for immediate delivery, and all of these transactions are known as 'cash sales.'\n\n\n (2)\n Many members send out in the afternoons, whenever market conditions are favorable, telegrams or letters to country grain dealers offering to buy grain, or to millers and other nonresidents of Chicago, probable buyers, offering to sell grain at released prices and to be shipped within a certain time, on condition that these offers be accepted before regular market hours the next morning. These are known as 'cash sales for deferred shipment,' or as 'sales to arrive.'\n\n\n (3)\n Many of the members engage either as principals or agents in making on the exchange contracts with other members for the purchase and sale of grain for future delivery by which the seller agrees to deliver in Chicago the grain covered by the contract upon any day of the named month that he shall select. More than 75 per cent. of the volume of all trading in the exchange is for future delivery, and under the rules it must be done in the exchange hall and between regular fixed hours; that both buyers \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n and sellers in all such contracts are personally present when the contracts are made.\n The bill further avers that all contracts for future delivery are under the rules of the Board fulfilled only by delivery of warehouse receipts for the grain issued by twelve warehouses in Chicago, selected by the Board and having a capacity of 13,000,000 bushels and licensed by the state of Illinois to do a public warehouse business; that the grain is mixed with other grain, so that the receipt holder never gets the grain deposited when the receipt was issued; that, while a rule of the exchange makes grain in railroad cars deliverable in future cars the last three days of the month, the transaction is not fully completed till the grain in those cars is deposited in a regular warehouse and receipt issued; that in the trading for future delivery more than three-quarters of the many millions of bushels contracted to be delivered are settled for without delivery by offsetting purchases; that a large part of the future trading is done by grain merchants, millers, and others only for the purpose of insuring themselves against price fluctuations in respect of like grain owned by them and held for sale, shipment, or manufacture, and is settled by offsetting.\n The bill further avers that another large part of future trading is done by speculators, so called, who make a study of market conditions affecting prices, and try to profit by their judgment as to future prices; that few of such speculators have capital enough to make large single purchases in any way affecting the market; that six-sevenths of all the trading in futures in the country take place in Chicago; that no corners have been run on the exchange for 15 years, due to the enforcement of rules against them by the Board and 'perhaps to the Sherman Anti-Trust Act'; that manipulation has never been successfully resorted to, to depress prices; that the selling of futures has no such effect; that the law of sup- \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n ply and demand regulates prices and prevents violent fluctuations; and that before hedging was made possible by this future trading the cost of the middleman between producer and consumer was much greater.\n The defendants filed an answer admitting much of the bill, but specifically denying the averments included in the last foregoing paragraph.\n The plaintiffs submitted a large number of affidavits in support of a motion for a temporary injunction. These contained opinions of many professors of political economy in the colleges of the country to the effect that trading in futures in the long run did not depress prices, but stabilized them.\n The court denied the motion for a temporary injunction and of its own motion dismissed the bill for want of equity.\n The conclusions of Congress expressed in the recital of section 3 as to the detriment to interstate commerce from constantly recurring manipulation of sales for future delivery were reached after many years of investigation and examination of witnesses, including the advocates of regulation and those opposed, and men intimately advised in respect to the grain markets of the country.\n The Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry reported to the Senate as follows:\n'Every member of a grain exchange who testified before this committee acknowledged that there is at times excessive speculation and undesirable speculation in the futures market. Furthermore, it was brought out that a few big traders at times influence prices-manipulate the market-by the great volume of their operations. Also it was shown that a continually fluctuating, and not a stable, market is the desire of speculators. Such a market is against the interests of the producer; he must have stable prices in order to market his crop to best advantage. A market without wide and frequent price fluctuations \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n would greatly benefit the producer. The reason for this is that rapidly fluctuating prices can not be fully reflected in the prices paid at country stations, so an additional margin must be allowed for buying in the country.' Sen. Report No. 212, 67th Congress, 1st Sess.\n\n Witnesses testified before the committee that a calculation based on commissions showed the total bushels of grain sold for future delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade in a year reach nearly 20,000,000,000 and that the amount of grain actually delivered under such contracts is not 1 per cent. of this. Objectors to furture trading insisted at first that future trading put in the hands of desperate speculators an easy opportunity to corner the market and to promote great and rapid fluctuations in value, and was wholly vicious and should be forbidden. Further investigation and consideration have satisfied many that the law of supply and demand operated on futures as on cash sales and that futures are very useful in certain respects, notably in offering a means by which, through 'hedging,' owners of grain can, to some extent, protect themselves against the danger of losses by fluctuation.\n The government did not, in this hearing and argument, maintain that by manipulation the operators can permanently depress the prices of grain, but insisted and cited the actual quotations from time to time, some as late as the summer of 1922, showing violent fluctuations through 'deals' of large operators engaged in manipulating the futures market at intervals since 1900, before which corners were ever recurring but since which they have been infrequent. Much evidence was adduced before congressional committees that the sales of futures on the Chicago Board dominated the prices of wheat in this country and the world. The injurious effect of these recurring fluctuations in such futures upon the consignment of grain by owners and producers was asserted by witnesses. Mr. \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n Herbert Hoover, whose experience as Food Administrator gave his opinion weight, said to the House Committee on Agriculture (Future Trading Hearings-66th Congress, 3d Session, pp. 909, 910):\n'The second form of manipulation, and the one that I feel does at times take place, is the making of a drive on the price by either the sale or the purchase of such quantities as will affect the price by the volume of material coming to the market at that particular time. I would regard those transactions as an attempt to dislocate the normal flow of the law of supply and demand, and any attempt of any individual to dislocate a free market must be against public interest. I feel it is also against the interest of the individual producer, because a drive on the market that depresses the price must find a considerable number of farmers who, through the fall in price and their outside obligations, are compelled to liquidate, and they have been done an injury. Incidentally the commodity has been brought into the market, and an acceleration to depression has been created.'\n\n Mr. Julius H. Barnes, the head of the United States Grain Corporation during the war, and of widest experience in the grain markets of the world, at the same hearing, after explaining that future dealing stabilizes prices and helps legitimate hedging, and that a drive on prices worked its own cure in the long run, as did the distinguished economists whose affidavits were exhibited in this case, said (pages 839, 840):\n'But it is also true that, even though such a price depression must be temporary in character it may, during its period of effectiveness, do substantial injustice by forcing the liquidation of grain held on margins, or by the price tendency thus displayed, frightening owners otherwise confident of the ultimate value of their goods.'\n\n The Federal Trade Commission in its report on wheat prices to the President, December 13, 1920, said (page 8): \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n 'Price of wheat futures, the decline of which has been especially the subject of criticism, are susceptible of manipulation. Wide fluctuations in prices and large discounts of the future price below the cost price have prevailed. This has made it unsatisfactory for 'hedging,' and hedging sales may also appear to be manipulation, because, if they are large, they may cause sharp depressions. Wheat futures are not functioning well, even according to the standards of their advocates.'\n Mr. Julius H. Barnes, in his evidence before the Federal Trade Commission, in October, 1922, describes the effect upon interstate commerce of a 'deal' in May, 1922, wheat on the Chicago Board of Trade, when the price of futures rose rapidly. Large operators collected cash wheat all over the country and headed it for Chicago for delivery at the attractive prices. This took wheat away from all the other wheat centers of the country, where it normally would have remained for consumption, and accumulated it in almost unsalable quantity in Chicago, greatly disturbing the normal and useful flow of wheat in its ordinary and proper distribution and precipitating a crash in prices. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[262 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n It was charged before the congressional committees that the limitation of deliveries under contracts for futures to warehouse receipts of 12 regular warehouses aggregating but 13,000,000 bushels capacity, with the privilege of a tender of grain in cars on the last three days of the delivery month and a power in the board of directors to enlarge the privilege in case of an emergency, casts another element of speculative doubt into the prices of futures and puts too much control in the board of directors. In view of the fact that the total capacity of Chicago for storing grain in public and private warehouses is 45,000,000, it is urged that this rule of the futures market is sinister and dangerous in affecting the prices of a market that are worldwide in their influence by such a narrow limitation of deliveries subject to \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n arbitrary and uncertain change at the discretion of the Board, and that it is a factor in frightening shippers and lawful hedgers in making opportunity for speculative manipulation and burdening the flow of grain in normal interstate channels. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[262 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry S. Robbins, of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n\n\n[262 U.S. 1, 31]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellants contend that the decision of this court in Hill v. Wallace, \n259 U.S. 44\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 453, is conclusive against the constitutionality of the Grain Futures Act. Indeed in their bill they pleaded the judgment in that case as res adjudicata in this, as to its invalidity. The act whose constitutionality was in question in Hill v. Wallace was the Future Trading Act (chapter 86, 42 Stat. 187). It was an effort by Congress, through taxing at a prohibitive rate sales of grain for future delivery, to regulate such sales on boards of trade by exempting them from the tax if they would comply with the congressional regulations. It was \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 32]\n\u00a0\n held that sales for future delivery where the parties were present in Chicago, to be settled by offsetting purchases or by delivery, to take place there, were not interstate commerce and that Congress could not use its taxing power in this indirect way to regulate business not within federal control. We said (\n259 U.S. 68\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 458):\n'Looked at in this aspect and without any limitation of the application of the tax to interstate commerce, or to that which the Congress may deem from evidence before it to be an obstruction to interstate commerce, we do not find it possible to sustain the validity of the regulations as they are set forth in this act. A reading of the act makes it quite clear that Congress sought to use the taxing power to give validity to the act. It did not have the exercise of its power under the commerce clause in ind and so did not introduce into the act the limitations which certainly would accompany and mark an exercise of the power under the latter clause.'\n\n Again, on page 69 of 259 U. S., on page 458 of 42 Sup. Ct. (66 L. Ed. 822), we said:\n'It follows that sales for future delivery on the Board of Trade are not in and of themselves interstate commerce. They can not come within the regulatory power of Congress as such, unless they are regarded by Congress, from the evidence before it, as directly interfering with interstate commerce so as to be an obstruction or a burden thereon.'\n\n The Grain Futures Act which is now before us differs from the Future Trading Act in having the very features the absence of which we held in the somewhat carefully framed language of the foregoing prevented our sustaining the Future Trading Act. As we have seen in the statement of the case, the act only purports to regulate interstate commerce and sales of grain for future delivery on boards of trade because it finds that by manipulation they have become a constantly recurring burden and obstruction to that commerce. Instead, \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 33]\n\u00a0\n therefore, of being an authority against the validity of the Grain Futures Act, it is an authority in its favor.\n The Chicago Board of Trade is the greatest grain market in the world. Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 231, 235\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 242. Its report for 1922 shows that on that market in that year were made cash sales for some 350,000,000 bushels of grain, most of which was shipped from states west and north of Illinois into Chicago, and was either stored temporarily in Chicago or was retained in cars and after sale was shipped in large part to Eastern states and foreign countries. This great annual flow is made up of the cash grain sold on the exchange, the cash sales to arrive (Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, \n246 U.S. 231\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 242), and the comparatively small percentage of grain contracted to be sold in the futures market not settled by offsetting. Chicago Board of Trade v. Christie Grain Co., \n198 \nU.S. 236, 248\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 637. The railroads of the country accommodate themselves to the interstate function of the Chicago market by giving shippers from Western states bills of lading through Chicago to points in Eastern states with the right to remove the grain at Chicago for temporary purposes of storing, inspecting, weighing, grading, or mixing, and changing the ownership, consignee or destination and then to continue the shipment under the same contract and at a through rate. Bacon v. Illinois, \n227 U.S. 504\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 299. Such a contract does not prevent the local taxing of the grain while in Chicago; but it does not take it out of interstate commerce in such a way as to deprive Congress of the power to regulate it, as is plainly intimated in the authority cited (\n227 U.S. 516\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 299) and expressly recognized in Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495, 525\n, 526 S., 42 Sup. Ct. 397. The fact that the grain shipped from the West and taken from cars may have been stored in warehouses and mixed with other grain, so that the owner receives other grain when presenting his receipt for continuing \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 34]\n\u00a0\n the shipment, does not take away from the interstate character of the through shipment any more than a mixture of the oil or gas in the pipe lines of the oil and gas companies in West Virginia, with the right in the owners to withdraw their shares before crossing state lines, prevented the great bulk of the oil and gas which did thereafter cross state lines from being a stream or current of interstate commerce. Eureka Pipe Line v. Hallanan, \n257 \nU.S. 265, 272\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 101; United Fuel Gas Co. v. Hallanan, \n257 \nU.S. 277, 281\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 105.\n It is impossible to distinguish the case at bar, so far as it concerns the cash grain, the sales to arrive, and the grain actually delivered in fulfi lment of future contracts, from the current of stock shipments declared to be interstate commerce in Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 U.S. 495\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 397. That case presented the question whether sales and purchases of cattle made in Chicago at the stockyards by commission men and dealers and traders under the rules of the stockyards corporation could be brought by Congress under the supervision of the Secretary of Agriculture to prevent abuses of the commission men and dealers in exorbitant charges and other ways, and in their relations with packers prone to monopolize trade and depress and increase prices thereby. It was held that this could be done, even though the sales and purchases by commission men and by dealers were in and of themselves intrastate commerce, the parties to sales and purchases and the cattle all being at the time within the city of Chicago.\n We said (\n258 U.S. 515\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 402):\n'The stockyards are not a place of rest or final destination. Thousands of head of live stock arrive daily by carload and trainload lots, and must be promptly sold and disposed of and moved out to give place to the constantly flowing traffic that presses behind. The stockyards are but a throat through which the current flows \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 35]\n\u00a0\n and the transactions which occur therein are only incident to this current from the West to the East, and from one state to another. Such transactions cannot be separated from the movement to which they contribute and necessarily take on its character. The commission men are essential in making the sales without which the flow of the current would be obstructed, and this, whether they are made to packers or dealers. The dealers are essential to the sales of the stock farmers and feeders. The sales are not in this aspect merely local transactions. They create a local change of title, it is true, but they do not stop the flow; they merely change the private interests in the subject of the current, not interfering with, but, on the contrary, being indispensable to, its continuity. The origin of the live stock is in the West, its ultimate destination known to, and intended by, all engaged in the business is in the Middle West and East, either as meat products or stock for feeding and fattening. This is the definite and well-understood course of business. The stockyards and the sales are necessary factors in the middle of this current of commerce.'\n\n This case was but the necessary consequence of the conclusions reached in the case of Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 U.S. 375\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 276. That case was a milestone in the interpretation of the commerce clause of the Constitution. It recognized the great changes and development in the business of this vast country and drew again the dividing line between interstate and intrastate commerce where the Constitution intended it to be. It refused to permit local incidents of great interstate movement, which taken alone were intrastate, to characterize the movement as such. The Swift Case merely fitted the commerce clause to the real and practical essence of modern business growth. It applies to the case before us just as it did in Stafford v. Wallace.\n The distinction that the exchange of the Chicago Board of Trade building is not within the same inclosure as the \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 36]\n\u00a0\n railroad yards and warehouses in which the grain is received and stored on its way from the West to the East as it is being sold on the exchange, while the stockyards exchange and the actual receipt and shipment of cattle are within the same fense, surely can make no difference in the application of the principle. The sales on the Chicago Board of Trade are just as indispensable to the continuity of the flow of wheat from the West to the mills and distributing points of the East and Europe, as are the Chicago sales of cattle to the flow of stock toward the feeding places and slaughter and packing houses of the East.\n The question under this act is somewhat different in form and detail from that in the Stafford Case, but the result must be the same. It is not the sales and deliveries of the actual grain which are the chief subject of the supervision of federal agency by Congress in the Grain Futures Act, although a record of cash sales is required, and a corner in cash sales would be a violation of it, and there are other provisions equally regulatory of them. It is the contracts of sales of grain for future delivery, most of which do not result in actual delivery but are settled by offsetting them with other contracts of the same kind, or by what is called 'ringing.' Board of Trade v. Christie Co., \n198 U.S. 236\n, 246-247, 25 Sup. Ct. 637. The question is whether the conduct of such sales is subject to constantly recurring abuses which are a burden and obstruction to interstate commerce in grain? And further, are they such an incident of that commerce and so intermingled with it that the burden and obstruction caused therein by them can be said to be direct?\n In United States v. Ferger, \n250 U.S. 199\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 445, the question was of the validity of a statute of Congress punishing the forging of bills of lading used in interstate commerce, and altering them. The lower court had dismissed an indictment charging the offense denounced in the statute, \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 37]\n\u00a0\n on the ground that Congress could only deal with real bills of lading where there was an actual shipment in interstate commerce, and had no power to punish a fraud and fiction where there was no such commerce, and where the bills of lading whose fabrication was the subject of complaint were mere pieces of papers fraudulently inscribed, and did not relate to any actual interstate commerce. This court, speaking through Chief Justice White, rejected the view of the lower court, on the ground that interstate commerce would be directly impaired and weakened by the unrestrained right to fabricate and circulate spurious bills of lading apparently connected with such commerce. The court, in Stafford v. Wallace, supra, adopted and applied this principle and said (\n258 U.S. 521\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 403):\n'Whatever amounts to more or less constant practice, and threatens to obstruct or unduly to burden the freedom of interstate commerce is within the regulatory power of Congress under the commerce clause, and it is primarily for Congress to consider and decide the fact of the danger and to meet it. This court will certainly not substitute its judgment for that of Congress in such a matter unless the relation of the subject to interstate commerce and its effect upon it are clearly nonexistent.'\n\n In the act we are considering, Congress has expressly declared that transactions and prices of grain in dealing in futures are susceptible to speculation, manipulation, and control which are detrimental to the producer and consumer and persons handling grain in interstate commerce and render regulation imperative for the protection of such commerce and the national public interest therein.\n It is clear from the citations, in the statement of the case, of evidence before committees of investigation as to manipulations of the futures market and their effect, that we would be unwarranted in rejecting the finding \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 38]\n\u00a0\n of Congress as unreasonable, and that in our inquiry as to the validity of this legislation we must accept the view that such manipulation does work to the detriment of producers, consumers, shippers and legitimate dealers in interstate commerce in grain and that it is a real abuse.\n But it is contended that it is too remote in its effect on interstate commerce, and that it is not like the direct additions to the cost to the producer of marketing cattle by exorbitant charges and discrimination of commission men and dealers, as in Stafford v. Wallace. It is said there is no relation between prices on the futures market and in the cash sales. This is hardly consistent with the affidavits the plaintiffs present from the leading economists, already referred to, who say that dealing in futures stabilizes cash prices. It is true that the curves of prices in the futures and in the cash sales are not parallel and that sometimes one is higher and sometimes the other. This is to be expected because futures prices are dependent normally on judgment of the parties as to the future, and the cash prices depend on present conditions, but it is very reasonable to suppose that the one influences the other as the time of actual delivery of the futures approaches, when the prospect of heavy actual transactions at a certain fixed price must have a direct effect upon the cash prices in unfettered sales. The effect of such a 'deal' as that of May, 1922, as explained by Mr. J. H. Barnes, shows this clearly and illustrates in a striking way the direct effect of such manipulation in disturbing the actual normal flow of grain in interstate commerce most injuriously. Mr. Barnes also points out the effect of the operation of the rule limiting deliveries to warehouse receipts from warehouses selected by the directors of the Board, whose unregulated power to suspend or modify the rule pending settlement adds to the speculative character of the market and frightens consignors. \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 39]\n\u00a0\n More than this, prices of grain futures are those upon which an owner and intending seller of cash grain is influenced to sell or not to sell as they offer a good opportunity to him to hedge comfortably against future fluctuations. Manipulations of grain futures for speculative profit, though not carried to the extent of a corner or complete monopoly, exert a vicious influence and produce abnormal and disturbing temporary fluctuations of prices that are not responsive to actual supply and demand and discourage, not only this justifiable hedging, but disturb the normal flow of actual consignments. A futures market lends itself to such manipulation much more readily than a cash market.\n In the case of United States v. Patten, \n226 U.S. 525\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 141, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 325, an indictment charged a conspiracy to run a corner by making purchases of quantities of cotton for future delivery, by means of which the conspirators were to secure control of the available supply of cotton in the country and enhance the price of cotton at will. It was contended that, even if the necessary result of this was an obstruction of interstate trade, it was so indirect as not to constitute a restraint of it within the federal Anti-Trust Law under which the indictment was drawn. This court held otherwise and sustained the indictment.\n Corners in grain through trading in futures have not been so frequent as they were before 1900, due, as the plaintiffs aver, to the stricter rules of the Board of Trade as to futures and to the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (Comp. St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830), though they do seem to have since occurred infrequently. The fact that a corner in grain is brought about by trading in futures shows the direct relation between cash prices and actual commerce on the one hand, and dealing in futures on the other, because a corner is not a monopoly of contracts only, it is a monopoly of the actual supply of grain in commerce. It was this direct relation that led to the decision in the Patten Case. If a corner and the enhancement \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 40]\n\u00a0\n of prices produced by buying futures directly burden interstate commerce in the article whose price is enhanced, it would seem to follow that manipulations of futures which unduly depress prices of grain in interstate commerce and directly influence consignment in that commerce are equally direct. The question of price dominates trade between the states. Sales of an article which affect the country-wide price of the article directly affect the country-wide commerce in it. By reason and authority, therefore, in determining the validity of this act, we are prevented from questioning the conclusion of Congress that manipulation of the market for futures on the Chicago Board of Trade may, and from time to time does, directly burden a d obstruct commerce between the states in grain, and that it recurs and is a constantly possible danger. For this reason, Congress has the power to provide the appropriate means adopted in this act by which this abuse may be restrained and avoided.\n The next provision of the act which is attacked as invalid is that which forbids a board, designated as a contract market, from excluding from membership in, and all privileges on, its exchanges any duly authorized representative of a lawfully formed and conducted association of producers having adequate financial responsibility, engaged in the cash grain business, and complying or agreeing to comply with the terms and conditions lawfully imposed on the other members, and which bars any rule forbidding the return by such association of the commissions of its representative, less expenses, to the bona fide members of the co- operative association in proportion to their consignments of grain to the exchange. It is said that this will impair the value of memberships in the Board and will take the property of the members without due process of law.\n The Board of Trade conducts a business which is affected with a public interest and is, therefore, subject to \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 41]\n\u00a0\n reasonable regulation in the public interest. The Supreme Court of Illinois has so decided in respect to its publication of market quotations. New York & Chicago Grain Exchange v. Chicago Board of Trade, 127 Ill. 153, 19 N. E. 855, 2 L. R. A. 411, 11 Am. St. Rep. 107. In view of the actual interstate dealings in cash sales of grain on the exchange, and the effect of the conduct of the sales of futures upon interstate commerce, we find no difficulty under Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113\n, 133, and Stafford v. Wallace, supra, in concluding that the Chicago Board of Trade is engaged in a business affected with a public national interest and is subject to national regulation as such. Congress may therefore reasonably limit the rules governing its conduct with a view to preventing abuses and securing freedom from undue discrimination in its operations. The incidental effect which such reasonable rules may have, if any, in lowering the value of memberships does not constitute a taking, but is only a reasonable regulation in the exercise of the police power of the national government. Congress evidently deems it helpful in the preservation of the vital function which such a board of trade exercises in interstate commerce in grain that producers and shippers should be given an opportunity to take part in the transactions in this world market through a chosen representative. Nor do we see why the requirement that the relation between them and this representative, lookikng to economy of participation on their part by a return of patronage dividends, should not be permissible because facilitating closer participation by the great body of producers in transactions of the Board which are of vital importance to them. It would seem to make for more careful supervision of those transactions in the national public interest in the free flow of interstate commerce. Under the present rules of the Board, corporations are permitted to enjoy the benefit of membership by reason of the membership of two of their executive officers who are bona fide stockholders, and all their stockholders \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 42]\n\u00a0\n are thus given a chance to enjoy the commissions earned and the benefits to the corporation of other membership privileges to the extent of their stock ownership. The provisions of the act objected to are to be sustained on the principles laid down in House v. Mayes, \n219 U.S. 270\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 234. Broadnax v. Missouri, \n219 U.S. 285\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 238, and Grisim v. South St. Paul Live Stock Exchange, 152 Minn. 271, 188 N. W. 729. We think the objection to this feature of the act untenable.\n We do not find it necessary to our decree in this case to consider the constitutional objections made in the bill to that part of the fourth section which forbids he use of the mails and interstate facilities of communication to offer or accept sales for future deliveries or to send quotations of prices thereof except through members of a board of trade, because the plaintiffs are not affected thereby. Section 10 of the act reads as follows:\n'If any provision of this act or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of the act and of the application of such provision to other persons and circumstances shall not be affected thereby.'\n\n The unconstitutionality of these provisions, if they be unconstitutional, would, therefore, not invalidate the rest of the act.\n Section 9 declares it to be a misdemeanor for a member of a designated board of trade to fail to evidence any contract mentioned in section 4 by a record in writing as therein required. This is only a legitimate means of enforcing the statutory regulations of the Board of Trade which we have found to be within the power of Congress.\n As to the power of Congress to provide in section 9 for the punishment of any one who shall knowingly or carelessly deliver through the mail or interstate means of communication false or misleading crop or market reports, it will be time enough for us to consider its existence when some one is charged with the offense and is brought to trial therefor. The plaintiffs present no such case. \n\n[262 U.S. 1, 43]\n\u00a0\n Paragraph (b) of section 6 which gives to the Commission the power on complaint after investigation by the Secretary of Agriculture, and after a hearing, to exclude from all contract markets any person violating any of the provisions of the act or attempting to manipulate the market price of any grain in violation of the provisions of section 5 of the act or of any of the rules or regulations made in pursuance to its requirements, is attacked as invalid because a jury trial is not afforded. The plaintiffs do not aver that they are committing acts which will subject them to such exclusion, or that charges have been made and proceedings have been begun or are about to be begun against them by the Secretary of Agriculture. Until they are thus in danger of suffering prejudice from the operation of the paragraph, they cannot invoke our decision as to its validity.\n For the reasons given the decree of the District Court is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In response to Senate Resolution 133 the Federal Trade Commission prepared to make a report by conducting in October, 1922, an inquiry into the market manipulation of grain. Mr. Julius H. Barnes was a witness, and in the course of his examination said (pages 74-76):\n'Now, in May, 1922, we had the same spectacular gyrations in prices, starting earlier in the month and falling into a complete collapse in price. Why?\n\n'Commissioner Murdock: In the middle of the month this time?\n\n'Mr. Barnes: Yes, starting early in the month, rising to a peak and then falling to an early collapse. Without knowing the facts, because these things are detected by commission merchants, it seems quite clear that there were two or three large lines of wheat bought in Chicago for delivery in May, 1922; that at least one of those, on popular report, was a man who could easily pay for 5,000,000 bushels of wheat; that he intended to take the wheat as a merchant; that he was going to pay cash for it and not squeeze somebody to make a settlement. He expected to get delivery of that, did not buy it in anticipation that it could not be delivered, and therefore he could force a settlement, and he was going to act as a merchant on the belief that wheat was worth more in the world's markets than the prices then ruling in Chicago; but on top of that there developed that two or three other men, who were evidently clear speculators, not acting with that conception, had also lines of wheat, and the aggregate of those made a shortage in Chicago exceeding the stock of wheat in Chicago or naturally tributary thereto.\n\n'The result of that was that as this sit ation developed, the buyer, miller or exporter began to get afraid about the Chicago market, that he might have to buy his hedges in higher, and began to buy in those hedges and the market advanced under that kind of apprehensive buying, the buying of legitimate merchants who were frightened to leave their hedges in that month any longer. That helped make the peak, plus perhaps some buying by interested people who wanted to see the price marked up, and those large cash interests in Chicago began to collect all over the country wheat and head it to Chicago \n\n for delivery at these attractive prices, which by this time had reached a relation in respect to all of the markets which attracted wheat from every direction to Chicago.\n'The result of that was that by the end of the month there was accumulated in Chicago a stock of 10,000,000 or 12,000,000 bushels of wheat, which was beyond the normal absorbing capacity of the consumption trade that rests on Chicago, and that wheat had been lifted by the incentive of these apprehensively made prices from centers where it should have remained for the consumption which normally overtakes it from those centers-Omaha, Kansas City, Minneapolis, all these other points. So that the country stocks which should normally supply mills west of Chicago or south of Chicago were lifted out of their natural place and directed to Chicago by these apprehensively made prices, and there was collected in Chicago an almost un salable quantity of wheat which could only press in one direction, could not go back.\n\n'Commissioner Murdock: So that we had a price collapse by that?'\n\n See, also, letter of J. H. Barnes to Chicago Board of Trade, p. 69, Grain Future Hearings before Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, U. S. Senate, 67th Congress, 2d Session, on H. R. 11843, containing the following:\n'Present conditions lay an economic burden on distribution cost by drawing wheat to Chicago out of its accustomed channels and from points of supply needed shortly for actual consumption elsewhere. These evil effects are solely from apprehension of a forced settlement at artificial prices on hedges properly used as insurance against price level fluctuations.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Evidence of Julius H. Barnes before Federal Trade Commission in October, 1922 (page 77), on inquiry in response to Senate Res. No. 133:\n'Mr. Barnes: In the demonstration for several years that the chief abuses of the trade were deliberate manipulation and congestion, the deliberate forcing of settlement by artificial prices, the trade step by step tried to make it more difficult for any one to obtain that control of the market. They made No. 1, 2, 3 wheat, and on all varieties deliverable. That was not sufficient, as demonstrated in Chicago two years ago to the market committee of 1917. I suggested to them that the trade ought to seriously consider a widening of the contract basis once more, so as to make wheat at Omaha and Kansas City and Minneapolis, at points of accumulation on the normal flow. So that there was not any substantial injustice done a buyer; deliverable at a freight cost difference and a small penalty, so that it would not be abused, and I stand to-day for that as being the one real constructive thing left for the Chicago market to- day, if Chicago is to be the liquid grain future trading market of America, as it should be, if there is a natural advantage in concentrating all the trading of the country in one market, so that you can send an order through and get 100,000 or 500,000 bushels in a minute, to answer a cable from abroad or a milling order, because the volume of trade there is liquid all the time, and I believe that is in the public interest.\n\n'If it is to do that, then Chicago ought to widen this wedge against these shippers, and it can be done by taking into contract delivery the wheats in these other markets. The effect last May would have been that that wheat would have been delivered, but the wheat itself would have physically been in Omaha and Kansas City and available for milling in June and July, when it was n eded, and it would not have been in Chicago to press direct on East and the world's market and cause a further decline in price.\n\n'Mr. Watkins: Mr. Barnes, what you would include for delivery at Chicago markets you would include for delivery at seaboard markets, would you not?\n\n'Mr. Barnes: No. I would not, because as I say, on the natural flow, a buyer in Chicago for actual delivery of wheat must in the normal process of trade move that what east. His consumption both for export and milling is east of Chicago. Therefore, for him to take delivery west of Chicago at a freight difference and a small penalty is no substantial injustice; but to force him to take wheat at the seaboard at the transportation cost when maybe he is buying in Chicago to supply a mill in Omaha, might be a very substantial injustice.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","26":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBREDE v. POWERS(1923)\nNo. 45\nArgued: October 4, 1923Decided: October 22, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 4, 5]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Otho S. Bowling, of New York City, and Morris Kamber, of Brooklyn, N. Y., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 4, 9]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Dismissal of a writ of habeas corpus is assailed by this appeal. It was issued to review the legality of a conviction upon information and a sentence of imprisonment upon it. In detail of the grounds and justification of it, the charge of the petition is that appellant was proceeded against in the District Court upon an information charging him with a violation of section 21, title 2, of the Act of Congress of October 28, 1919, the National Prohibition Act (41 Stat. 314), and convicted on the 17th day of June, 1920, and sentenced to pay a fine of $500 and be imprisoned for 60 days. In execution of the sentence it is alleged that he was committed to the custody of the appellee, he being the United States marshal for the Eastern district of New York.\n The further allegation of the petition is that the court 'never acquired jurisdiction of the pretended criminal action upon which, in form, it tried and condemned' him, 'for the reason that the crime of which' he 'was charged and for which said court sought to try and condemn' him 'is an infamous crime within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and no presentment or indictment of a grand jury charging same, was ever filed or presented.'\n After hearing, the writ was discharged and appellant was remanded to the custody of the marshal to serve his sentence under the commitment, which was to the county jail of Essex county, New Jersey.\n Is the contention of appellant justified, in that his was a conviction and commitment of an infamous crime? It is upon this contention that his petition rests. \n\n[263 U.S. 4, 10]\n\u00a0\n It has been decided that a crime takes on the quality of infamy if it be one punishable by imprisonment at hard labor or in a penitentiary, and must be proceeded against upon presentment or indictment of a grand jury. Ex parte Wilson, \n114 U.S. 417\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 935; Mackin v. United States, \n117 U.S. 348\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 777; United States v. Moreland, \n258 U.S. 433\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 368, 24 A. L. R. 992. And such is the quality of the crime and the procedure against it, if the statute authorizes the court to condemn to such punishment. See, also, In re Bonner, \n151 U.S. 242\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 323; In re Mills, \n135 U.S. 263\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 762.\n Or to put it as counsel puts it:\n'The construction of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution is this: An infamous crime is one that carries infamous punishment; the test does not depend upon the punishment that ultimately happens to be inflicted, but upon the punishment the court has power to inflict.'\n\n To show the pertinence of the test and its adaptation to the case, it is the contention of the appellant that the court had power, and only power, to sentence him to imprisonment in a penal institution of New York, and that by the law of the state, by federal statute made applicable to federal prisoners therein, imprisonment is at hard labor.\n The argument by which the contention is attempted to be sustained is somewhat strained. It rests upon the power the statutes give to the courts to specify the places of imprisonment, which began, it is said, in 1789. By a Resolution then passed, the state Legislatures were recommended to receive and keep prisoners committed under the authority of the United States 'under the like penalties as in the case of prisoners committed under the authority of such states respectively. ...' 1 Stat. 96.\n The purpose thus expressed was in substance repeated subsequently, and sections 5537 and 5538 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  10521, 10522), reproducing a resolution adopted in 1821 (3 Stat. 646), sections 5542 and 5548 (Comp. St.  10528, 10549), reproducing 4 Stat. 118,  15, and 4 Stat. 777,  5, are \n\n[263 U.S. 4, 11]\n\u00a0\n cited. Sections 5546 and 5541 (Comp. St.  10547, 10527) are also cited; they having their origin in 13 Stat. 74,  1 and 500,  3.\n It is provided in sections 5537 and 5538, where a state does not allow the use of its jails to United States prisoners, the marshal under direction of the court may hire or procure a temporary jail, and that the marshal shall make provisions for the safe-keeping of prisoners until permanent provision for that purpose is made by law.\n By section 5542, where the sentence is imprisonment to hard labor, the court may direct its execution 'within the district or state where such court is held.'\n Section 5548 provides that, where punishment for an offense is by fine or imprisonment, it may be executed in any house of correction or house of reformation for juvenile delinquents 'within the state or district where' such court is held.\n Section 5546 provides that the place of imprisonment, where there may be no penitentiary or jail suitable for the confinement of convicts or available therefor, may be in some suitable jail or penitentiary in a convenient state or territory to be designated by the Attorney General, and power to changes is given to the Attorney General.\n The provisions of these sections seem adaptive to all imprisonments and to all grades of crime; in other words, have an adaptive and harmonious relation, and such relation they were declared to have in In re Karstendick, \n93 U.S. 396\n. Appellant, however, contends that section 5546 may be treated as a proviso of sections 5541 and 5542, and that the latter sections 'define the only instances in which a United States court can sentence a prisoner to confinement in a 'state jail or penitentiary' within the state, that is, when the statute requires hard labor as part of the punishment or when the imprisonment is for more than a year, and that, therefore, when the sentence is in terms of imprisonment merely, for a year or less, \n\n[263 U.S. 4, 12]\n\u00a0\n the court has no power to sentence the prisoner to a 'suitable jail or penitentiary in a convenient state ... designated by the Attorney General.\"\n We are not impressed with the contention. The reasoning to sustain it is that Congress 'could give District Courts the power to sentence short term convicts to institutions beyond the limits of their ordinary jurisdiction, but it has not,' and, further 'although Congress was willing, when the facts justified, that a long termer should be sent beyond the borders of his state, they were unwilling that a short termer should be so dealt with.'\n The reasoning does not convince us. We prefer, and accept, the clear and direct power given to the Attorney General (section 5546), and there is nothing in In re Mills and In re Bonner that militates against it.\n In re Mills decided that, when a statute does not require imprisonment in a penitentiary, a sentence cannot impose it, unless the sentence is for a period longer than one year. In re Bonner is to the same effect. In other words, the sentences cannot transcend those of the statutes. In both cases the sentences were convictions upon indictments. They are authorities against, not for, the appellant. His contention changes the penalty of the statute, and therefore repels. The statute provides that for the offense here charged the offender shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not exceeding one year, or both [section 21 ]. Where the charge is selling, as in the Wyman Case, \n263 U.S. 14\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 10, 68 L. Ed. --, the punishment, for the first offense, is a fine not more than $1,000 and imprisonment not exceeding six months. National Prohibition Act,  29, 41 Stat. 316.\n The statute excludes the imposition of hard labor or imprisonment in a penitentiary. Under the contention of appellant both would be imposed. Imprisonment must be, is the assertion, in a New York penitentiary, and at hard labor, the latter consequence because of the law of New York. \n\n[263 U.S. 4, 13]\n\u00a0\n Appellant, while particularly insistent upon the New York law and the absence of power to imprison elsewhere than in a New York institution, however, contends that the imprisonment in the Essex county jail is at hard labor, because the conduct or discipline of that jail requires or permits the imposition of hard labor, and thereby constitutes the crime infamous. If that can be so held, it gives the court power to transcend the statute, which, as we have said, does not include hard labor in its punishment. But such peremptory requirement cannot be assigned to the New Jersey law-neither employment at hard labor, nor any labor. The law is made adaptive to circumstances, made so by committing its administration to the judgment of the freeholders of the county, and it is limited to prescribing suitable employment of prisoners to accomplish the purpose of the law. Laws N. J. 1917, P. 888. The law gives no indication that the employment is or may be prescribed as punishment. It proceeds along other lines.\n It follows that the sentence of the court was not intended to be, and could not have been, to imprisonment at hard labor.\n We find no error in the decision of the court in discharging the writ and its action is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in the result. \n\n\n\n","27":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROSNAN v. BROSNAN(1923)\nNo. 56\nArgued: October 8, 1923Decided: November 26, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 345, 346]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. R. H. Yeatman and Wilton J. Lambert, both of Washington, D. C ., for John Brosnan, Jr.\n W. Gwynn Gardiner, of Washington, D. C., for Margaret Brosnan.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes before us, under Section 251 of the Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1228), upon the following certificate:\n'The Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia certifies that the record in this case discloses the following: Timothy Brosnan died in the District of Columbia, wherein he resided and was domiciled, on May 2, 1919, leaving a last Will and Testament dated July 29, 1918, which was duly filed for probate, whereupon his widow Margaret Brosnan, the appellee here, filed a caveat challenging the mental capacity of the decedent. At the close of the evidence, which was conflicting upon this point, the proponents of the Will, appellants here, prayed the court to instruct the jury that on this issue the burden of proof was upon the caveator. The court declined to so rule but instructed the jury, as requested by the caveator, that the burden of proof was upon the caveatees and that, if the jury should find 'that the evidence is evenly balanced or that the weight of the evidence it in favor of finding that the testator was of unsound mind,' the verdict should be against testamentary capacity. The Court of Appeals certifies that the following question of law arises upon the record, the decision of which is \n\n[263 U.S. 345, 347]\n\u00a0\n necessary for the proper disposition of the case, and, to the end that a correct result may be reached, desires the instruction of the Supreme Court of the United States upon the that question, to wit: upon the issue whether the testator, at the time of the execution of the Will, was 'of sound and disposing mind and capable of executing a valid deed or contract,' is the burden of proof in the District of Columbia upon the caveator or caveatee?'\n\n The Code of the District of Columbia provides for the probate of a will in solemn form upon the filing of a petition and notice to all persons interested in the estate by service of citation or publication ( section 130); permits any party in interest to file a caveat in opposition to its probate upon or prior to the hearing (section 136); and, if the will be admitted to probate, permits any person in interest, within a specified time thereafter, to file a caveat and pray that the probate be revoked (section 137). It is further provided that no will shall be good and effectual unless the person making the same be at the time of its execution of sound and disposing mind and capable of executing a valid deed or contract (section 1625).\n The certificate of the Court of Appeals does not show specifically whether the caveat was filed before or after the probate of the will; but for the purpose of giving the instruction requested as to the rule of law in the District of Columbia, this is immaterial, whatever may be the effect of the distinction elsewhere.\n The questions as to the burden of proof under a caveat challenging the mental capacity of the testator, before or after the probate of a will, have given rise to much conflict of opinion in different jurisdictions. It is, however, unnecessary to enter into a consideration of these questions at large, for the reason that the law in the District of Columbia has been established by the decision \n\n[263 U.S. 345, 348]\n\u00a0\n of this Court in Leach v. Burr, \n188 \nU.S. 510, 516\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 393 (1903). In that case the will having been offered for probate, a caveat was filed in opposition. The questions submitted for consideration on the trial in the Supreme Court of the District were whether the testator was at the time of executing the will 'of sound mind, capable of executing a valid deed or contract,' and whether the will was procured by threats, menace, and duress, or by fraud. The trial court directed a verdict against the caveator and ordered the will to be admitted to probate. Upon appeal from an affirmance of this order by the Court of Appeals, this Court, after specifically setting out the questions submitted for consideration and reviewing the evidence, especially in reference to the question of the mental capacity of the testator, said:\n'Upon questions of this kind submitted to a jury the burden of proof, in this District at least, is on the caveators. Dunlop v. Peter, 1 Cranch, C. C. 403, Fed. Cas. No. 4168. See also Higgins v. Carlton, 28 Md. 115, 143, 92 Am. Dec. 666; Tyson v. Tyson's Executors, 37 Md. 567. The caveators in the present case failed to sustain this burden, and we are of the opinion that the trial court did not err in directing a verdict against them. The judgment is affirmed.'1\n\n This is a specific decision that in the District of Columbia under a caveat filed in opposition to the probate of a will the burden of proof on an issue as to the mental capacity of the testator, is upon the caveator. It definitely determines the rule of law, in the District and completely abrogates such effect, if any, as otherwise might have attached to the incidental remark in the previous case of Rich v. Lemmon, 15 App. D. C. 507 \n\n[263 U.S. 345, 349]\n\u00a0\n (1899), that the 'onus of proof' upon such issue was on the proponent of the will. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Apart from any question of pleading as to the burden of allegation, this rule as to the burden of proof rests upon the ancient presumption in reference to sanity. Higgins v. Carlton, supra, 28 Md. 141, 92 Am. Dec. 666. And viewed from a practical rather than an academic standpoint, it gives effective weight to the presumption of the testator's sanity and obviates the difficulty which would arise if such presumption were treated as one which merely established a prima facie case in favor of the proponent of the will but did not relieve him from the ultimate burden of persuasion on the question of the testator's mental capacity, involving a nice distinction tending to confusion in a jury trial. And for this reason, as well as upon the principle of stare decisis, we have no disposition to modify or change the law of the District as settled in Leach v. Burr.\n And obviously, as the caveator under that law has the burden of proving the want of mental capacity in the testator before the will has been probated, he is not relieved of this burden when challenging such capacity in a proceeding instituted to revoke the probate of a will after the presumption of the testator's sanity has been fortified by a decree of probate made in solemn form after notice to the parties in interest.\n For the foregoing reasons, in answer to the request of the Court of Appeals, it is instructed: That in the District of Columbia, under a caveat to a will challenging the mental capacity of the testator, whether before or after the will has been admitted to probate, the burden of proof \n\n[263 U.S. 345, 350]\n\u00a0\n on the issue whether the testator at the time of executing the will was of sound and disposing mind and capable of executing a valid deed or contract, is upon the caveator. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the Higgins Case it specifically appears that the caveat was filed before probate of the will; in the Dunlop Case this interentially appears; and in the Tyson Case it appears that the caveat was filed after the will had been admitted to probate. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The rule stated in Leach v. Burr seems at first to have been followed, as it should, by the trial courts of the District, as settled law. See, for example, Re Will of Shelly, 34 Wash. Law Rep. 802 (1906). But later they seem to have regarded the earlier statement in Rich v. Lemmon, as controlling. See Re Estate of Robinson, 45 Wash. Law Rep. 760 ( 1917). \n\n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROWN v. U S(1923)\nNo. 97\nArgued: October 19, 1923Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. J. H. Peterson, of Pocatello, Idaho, for Brown and another. \n\n[263 U.S. 78, 79]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. W. Dyar, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court. \n\n[263 U.S. 78, 80]\n\u00a0\n These are cross-writs of error to a judgment of the District Court of Idaho in a condemnation case. The plaintiffs in error are owners of a tract of 120 acres, which was the object of the suit by the United States. The jury rendered a verdict of $6,250 for the plaintiffs, and the court added $328 as interest at 7 per cent., from the date of the issuing of the summons to that of the judgment. The plaintiffs denied the power of the Congress under the federal Constitution to condemn the land, because not taken for a public use. This entitled them to come to this court under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215); and so the United States sued out a cross-writ of error to question the legality of including in the judgment the interest item.\n Plaintiffs' tract lies just outside the present limits of American Falls in Idaho. The town has 1,500 people and is so situate in the valley of the Snake river that three-fourths of the town, or 640 acres, will be flooded by the waters of a reservoir which the United States proposes to create, for irrigation of its arid public land, by damming the waters of the river.\n The Sundry Civil Act of March 4, 1921 (41 Stat. 1367, 1403) appropriates $1,735,000 in addition to an unexpended balance for the continuation of the construction and extension of the irrigation system called the Minidoka Project,\n'with authority in connection with the construction of American Falls reservoir to purchase or condemn and to improve suitable land for a new town site to replace the portion of the town of American Falls which will be flooded by the reservoir and to provide for the removal of buildings to such new site and to plat and to provide for appraisal of lots in such new town site, and to exchange and convey such lots in full or part payment for property to be flooded by the reservoir, and to sell for not less than the appraised valuation any lots not used for such exchange.' \n\n[263 U.S. 78, 81]\n\u00a0\n The United States has purchased 410 acres for the new town site and needs 165 acres more of which plaintiffs' tract of 120 acres is part. Negotiations for purchase from the plaintiffs failed, as they demanded $24, 000.\n\n The plaintiffs contend that the power of eminent domain does not extend to the taking of one man's property to sell it to another, that such an object cannot be regarded as for a public use of the property, and, without this, appropriation can have no constitutional validity. The District Court held that the acquisition of the town site was so closely connected with the acquisition of the district to be flooded and so necessary to the carrying out of the project that the public use of the reservoir covered the taking of the town site. We concur in this view.\n The circumstances of this case are peculiar. An important town stood in the way of a necessary improvement by the United States. Three-quarters of its streets, alleys, and parks, and of its buildings, public and private, would have to be abandoned. The buildings could not be moved, except to the gradually rising ground east of the Snake river. There was a bluff 100 feet high on the other side of the river. The tract of 475 acres selected for the new town site was the only practical and available place to which the part of the town to be flooded could be moved, so as to be united with the one-quarter of the old town which would be left. American Falls is a large settlement for that sparsely settled country, and it was many miles from a town of any size in any direction. It was a natural and proper part of the construction of the dam and reservoir to make provision for a substitute town as near as possible to the old one.\n No one would say that a legislative act authorizing a railway company to build a railroad exceeds the constitutional limit by reason of a specific provision that the \n\n[263 U.S. 78, 82]\n\u00a0\n company may condemn land not only for the right of way, but also additional land adjacent thereto for use as borrow pits in making fills and embankments, or for use as spoil banks or dumps for the earth excavated from tunnels and cuts. Such adjacent land would certainly be devoted to the public use for which the railway was being constructed. If so, then the purchase of a townsite on which to put the people and buildings of a town that have to be ousted to make the bed of a reservoir would seem to be equally within the constitutional warrant. The purchase of a site to which the buildings of the town can be moved and salvaged, and the dispossessed owners be given lots in exchange for their old ones, is a reasonable adaptation of proper means toward the end of the public use to which the reservoir is to be devoted? The transaction is not properly described as the condemnation of the land of one private owner to sell it to another. The incidental fact that in the substitution and necessary adjustment of the exchanges, a mere residuum of the town site lots may have to be sold does not change the real nature of what is done, which is that of a mere transfer of the town from one place to another at the expense of the United States. The usual and ordinary method of condemnation of the lots in the old town, and of the streets and alleys as town property, would be ill adapted to the exigency. It would be hard to fix a proper value of homes in a town thus to be destroyed, without prospect of their owners' finding homes similarly situate on streets in another part of the same town, or in another town near at hand. It would be difficult to place a proper estimate of the value of the streets and alleys to be destroyed and not to be restored in kind. A town is a business center. It is a unit. If three-quarters of it is to be destroyed by appropriating it to an exclusive use like a reservoir, all property owners, both those ousted and those in the remaining quarter, as well as the state, whose subordinate agency of government is the munici pality, \n\n[263 U.S. 78, 83]\n\u00a0\n are injured. A method of compensation by substitution would seem to be the best means of making the parties whole. The power of condemnation is necessary to such a substitution.\n The circumstances of this case are so peculiar that it would not be surprising if no precedent could be found to aid us as an authority. There is one, however, which presents a somewhat close analogy. In Pitznogle v. Western Maryland R. R. Co., 119 Md. 673, 87 Atl. 917, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 319, a railroad company condemned a piece of land for its tracks and yards, and in doing so appropriated a private right of way, which was the only access of certain other landowners to the public highway. It was held that the railway company could condemn an additional strip of land for a substitute right of way to be furnished to these landowners. In reaching this conclusion the court said:\n'The condemnation of a part of this land, here sought to be condemned, for a substitute private road or way is incident to and results from the taking, by reason of public necessity, of the existing private road for public use, and the use of it for such purposes should, we think, be regarded as a public use within the meaning of the Constitution.'\n\n Our conclusion is not in conflict with that class of cases with which the justices of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts dealt in the Opinion of Justices, 204 Mass. 607, 91 N. E. 405, 27 L. R. A. (N. S.) 483. It was there proposed that the city of Boston, in building a street through a crowded part of the city, should be given power to condemn lots abutting on both sides of the proposed street, with a view to sale of them after the improvement was made for the promotion of the erection of warehouses, mercantile establishments, and other buildings suited to the demands of trade and commerce. The justices were of opinion that neither the development of the private commerce of the city nor the incidental profit which might enure to the \n\n[263 U.S. 78, 84]\n\u00a0\n city out of such a procedure could constitute a public use authorizing condemnation. The distinction between that case and this is that here we find that the removal of the town is a necessary step in the public improvement itself and is not sought to be justified only as a way for the United States to reduce the cost of the improvement by an outside land speculation.\n The remaining question in this case arises on the cross-writ of error of the United States, by which exception is taken to the court's having included in the judgment interest at 7 per cent. on the value of the property as found by the jury from the date of the issuing of the summons until the date of the judgment. The land remained in the possession of the owners up to the date of the judgment and they cultivated the land meantime and gathered crops therefrom.\n The District Court, in directing the jury, followed the law of the state (section 7415, Complied St. Idaho, 1919; section 5221, Revised Codes Idaho 1908) in which the land lay and the court was sitting, as follows:\n'For the purpose of assessing compensation and damages, the right thereto shall be deemed to have accrued at the date of the summons, and its actual value, at that date, shall be the measure of compensation for all property to be actually taken. ... No improvements put upon the property subsequent to the date of the service of summons shall be included in the assessment of compensation or damages.'\n\n The Idaho statute has been construed by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit to justify the court in adding interest upon the value fixed by the jury from the date of the summons until the judgment. Weiser Valley Land & Water Co. v. Ryan, 190 Fed. 417, 424, 111 C. C. A. 221, 228. The court said:\n'Having such right to compensation at a given time, it would seem that the owner ought to have interest upon \n\n[263 U.S. 78, 85]\n\u00a0\n the amount ascerained until paid. In the meanwhile he can claim nothing for added improvements, nor is he entitled to any advance that might affect the value of the property.'\n\n Counsel for the United States cite against such a ruling the case of Shoemaker v. United States, \n147 \nU.S. 282, 321\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 361, wherein, in a District of Columbia condemnation, there being no specific statute on the subject, it was held that no interest should be paid to the owner until the taking. The court said:\n'It is true that, by the institution of proceedings to condemn, the possession and enjoyment by the owner are to some extent interfered with. He can put no permanent improvements on the land, nor sell it, except subject to the condemnation proceedings. But the owner was in receipt of the rents, issues, and profits during the time occupied in fixing the amount to which he was entitled, and the inconveniences to which he was subjected by the delay are presumed to be considered and allowed for in fixing the amount of the compensation. Such is the rule laid down in cases of the highest authority.'\n\n This was followed in Bauman v. Ross, \n167 \nU.S. 548, 598\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 966, 985 (42 L. Ed. 270) in which Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for the court in reference to the validity of a statute providing for condemnation proceedings in the District of Columbia, said:\n'The payment of the damages to the owner of the land and the vesting of the title in the United States are to be contemporaneous. The Constitution does not require the damages to be actually paid at any earlier time; nor is the owner of the land entitled to interest pending the proceedings.'\n\n In these cases, the value found was at the time of taking or vesting of title, and the presumption indulged was that the valuation included the practical damage arising from the inability to sell or lease after the blight of the \n\n[263 U.S. 78, 86]\n\u00a0\n summons to condemn. Where the valuation is as of the date of the summons, however, no such elements can enter into it, and the allowance of interest from that time is presumably made to cover injury of this kind to the landowner pending the proceedings. It often happens that in the delays incident to condemnation suits the loss to the owner arising from the delay between the summons and the vesting of title by judgment is a serious one. The interest charge under the Idaho statute has the wholesome effect of stimulating the plaintiff in condemnation to prompt action. Moreover, the plaintiff may reduce to a minimum the rents and profits enjoyed by the defendant because under the Idaho statute the plaintiff may have a summary preliminary hearing before commissioners to fix probable damages, and by depositing the amount so fixed with the clerk of the court, if the defendant will not accept it, the plaintiff may obtain immediate possession. Within less than a month after bringing suit, he can thus appropriate to himself the rents and profits of the land, and in enjoyment of them can await the final judgment. Compiled Statutes Idaho 1919, vol. 2 ,  7420; Revised Codes Idaho 1908, vol. 2,  5226\n\n\n It is urged, however, that the federal conformity statute as to condemnation suits which directs federal courts to conform the practice and procedure 'as near as may be' to that of the courts of the state where the land is does not require or authorize the federal courts to allow interest to the property holder except according to the rule laid down in the Shoemaker Case, the Bauman Case, Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 299, 305\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 354, and United States v. Rogers, \n255 U.S. 163\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 281, in all of which interest was allowed only from the time of taking or vesting of title, that this is a matter of substance, which a conformity statute was not intended to cover, as appears from the language of the opinions in the last two cases. It will be observed, however, that in these two cases the \n\n[263 U.S. 78, 87]\n\u00a0\n allowance of interest did conform to the state statutes, and that this was given by the court as an additional reason for sustaining its conclusion. It is doubtless true that the conformity provision of the act of 1888 ( Comp. St.  6909, 6910) does not bind the federal courts to follow the state statute in the matter of interest. But the disposition of federal courts should be to adopt the local rule, if it is a fair one, and, as already indicated, we are not able to say that, with the value fixed as of the date of summons, and the opportunity afforded promptly, thereafter to take possession, interest allowed from the date of the summons is not a provision making for just compensation. North Coast Railroad Co. v. Aumiller, 61 Wash. 271, 274, 112 Pac. 384. In United States v. Sargent, 162 Fed. 81, 89 C. C. A. 81, the government condemned land in Minnesota for a post office. Under the statute of that state the hearing was before three commissioners, who were to report the damages sustained on account of the taking. Unless this resulted in payment and settlement, a hearing before a court or jury followed, and judgment was entered on that, and possession was given on payment of the judgment, which included costs and interest from the time of filing the commissioners' report. The commissioners' report was filed June 12, 1907, the report was confirmed August 19, 1907, and interest was allowed from June 12th until the date when the damages were paid into the registry of the court. The Circuit Court of Appeals thought the rule a fair one. Speaking by Judge Adams (162 Fed. 84, 89 C. C. A. 84), it said:\n'Considerable time may elapse after the commissioners fix the value of the land before it is ultimately paid for. They can only fix it as of the time they act. They cannot say what it will be at any indefinite time in the future. The value may for many reasons change, and the rental value may be materially affected by the tenure of the owner rendered uncertain by possible protracted litigation. Considerations like these doubtless \n\n[263 U.S. 78, 88]\n\u00a0\n prompted the Legislature of the state to provide that the amount of the award should bear interest until paid as the best and fairest available method of providing against the possible consequences just suggested. Without holding that the requirement for payment of interest is one of the 'modes of proceeding' which, by section 2 of the Act of August 1, 1888, is made compulsory upon the courts of the United States, we are satisfied to conform to it as a palpably fair and reasonable method of performing the indispensable condition to the exercise of the right of eminent domain, namely, of making 'just compensation' for the land as it stands, at the time of taking. 'The time of taking' under the Minnesota statute, supra, is when payment is made for it. ... It is better, when possible, to act in harmony rather than in conflict with the established policy of a state.'\n\n In the last opinion of this court on the question of interest in the appropriation of land by the United States, that in Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. United Stated, \n261 \nU.S. 299, 306\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 354, the case of United States v. Sargent and part of the language above quoted is cited with approval.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","29":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROWNLOW v. SCHWARTZ(1923)\nNo. 95\nArgued: January 16, 1923Decided: February 19, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. Robert L. Williams and F. H. Stephens, both of Washington, D. C., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. W. Gwynn Gardiner, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The defendant in error, petitioner below, on June 9, 1920, filed a petition in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, praying for a writ of mandamus against respondents requiring them to issue to her a permit to erect a building for business purposes on a lot situated on a residence street in Washington. Prior to filing the petition she made preparations to erect the building and applied to the building inspector for a permit, which he \n\n[261 U.S. 216, 217]\n\u00a0\n declined to issue, upon grounds not necessary to be stated here.\n The plaintiffs in error, respondents below, filed an answer to the petition and return to the rule to show cause, and to the answer a demurrer was interposed. On July 6, 1920, the demurrer was overruled, the rule to show cause discharged, and petition dismissed. Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals this judgment was, on February 7, 1921, reversed and the cause remanded, with directions to issue the writ as prayed. Schwartz v. Brownlow, 50 App. D. C. 279, 270 Fed. 1019. On March 19, 1921, an application for a rehearing was overruled, and on June 13th following, this writ of error was allowed.\n On March 14th, after the decision of the Court of Appeals, but before the allowance of the writ of error, the permit demanded by petitioner was issued by the building inspector, and thereupon the building was constructed. It had been fully completed when the writ of error was allowed. On June 2, 1921, petitioner conveyed all her interest in the property to persons not parties to this cause.\n It thus appears that there is now no actual controversy between the parties-no issue on the merits which this court can properly decide. The case has become moot for two reasons: (1) Because the permit, the issuance of which constituted the sole relief sought by petitioner, has been issued and the building to which it related has been completed; and (2) because, the first reason aside, petitioner no longer has an interest in the building, and therefore has no basis for maintaining the action.\n This court will not proceed to a determination when its judgment would be wholly ineffectual for want of a subject matter on which it could operate. An affirmance would ostensibly require something to be done which had already taken place. A reversal would ostensibly avoid an event which had already passed beyond recall. One would be as ain as the other. To adjudicate a cause \n\n[261 U.S. 216, 218]\n\u00a0\n which no longer exists is a proceeding which this court uniformly has declined to entertain. See Mills v. Green, \n159 U.S. 651\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 132; Codlin v. Kohlhausen, \n181 U.S. 151\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 584; Little v. Bowers, \n134 \nU.S. 547, 556\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 620; Singer Manufacturing Co. v.

Ct. 522.\n It is urged that the permit was issued by the inspector of buildings only because he believed it was incumbent upon him to comply with the judgment of the Court of Appeals and avoid even the appearance of disobeying it. The motive of the officer, so far as this question is concerned, is quite immaterial. We are interested only in the indisputable fact that his action, however induced, has left nothing to litigate. American Book Co. v. Kansas, supra. The case being moot, further proceedings upon the merits can neither be had here nor in the court of first instance. To dismiss the writ of error would leave the judgment of the Court of Appeals requiring the issuance of the mandamus in force-at least apparently so-notwithstanding the basis therefor has disappeared. Our action must, therefore dispose of the case, not merely of the appellate proceeding which brought it here. The practice now established by this court, under similar conditions and circumstances, is to reverse the judgment below and remand the case with directions to dismiss the bill, complaint, or petition. United States v. Hamburg-American Co., supra; Barry v. Davis, supra; Board of Public Utility Com'rs v. Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas, supra; Commercial Cable Co. v. Burleson, supra; Heitmuller v. Stokes, supra.\n Following these precedents, the judgment below should be reversed, with directions to the Court of Appeals to \n\n[261 U.S. 216, 219]\n\u00a0\n remand the cause to the Supreme Court, with instructions to dismiss the petition, without costs, because the controversy involved has become moot, and therefore is no longer a subject appropriate for judicial action.\n And it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","30":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRUSH ELECTRIC CO. v. CITY OF GALVESTON(1923)\nNo. 179\nArgued: Decided: June 4, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. William H. Armbrecht, of Mobile, Ala., Charles A. Frueauff, of New York City, and Terry, Cavin & Mills, of Galveston, Tex., for appellant.\n Messrs. James W. Wayman and Frank S. Anderson, both of Galveston, Tex ., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant for many years has been operating an electric light and power plant in the city of Galveston, \n\n[262 U.S. 443, 444]\n\u00a0\n under a franchise reserving to the city the right to regulate rates.\n In 1918 an ordinance was enacted increasing the rates then in force. By a subsequent ordinance, passed in 1919, these 1918 rates were decreased.\n The present suit was brought by appellant in the federal District court for the Southern District of Texas to enjoin the enforcement of these ordinances, and especially that of 1919, on the ground that the rates fixed thereby were confiscatory. In 1920 the case was referred to a master who heard the evidence and made a report, in which he determined that the rates of 1919 were confiscatory and that those of 1918 were not. To this report both parties filed exceptions. These filed by the appellant were overruled by the District Court, while those of the appellee were, with two exceptions, sustained. The questions presented are numerous, but, in view of the conclusion we have reached, we do not consider it necessary to review them in detail.\n The parties stipulated, and the master found, that the then undepreciated value of the physical property, at January 1, 1920, prices, was $784,689, and that the cost of the physical property at average pre- war prices, undepreciated, as of January 1, 1920, was $576,898. The master found the former amount, after deducting the value of real estate, office and utility equipment, and depreciation, represented the depreciated value of the depreciable property for rate-making purposes, following the principle established by this court. See Missou i ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Comm., \n262 U.S. 276\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 544, 67 L. Ed. --, decided May 21, 1923, and cases cited.\n The testimony as to depreciation was conflicting and speculative-the estimates ranging from 15 per cent. to 40 per cent. of the value of the plant. The master fixed it at 28 per cent., making the present depreciated value of the depreciable property $534,818. To this he added the value of various \n\n[262 U.S. 443, 445]\n\u00a0\n items, including intangible property, real estate, and office and utility equipment, bringing the total up to $800,000. This he held to be the fair present value of the property. Upon this valuation he recommended an annual return of 8 per cent. and an annual rate for depreciation of 4 1\/2 per cent. The gross earnings for the year ending July 31, 1920, which arose from the application of the rates fixed by the ordinance of 1918, were $333,079.65, which left, after deductions for expenses of operation and maintenance, net earnings of more than $104,000, or over $4,000 in excess of a reasonable and fair return. He estimated that under the rates fixed by the 1919 ordinance the net earnings would have been only $77,665, or over $22,000 less than a fair and reasonable return. The 1919 rates, however, have never been put into operation, and appellant has continued to operate under the 1918 rates.\n The District Judge did not agree with the master's findings, but substituted no base value of his own, because of his conclusion that the injunction should be denied--\n'on the ground that the ordinance has had no test, and that in my view, taking the master's base, the ordinance is still not confiscatory, it will not be necessary for me to hazard a guess as to what value ought to be taken, since I feel sure that before the precise valuation of the plant by me can become important, conditions of prices and values will have settled down to such a definite and permanent basis, as that there will be no difficulty in reaching a proper price basis to apply on any future adjustment in or out of court.'\n\n The lower court accepted the master's estimate of 8 per cent. upon the value as a fair rate of return, but fixed 4 per cent., instead of 4 1\/2 per cent., as a fair rate for annual depreciation. In sustaining certain of the appellee's exceptions, it held that the master's allowance for some items should be decreased and in other instances disallowed. Instead of 28 per cent. for past depreciation, the court fixed 33 1\/3 per cent., and provisionally \n\n[262 U.S. 443, 446]\n\u00a0\n determined that the total fair valuation of the plant for rate-making purposes was $612,000. Upon this valuation, the estimated net earnings under the rates fixed by the 1919 ordinance was shown to be in excess of a fair return to the extent of over $21,000. The estimated amount of income under the 1919 rates is based on the amount of business done under the 1918 rates, and consequently is largely a matter of prophecy. An actual test of these rates may result in a larger return, by bringing about an increase of business. The conclusion of the court that the temporary restraining order theretofore granted should be dissolved, the injunction prayed for refused, and, at the option of appellant, the bill dismissed without prejudice, or passed to the suspense docket, 'with leave to again call the matter up after a trial of the ordinance, or before trial, should unusual and extraordinary conditions occur, making it imperative to save complainant's property from confiscation,' under the circumstances disclosed by the record, commends itself to our judgment.\n The evidence is so conflicting, and the conclusion to be drawn therefrom in respect of this or that item so uncertain and speculative, that we do not feel warranted in disturbing the findings of the court below, in the absence of an actual test under the new rates. If hereafter it can be shown that the returns afforded are confiscatory, appellant will be free to make another application for relief. Knoxville v. Water Co., \n212 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 29 S. Sup.

Flynn, Streeter B. Flynn, and Robert M. Rainey, all of Oklahoma City, Okl., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Benjamin Martin, Jr., of Muskogee, Okl., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action by an Indian allottee to recover for a wrongful occupancy and use of his land.\n The plaintiff was an adult Cherokee Indian of the full blood, enrolled and recognized as a member of the tribe and still a ward of the United States. The land was an 80-acre tract which had been allotted to him in the division of the tribal lands-40 acres as a homestead and the remainder as surplus land. He had full title, but his power to alien or lease was subject to restrictions imposed by Congress for his protection. By three successive instruments, each given for a cash rental of $75, he leased the land, both homestead and surplus, to the defendants for agricultural purposes. The first lease was given late in 1915 for a term of one year, beginning January 1, 1916; the second was given early in July, 1916, for a term of one year, beginning January 1, 1917; and the third was given late in July, 1917, for a term of one year, beginning January 1, 1918. The defendants went into possession under the leases, and in 1917 and 1918 sublet the land to others. From the subletting the defendants realized $890.40 in 1917, and $384.35 in 1918, these sums representing the actual rental value on a crop-sharing basis in those years.\n The action was begun in 1919, on the theory that the leases were made in violation of the restrictions imposed \n\n[263 U.S. 250, 252]\n\u00a0\n by Congress, and therefore were wholly void. At first a recovery was sought for all three years, but afterwards the claim for 1916 was dropped. On the trial the court treated the leases for 1917 and 1918 as void, but ruled that the plaintiff had waived the invalidity of the lease for 1917 by not promptly objecting to any occupancy or use under it, and so could not recover for that year. A recovery was had for 1918 of a sum conforming to what the defendants had realized from the subletting for that year, with interest. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court of the state, and it reversed the judgment, with a direction that no recovery be allowed for either year. 85 Okl. 38, 204 Pac. 119. That court treated the leases for both years as void, but construed and applied a statute of the state as in effect requiring that the leases be regarded as creating a tenancy at will and controlling the amount which the plaintiff was entitled to demand and receive. This was done over his objection that the state statute, so construed and applied, was in conflict with the congressional restrictions, and therefore was invalid. The plaintiff prosecutes this writ of error. Upon his petition a writ of certiorari was granted (\n260 U.S. 716\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 94), but as it appears that the writ of error was well grounded the writ of certiorari will be dismissed.\n The power of Congress to impose restrictions on the right of Indian wards of the United States to alien or lease lands allotted to them in the division of the lands of their tribe is beyond question, and of course it is not competent for a state to enact or give effect to a local statute which disregards those restrictions or thwarts their purpose. Tiger v. Western Investment Co., \n221 \nU.S. 286, 316\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 578; Monson v. Simonson, \n231 \nU.S. 341, 347\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 71; Brader v. James, \n246 \nU.S. 88, 96\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 285; Mullen v. Pickens, \n250 \nU.S. 590, 595\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 31\n\n\n An examination of the several enactments by which Congress has restricted the leasing of Cherokee allotments \n\n[263 U.S. 250, 253]\n\u00a0\n for agricultural purposes1 discloses that when the leases in question were given the situation was as follows:\n\n\n (1)\n An adult allottee of the full blood could lease the homestead for not exceeding one year, and the surplus for not exceeding five years, without any approval of the lease, but could not lease for longer periods without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.\n\n\n (2)\n Any lease not permitted by the restrictions was to be 'absolutely null and void.'\n The permission given to lease for limited periods without approval was not intended to authorize the making of leases which were to begin at relatively distant times in the future, but only the making of such as were to take effect in possession immediately or, what was equally within the spirit of the permission, on the termination of an existing lease then about to expire. United States v. Noble, \n237 \nU.S. 74, 82\n, 83 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 532. And see Dowell v. Dew, 1 Younge & Collier's N. C. 345, 357; same case on appeal, 7 Jurist, 117.\n It is conceded, and we think rightly so, that the leases for 1917 and 1918 fell outside the permission given. Both covered the homestead as well as the surplus land; both were made midway during the term of a like lease theretofore given, and were to take effect in possession on the expiration of that lease, and neither was approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Being outside the permission, they were, as declared in the restricting provision, 'absolutely null and void.'\n Obviously a lease which Congress, in the exertion of its power over land allotted to an Indian ward, pronounces absolutely viod cannot be validated or given any force by a state, and a state statute which requires that such a \n\n[263 U.S. 250, 254]\n\u00a0\n lease be regarded as effective for any purpose is necessarily invalid in that respect. Monson v. Simonson, supra; Mullen v. Pickens, supra.\n The Supreme Court of the State, although recognizing the invalidity of the leases under the congressional restrictions, construed and applied a statute of the state (section 3783, Rev. Laws 1910) as in effect requiring that the leases be regarded as creating a tenancy at will and controlling the compensation which the allottee could demand and the defendants should pay for the occupancy and use of the land. We of course must treat the local statute as intended to operate as that court say it does, and must determine its validity on that basis. In that view of it, we think the conclusion is unavoidable that it gives force and effect to leases which a valid enactment of Congress declares shall be of no force or effect, and that in this respect it must be held invalid under article 6, cl. 2, of the Constitution of the United States.\n The state court was persuaded that its conclusion had support in decisions dealing with leases made between parties entirely competent to make them, but not executed in conformity with local laws, such as the statute of frauds. But decisions of that class are not apposite. These leases were made in violation of a congressional prohibition. They were not merely voidable at the election of the allottee, but absolutely void and not susceptible of ratification by him. Nothing passed under them and none of their provisions could be taken as a standard by which to measure the compensation to which the allottee was entitled for the unauthorized occupancy and use of his land.\n It is not our province to inquire particularly into the need for the protection intended to be afforded by the restrictions, but, if it were, the need would find strong illustration in this case; for it appears that each of the leases was obtained for a cash rental of $75, and that when \n\n[263 U.S. 250, 255]\n\u00a0\n the time arrived for assuming possession under them the defendants readily sublet the land on terms which netted them $890.40 in 1917 and $384.35 in 1918, the latter year being one of pronounced drought.\n Judgment reversed on writ of error.\n Writ of certiorari dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of July 1, 1902, c. 1375,  72, 32 Stat. 716, 726; Act April 26, 1906, c. 1876,  19 and 20, 34 Stat. 137, 144; Act May 27, 1908, c. 199 ,  and 5, 35 Stat. 812. \n\n\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBUTTERS v. CITY OF OAKLAND(1923)\nNo. 16\nArgued: Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. C. Irving Wright and J. E. Manders, both of San Francisco, Cal., for plaintiffs in error. \n\n[263 U.S. 162, 163]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James A. Johnson, of Oakland, Cal., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiffs in error brought suit to restrain the defendants from making or recording an assessment of improvement taxes against plaintiffs' properties, made under the provisions of the Improvement Act of 1911. California Statutes 1911, pp. 730-769. The improvement consists of certain street grading in the city of Oakland, together with various structures, such as culverts, etc., in connection therewith.\n The authority to order such improvements is vested by the statute in the city council, which before making an order, must pass a resolution of intention to do so, setting forth specified details. In a case such as is here presented, the council may delimit the district to be benefited and make the expense chargeable upon it. Public notice of the contemplated improvement is to be given, and, within stated times thereafter, the owner of any assessable property may protest in writing against either the proposed work or the extent of the district to be assessed, or both. Such protest must be heard and passed upon by the council and 'its decision shall be final and conclusive.' If the protest be denied, the council may order the proposed improvement. Provision is made for inviting bids and awarding and making contracts therefor and for reviewing the proceedings at the instance of any interested person. Where the cost of the improvement is to be assessed against a district, diagrams of the property benefited must be made, showing each separate lot, piece or parcel of land, its area, relative location, etc. Thereupon the superintendent of streets must estimate the benefit to be received by each of such parcels of land \n\n[263 U.S. 162, 164]\n\u00a0\n 'In proportion to the estimated benefits to be received by each,' and thereafter an assessment to cover the same is made. Any person interested may appeal to the city council in respect of these and prior proceedings, including the question of the correctness or legality of the assessment. The decision of the city council thereon is made final and conclusive as to all persons entitled to appeal.\n The trial court found the issues of fact and of law against plaintiffs and entered judgment accordingly, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for the First Appellate District. 53 Cal. App. 294, 200 Pac. 354. A petition to have the cause heard in the state Supreme Court was denied, and it comes here by writ of error to the District Court of Appeal. The federal question raised in the court below and presented here is that the state statute and the assessment against plaintiffs' properties offend against the federal Constitution in that the one arbitrarily authorizes and the other arbitrarily imposes a tax upon plaintiff's properties for local improvement in excess of the benefits received and without providing for resulting damages, and thereby they are deprived of their property without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Several grounds are urged in support of this contention, which we consider in their order.\n\n 1. \nPlaintiffs in error content that the assessment was not in proportion to the benefits because certain property, also benefited by the improvement, was omitted from the district. Without reviewing the circumstances said to establish this contention, it is enough to say that the municipal authorities were empowered to establish the district benefited and to assess the tax in proportion to the benefits. Ample provision is made for a hearing and a hearing was accorded. There is nothing to justify the conclusion that the authorities acted arbitrarily or \n\n[263 U.S. 162, 165]\n\u00a0\n fraudulently. The assessment was reviewed upon appeal by the city council, and that body, after a hearing, altered it in some particulars, and caused a new warrant of assessment to be issued. Its action, under the statute, was final and conclusive and is not open to attack in this proceeding. Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley, \n164 U.S. 112\n, 167-170, 175, 17 Sup. Ct. 56; Hibben v. Smith, \n191 U.S. 310\n, 321-323, 24 Sup. Ct. 88; Jelliff v. Newark, 48 N. J. Law, 101, 109, 2 Atl. 627; Embree v. Kansas City, etc., Road District, \n240 U.S. 242\n, 247- 249, 36 Sup. Ct. 317.\n\n 2. \nUpon review by the city council deductions were made from the amounts assessed upon certain areas included within the district and a sum equal to the aggregate thereof was distributed over and assessed upon the entire district, resulting in some increase in the assessment upon plaintiffs' properties. It is urged that this establishes, to the extent of the increase, that the assessment was arbitrary, and not according to benefits. The Supreme Court of California in another case, involving the same assessment has held otherwise. Rockridge Place Co. v. City Council, 178 Cal. 58, 62, 63, 172 Pac. 1110. The whole matter seems to have been fully heard and carefully considered by the city council and its adjustment upon the basis that the assessment upon some property within the district was too high and that upon the remainder too low cannot be upset merely because the aggregate amount deducted from the one coincides with that applied upon the other, since the council after a full hearing, expressly found that the assessment as finally made was in accordance with the benefits. It is impossible for us to say that the property assessed did not receive an additional benefit to the extent of the amount thus proportionately distributed. The determination of the council is so largely a matter of opinion that in the absence of convincing evidence of error it will not be disturbed. See Jelliff v. \n\n[263 U.S. 162, 166]\n\u00a0\n Newark, supra; Walker et al. v. City of Aurora, 140 Ill. 402, 411, 29 N. E. 741; Sanitary District v. Joliet, 189 Ill. 270, 272, 59 N. E. 566; State, Pudney, pros. v. Village of Passaic, 37 N. J. Law, 65, 67, 68.\n\n 3. \nPlaintiffs insist that the order directing the improvement in question is invalid because no provision is made for the ascertainment and adjustment of damages occasioned to abutting owners by a change of grade. As construed by the state Supreme Court the statute simply authorizes the collection of the assessment, but does not interfere with the right of a taxpayer whose property may be injured thereby to receive compensation or to enjoin the doing of the work until it is ascertained and paid. 53 Cal. App. 299, 200 Pac. 354; Wilcox v. Engebretsen, 160 Cal. 288, 298, 299, 116 Pac. 750. We must accept this construction. Two of this plaintiffs, in fact, availed themselves of this remedy and recovered damages against the city.\n\n 4. \nThe statute provides that the expense of the work may be chargeable upon the district which the city council declares to be benefited by the improvement, and that such cost shall be assessed upon the several lots in the district 'in proportion to the estimated benefits to be received by each'; and it is urged by plaintiffs that the cost may exceed the benefits, in which event the proportionate assessment of the estimated benefits may, in fact, be greater than the actual benefits received. We are not impressed with his contention. It is not unreasonable to assume that ordinarily the cost of street grading and paving, within municipalities such as this statute deals with, will not exceed the benefits which the adjoining land owners will receive, and it is neither alleged nor proven that it has in fact done so in the present case. The method of assessment provided for is an old and familiar one and embodies a principle too well established to be overturned by the suggestion of a theoretical possibility that there may not be an exact and mathematical relation between cost and benefit in particular instances.

Carrigan, of Wichita Falls, Tex., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. W. B. Jaynes, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A statute of Texas (R. S. 1911, c. 11, arts. 1006-1007) empowered the city of Olney to lay sidewalks and to assess the cost against abutting property and owners. The city ordered the construction of sidewalks in front of four lots owned by plaintiff in error. An ordinance was passed making the cost of sidewalks a lien against abutting property, and providing for 20 days' notice to the owner, before charging such cost personally against him or as a lien upon his property. Plaintiff in \n\n[262 U.S. 352, 353]\n\u00a0\n error was given notice in compliance with the statute and ordinance. He failed to appear or make objection to the assessment.\n The statute provides that any property owner against whom or whose property such assessment has been made may within 20 days bring suit in any court having jurisdiction to set aside or correct the same or any proceeding with reference thereto, on account of any error or invalidity therein; but thereafter he may not question the validity of such proceeding or assessment. No suit was brought by the plaintiff in error. The city issued its assessment certificate, declaring the cost of the sidewalks, $89.32, a charge agains him and against the lots.\n The statute further provides that if any such certificate shall recite that the proceedings have been regularly had, and that all prerequisites to the fixing of the assessment lien and personal liability have been complied with, it shall be prima facie evidence of the facts so recited. The certificate contained these recitals. Plaintiff in error failed to pay, and the city brought suit in justice court. He answered in substance that the city had no ordinance authorizing the assessment, that it had not complied with the statute, and was therefore without authority to invoke it, and that its acts and conduct in making the assessment constituted a taking of his property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. He contended that there should have been a specific ordinance concerning this sidewalk and assessment.\n The justice of the peace gave judgment in favor of plaintiff in error. The city appealed to the county court. At the trial, it offered the assessment certificate in evidence and rested. Plaintiff in error offered to prove that no ordinance had been passed relative to the laying of this particular sidewalk, that he received the notice to appear, and went to the meeting place of the city council, and that the council had adjourned. He did not offer \n\n[262 U.S. 352, 354]\n\u00a0\n to prove any fact excusing his failure to appear before adjournment, or that he was denied a hearing. The county court found for the city. Its order denying a motion for a new trial recites that it is the highest appellate court to which the cause can be taken in the state of Texas because the amount involved is less than $100. The county judge allowed a writ of error bringing the case here.\n The judgment of that court necessarily determines that the state laws were complied wity. Unless a federal right is involved, the state court's application of local laws will not be reviewed here. Hallinger v. Davis, \n146 \nU.S. 314, 319\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 105; Peters v.

PITTSBURGH & WEST VIRGINIA COAL CO.(1923)\nNo. 72\nArgued: Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 244, 245]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles R. Hickox, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Messrs. Thomas F. Barrett, of Clarksburg, W. Va., and Theodore Kiendl, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves an adjudication in bankruptcy made under an involuntary petition which was opposed by intervening creditors.\n In February, 1921, three of the respondents, the Pittsburgh & West Virginia Coal Company and two other coal companies, filed in a Federal District Court in New York a petition for the involuntary bankruptcy of the Diamond Fuel Company, alleging that it was insolvent and had committed an act of bankruptcy within four months prior thereto, and that they were creditors having provable claims against it. The petition was regular and sufficient on its face. The Fuel Company answered, denying that it was insolvent or had committed an act of bankruptcy, or that the Pittsburgh Company, one of the petitioners, was its creditor and had a provable claim against it.\n In September, 1921, more than nine months after the date of the alleged act of bankruptcy, before any further proceedings had been had other than the appointment of a receiver, two other creditors of the Fuel Company by leave of the court intervened in the proceeding and joined as \n\n[263 U.S. 244, 246]\n\u00a0\n petitioning creditors in the petition for bankruptcy. Eleven days thereafter the present petitioners, the Canute Steamship Co., Ltd., and Compania Naviera Sota y Aznar, hereinafter called the opposing creditors, being creditors of the Fuel Company claiming to have acquired a lien upon its funds by attachment proceedings instituted within four months before the filing of the original petition, by leave of the court likewise intervened in the proceeding in opposition to the petition for bankruptcy, and filed answers denying its averments in like manner as in the answer of the Fuel Company.\n On the hearing before the District Court on pleadings and proof, the Fuel Company withdrew its answer and consented to an adjudication. The case was then heard on the issues raised by the answers of the opposing creditors. The District Judge intimating, but not determining, that by reason of certain matters not necessary to be recited, the opposing creditors were estopped from denying that the Pittsburgh Company was a creditor, held that, independently of this question, any defect of parties which might otherwise have resulted was cured by the joinder of the two intervening creditors having valid claims; and, finding that the allegations of the petition for bankruptcy were otherwise sustained by the proof, an order was entered adjudging the Fuel Company a bankrupt. Upon appeal by the opposing creditors, the Circuit Court of Appeals, assuming, but not deciding, that the Pittsburgh Company was not a creditor, nevertheless affirmed the order of adjudication on the ground that the question of its claim was immaterial in view of the joinder of the intervening petitioners supplying the requisite number of creditors. In re Diamond Fuel Co., 283 Fed. 108.\n The opposing creditors contend that this was error upon the ground that under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act (30 Stat. 544 [Comp. St.  9585-9656]), the petition in bankruptcy could not properly be sustained except upon a finding that the Pitts burgh \n\n[263 U.S. 244, 247]\n\u00a0\n Company was a creditor of the Fuel Company having a provable claim against it, so as to make up the required number of three original petitioners entitled to maintain the petition; and that, in the absence of such finding, this lack could not be cured by the joinder of the other petitioning creditors more than four months after the commission of the act of bankruptcy.\n The pertinent provisions of the Act are these: Section 3b (section 9587) provides that a petition may be filed against a person who is insolvent and has committed an act of bankruptcy within the preceding four months; Section 59b (section 9643), that three or more creditors who have provable claims against any person of a specified aggregate amount-or if all the creditors of such person are less than twelve in number, then one of such creditors whose claim equals the specified amount-may file a petition to have him adjudged a bankrupt; and Section 59f, that\n'Creditors other than original petitioners may at any time enter their appearance and join in the petition, or file an answer and be heard in opposition to the prayer of the petition.'\n\n It was not averred in the petition for bankruptcy that the creditors of the Fuel Company were less than twelve in number; nor is this claimed. And no question is made as to the aggregate amount of the claims involved.\n The argument in behalf of the opposing creditors is, in effect, that under Section 3b a petition for involuntary bankruptcy must be filed within four months after the commission of the act of bankruptcy; that under Section 59b, unless the creditors are less than twelve in number, to give the court jurisdiction the petition must be filed by not less than three creditors having provable claims; and that where less than three of the original petitioners are in fact such creditors, the joinder in the petition more than four months after the commission of the act of bankruptcy of intervening creditors having such claims, is in substance an amendment of the original petition, equiva lent \n\n[263 U.S. 244, 248]\n\u00a0\n to the filing of a new petition, which does not validate the original petition ab initio or authorize an adjudication of bankruptcy to be made under it based upon an act of bankruptcy committed more than four months before the requisite number of creditors entitled to maintain it had become petitioners.\n However, the filing of a petition, sufficient upon its face, by three petitioners alleging that they are creditors holding provable claims of the requisite amount, the insolvency of the defendant and the commission of an act of bankruptcy within the preceding four months, clearly gives the bankruptcy court jurisdiction of the proceeding. Re New York Tunnel Co ., 166 Fed. 284, 285, 92 C. C. A. 202; Re Bolognesi, 223 Fed. 771, 772, 139 C. C. A. 351. And while, under Section 59b, as held in Cutler v. Ring Co. (C. C. A.), 264 Fed. 836, 838, it is indispensable to the maintenance of the petition that the existence of three petitioners holding provable claims be established, if challenged, the argument in behalf of the opposing creditors erroneously assumes that these must be three original petitioners, and fails to give due weight to the plain provisions of Section 59f supplementing and modifying the provisions of Section 59b in this respect. Section 59f provides in unambiguous language that creditors other than the original petitioners may 'at any time' enter their appearance and 'join in the petition.' The right thus conferred is not limited to the period of four months after the commission of the act of bankruptcy alleged in the petition, either expressly or by implication; the only limitations as to point of time being those necessarily implied, that, on the one hand, the petition cannot be joined in after it has been dismissed and is no longer pending, and that, on the other hand, it must be joined in before the adjudication is made. Such intervention by other creditors is not an amendment to the original petition or equivalent to the filing of a new petition, but is, in the specific language of the act, a \n\n[263 U.S. 244, 249]\n\u00a0\n 'joining in' the original petition itself. And other creditors thus joining in the original petition necessarily acquire the status of petitioning creditors as of the date on which the original petition was filed, and may thereafter avail themselves of its allegations, including those relating to the commission of the act of bankruptcy, as fully as if they had been original petitioners.\n We therefore conclude that where a petition for involuntary bankruptcy is sufficient on its face, alleging that the three petitioners are creditors holding provable claims and containing all the averments essential to its maintenance, other creditors having provable claims who intervene in the proceeding and join in the petition at any time during its pendency before an adjudication is made, after as well as before the expiration of four months from the alleged act of bankruptcy, are to be counted at the hearing in determining whether there are three petitioning creditors qualified to maintain the petition, it being immaterial in such case whether the three qualified creditors joined in the petition originally or by intervention.\n The decisions in the Circuit Courts of Appeals and District Courts are to this effect: Re Stein, 105 Fed. 749, 45 C. C. A. 29; Re Bolognesi, supra, 223 Fed. 773, 139 C. C. A. 351; Re Romanow (D. C.) 92 Fed. 510; Re Mammouth Lumber Co. (D. C.) 109 Fed. 308; Re Mackey (D. C.) 110 Fed. 355; Re Charles Town Light Co.

In the Despres Case the original petition had been dismissed and the intervening creditors did not join in it but filed a new petition; 'property acquired by bequest,' within Act. used in the opinion, it was obviously not intended to modify or overrule the prior decision of the same court in First State Bank v. Haswell, supra, which was cited with approval (213 Fed. 192, 129 C. C. A. 534). And in the Trammell Case other creditors were not permitted to reopen a proceeding in which the original petition had been dismissed, as being not an intervention in a pending proceeding but the institution of a new one.\n The question, upon which the decisions show a conflict of opinion, as to the joinder of an intervening creditor in an original petition insufficient upon its face, is not here involved and is not determined.\n Finding, for the foregoing reasons, no error in the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, it is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","35":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHARLES A RAMSAY CO. v.

J., for plaintiffs in error.[ Charles a Ramsay Co v. Associated Bill Posters of U S and Canada \n260 U.S. 501\n (1923) ]\n\n\n[260 U.S. 501, 505]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Richard T. Greene, of New York City, for defendants in error.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 501, 509]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are separate actions for treble damages under the Sherman Act ( Comp. St.  8820 et seq.). The plaintiffs are distinct corporations and demand different sums; otherwise their complaints are identical. Holding no cause of action was stated, the trial court dismissed both complaints upon demurrer, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this action. 271 Fed. 140. It will suffice to state the substance of the pertinent allegations.\n Plaintiffs were solicitors of advertising for customers in many States. They prepared, designed, purchased and sold posters and caused them to be displayed by local operators in many cities and towns throughout the United States and Canada. They contracted with their customers and received pay for the entire service of preparing, designing, purchasing and posting the advertisements and were engaged in interstate commerce.\n Defendants are a New York corporation and its officers and directors, together with certain favored solicitors.\n Advertising by posters has become common, and in most of the larger cities and towns throughout this country and Canada one or more local concerns follow the business of displaying them. Usually advertisers contract with a lithographer directly or through agents (solicitors), such as plaintiffs, for the manufacture or purchase of posters, and with the local billposter for displaying them. Often the lithographer does business in a different state from the advertiser and both operate in different states from those where most of the billboards are located. Some posters are prepared for the exclusive use of an advertiser and some ('stock' or 'sample' ones) for general use. Nearly all are put out by six or eight lithographers. \n\n[260 U.S. 501, 510]\n\u00a0\n In 1891 many billposters throughout the United States and Canada, theretofore in competition, entered into a combination and conspiracy to monopolize the business in their respective localities and to dominate and control all trade and commerce in posters within such limits. To that end they organized a voluntary association-afterwards incorporated-whose membership is now very large.\n The following were among the means adopted for carrying out the purposes of the combination and conspiracy: (a) Membership has been restricted to one employing billposter in each town or city and members have been prohibited from competing with each other. (b) Funds have been furnished to members for buying out competitors. (c) Rules prevent members accepting certain work form an advertiser who has given business to a nonmember. (d) A schedule of prices has been fixed and members have been prohibited from accepting certain kinds of work from any one except solicitors (twelve in all) arbitrarily selected and licensed, who are forbidden to patronize a nonmember in any place where any member does business. (e) By threats of withdrawal of patronage, manufacturers have been prevented from furnishing posters to independent billposters or to advertisers desiring to do business with independents except upon prohibitive terms.\n The association's membership has become large, its powers and influence great, while the number of independent billposters has greatly declined, and it is now practically impossible for an advertiser to utilize posters except by employing members of the association and upon terms arbitrarily fixed. Advertisers are not permitted to purchase 'stock' posters, unless willing to have them displayed upon boards of members, and independent billposters cannot purchase such matter at all.\n Plaintiffs had developed a lucrative and profitable business when in July, 1911, the association canceled their \n\n[260 U.S. 501, 511]\n\u00a0\n licenses and refused to renew the same. Now, as a result of the defendants' unlawful acts, they are disabled from competing in the markets and their business is restricted and unprofitable.\n The court below held:\n'The business of the solicitors is to send their customers' advertisements to be posted on billboards in various towns and cities throughout the country. Assuming that this business is, as between them and their customers, interstate commerce, we are clear that, after the posters have arrived at destination, the posting of them by the bill posters is a purely local service, not directly affecting, but merely incidental to, interstate commerce. We think this follows from the decision of the Supreme Court in Hopkins v. United States, \n171 U.S. 578\n.'\n\n We cannot accept this view. The alleged combination is nation-wide; members of the association are bound by agreement to pursue a certain course of business designed and probably adequate materially to interfere with the free flow of commerce among the states and with Canada. As a direct result of the defendants' joint acts, plaintiff's interstate and foreign business has been greatly limited or destroyed. Hopkins v. United States, \n171 U.S. 578\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 40, is not applicable. There the holding was that the rules, regulations and practices of the association directly affected local business only. The purpose of the combination here challenged is to destroy competition and secure a monopoly by limiting and restricting commerce in posters to channels dictated by the confederates, to exclude from such trade the undesired, including the plaintiffs, and to enrich the members by demanding noncompetitive prices. The allegations clearly show the result has been as designed, that the statute has been violated and plaintiff's business has suffered.\n This court has heretofore laid down and adequately discussed the applicable principles.

Associated Bill Posters %(d. c.) 235 f\/ed. 540. The fundamental purpose of the Sherman Act was to secure equality of opportunity and to protect the public against evils commonly incident to destruction of competition through monopolies and combinations in restraint of trade. The alleged actions of defendants are directly opposed to this beneficent purpose and are denounced by the statute.\n We find no adequate support for the claim that plaintiffs were parties to the combination of which they now complain.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","36":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHARLES NELSON CO. v. U S(1923)\nNo. 287\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. C. Prentiss, of Washington, D. C., and Wm. E. Humphrey, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims dismissing the petition of the plaintiff, the Charles Nelson Company, after a hearing of the evidence and upon findings made. The plaintiff was the lowest and accepted bidder upon advertised solicitation of the Navy \n\n[261 U.S. 17, 18]\n\u00a0\n Department for the furnishing and delivery of lumber at the Puget Sound Navy Yard for a period ending December 31, 1917. This suit is to recover the sum of $20,321.33, the amount with interest of the difference between the market value and the price bid upon what the plaintiff claims was an unjust excess over and above the amount of lumber it should have delivered and that which at the insistence of the Nevy Department it did deliver.\n The bids were opened January 3, 1917. The contract was signed February 23, 1917. Thereby the plaintiff agreed to furnish and deliver f. o. b. alongside wharf navy yard, Puget Sound, lumber of certain kinds in such quantities and at such times during the period ending December 31, 1917, as the supply officer of the Navy might direct. 'All deliveries to be made promptly and orders of 50,000 ft. b. m. or less of assorted sizes, not more than 10,000 ft. b. m. of any one size except with the consent of the contractor, must be delivered within ten days after receipt of order. All other orders must be delivered within 25 days after date of receipt of order from he supply officer.' The contract contained this provision which was evidently taken from the form of bids solicited:\n'It shall be distinctly understood and agreed that it is the intention of the contract that the contractor shall furnish and deliver any quantities of Douglas fir which may be ordered for the naval service of the place named during the period ending December 31, 1917, irrespective of the estimated quantity named, the government not being obligated to order any specific quantity of Douglas fir contracted for.'\n\n Then follows:\n'Class 5 (Continued).\n\n'Stock Classification No. 39.\n\n'Fir, Douglas, as follows:\n\n'1. 1,675,000 feet b. m. (about), of such sizes or grades as may be ordered-per M feet.' \n\n[261 U.S. 17, 19]\n\u00a0\n The Navy Department on orders placed by it before December 31, 1917, received from the plaintiff 3,688,259 feet b. m. of Douglas fir. The amount furnished above 1,675,000 feet was worth at market price, delivered at the navy yard, $18,310.21 more than the plaintiff was paid therefor at the prices bid and accepted.\n\n After the execution of the contract and as a development of the World War the government entered upon the building of submarine chasers at this navy yard, a type of vessel never before built there, and much of the lumber required of the plaintiff under its contract was used in the construction of these vessels.\n The plaintiff denies that the writing signed by it was a binding contract, because there was no mutuality of obligation. The government answers this by citing the case of United States v. Purcell Envelope Co., \n249 U.S. 313\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 300. In that case the Post Office Department invited bids--\n'for furnishing stamped envelopes and newspaper wrappers in such quantities as may be called for by the department during a period of four years, beginning on the first day of October, 1898.'\n\n The bid of the Purcell Company was accepted. The formal contract was signed by the Company and bond given. Subsequently the Postmaster General refused to sign this contract, and bought the envelopes and wrappers elsewhere. This court held that the acceptance of the bid made the contract, that the words above quoted must be construed to mean that the company should furnish all the envelopes and wrappers of the specified sizes which the department would need during the four years' period, and that the government was as much bound to take the envelopes and wrappers as the bidder was bound to furnish them. Heavy damages for the breach of the contract were awarded against the United States. But it is to be observed that there was in the contract or invitation for bids no express denial of the obligation of the Post Office \n\n[261 U.S. 17, 20]\n\u00a0\n Department to take the envelopes in that case, so that the question of a lack of mutuality did not arise in the Purcell Case as it does here.\n But we are not obliged definitely to pass upon the question whether the instrument relied on by the government constituted a contract binding on the plaintiff for the whole amount ordered at the price bid, because under the findings of the Court of Claims, the plaintiff must be held to have waived any right to claim more than the price it bid for any part of the lumber it furnished.\n The findings show that the plaintiff did not furnish the lumber itself but relied on two so-called subsidiary companies to do so. The manager of one of the companies, the Crown Company, was Scott. He was also a stockholder and officer in the plaintiff. Scott received an order for 1, 675,000 feet b. m. of lumber from the plaintiff to be delivered to the navy yard. In May, there was delay in deliveries by the Crown Company of which the navy yard commandant made complaint to the plaintiff by telegram, to which plaintiff replied referring the commandant to Scott. Having delivered 950,000 feet, and accepted orders in addition thereto of 1,186, 000 feet, Scott on May 21st, wrote to the navy yard supply officer calling attention to the fact that the orders received unfilled were for 1 186,000 feet whereas there were only 725,000 feet due on the original contract for 1,675,000 feet, and asking him to say which of the orders he wished to withdraw. It appeared that Scott was not then advised of the terms of the contract. The supply officer replied quoting from the contract the clause quoted above, refusing to withdraw any orders and insisting on fulfillment of all orders issued and to be issued. A copy of the letter was sent to plaintiff at its office in San Francisco. After further correspondence in which the supply officer threatened the plaintiff to buy in the open market against its account, the Crown Lumber Company by \n\n[261 U.S. 17, 21]\n\u00a0\n Scott, June 7th, accepted another order 'under protest especially as to delivery date.' On June 11th, Scott accepted another order 'under protest.' On June 26th and July 2d he accepted other orders 'under protest, especially as to delivery.' In June, Scott and Jackson, vice president of the plaintiff, held a conference with the supply officer at the navy yard to discuss the failure to keep up with the deliveries as the government needed them. During this conference Scott again protested at being compelled to deliver any more than 1,675,000 feet at the contract price. The supply officer stood upon the contract and made no promise to pay more than the contract price. Scott testified that in spite of the letter sent him by the supply officer, he did not know, until the next September, the terms of the contract except from the insufficient memorandum of order sent him by the plaintiff company soon after the contract was signed. The Court of Claims finds that it did not appear that Scott was directed by the company to make such a protest as at the June meeting or that he was acting within his authority in so doing. On June 18th the plaintiff company wrote the supply officer as follows:\n'Dear Sir: Contract 28942. We have for acknowledgment your letter of the 14th, in which you transmit instructions received from the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts, Navy Department, Washington, D. C., in which you are instructed as follows:\n\n\"Contract 28942, if contractor fails to make delivery, purchase authorized as requested.'\n\n'May we be permitted to state that it has never been our intention or aim to fail to make delivery of your requirements as we may be committed to under the contract above quoted? Mr. A. A. Scott, our resident agent on Puget Sound, has been instructed to give your business the right of way, both at the Mukilteo and Port Angeles plants. \n\n[261 U.S. 17, 22]\n\u00a0\n 'Mr. H. W. Jackson, our vice president, was on the Sound recently, and he states that at both mills nothing is left undone in order to produce the lumber that you have ordered under the contract.\n\n'By way of further explanation we might say that when we entered into this contract with your department we never dreamt that we would be expected to deliver extraordinary quantities of clear lumber of long lengths, such as planking, decking, etc., within the time limits specified in the contract. In connection with these orders we feel that we are entitled to some consideration and a little leniency. The contract itself states that we are committed to making deliveries on your orders 50 M feet per b. m. or less of assorted sizes, not more than 10 M b. m. of any one size except with the contractor's consent, which must be delivered within ten days after date of receipt of order, and that all other orders must be delivered within twenty-five days after date of receipt of order from the supply officer. Therefore we submit that when you order 100 M feet of decking or ship lumber of long lengths and ask us to furnish same within ten days you are requiring more of us than is specified in the written contract.\n\n'For this special material, if you were to buy this in the open market to-day, you probably would penalize us $10.00 per M. We feel sure that it is not the desire of your department to arbitrarily penalize us to that extent, in view of the fact that we are doing our utmost to execute your orders within the time limits.\n\n'We feel that we are not responsible for the extraordinary conditions which have arisen since the contract was executed. We are reliably informed that the War Department has canceled their contracts and is now redistributing their requirements, having in view existing conditions. We also feel that your department should interpret our engagement in the same way. We trust you \n\n[261 U.S. 17, 23]\n\u00a0\n will accept this communication in the spirit in which it is sent. We are not asking to be relieved of any responsibility, but rather we submit the facts with a view of enlisting your co-operation to assist us in completing our engagements.'\n\n The Court of Claims further found that 'no protest against furnishing more than 1,675,000 feet of lumber under the contract was ever made by the plaintiff company or any of its officers,' and the seventh finding was as follows:\n'The plaintiff company furnished to the defendant, on orders placed by the defendant under contract 28942, 3,688,259 feet of lumber, for which it was paid at the contract price, and it did not at the time of any payment make to the United States any protest against payment at that price, and so far as the United States was informed such payments were accepted as in full.\n\n'The amount of lumber furnished over and above 1,675,000 feet was worth at market price, delivered at the navy yard, $18,310.21 more than the plaintiff was paid therefor at contract price.'\n\n On these findings we can see no escape for the plaintiff from acquiescence by its conduct in the price bid for the whole amount of lumber delivered.\n The plaintiff relies on the opinion of this court in Freund v. United States, \n260 U.S. 60\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 70, 67 L. Ed. --, decided November 13, 1922. The facts of that case are very different from this. They involved conduct on the part of the representatives of the government of questionable fairness toward the contractors and showed no such acquiescence and absence of protest as here appear.\n It may be, as counsel suggest, that the plaintiff's course was influenced by a patriotic wish to help the government when it was engaged in war. If so, it was to be commended. But this cannot change the legal effect of its evident acquiescence, seen in its letter of June 18th, \n\n[261 U.S. 17, 24]\n\u00a0\n and its failure to protest thereafter, and to put the government on notice that it intended to claim a recovery on a quantum valebat when it was delivering the extra 2,000,000 feet of lumber and receiving the payments therefor from the government at the prices named in the bid. The judgment of the Court of Claims is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","37":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHAS. WOLFF PACKING CO. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS OF STATE(1923)\nNo. 739\nArgued: April 27, 1923Decided: June 11, 1923\n\n\n of State of Kansas \n262 U.S. 522\n (1923) ]\n\n\n[262 U.S. 522, 524]\n\u00a0\n This case involves the validity of the Court of Industrial Relations Act of Kansas. Chapter 29, Special Session, Laws of 1920. The act declares the following to be affected with a public interest: First, manufacture and preparation of food for human consumption; second, manufacture of clothing for human wear; third, production of any substance in common use for fuel; fourth, transportation of the foregoing; fifth, public utilities and common carriers. The act vests an industrial court of three judges with power upon its own initiative or on complaint to summon the parties and hear any dispute over wages or other terms of employment in any such industry, and if it shall find the peace and health of the public imperiled by such controversy, it is required to make findings and fix the wages and other terms for the future conduct of the industry. After 60 days, either party may ask for a readjustment, and then the order is to continue in effect for such reasonable time as the court shall fix, or until changed by agreement of the parties. The Supreme Court of the state may review such orders, and in case of disobedience to an order that court may be appealed to for enforcement.\n The Charles Wolff Packing Company, the plaintiff in error, is a corporation of Kansas engaged in slaughtering hogs and cattle and preparing the meat for sale and shipment. It has $600,000 capital stock and total annual sales of $7,000,000. More than half its products are sold beyond the state. It has 300 employees. There are many other packing houses in Kansas, of greater capacity. This is considered a small one.\n In January, 19 1, the president and seretary of the Meat Cutters' Union filed a complaint with the industrial court against the Packing Company respecting the wages its employees were receiving. The company appeared and answered and a hearing was had. The court made findings, including one of an emergency, and an order as \n\n[262 U.S. 522, 525]\n\u00a0\n to wages, increasing them over the figures to which the company had recently reduced them. The company refused to comply with the order and the industrial court then instituted mandamus proceedings in the Supreme Court to compel compliance. That court appointed a commissioner to consider the record, to take additional evidence, and report his conclusions. He found that the company had lost $100,000 the previous year, and that there was no sufficient evidence of an emergency or danger to the public from the controversy to justify action by the industrial court. The Supreme Court overruled his report and held that the evidence showed a sufficient emergency.\n The prescribed schedule of wages and the limitation of hours and the rate of pay required for overtime resulted in an increase in wages of more than $400 a week.\n It appeared from the evidence that the company and plant were under the control of, and in business association with, what were called 'The Allied Packers' who have plants in various cities and compete with the socalled Big Five Packers, the largest in the country; that the products of the Wolff Packing Company are sold in active competition with such products made by other concerns throughout the United States. It appeared, further, that about the time of this controversy a strike was threatened in the packing houses of the Big Five, which the President of the United States used his good offices to settle. The chief executive of the Wolff Company testified that there had been no difficulty in securing all the labor it desired at the reduced rates offered. The industrial court conceded that the Wolff Company could not operate on the schedule fixed without a loss, but relied on the statement by its president that he hoped for more prosperous times.\n The packing company brings this case here on the ground that the validity of the Industrial Court Act was \n\n[262 U.S. 522, 526]\n\u00a0\n upheld although challenged as in conflict with the provision of the Fourteenth Amendment that no state shall deprive any person of liberty or property without due process of law.\n Messrs. D. R. Hite and John S. Dean, both of Topeka, Kan., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. John G. Egan, of Topeka, Kan., and Chester I. Long, of Wichita, Kan., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[262 U.S. 522, 533]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. CHIEF JUSTICE TAFT, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The necessary postulate of the Industrial Court Act is that the state, representing the people, is so much interested in their peace, health, and comfort that it may compel those engaged in the manufacture of food and clothing, and the production of fuel, whether owners or \n\n[262 U.S. 522, 534]\n\u00a0\n workers, to continue in their business and employment on terms fixed by an agency of the state, if they cannot agree. Under the construction adopted by the state Supreme Court the act gives the industrial court authority to permit the owner or employer to go out of the business, if he shows that he can only continue on the terms fixed at such heavy loss that collapse will follow; but this privilege under the circumstances is generally illusory. Block v. Hirsh, \n256 \nU.S. 135, 157\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 458, 16 A. L. R. 165. A laborer dissatisfied with his wages is permitted to quit, but he may not agree with his fellows to quit or combine with others to induce them to quit.\n These qualifications do not change the essence of the act. It curtails the right of the employer on the one hand, and of the employee on the other, to contract about his affairs. This is part of the liberty of the individual protected by the guaranty of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 U.S. 390\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 625, 67 L. E . --, decided June 4, 1922. While there is no such thing as absolute freedom of contract, and it is subject to a variety of restraints, they must not be arbitrary or unreasoanble. Freedom is the general rule, and restraint the exception. The legislative authority to abridge can be justified only by exceptional circumstances. Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 U.S. 525\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 394, 67 L. Ed. --, decided April 9, 1923\n\n\n It is argued for the state that such exceptional circumstances exist in the present case and that the act is neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. Counsel maintain:\n First. The act declares that the preparation of human food is affected by a public interest and the power of the Legislature so to declare and then to regulate the business is established in Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113\n, Budd v. New York, \n143 U.S. 517\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 468, Brass v. Stoeser, \n153 U.S. 391\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 857, Noble State Bank v. Haskell, \n219 U.S. 104\n, 31 Sup.

The power to regulate a business affected with a public interest extends to fixing wages and terms of employment to secure continuity of operation. Wilson v. New, \n243 \nU.S. 332, 352\n, 353 S., 37 Sup. Ct. 298, L. R. A. 1917E, 938, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1024.\n Businesses said to be clothed with a public interest justifying some public regulation may be divided into three classes:\n\n\n (1)\n Those which are carried on under the authority of a public grant of privileges which either expressly or impliedly imposes the affirmative duty of rendering a public service demanded by any member of the public. Such are the railroads, other common carriers and public utilities.\n\n\n (2)\n Certain occupations, regarded as exceptional, the public interest attaching to which, recognized from earliest times, has survived the period of arbitrary laws by Parliament or colonial Legislatures for regulating all trades and callings. Such are those of the keepers of inns, cabs, and gristmills. State v. Edwards, 86 Me. 102, 29 Atl. 947, 25 L. R. A. 504, 41 Am. St. Rep. 528; Terminal Taxicab Co. v. District of Columbia, \n241 \nU.S. 252, 254\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 583, Ann. Cas. 1916D, 765.\n\n\n (3)\n Businesses which, though not public at their inception, may be fairly said to have risen to be such and have become subject in consequence to some government regulation. They have come to hold such a peculiar relation to the public that this is superimposed upon them. In the language of the cases, the owner by devoting his business to the public use, in effect grants the public an interest in that use and subjects himself to public regulation to the extent of that interest although the property continues to belong to its private owner and to be entitled to protection accordingly. Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113\n; Spring Valley Water Works v. Schottler, \n110 U.S. 347\n, 4 Sup. Ct. 48; Budd v. New York, 117 N. Y. 1, 27, 22 N. E. 670, 682, 5 L. R. A. 559, 15 Am. St. Rep. 460; Id., \n143 U.S. 517\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 468; Brass v. Stoeser, \n153 U.S. 391\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 857; Noble State Bank v. Haskell, \n219 U.S. 104\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 186, 32 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1062, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 487; German Alliance Insurance Co. \n\n[262 U.S. 522, 536]\n\u00a0\n v. Lewis, \n233 U.S. 389\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 612, L. R. A. 1915C, 1189; VanDyke v. Geary, \n244 \nU.S. 39, 47\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 483; Block v. Hirsh, \n256 U.S. 135\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 458, 16 A. L. R. 165.\n It is manifest from an examination of the cases cited under the third head that the mere declaration by a Legislature that a business is affected with a public interest is not conclusive of the question whether its attempted regulation on that ground is justifie . The circumstances of its alleged change from the status of a private business and its freedom from regulation into one in which the public have come to have an interest are always a subject of judicial inquiry.\n In a sense, the public is concerned about all lawful business because it contributes to the prosperity and well being of the people. The public may suffer from high prices or strikes in many trades, but the expression 'clothed with a public interest,' as applied to a business, means more than that the public welfare is affected by continuity or by the price at which a commodity is sold or a service rendered. The circumstances which clothe a particular kind of business with a public interest, in the sense of Munn v. Illinois and the other cases, must be such as to create a peculiarly close relation between the public and those engaged in it, and raise implications of an affirmative obligation on their part to be reasonable in dealing with the public.\n It is urged upon us that the declaration of the Legislature that the business of food preparation is affected with a public interest and devoted to a public use should be most persuasive with the court, and that nothing but the clearest reason to the contrary will prevail with the court to hold otherwise. To this point, counsel for the state cite Clark v. Nash, \n198 U.S. 361\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 676, 4 Ann. Cas. 1171; Strickley v. Highland Boy Mining Co., \n200 U.S. 527\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 301, 4 Ann. Cas. 1174; Hairston v. Danville & Western Ry. Co., \n208 \nU.S. 598, 600\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 331, 13 Ann. Cas. 1008; Union Lime Co. v. Chicago & North Western Ry. Co., \n233 U.S. 211\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 522; Jones v. Portland, \n245 U.S. 217\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 112, L. R. A. 1918C, 765, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 660; and Green v. \n\n[262 U.S. 522, 537]\n\u00a0\n Frazier, \n253 U.S. 233\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 499. These cases are not especially helpful in determining how a business must be devoted to a public use to clothe it with a public interest so as to permit regulation of rates or prices. They were of two classes-one where condemnation proceedings were opposed on the ground that private property could only be taken for a public use and the use contemplated by the Legislature was not a public one. The other was of tax suits in which the validity of the tax was denied because the use for which the tax was levied was not a public one. 'Public use' in such cases would seem to be a term of wider scope than where it is used to describe that which clothes property or business 'with a public interest.' In the former, the private owner is fully compensated for his property. In the latter, the use for which the tax is laid may be any purpose in which the state may engage and this covers almost any private business if the Legislature thinks the state's engagement in it will help the general public and is willing to pay the cost of the plant and incur the expense of operation.\n It has never been supposed, since the adoption of the Constitution, that the business of the butcher, or the baker, the tailor, the wood chopper, the mining operator, or the miner was clothed with such a public interest that the price of his product or his wages could be fixed by state regulation. It is true that in the days of the early common law an omnipotent parliament did regulate prices and wages as it chose, and occasionally a colonial legislature sought to exercise the same power; but nowadays one does not devote one's property or business to the public use or clothe it with a public interest merely because one makes commodities for, and sells to, the public in the common callings of which those above mentioned are instances.\n An ordinary producer, manufacturer, or shopkeeper may sell or not sell as he likes, United States v. \n\n[262 U.S. 522, 538]\n\u00a0\n Freight Association, \n166 \nU.S. 290, 320\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 540; Terminal Cab Co. v. Kutz, \n241 \nU.S. 252, 256\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 583, Ann. Cas. 1916D, 765, and while this feature does not necessarily exclude usinesses from the class clothed with a public interest, German Alliance Ins Co. v. Lewis, \n233 U.S. 389\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 612, L. R. A. 1915C, 1189, it usually distinguishes private from quasi-public occupations.\n In nearly all the businesses included under the third head above, the thing which gave the public interest was the indispensable nature of the service and the exorbitant charges and arbitrary control to which the public might be subjected without regulation.\n In the preparation of food, the changed conditions have greatly increased the capacity for treating the raw product and transferred the work from the shop with few employees to the great plant with many. Such regulation of it as there has been, has been directed toward the health of the workers in congested masses, or has consisted of inspection and supervision with a view to the health of the public. But never has regulation of food preparation been extended to fixing wages or the prices to the public, as in the cases cited above where fear of monopoly prompted, and was held to justify, regulation of rates. There is no monopoly in the preparation of foods. The prices charged by plaintiff in error are, it is conceded, fixed by competition throughout the country at large. Food is now produced in greater volume and variety than ever before. Given uninterrupted interstate commerce, the sources of the food supply in Kansas are country-wide, a short supply is not likely, and the danger from local monopolistic control less than ever.\n It is very difficult under the cases to lay down a working rule by which readily to determine when a business has become 'clothed with a public interest.' All business is subject to some kinds of public regulation, but when the public becomes so peculiarly dependent upon a particular business that one engaging therein subjects \n\n[262 U.S. 522, 539]\n\u00a0\n himself to a more intimate public regulation is only to be determined by the process of exclusion and inclusion and to gradual establishment of a line of distinction. We are relieved from considering and deciding definitely whether preparation of food should be put in the third class of quasi public businesses, noted, above, because, even so, the valid regulation to which it might be subjected as such, could not include what this act attempts.\n To say that a business is clothed with a public interest is not to determine what regulation may be permissible in view of the private rights of the owner. The extent to which an inn or a cab system may be regulated may differ widely from that allowable as to a railroad or other common carrier. It is not a matter of legislative discretion solely. It depends on the nature of the business, on the feature which touches the public, and on the abuses reasonably to be feared. To say that a business is clothed with a public interest is not to import that the public may take over its entire management and run it at the expense of the owner. The extent to which regulation may reasonably go varies with different kinds of business. The regulation of rates to avoid monopoly is one thing. The regulation of wages is another. A business may be of such character that only the first is permissible, while another may involve such a possible danger of monopoly on the one hand, and such disaster from stoppage on the other, that both come within the public concern and power of regulation.\n If, as, in effect, contended by counsel for the state, the common callings are clothed with a public interest by a mere legislative declaration, which necessarily authorizes full and comprehensive regulation within legislative discretion, there must be a revolution in the relation of government to general business. This will be running the public interest argument into the ground, to use a phrase of Mr. Justice Bradley when characterizing a similarly \n\n[262 U.S. 522, 540]\n\u00a0\n extreme contention. Civil Rights Cases, \n109 \nU.S. 3, 24\n, 3 S. Sup. Ct. 18. It will be impossible to reconcile such result with the freedom of contract and of labor secured by the Fourteenth Amendme t.\n This brings us to the nature and purpose of the regulation under the Industrial Court Act. The avowed object is continuity of food, clothing and fuel supply. By section 6 reasonable continuity and efficiency of the industries specified are declared to be necessary for the public peace, health and general welfare, and all are forbidden to hinder, limit or suspend them. Section 7 gives the industrial court power in case of controversy between employers and workers which may endanger the continuity or efficiency of service, to bring the employer and employees before it and after hearing and investigation to fix the terms and conditions between them. The employer is bound by this act to pay the wages fixed and while the worker is not required to work, at the wages fixed, he is forbidden, on penalty of fine or imprisonment, to strike against them and thus is compelled to give up that means of putting himself on an equality with his employer which action in concert with his fellows gives him.\n There is no authority of this court to sustain such exercise of power in respect to those kinds of business affected with a public interest by a change in pais, first fully recognized by this court in Munn v. Illinois, supra, where it said (\n94 U.S. 126\n):\n'Property does become clothed with a public interest when used in a manner to make it of public consequence, and affect the community at large. When, therefore, one devotes his property to a use in which the public has an interest, he in effect grants to the public an interest in that use, and must submit to be controlled by the public for the common good, to the extent of the interest he has thus created. He may withdraw his grant by discontinuing \n\n[262 U.S. 522, 541]\n\u00a0\n the use; but, so long as he maintains the use, he must submit to the control.'\n\n These words refute the view that public regulation in such cases can secure continuity of a business against the owner. The theory is that of revocable grant only. Weems Steamboat Co. v. People's Co., \n214 U.S. 345\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 661, 16 Ann. Cas. 1222. If that be so with the owner and employer, a fortiori must it be so with the employee. It involves a more drastic exercise of control to impose limitations of continuity growing out of the public character of the business upon the employee than upon the employer; and without saying that such limitations upon both may not be sometimes justified, it must be where the obligation to the public of continuous service is direct, clear, and mandatory, and arises as a contractual condition express or implied of entering the business either as owner or worker. It can only arise when investment by the owner and entering the employment by the worker create a conventional relation to the public somewhat equivalent to the appointment of officers and the enlistment of soldiers and sailors in military service.\n We are considering the validity of the act as compelling the employer to pay the adjudged wages, and as forbidding the employees to combine against working and receiving them. The penalties of the act are directed against effort of either side to interfere with the settlement by arbitration. Without this joint compulsion, the whole theory and purpose of the act would fail. The state cannot be heard to say, therefore, that upon complaint of the employer the effect upon the employee should not be a factor in our judgment.\n Justification for such regulation is said to be found in Wilson v. New, \n243 U.S. 332\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 298, L. R. A. 1917E, 938, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1024. It was there held that in a nation-wide dispute over wages between railroad companies and their train operatives, with a general strike, commercial paralysis, and grave loss and suffering overhanging \n\n[262 U.S. 522, 542]\n\u00a0\n the country, Congress had power to prescribe wages not confiscatory, but obligatory on both for a reasonable time to enable them to agree. The court said that the business of common carriers by rail was in one aspect a public business because of the interest of  ciety in its continued operation and rightful conduct and that this gave rise to a public right of regulation to the full extent necessary to secure and protect it; that viewed as an act fixing wages it was an essential regulation for protection of public right; that it did not invade the private right of the carriers because their property and business were subject to the power of government to insure fit relief by appropriate means and it did not invade private rights of employees since their right to demand wages and to leave the employment individually or in concert was subject to limitation by Congress because in a public business which Congress might regulate under the commerce power.\n It is urged that under this act the exercise of the power of compulsory arbitration rests upon the existence of a temporary emergency as in Wilson v. New. If that is a real factor here, as in Wilson v. New, and in Block v. Hirsh, \n256 \nU.S. 135, 157\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 458, 16 A. L. R. 165 (see Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, \n260 U.S. 393\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 158, 67 L. Ed. --, decided December 11, 1922) it is enough to say that the great temporary public exigencies, recognized by all and declared by Congress, were very different from that upon which the control under this act is asserted. Here it is said to be the danger that a strike in one establishment may spread to all the other similar establishments of the state and country, and thence to all the national sources of food supply so as to produce a shortage. Whether such danger exists has not been determined by the Legislature, but is determined under the law by a subordinate agency, and on its findings and prophecy owners and employers are to be deprived of freedom of contract and workers of a most important element of their freedom of labor. \n\n[262 U.S. 522, 543]\n\u00a0\n The small extent of the injury to the food supply of Kansas to be inflicted by a strike and suspension of this packing company's plant is shown in the language of the Kansas Supreme Court in this case (Court of Industrial Relations v. Packing Co., 111 Kan. 501, 207 Pac. 806):\n'The defendant's plant is a small one, and it may be admitted that, if it should cease to operate, the effect on the supply of meat and food in this state would not greatly inconvenience the people of Kansas; yet, the plant manufactures food products and supplies meat to a part of the people of this state, and, if it should cease to operate, that source of supply would be cut off.'\n\n The Supreme Court's construction of the operation and effect of the act is controlling. The language quoted shows how drastic and all- inclusive it is.\n But the chief and conclusive distinction between Wilson v. New and the case before us is that already referred to. The power of a Legislature to compel continuity in a business can only arise where the obligation of continued service by the owner and its employees is direct and is assumed when the business is entered upon. A common carrier, which accepts a railroad franchise, is not free to withdraw the use of that which it has granted to the public. It is true that if operation is impossible without continuous loss (Brooks-Scanlon Co. v. R. R. Commission, \n251 U.S. 396\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 183; Bullock v. R. R. Commission, \n254 U.S. 513\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 193), it may give up its franchise and enterprise, but, short of this, it must continue. Not so the owner, when by mere changed conditions his business becomes clothed with a public interest. He may stop at will, whether the business be losing or profitable.\n The minutely detailed government supervision, including that of their relations to their employees, to which the railroads of the country have been gradually subjected by Congress through its power over interstate commerce, furnishes no precedent for regulation of the business of the \n\n[262 U.S. 522, 544]\n\u00a0\n the plaintiff in error, whose classification as public is at the best doubtful. It is not too much to say that the ruling in Wilson v. New went to the border line, although it concerne an interstate common carrier in the presence of the nation-wide emergency and the possibility of great disaster. Certainly there is nothing to justify extending the drastic regulation sustained in that exceptional case to the one before us.\n We think the Industrial Court Act, in so far as it permits the fixing of wages in plaintiff in error's packing house, is in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, and deprives it of its property and liberty of contract without due process of law.\n The judgment of the court below must be Reversed. \n\n\n\n","38":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY NAT BANK OF EL PASO, TEX, v. EL PASO & N E R CO(1923)\nNo. 309\nArgued: March 12, 1923Decided: June 11, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 695, 696]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. H. Culwell, of El Paso, Tex., for petitioner.\n Mr. Wm. R. Harr, of Washington, D. C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was commenced in the district court of El Paso county by the petitioner to recover $10,101.18 for alleged failure to deliver, in accordance with a shipping contract, 847 head of cattle shipped October 27, 1911, by the petitioner from El Paso, Tex., to Kansas City, Mo., over the connecting lines of railway of respondents, there to be delivered to the First National Bank of \n\n[262 U.S. 695, 697]\n\u00a0\n that city. Judgment for the respondent was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals of the Eighth Supreme Judicial District of Texas. 225 S. W. 391. The Supreme Court of the state denied a writ of error. On petitioner's application, asserting that federal rights claimed by it in the state courts under the Carmack Amendment (34 Stat. c. 3591, p. 595 [Comp. St.  8604a, 8604aa]) are denied by the judgment, the case was brought here on certiorari.\n The petitioner declared upon alleged failure of respondents to deliver the cattle to the First National Bank of Kansas City, in accordance with a bill of lading issued by the initial carrier; it alleged the value of the cattle to be $20,000, and claimed $10,101.18 on account of failure by the carriers to deliver the cattel to the consignee named.\n The shipment in question was the last of 18 or 20 trainload shipments of cattle by petitioner from El Paso to Kansas City. The record shows that, for some time prior to the date of this shipment, one Cameron had been buying cattle in the interior of Mexico and shipping them to Juarez, whence they entered the United States at El Paso. A bank of Chihuahua furnished the money to pay for the cattle. That bank consigned them to petitioner at El Paso, making draft with bill of lading attached, for the amount of the purchase price. After the cattle were delivered to the petitioner on the American side, it paid the draft and refunded the purchase price to the Chihuahua bank. It then shipped the cattle to Kansas City for sale. J. P. Peters was a cattle broker doing business in Kansas City under the name of J. P. Peters Commission Company. His son, J. A. Peters, was employed by Cameron. He also acted for the petitioner, and all of the shipments were handled exclusively by him as its agent. All of the previous shipments were delivered to the commission company \n\n[262 U.S. 695, 698]\n\u00a0\n upon arrival at Kansas City, and, with the exception of some of the earliest, were shipped by him to the First National Bank of Kansas City, 'care of the J. P. Peters Commission Company.' This practice was adopted because the bank was closed at the time one of the earlier shipments arrived, and the day's market was lost.\n At the time of the shipment in question, a bill of lading was issued by the receiving carrier, signed by its agent and by the 'City National Bank, by J. A. Peters, Shipper.' The waybill contemporaneously made designated the consignee 'First National Bank, Kansas City, Mo., care J. P. Peters Commission Company. ...' The petitioner made a draft, with bill of lading attached, on the commission company, and forwarded it to the bank at Kansas City, with directions to release the cattle on payment of the draft, and to wire petitioner for instructions, if the draft was not paid. The terminal carrier delivered the cattle to the commission company without urrender of the bill of lading or the payment of the draft. The bank returned the bill of lading and the draft to the petitioner. The draft has never been paid in full, and this action is to recover the amount remaining unpaid. The jury found that, at the time of the execution of the bill of lading, it was agreed between the petitioner, acting through J. A. Peters, and the receiving carrier, that the cattle should be consigned by bill of lading to the First National Bank of Kansas City, Mo., care of the J. P. Peters Commission Company; that through mutual mistake, the bill of lading omitted the words 'care of the J. P. Peters Commission Company'; and that the petitioner through its said agent, directed the agent of the receiving carrier to note on the waybill that the cattle were consigned to the First National Bank of Kansas City, care of the J. P. Peters Commission Company. The jury also found that prior shipments of cattle above referred to had been delivered by the terminal carrier to the commission \n\n[262 U.S. 695, 699]\n\u00a0\n company before the payment of drafts to which the bills of lading were attached, and that the First National Bank acquiesced in and ratified such deliveries; that in reliance on such acquiescence and ratification, the terminal carrier delivered the shipment in question to the commission company without the surrender of the bill of lading; and that such acquiescence or ratification was reasonably sufficient to induce the belief that the commission company was authorized to receive the cattle for the bank.\n The petitioner complained that the carrier failed to deliver the cattle to the bank named as consignee or to the petitioner. If delivery was made to that bank, or to the petitioner, or on its order, the carriers did not commit any breach alleged, and there can be no recovery. \n2\n And if, as in the case of previous shipments, the contract had read 'First National Bank of Kansas City, Mo., care of J. P. Peters Commission Company,' delivery to the commission company would have been performance of the agreement. See Ela V. American Merchants' Union Express Co., 29 Wis. 611, 616, 9 Am. Rep. 619; Bell v. Windsor & Annapolis Ry. Co., 24 Nova Scotia, 521. The bank had ratified the delivery of prior shipments to the commission company before payment of drafts accompanying bills of lading. The terminal carrier had a right to assume that delivery of this shipment properly might be made to the commission company. J. A. Peters acted for the petitioner in making all of the shipments. He directed the prior shipments to be made to the consignee bank in care of the commission company. At his instance the waybill directed delivery of this shipment to the named consignee in care of the commission company. His orders and directions were binding on the petitioner. Thus in legal \n\n[262 U.S. 695, 700]\n\u00a0\n effect the petitioner at the time it made the shipment expressly ordered delivery to be made to the consignee bank in care of the commission company, and caused the agent of the receiving carrier to so direct on the waybill. We think it must be held that, under these circumstances, delivery to the commission company was delivery to the consignee bank.\n This being so, the provisions of the Carmack Amendment have no application.\n The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The other respondents are: El Paso & Southwestern Company, El Paso & Northeastern Railway Company, El Paso & Rock Island Railway Company, Chicago, Rock Island & El Paso Railway Company, Chicago, Rock Island & Gulf Railway Company, and Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See decision of this case in Court of Civil Appeals, 225 S. W. 391, 400, holding that the petition alleging failure to deliver to consignee would not support recovery for a delivery without surrender of bill of lading. \n\n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF NEW YORK v. NEW YORK TEL CO(1923)\nNo. 588\nArgued: February 21, 1923Decided: February 21, 1923\n\n\nDecided, March 12, 1923.\n\n\n\n[261 U.S. 312, 313]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. M. Maldwin Fertig and John P. O'Brien, both of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. John W. Davis, of New York City, for appellee.\n\n\n[261 U.S. 312, 314]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The New York Telephone Company, the appellee herein, filed its bill in the District Court against the members of the New York Public Service Commission, the counsel of the commission and the Attorney General of the state, asking an injunction against the enforcement of two orders of the Public Service Commission as to telephone rates, one as to rates in the city of New York and the other as to those in the state of New York, outside of the city, which it alleged to be confiscatory of its property and in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Thereafter the city of New York moved the court for an order making it a party defendant in the cause. This order the District Court denied. Thereafter an interlocutory injunction against the orders was granted and an appeal. No. 542, is pending here and has been argued, but not decided. This is a separate appeal from the order refusing the application of the city to be made a party defendant.\n Under article 1, section 12, of the Public Service Commission Law of the state of New York (Consol. Laws, c. 48), it is made the duty of \n\n[261 U.S. 312, 315]\n\u00a0\n counsel to the commission--\n'to represent and appear for the people of the state of New York and the commission in all actions and proceedings involving any question under this chapter, or within the jurisdiction of the commission under the railroad law, or under or in reference to any act or order of the commission, and, if directed to do so by the commission, to intervene, if possible, in any action or proceeding in which any such question is involved.'\n\n Chapter 15 of the Laws of 1922 of the state directs that:\n'The Attorney General shall appear for the people of the state, and take such steps as may be necessary to protect the interests of the public, in the proceeding heretofore instituted by the Public Service Commission and entitled 'In the matter of the hearing on motion of the commission, as to rates, charges and rentals, and the regulations and practices affecting rates, charges and rentals of the New York Telephone Company.' For such purpose, he may employ special deputies, experts and other assistants, and incur such other expenses as he may find necessary, within the amount appropriated by this act.'\n\n The necessary defendant in the suit to enjoin the orders lowering rates was the Public Service Commission whose orders they were. In addition the counsel of the commission and the Attorney General were made parties defendant under the legislation above recited. The city of New York has no control over the rates. Its only interest in them is as a subscriber, and even as such its interest in the general rates is not direct because its own rates are settled by a special contract. Under such circumstances, the city is certainly not a necessary party.\n In re Engelhard, \n231 U.S. 646\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 258, an action had been brought against the city of Louisville to restrain the enforcement of an ordinance prescribing telephone \n\n[261 U.S. 312, 316]\n\u00a0\n rates. One of the subscribers filed a petition in the District Court asking to be made a party defendant. This was denied and the petitioner sought in this court a mandamus to compel the District Judge to grant the petition. It was pressed upon the court that petitioner had a common interest with other subscribers in the rates under discussion and that under equity rule No. 38 when the question is one of common or general interest and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court, one may sue or defend for all. This court held that the city was the proper defendant in the suit as the representative of all interested. We said:\n'It is the universal practice, sustained by authority, that the only mode of judicial relief against unreasonable rates is by suit against the governmental authority which established them or is charged with the duty of enforcing them.'\n\n There is nothing in this case to show that the Public Service Commission will not fully and properly represent the subscribers resident in New York City. Indeed it was said at the bar that the city and the Public Service Commission and the Attorney General were co-operating in every way in the defense of the suit. It was completely within the discretion of the District Court to refuse to allow the city to become a defendant when its interests and those of its residents were fully represented under the law and protected by those who had been made defendants. There is nothing to show that the refusal complained of was an abuse of discretion. This same controversy arose in the case of City of New York v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n253 U.S. 219\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 511, and the same conclusion was reached. Indeed it was there said that an order like the one here objected to was not of such a final character as to furnish the basis of an appeal, citing Ex parte Cutting, \n94 U.S. 14\n, 22; Credits Commutation Co. v. United States, \n177 \nU.S. 311, 315\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 636; Ex parte Leaf Tobacco Board of Trade, \n\n[261 U.S. 312, 317]\n\u00a0\n \n222 \nU.S. 578, 581\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 833. These cases show that exceptional circumstances may make an order denying intervention in a suit a final and appealable order, but the present is not one of them.\n Our conclusion is that this appeal should be\n Dismissed. \n\n\n\n","40":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF NEWARK v. STATE OF NEW JERSEY(1923)\nNo. 469\nArgued: March 2, 1923Decided: May 7, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 192, 193]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Geo. W. Wickersham, of New York City, and J. T. Congleton, of Newark, N. J., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. William Newcorn, of Plainfield, N. J., for the State of New Jersey.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The state of New Jersey recovered judgment against the city of Newark for $18,104.08 and costs, in an action brought in the state Supreme Court. The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals, and the case is here on writ of error. It is based on a state enactment which is attacked on the sole ground that it violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The state's right to recover depends upon the validity of an enactment of the state (chapter 252, Laws of 1907), which is sufficiently set forth in the decision of this court in Trenton v. New Jersey, \n262 U.S. 182\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 534, 67 L. Ed. --, handed down on this day.\n In East Jersey Water Co. v. Board of Conservation & Development, 91 N. J. Law, 448, 453, 103 Atl. 853, 855, it is said:\n'The statute requires payment 'for all such water hereafter diverted in excess of the amount now being legally diverted,' with the proviso that no payment be required until the legal diversion shall exceed one hundred \n\n[262 U.S. 192, 194]\n\u00a0\n gallons per day per capita. We are of opinion that 'legally diverted' means not a future diversion, but one now being exercised under a legal right, and that under this statute a legal abstractor may take what he was diverting in 1907, and, if that did not reach the statutory maximum of exemption, as much more as is required to make the total diversion one hundred gallons per day per capita for each of the municipalities supplied, without payment of the license fee.\n\n'If, in 1907, the daily diversion exceeded one hundred gallons per capita, the amount then diverted, if lawful, may be taken without payment, and if it was less, no license fee can be imposed until it exceeds the statutory quantity.'\n\n The complaint alleged that under the provisions of this act the city was 'permitted to divert ... an average daily free allowance of water to the amount of 36,241,666 gallons, the said last mentioned amount being the amount of water which was being diverted by said municipality on June 17th aforesaid, the date when the act aforesaid became effective and operative,' and claimed for each of the years subsequent to July 1, 1914, a license fee of $1 per million gallons for the excess of the daily average diversion of water over the quantity above specified. The answer alleged that prior to the passage of the act of 1907, the city had acquired a plant capable of furnishing 50,000,000 gallons of water per day, and set up certain separate defenses. At the trial, the court on motion of the state, struck out the separate defenses; the facts were not in controversy, and judgment was given for the amount claimed. About the same time, the state also recovered judgment against the city of Trenton for the license fee imposed by the same act. Both cases were taken to the Court of Errors and Appeals, the highest court of the state, and there by one decision the judgments were affirmed. 117 Atl. 158. That court said: \n\n[262 U.S. 192, 195]\n\u00a0\n 'The facts are not in dispute. It is conceded that the city of Trenton, at the time of the enactment of the act of 1907, was taking from the Delaware rive daily 14,200,000 gallons of water for local use, and that the city of Newark was daily extracting from the Pequannock river 36,241,666 gallons for local use. These diversions represent the ante-statutory flowage, and are considered by the state under the eighth section of the act of 1907 to be nontaxable.'\n To establish its contention that section 8 of the enactment in question so discriminates between those authorized to divert water that it violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the city says that the highest court has in this case construed the words 'now being legally diverted' to mean the amount of water which was actually diverted on the day when the act went into effect, namely, June 17, 1907; that, had the city flowed into its mains 50,000,000 gallons that day the tax would have been levied only upon the excess over that amount and on the facts shown in the complaint, there would have been no tax in the years above referred to; that the purely accidental figure of 36,241,666 gallons, the amount actually diverted on that day, will for all time be the basis of the assessment of the tax upon the city. It is suggested that cities less populous by one-half than Newark, but owning plants far in excess of their needs might have diverted on June 17, 1907, twice the amount of water which the city of Newark diverted, and that a city twice as large might have diverted half as much, and the former of such cities would thereby have procured an almost perpetual exemption, and the latter would have brought on itself an insupportable burden of indefinite duration; and that accidents of climate, of conflagrations and of breaks in the mains on the critical date, June 17, 1907, would have resulted in increasing the exemption. \n\n[262 U.S. 192, 196]\n\u00a0\n The enforcement by the state of the provision of the act imposing upon the city the specified annual payments for such diversion of water does not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The regulation of municipalities is a matter peculiarly within the domain of the state. In Trenton v. New Jersey, \n262 U.S. 182\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 534, 67 L. Ed. --, decided this day, it is held that the imposition of the license fee specified in this act is not a taking of property of that city in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The reasons supporting that conclusion apply here. The city cannot invoke the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment against the state. \n1\n Considering the former opinions of this court, there is no substantial federal question in the case.\n The writ of error is dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cf.

PADUCAH R CO(1923)\nNo. 243\nArgued: January 18, 1923Decided: February 19, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[261 U.S. 267, 268]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. A. Berry and James D. Mocquot, both of Paducah, Ky., for appellants.\n Mr. Charles K. Wheeler, of Paducah, Ky., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellee, the Paducah Railway Company, is the owner of an electric street car system in Paducah, Ky., and is operating it under a franchise ordinance adopted April 29, 1919, Section XV thereof (printed in the margin)1 relates to fares to be charged. The company \n\n[261 U.S. 267, 269]\n\u00a0\n commenced operation under this ordinance October 1, 1919, charging the fare therein specified, 6 cents for adults, half fare for children under 12 and over 5 years of age. On September 17, 1920, the company notified the city that it would fail to earn enough to meet operating expenses, taxes, depreciation, and a reasonable rate of return upon its investment by $72,350.10, and furnished the city a statement showing (f r 11 months, actual and September estimated) that operating expenses, including depreciation and taxes, exceeded the total revenue by $4,055.86, and that the additional amount required to provide an 8 per cent. return on \n\n[261 U.S. 267, 270]\n\u00a0\n the investment of $854,303 was $72,350.10; that the number of passengers carried was 2,979,654, and the average fare 5.32 cents; that to provide sufficient revenue on the basis of then existing price levels it would require a cash fare of 13.5 cents, and stated that in the hope that during the ensuing year prices would decline, it was willing to operate for the 12 months beginning October 1, 1920, at a lower fare. It notified the city that, effective on that day, the rates of fare would be: Cash fare, 10 cents; tokens, 7.5 cents; half fare, 5 cents. On September 20, 1920, the company, supplementing its earlier communication, requested the city, if dissatisfied with the value of the property as shown in the statement theretofore furnished, to have an appraisal of the property as provided in section XV of the franchise ordinance. On September 21, 1920, claiming that the company was limited to the fares specified in section XV as maximum, the city, without any investigation of the facts reported by the company or any appraisal of the property, passed an ordinance prescribing the same fare and imposing penalties for the violation of the ordinance. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[261 U.S. 267, 271]\n\u00a0\n The company thereupon brought this suit to restrain and enjoin the enforcement of the ordinance on the ground that the rates specified are unremunerative and confiscatory, and that the enforcement of the ordinance would take the company's property without due process of law and deny it equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n After hearing the parties, the District Court, on September 30, 1920, granted a temporary injunction.\n On October 12, 1920, the company furnished a statement of receipts and expenditures for the first 12-months period in form similar to that submitted September 17, 1920, shortly before the expiration of the year, showing that operating expenses including depreciation and taxes exceeded the total revenue by $4,338.21, and that the additional amount of revenue required to provide an 8 per cent. return on the investment as claimed was $ 72,862.45.\n At the trial of the case on the merits, the company offered evidence sufficient to sustain the allegations of the complaint. The city offered no evidence and made no serious contention that the rates fixed in the ordinance complained of were sufficient, but insisted that the franchise ordinance was a contract binding the company to the fares specified in section XV as the maximum never to be exceeded during the 20-year term.\n The District Court held that the franchise fixed rates for the first year only, and final decree was entered enjoining the enforcement of the ordinance.\n On this appeal, the city's only contention is that, under the franchise, the company has no right at any time to have fares in excess of those specified in that section, and because of the contract, it may not invoke constitutional protection against the enforcement of the specified rates, even if shown to be too low to yield a reasonable return. \n\n[261 U.S. 267, 272]\n\u00a0\n Before considering the language, it is appropriate to take note of the situation existing at the time the passage of the franchise was being considered. The plaintiff's predecessor, the Paducah Traction Company, had operated the system for many years. Until July 1, 1918, there was a 5-cent fare. The city and company agreed upon a fare of 7 cents to commence on that date. On September 1, 1918, a receiver was appointed and that fare continued in force until October 1, 1919, the date of the commencement of the term of the present franchise. The District Judge in his opinion on granting the motion for a temporary injunction said:\n'The predecessor of the plaintiff had failed to accomplish either an adequate transportation system for the city or th making of anything resembling profits for itself.'\n\n Operating expenses greatly increased between 1914 and the adoption of the franchise ordinance.\n That the city had power under its charter to prescribe just and reasonable fares from time to time was stated by counsel on the argument and is assumed. The surrender of this power or any part of it is a very grave act; authority to make it must be plain, and the intention so to do must clearly and unmistakably appear. Home Telephone Co. v. Los Angeles, \n211 \nU.S. 265, 273\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 50, and cases there cited.\n The company was entitled to just compensation-i. e., a reasonable return on the value of its property used in the public service-and, unless contracted away, that right is protected by constitutional safeguards which may not be overridden by legislative enactment or considerations of public policy. Southern Iowa Electric Co. v. City of Chariton et al., \n255 \nU.S. 539, 542\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 400, and cases there cited; San Antonio v. San Antonio Public Service Co., \n255 U.S. 547\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 428.\n On the argument, it was stated by counsel that the city and company have power to contract as to rates and we so assume. If the franchise here amounts to a contract \n\n[261 U.S. 267, 273]\n\u00a0\n binding the company to the fare stated therein as a maximum, as claimed by the city, for the whole franchise term of 20 years, it cannot complain, and there is no ground for relief; and the question whether such rates are too low to give a reasonable return or sufficient is immaterial. Southern Iowa Electric Co. v. City of Chariton et al., supra, \n255 U.S. 543\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 400; San Antonio v. San Antonio Public Service Co., supra.\n In the construction of section XV, regard properly may be had to the facts, the situation of the parties at the time of the adoption of the ordinance and to their respective powers and rights liable to be effected by the franchise.\n The first clause is as follows:\n'The fare for one continuous trip for twelve (12) months from the commencement of operation under this franchise is hereby fixed as follows:\n\n Cash fare for adults ..... 6\n Children under twelve and over five ..... Half fare\n Children under five when accompanied by guardian ..... Nothing.'\n By this provision a definite fare for a specified period is fixed. There is nothing indicating any intention that the fares are to continue beyond the 12 months or that they are to be taken as maximum and not to be exceeded after the expiration of that period.\n The second clause is as follows:\n'At the end of such period the purchaser, shall submit a verified statement of the receipts and expenditures to the mayor and commissioners of the city of Paducah and if it appear therefrom ( after investigation and verification of such report) that the purchaser has received more than a sufficient sum to pay expenses and a reasonable rate of return on the capital invested, such purchaser shall repay to the city of Paducah the difference between the amount necessary for such expenses and a \n\n[261 U.S. 267, 274]\n\u00a0\n reasonable rate of return upon invested capital and the amount actually received.'\n\n The purpose of this is plain. The parties here provided for payment to the city by the company of any excess that might result from possible decline of operating expenses or other causes. There is no support here for the city's contention that the fares specified in the section were fixed as the permanent maximum fares for the whole period.\n The third clause, commencing the second paragraph of the section, is as follows:\n'At the expiration of each 12 months during the life of this franchise, for the purpose of regulating fares to be charged by the purchaser, and to accomplish that purpose, and to prevent excessive fares, the purchaser shall at the expiration of each 12 months during the life of this franchise submit to the commissioners of the city of Paducah a verified statement of the receipts and expenditures and if from any of such reports it appears the fare as fixed is more than sufficient to provide a reasonable rate of return upon the invested capital, the city shall reduce such fare accordingly.'\n\n The reports required are for the purpose of regulating fares, and were intended to furnish the city facts in aid of the exercise of its power to prescribe just and reasonable fares and to prevent excessive fares; and by this provision there is evidenced a definite understanding that, if in any 12 months period the revenue yielded by the fares established and in effect for that period is more than sufficient, as defined in the ordinance, the city will reduce the fares accordingly. There is nothing here to indicate an intention that the fare prescribed in the first clause shall be deemed maximum for the term of the franchise.\n The third paragraph commences with the following language:\n'For the purpose of ascertaining the rate of fare to be charged hereunder the city may cause said \n\n[261 U.S. 267, 275]\n\u00a0\n property to be appraised as follows.'\n\n The remaining part of the section relates to the valuation. It gives the city authority to require an appraisal of property to be made in the manner specified and imposes upon the company one-half of the expense thereof. This is a further aid to the exercise of the city's power to prescribe just and reasonable fares.\n The conclusions to be drawn as to the matter in controversy are obvious. The parties agreed to and were bound to the specified fares for the first 12 months. These fares were not agreed to be maximum for any other part of the franchise term. The right of the company thereafter to have fares sufficient to provide a reasonable rate of return upon its invested capital was not contracted away. The power and duty of the city thereafter to prescribe fares that are just and reasonable was not contracted away; it was definitely understood that, if from any of such reports it appears that 'the fare as fixed' (meaning, as established and in effect) was excessive, the city will reduce such fare accordingly.\n We have examined the record and are satisfied that the fares prescribed by the ordinance of September 21, 1920, were shown to be too low under the conditions existing at the time of the trial, and that the company is entitled to the injunction.\n The decree entered is general in form and is not limited as to time. The terms of the ordinance prescribing the fare in question are general and fix no time limit. It is obvious that conditions may have so changed or hereafter may so change that these or even lower fares may be just and reasonable. The decree appealed from should be modified to safeguard the right of the city under its charter and the franchise properly to exercise its power to prescribe just and reasonable fares.\n The decree is modified in accordance with this opinion, and, as so modified, is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section XV.\n The fare for one continuous trip for twelve (12) months from the commencement of operation under this franchise is hereby fixed as follows:\n Cash fare for adults ..... 6\n Children under twelve and over five ..... Half fare.\n Children under five when accompanied by guardian ..... Nothing.\n At the end of such period the purchaser shall submit a verified statement of the receipts and expenditures to the mayor and commissioners of the city of Paducah and if it appear therefrom (after investigation and verification of such report) that the purchaser has received more than a sufficient sum to pay expenses and a reasonable rate of return on the capital invested, such purchaser shall repay to the city of Paducah the difference between the amount necessary for such expenses and a reasonable rate of return upon invested capital and the amount actually received.\n At the expiration of each twelve months during the life of this franchise, for the purpose of regulating fares to be charged by the purchaser, and to accomplish that purpose, and to prevent excessive fares, the purchaser shall, at the expiration of each twelve months during the life of this ranchise submit to the commissioners of the city of Paducah a verified statement of the receipts and expenditures and if from any of such reports it appears the fare as fixed is more than sufficient to provide a reasonable rate of return upon the invested capital, the city shall reduce such fare accordingly.\n For the purpose of ascertaining the rate of fare to be charged hereunder the city may cause said property to be appraised as follows: The city shall appoint a disinterested street railway expert, and the purchaser shall appoint such expert appraiser for its part, and the two so appointed shall select a third expert appraiser. ... Said experts shall report in writing to the mayor and commissioners of the city of Paducah within three months after their appointment the total valuation of the property owned, controlled or used by the purchaser, in connection with the operation of a street car system in Paducah and its vicinity, but this franchise shall not be estimated or considered in its value. The cost of such appraisal to be borne equally by the city and the purchaser hereof. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section I. That commencing immediately after 12 o'clock midnight on September 30, 1920, the fares that may be charged and collected for passage upon any street car within the city of Paducah, and upon any electric street car system operating under any franchise granted by the city of Paducah, shall be as follows:\n Cash fare for adults ..... 6 cents.\n For children under 12 years of age and over 5 years of age ..... Half fare.\n For children under 5 years when accompanied by any person who is over 5 years of age ..... Nothing.\n Section II. Any person, firm or corporation operating any electric street railway or car within the city of Paducah, or under any franchise granted by the city of Paducah, who shall charge or attempt to collect any greater rate of fares for transportation upon any such electric street car than is provided in section I hereof, shall be guilty of a violation of this ordinance, and each person, firm or corporation so violating said ordinance shall be fined in any sum not less than ten ($10.00) dollars, nor more than twenty ($20.00) dollars for each violation thereof. \n\n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF TRENTON v. STATE OF NEW JERSEY(1923)\nNo. 430\nArgued: March 2, 1923Decided: May 7, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 182, 183]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. V. Dawes, of Trenton, N. J., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. William Newcorn, of Plainfield, N. J., for the State of New Jersey.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The state of New Jersey recovered judgment against the city of Trenton for $14,310, in an action brought in the state Supreme Court. The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals, and is here on writ of error.\n The state's right to recover depends upon the validity of an act of the Legislature (chapter 252, Laws of 1907). The city asserts that this act offends against the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States, and that it takes property owned by the city in its private or proprietary capacity for public use without just compensation and without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The act provides that:\n'Every municipality, corporation or private person now diverting the waters of streams or lakes with outlets for the purpose of a public water supply shall make annual payments on the first day of May to the state treasurer for all such water hereafter diverted in excess of the amount now being legally diverted: Provided, however, no payment shall be required until such legal diversion shall exceed a total amount equal to one hundred \n\n[262 U.S. 182, 184]\n\u00a0\n (100) gallons daily per capita for each inhabitant of the municipality or municipalities supplied, as shown by the census of one thousand nine hundred and five.' Section 8.\n\n The city claims the right to take from the Delaware river all the water that it requires, without limitation as to quantity and without license fee for any part thereof, and that such right was acquired by the president and directors of the Trenton Waterworks (hereinafter called the water company) by grant direct from the state March 24, 1852, and that the city acquired this right by purchase from the water company. Briefly, the basis of the city's claim is as follows:\n By an act of February 29, 1804, the president and directors of the Trenton Waterworks were created a body politic and corporate. They and their successors and assigns were made capable of disposing of water to such as might apply for the same for such annual rent and under such restrictions as they might think proper, and they were authorized to lay and extend their water mains through the streets of the city. Certain springs constituted the company's source of supply, and by reason of increase of population ceased to be adequate. March 24, 1852 (P. L. p. 289 ), a supplement to the above-mentioned act was passed, by which the company was authorized to take the water required either in whole or in part from the Delaware river. Later, March 2, 1855 (P. L. p. 141), an act was passed, authorizing the city to purchase the whole or a majority of the shares of the capital stock of the water company, and the city purchased all of the stock. Thereafter an act of March 1, 1859 (P. L. p. 38), required the company to convey unto 'the inhabitants of the city of Trenton' all the real estate, works and property and all the corporate powers, franchises and privileges of the company, and this conveyance was duly made.\n If the provision of the act of 1907 imposing the license fee is valid as against the city, the judgment is right. \n\n[262 U.S. 182, 185]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Errors and Appeals held that it was valid, that the state under its police power might impose a license fee as specified in the act, and that this does not deprive the city of any contractual or property right.\n The stat undoubtedly has power, and it is its duty, to control and conserve the use of its water resources for the benefit of all its inhabitants, and the act of 1907 was passed pursuant to the policy of the state to prevent waste and to economize its water resources. Decision of the Court of Errors and Appeals in this case, 117 Atl. 158; McCarter v. Hudson Water Co., 70 N. J. Eq. 695, 701, 702, 14 L. R. A. (N. S.) 197, 118 Am. St. Rep. 754, 10 Ann. Cas. 116, affirmed by this court in \n209 \nU.S. 349, 355\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 529, 14 Ann. Cas. 560; Collingswood v. Water-Supply Commission, 84 N. J. Law, 104, 110, 86 Atl. 660; Cobb v. Davenport, 32 N. J. Law, 369, 378. The only way the city could acquire the right to take the water of the Delaware river was by grant from the state or by authorized purchase or condemnation from one to whom the right had been granted by the state. State v. Jersey City, 94 N. J. Law, 431, 433, 111 Atl. 544, 19 A. L. R. 646. The power to determine the conditions upon which waters may be so diverted is a legislative function. The state may grant or withhold the privilege as it sees fit. Assuming in favor of the city, that its grantor received a perpetual right, unburdened by license fee or other charge, to divert all the water required for the use of the city and its inhabitants, does it follow that the state as against the city is bound by contract and is without power to impose a license fee as provided in the act?\n The relations existing between the state and the water company were not the same as those between the state and the city. The company was organized and carried on its business for pecuniary profit. Its rights and property were privately owned and therefore safeguarded by the constitutional provisions here sought to be invoked by the city against the legislation of the state. The city is a political subdivision of the state, created as a convenient \n\n[262 U.S. 182, 186]\n\u00a0\n agency for the exercise of such of the governmental powers of the state as may be intrusted to it. The diversion of waters from the sources of supply for the use of the inhabitants of the state is a proper and legitimate function of the state. This function may be left to private enterprise, subject to regulation by the state; it may be performed directly; or it may be delegated to bodies politic created for that purpose, or to the municipalities of the state. Power to own, maintain and operate public utilities, such as waterworks, gas and electric plants, street railway systems, public markets, and the like is frequently conferred by the states upon their cities and other political subdivisions. For the purpose of carrying on such activities, they are given power to hold and manage personal and real property.\n As said by this court, speaking through Mr. Justice Moody, in Hunter v. Pittsburgh, \n207 \nU.S. 161, 178\n, 179 S., 28 Sup. Ct. 40, 46 (52 L. Ed. 151):\n'The number, nature and duration of the powers conferred upon these corporations and the territory over which they shall be exercised rests in the absolute discretion of the state. Neither their charters, nor any law conferring governmental powers or vesting in them property to be used for governmental purposes, or authorizing them to hold or manage such property, or exempting them from taxation upon it, constitutes a contract with the state, within the meaning of the federal Constitution. The state, therefore, as its pleasure may modify or withdraw all such powers, may take without compensation such property, hold it itself, or vest it in other agencies, expand or contract the territorial area, united the whole or a part of it with another municipality, repeal the charter and destroy the corporation. All this may be done, conditionally or unconditionally, with or without the consent of the citizens, or even against their protest. In all these respects the state is supreme and its legislative body, conforming its action to the state Constitution, \n\n[262 U.S. 182, 187]\n\u00a0\n may do as it will, unrestrained by any provision of the Constitution of the United State . ... The power is in the state and those who legislate for the state are alone responsible for any unjust or oppressive exercise of it.'\n\n In New Jersey it has been held that within the limits prescribed by the state Constitution, the Legislature may delegate to municipalities such portion of political power as they may deem expedient, withholding other powers, and may withdraw any part of that which has been delegated. Van Cleve v. Passaic Valley Sewerage Commissioners, 71 N. J. Law, 183, 198, 58 Atl. 571.\n In the absence of state constitutional provisions safeguarding it to them, municipalities have no inherent right of self-government which is beyond the legislative control of the state. \n1\n A municipality is merely a department of the state, and the state may withhold, grant or withdraw powers and privileges as it sees fit. However great or small its sphere of action, it remains the creature of the state exercising and holding powers and privileges subject to the sovereign will. See Barnes v. District of Columbia, \n91 \nU.S. 540, 544\n, 545 S..\n In Mt. Pleasant v. Beckwith, \n100 \nU.S. 514, 524\n, 525 S. (25 L. Ed. 699), it was held that where a municipal corporation is legislated out of existence and its territory annexed to other corporations, the latter, unless the Legislature otherwise provides, becomes entitled to all its property and immunities. In the opinion it is said (\n100 U.S. 524\n, 525):\n'Institutions of the kind, whether called cities, towns, or counties, are the auxiliaries of the state in the important business of municipal rule; but they cannot have the least pretension to sustain their privileges or their existence upon anything like a contract between themselves and the Legislature of the state, because there is \n\n[262 U.S. 182, 188]\n\u00a0\n not and cannot be any reciprocity of stipulation between the parties, and for the further reason that their objects and duties are utterly incompatible with everything partaking of the nature of compact.'\n\n The power of the state, unrestrained by the contract clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, over the rights and property of cities held and used for 'governmental purposes' cannot be questioned. In Hunter v. Pittsburgh, \n207 U.S. 179\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 40, reference is made to the distinction between property owned by municipal corporations in their public and governmental capacity and that owned by them in their private or proprietary capacity, and decisions of this court which mention that distinction are referred to.2 In none of these cases was any power, right, or property of a city or other political subdivision held to be protected by the Contract Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment. This court has never held that these subdivisions may invoke such restraints upon the power of the state. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n In East Hartford v. Hartford Bridge Co., 10 How. 511, 533, 534, 536, it appeared that for many years a franchise to operate a ferry over the Connecticut river belonged to the town of Hartford, that upon the incorporation of \n\n[262 U.S. 182, 189]\n\u00a0\n East Hartford the Legislature granted to it one-half of the ferry during the pleasure of the General Assembly, and that subsequently, after the building of a bridge across the river, the Legislature discontinued the ferry. It was held that this was not inconsistent with the contract clause of the federal Constitution. The reasons given in the opinion (10 How. 533, 534) support the contention of the state here made that the city cannot possess a contract with the state which may not be changed or regulated by state legislation.\n In Worcester v. Street Railway Co., \n196 \nU.S. 539, 548\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 327, it was held that the obligation of the street railway company to the city to pave and repair streets occupied by it, based on accepted conditions of a municipal ordinance granting right of location, is not private property beyond the legislative control of the state, and that state legislation taxing the company, and there y relieving it from its obligation to the city to pave and repair such streets, was not void as violating the contract clause of the federal Constitution. In the opinion it is said (\n196 \nU.S. 548, 549\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 327, 329):\n'The question then arising is whether the Legislature, in the exercise of its general legislative power, could abrogate the provisions of the contract between the city and the railroad company with the assent of the latter, and provide another and a different method for the paving and repairing of the streets through which the tracks of the railroad company were laid under the permit of their extended location. We have no doubt that the Legislature of the commonwealth had that power. A municipal corporation is simply a political subdivision of the state, and exists by virtue of the exercise of the power of the state through its legislative department. The Legislature could at any time terminate the existence of the corporation itself, and provide other and different means for the government of the district comprised within the limits of \n\n[262 U.S. 182, 190]\n\u00a0\n the former city. The city is the creature of the state'-citing East Hartford v. Hartford Bridge Co., 10 How. 511, 533, 534; United States v. Railroad Co., 17 Wall. 322, 329; New Orleans v. Clark, \n95 U.S. 644\n, 654; Commissioners of Laramie County v. Commissioners of Albany County et al., \n92 U.S. 307\n; Commissioners v. Lucas, \n93 U.S. 108\n, 114.\n\n In Pawhuska v. Pawhuska Oil Co., \n250 \nU.S. 394, 399\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 526, it was held that a legislative grant to a city of the power to regulate rates to be charged to the city and its inhabitants by a gas company might be withdrawn by the state from the city and conferred upon a commission, and that thereby no question was presented under the contract clause of the federal Constitution. In the opinion, after a statement of the issue, it is said (\n250 \nU.S. 397, 398\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 527, 528):\n'Thus the whole controversy is as to which of two existing agencies or arms of the state government is authorized for the time being to exercise in the public interest a particular power, obviously governmental, subject to which the franchise confessedly was granted. In this no question under the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States is involved, but only a question of local law, the decision of which by the Supreme Court of the state is final. ... In New Orleans v. New Orleans Waterworks Co., \n142 U.S. 79\n, where a city, relying on the contract clause, sought a review by this court of a judgment of a state court sustaining a statute so modifying the franchise of a waterworks company as to require the city to pay for water used for municipal purposes, to which it theretofore was entitled without charge, the writ of error was dismissed on the ground that no question of impairment within the meaning of the contract clause was involved.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[262 U.S. 182, 191]\n\u00a0\n The distinction between the municipality as an agent of the state for governmental purposes and as an organization to care for local needs in a private or proprietary capacity has been applied in various branches of the law of municipal corporations. The most numerous illustrations are found in cases involving the question of liability for negligent acts or omissions of its officers and agents. See Harris v. District of Columbia, \n256 U.S. 650\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 610, 14 A. L. R. 1471, and cases cited. It has been held that municipalities are not liable for such acts and omissions in the exercise of the police power, or in the performance of such municipal faculties as the erection and maintenance of a city hall and courthouse, the portection of the city's inhabitants against disease and unsanitary conditions, the care of the sick, the operation of fire departments, the inspection of steam boilers, the promotion of education and the administration of public charities. On the other and, they have been held liable when such acts or omissions occur in the exercise of the power to build and maintain bridges, streets and highways, and waterworks, construct sewers, collect refuse and care for the dump where it is deposited. \n5\n Recovery is denied where the act or omission occurs in the exercise of what are deemed to be governmental powers, and is permitted if it occurs in a proprietary capacity. The basis of the distinction is difficult to state, and there \n\n[262 U.S. 182, 192]\n\u00a0\n is no established rule for the determination of what belongs to the one or the other class. It originated with the courts. Generally it is applied to escape difficulties, in order that injustice may not result from the recognition of technical defenses based upon the governmental character of such corporations. \n6\n But such distinction furnishes no ground for the application of constitutional restraints here sought to be invoked by the city of Trenton against the state of New Jersey. They do not apply as against the state in favor of its own municipalities. We hold that the city cannot invoke these provisions of the federal Constitution against the imposition of the license fee or charge for diversion of water specified in the state law here in question. In view of former opinions of this court, no substantial federal question is presented. Pawhuska v.

U S(1923)\nNo. 255\nArgued: November 15, 1923Decided: November 26, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 341, 342]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas F. Trumbull, of Port Angeles, Wash., and John D. Fletcher and S. Warburton, both of Tacoma, Wash., for Clallam County.\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here upon a certificate from the Circuit Court of Appeals. The suit was brought against the appellants, Clallam County, incorporated by the State of Washington, and its taxing officers, for a decree 'cancelling,' as it is put in the certificate, the taxes levied by the County and State for the years 1919, 1920 and 1921, upon land and other physical property to which the United States Spruce Production Corporation then had the legal title. 283 Fed. 645. The questions certified are (1) whether the District Court of the United States \n\n[263 U.S. 341, 343]\n\u00a0\n had jurisdiction of this suit, and (2) whether the property held by the Spruce Production Corporation is subject to state taxation upon facts the statement of which may be abridged as follows:\n The Act of July 9, 1918, c. 143, subc 16,  1, 40 Stat. 845, 888 ( Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/32g), authorized the Director of Aircraft Production to form one or more corporations under the laws of any state for the purchase, production, manufacture and sale of aircraft, or equipment or materials therefor, and to own and operate railroads in connection therewith, whenever in his judgment it would facilitate the production of aircraft, etc., for the United States and Governments allied with it 'in the prosecution of the present war.' By section 3 (section 3115 1\/32i) within one year from the signing of a treaty of peace with Germany proceedings were to be begun for the dissolution of the corporation so formed. In August, 1918, this corporation was organized under the laws of Washington. The stock except seven shares for the trustees of the corporation was subscribed for by the United States and those shares were controlled by the United States and all property and dividends accruing from them were assigned to the United States. The United States conveyed to the corporation the lands and property now sought to be taxed and a partially performed contract under which these lands were to be acquired and a sawmill and logging railroad were to be built. The corporation issued bonds that were all taken by the United States for cash or in payment for the property conveyed to the company. It proceeded to complete the railroad and mill and to get materials for air craft for the use of the United States in the war and its activities 'were wholly directed to the government's program of production of aeroplane lumber.' After the armistice these activities have been directed to liquidating the corporation's affairs, although to accomplish it some further contracts have been made, but, as we understand, solely for that end. The regulations of the Chief of Air \n\n[263 U.S. 341, 344]\n\u00a0\n Service appointed under the National Defence Act (39 Stat. 166) provide for administrative supervision of the liquidation under the Secretary of War.\n In short the Spruce Production Corporation was organized by the United States as an instrumentality for carrying on the war, all its property was conveyed to it by or bought with money coming from the United States and was used by it solely as means to that end, and when the war was over it stopped its work except so far as it found it necessary to go on in order to wind up its affairs. When the winding up is accomplished there will be a loss, but whatever assets may be realized will go to the United States. Upon these facts immunity is claimed from taxation by a state.\n The immunity is claimed under the Constitution of the United States. It is true that no specific words forbid the tax, but the prohibition established by McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, was established on the ground that the power to tax assumed by the State was in its nature 'repugnant to the Constitutional laws of the Union' and therefore was one that under the Constitution the State could not use. 4 Wheat. 425, 426, 430. The immunity is derived from the Constitution in the same sense and upon the same principle that it would be if expressed in so many words. Therefore this suit arises under the Constitution and the District Court had jurisdiction of the case. Judicial Code, March 3, 1911, c. 231,  24 (Comp. St.  991). The first question must be answered, Yes.\n The State claims the right to tax on the ground that taxation of the agency may be taxation of the means employed by the government and invalid upon admitted grounds, but that taxation of the property of the agent is not taxation of the means. We agree that it 'is not always, or generally, taxation of the means,' as said by Chief Justice Chase in Thomson v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., 9 Wall. 579, 591. But it may be, and in our opinion clearly \n\n[263 U.S. 341, 345]\n\u00a0\n is when as here not only the agent was created but all the agent's property was acquired and used, for the sole purpose of producing a weapon for the war. This is not like the case of a corporation having its own purposes as well as those of the United States and interested in profit on its own account. The incorporation and formal erection of a new personality was only for the convenience of the United States to carry out its ends. It is unnecessary to consider whether the fact that the United States owned all the stock and furnished all the property to the corporation taken by itself would be enough to bring the case within the policy of the rule that exempts property of the United States. Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, \n117 U.S. 151\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 670. It may be that if the United States saw fit to avail itself of machinery furnished by the State it would not escape the tax on that ground alone. But when we add the facts that we have recited we think it too plain for further argument that the tax could not be imposed. See United States Spruce Production Corporation v. Lincoln County (D. C.) 285 Fed. 388; United States v. Coghlan (D. C.) 261 Fed. 425; King County v. United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation (C. C. A.) 282 Fed. 950.

LOISEL(1923)\nNo. 880\nArgued: May 4, 1923Decided: June 4, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 426, 427]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Zach Spearing, of New Orleans, La., and Guion Miller, of Baltimore, Md., for appellant.\n Mr. Robert H. Marr, of New Orleans, La., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is the third appeal by Collins in habeas corpus proceedings instituted to prevent his extradition to British India. After the decision in Collins v. Miller, \n252 U.S. 364\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 347, the District Court dismissed the application for habeas corpus so far as the commitment was based on the charge of obtaining property by false pretenses from Mahomed Alli Zaimel Ali Raza, and remanded Collins to the custody of Loisel, the marshal. The judgment of the District Court discharged the prisoner, so far as the commitment was based on charges of obtaining property by false pretenses from Pohoomul Bros. and from Ganeshi Lall & Sons. The ground of the discharge, stated in the judgment, was that Collins had been remanded to await further proceedings on these charges to the end that he might be given the opportunity of introducing evidence at a preliminary examination under the law of Louisiana; that no further examination had been held; \n\n[262 U.S. 426, 428]\n\u00a0\n that the prosecution on those affidavits had been definitely abandoned; and that other new affidavits had been filed by the British consul general. In this judgment the British consul general acquiesced. Collins appealed. The judgment was affirmed in Collins v. Loisel, \n259 U.S. 309\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 469.\n On those new affidavits, referred to in the judgment, apparently Collins was again committed to await extradition; the papers were transmitted for action to the Department of State with the magistrate's certificate; but, owing to the fact that proceedings were still pending in the District Court, the department refused to issue the warrant of extradition. Thereafter, while the Loisel Case was pending in this court, and while Collins was being held in custody to answer on the charge of obtaining property from Mahomed Alli Zaimel Ali Raza, a third set of affidavits were lodged against the prisoner by the British consul general before the same committing magistrate. They were in form and substance identical with those in which Collins had been previously charged with obtaining property by false pretenses from Pohoomul Bros. and from Ganeshi Lall & Sons and discharged by the District Court. Alleging that the affidavits were identical with those first filed on which he had been so discharged, Collins moved, before the magistrate, to quash the new affidavits. His motion was overruled; and, after due hearing, an order was entered by the magistrate again committing Collins to be held for extradition on these charges. Then he filed, in the same District Court, this petition for a writ of habeas corpus and certiorari. Judgment was entered therein in December, 1922, dismissing this second petition for a writ of habeas corpus; Collins was remanded to the custody of the marshal; and this appeal was taken under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St .  1215). After hearing counsel for appellant, this court on May 4, 1923, ordered that the judgment below be affirmed, and that \n\n[262 U.S. 426, 429]\n\u00a0\n the mandate issue forthwith. Because of the importance of the question presented, the reasons for this decision are now stated.\n Collins contended that commitment on the new affidavits, after discharge in proceeding based on others identical in form and substance, was a violation of the Fifth Amendment and of the Treaty with Great Britain. The constitutional provision against double jeopardy can have no application unless a prisoner has, theretofore, been placed on trial. See Kepner v. United States, 1 \n5 \nU.S. 100, 126\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 797, 1 Ann. Cas. 655. The preliminary examination of one arrested on suspicion of a crime is not a trial; and his discharge by the magistrate upon such examination is not an acquittal. Commonwealth v. Rice, 216 Mass. 480, 104 N. E. 347; People v. Dillon, 197 N. Y. 254, 256, 90 N. E. 820, 18 Ann. Cas. 552. Even the finding of an indictment followed by arraignment, pleading thereto, repeated continuances, and eventually dismissal at the instance of the prosecuting officer on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence to hold the accused, was held, in Bassing v. Cady, \n208 \nU.S. 386, 391\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 392, 13 Ann. Cas. 905, not to constitute jeopardy. Likewise it has been consistently held under the treaties with Great Britain and other countries, that a fugitive from justice may be arrested in extradition proceedings a second time upon a new complaint charging the same crime, where he was discharged by the magistrate on the first complaint or the complaint was withdrawn. \n1\n The precise question appears not to have been passed upon by this court in any case involving international extradition. But in Bassing v. Cady, supra, the rule was applied to a case of interstate rendition. Protection against unjustifiable vexation and harassment incident \n\n[262 U.S. 426, 430]\n\u00a0\n to repeated arrests for the same alleged crime must ordinarily be sought, not in constitutional limitations or treaty provisions, but in a high sense of responsibility on the part of the public officials charged with duties in this connection. The proceedings before the committing magistrate on the first and on the second set of affidavits; and the action of the Department of State on the latter were no bar to the proceedings on the third set of affidavits here involved. The filing by the British consul general of these new affidavits were clearly justified.\n The discharge of Collins on the first petition for habeas corpus, so far as it related to the charge of obtaining property from Pohoomul Bros. and from Ganeshi Lall & Sons does not operate as res judicata. It is true that the Fifth Amendment, in providing against double jeopardy, was not intended to supplant the fundamental principle of res judicata in criminal cases, United States v. Oppenheimer, \n242 U.S. 85\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 68, 3 A. L. R. 516; and that a judgment in habeas corpus proceedings discharging a prisoner held for preliminary examination may operate as res judicata. But the judgment is res judicata only that he was at the time illegally in custody, and of the issues of law and fact necessarily involved in that result. \n2\n The discharge here in question did not go to the right to have Collins held for extradition. It was granted because the proceedings on which he was then held had been irregular and the British consul general, instead of undertaking to correct them, had concluded to abandon them, and to file the charges anew by another set of affidavits.\n The contention was also made that, as the arrest on the new affidavits after discharge on the old was an independent proceeding, and Collins was then being held on an entirely different charge under review by this court \n\n[262 U.S. 426, 431]\n\u00a0\n in the Loisel Case, the magistrate was without jurisdiction. There was here no attempt to interfere by the second proceeding with the custody of Collins on the first. The fact that Collins was in the custody of the court did n t render invalid the second warrant. It would merely prevent withdrawal of the prisoner from the custody of the court by means of the execution of a second warrant. In re MacDonnell, 11 Blatch. 170, 177, 178, Fed. Cas. No. 8772; Compare Ponzi v. Fessenden, \n258 \nU.S. 254, 260\n, 265 S., 42 Sup. Ct. 309, 22 A. L. R. 879. The pendency of habeas corpus proceedings, relating to the charge involved in the Loisel Case, supra, did not deprive the magistrate of jurisdiction to entertain this application for arrest on other charges. Stallings v. Splain, \n253 \nU.S. 339, 342\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 537.\n It was further contended that the magistrate's order of commitment was insufficient, because it adjudged that Collins be held for extradition 'for trial on the charges pending against him in the Chief Presidency Magistrate's Court at Bombay,' and that, since he could legally be tried there only on the charge for which he was extradited, the order of commitment must specifically set forth that crime. United States v. Rauscher, \n119 U.S. 407\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 234. The contention is unsound. The order must of course, be interpreted as limited by the finding therein made, that the evidence produced 'justify his commitment on the charge of having obtained property by false pretenses.' The certificate which the magistrate issued thereon to the Secretary of State identifies the charges as those set forth in the two new affidavits. By established practice, the warrant of extradition issued by the Secretary of State likewise identifies the crime with which the prisoner has been charged and for the trial of which the prisoner is delivered up. Moreover, it may be assumed that the British government will not try appellant upon charges other than those upon which the extradition is allowed. Kelly v. Griffin, \n241 \nU.S. 6, 15\n, 36 S. Sup.

STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA(1923)\nNo. 297\nArgued: January 26, 1923Decided: February 19, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[261 U.S. 236, 237]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. Elliott, and Jo-Berry S. Lyles, both of Columbia, S. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. S. M. Wolfe and J. Fraser Lyon, both of Columbia, S. C., for the State of South Carolina.\n\n\n[261 U.S. 236, 240]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action brought by the state against the defendant ( plaintiff in error) to recover possession of a certain canal property, known as the Columbia Canal, on the ground that the defendant had forfeited the same by reason of its failure to fulfill certain conditions subsequent upon which its continued title depended. Prior to the year 1887 a small canal, following the course of the one now in question was owned by the state; the title being vested in the board of directors of the state penitentiary. In 1887 the Legislature passed an act incorporating the board of canal trustees, to whom the penitentiary directors were required to and did transfer the canal. 19 Stat. S. C. 1090\n\n\n By section 1 of this act, the title to the canal was vested in the trustees for the use and benefit of the city of Columbia, \n\n[261 U.S. 236, 241]\n\u00a0\n subject to the performance of certain obligations therein set forth, and to the proviso:\n'That should the said canal not be completed to Gervais street within seven years from the passage of this act all the rights, powers and privileges guaranteed by this act shall cease, and the said property shall revert to the state.'1\n\n By section 3 they were authorized to construct a dam across Broad river and raise the water in the river so as to get a fall of 37 feet at the south side of Gervais street, provided that the canal be so enlarged as to carry a body of water 150 feet wide at the top, 110 feet wide at the bottom and 10 feet deep and 'develop at least 10,000 horse power at the south side of Gervais street.'\n By section 5 the canal was to be opened for navigation free of charge.\n By section 7 the trustees were required to complete the canal within two years so as to carry a body of water of the dimensions \n\n[261 U.S. 236, 242]\n\u00a0\n stated from the source of the canal down to Gervais street and to furnish free of charge 500 horse power to the state, 500 horse power to Sullivan Fenner and 500 horse power to the city of Columbia, and 'as soon as is practicable, complete the canal down to the Congaree river, a few yards above the mouth of Rocky branch.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n By a subsequent act, passed in 1890, the trustees were authorized to 'sell, alienate and transfer' the property subject 'to all the duties and liabilities imposed thereby [that is, by the act of 1887], and subject to all contracts, liabilities and obligations made and entered into by said board. ...' 20 Stat. S. C. 967,  2. Under this statute the canal was sold to defendant's pr decessor, whose title the defendant now has.\n The case turns upon the provision contained in section 7, requiring the trustees, as soon as practicable, to complete the canal down to the Congaree river, and depends upon whether this is a condition subsequent, the failure to perform which incurs a forfeiture, or is a covenant the breach of which gives rise to another form of remedy. \n\n[261 U.S. 236, 243]\n\u00a0\n That the provision has not been complied with is not disputed.\n The Legislature, in 1917, passed an act (30 Stat. S. C. 348), which begins with a preamble reciting certain of the provisions of the act of 1887, including that relating to the completion of the canal down to the Congaree river, and declaring that there had been a failure to fulfill the conditions imposed by that act. By section 1 it is then enacted that these conditions have not been complied with but have been disregarded, by reason whereof the right, title and interest 'transferred by virtue of said acts, have been forfeited and reverted to the state.' By section 2 the Attorney General, and other officers named, are directed, within 90 days, to make such re-entry for the state as might be necessary and proper under the circumstances and to take such steps as might be lawful and proper to obtain possession and control of the property and improvements placed thereon, unless satisfactory arrangements be made by the claimants of the canal. By section 3 the Attorney General is directed, at the time of re-entry or thereafter, to commence such proceedings as might be proper in any of the courts of the state to assert the right of the state to said property and improvements.\n In pursuance of the act last referred to this action was brought in a state court of common pleas. The complaint alleged that the defendant had failed to complete the canal as soon as practicable down to the Congaree river, and had failed to comply with the provisions of the act of 1887 in other particulars. The other alleged violations may be dismissed from consideration, since the judgment of the trial court is based alone upon the one just specified, and its judgment is affirmed by the state Supreme Court without reference to the others.\n That the legislation of 1887 and 1890, and the transactions based thereon, establish a contract between the \n\n[261 U.S. 236, 244]\n\u00a0\n state and the defendant is clear. The remaining inquiries are: (1) What is the pertinent obligation of this contract? and (2) has that obligation been impaired, in violation of article 1, section 10, of the Constitution?\n We are met at the threshold with a challenge on the part of the state to our jurisdiction, and this must first be considered. The judgment of the state court, it is asserted, was based upon its own construction of the contract and not at all upon the act of 1917.\n As this court has repeatedly ruled, the Constitution affords no protection as against an impairment by judicial decision.

Ct. 62, and cases cited.\n If, therefore, the judgment, although in effect impairing the obligation of the contract, nevertheless proceeds upon reasons apart from and without giving effect to the statute, this court is without jurisdiction to review it.

If the judgment of the state court gives no effect to the subsequent law of the state, and the state court decides the case upon grounds independent of that law, a case is not made for review by this court upon any ground of the impairment of a contract.' \n\n[261 U.S. 236, 245]\n\u00a0\n But, although the state court may have construed the contract and placed its decision distinctly upon its own construction, if it appear, upon examination, that in real substance and effect, force has been given to the statute complained of our jurisdiction attaches. In Houston & Texas C. R. Co. v. Texas, \n177 \nU.S. 66, 77\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 545, 549 (44 L. Ed. 673), this court said:\n\n'Thus we see that, although the decision of the state court was based upon the ground that the warrants in which these payments were made had been issued in utter violation of the state Constitution, and were hence void, and that no payments made with such warrants had any validity, and although this ground of invalidity was arrived at without any reference made to the act of 1870, yet the necessary consequence of the judgment was that effect was thereby given to that act, and in a manner which the company has always claimed to be illegal and unwarranted by the act when properly construed. The company has never accepted such a construction, but, on the contrary, has always opposed it, and raises the question in this proceeding at the very outset. Upon these facts this court has jurisdiction, and it is its duty to determine for itself the existence, construction and validity of the alleged contract, and also to determine whether, as construed by this court, it has been impaired by any subsequent state legislation to which effect has been given by the court below. Bridge Proprietors v. Hoboken Company, 1 Wall. 116; University v. People, \n99 U.S. 309\n; Fisk v. Jefferson Police Jury, \n116 U.S. 131\n; New Orleans Water Works Company v. Louisiana Sugar Refining Company, \n125 U.S. 18\n; Central Land Company v. Laidley, \n159 U.S. 103\n, 109; Bacon v. Texas, \n163 U.S. 207\n, 216; McCullough v. Virginia, \n172 U.S. 102\n.'\n\n The record before us in the present case plainly discloses that the basis for bringing the action against the defendant was the act of 1917. The complaint alleges at \n\n[261 U.S. 236, 246]\n\u00a0\n considerable length the provisions of the Act of 1887 and the various transactions resulting in the acquisition of the property by the defendant and its consequent assumption of the obligations contained in that statute. The provisions of the act of 1917, as heretofore recited, are then set forth, followed by a statement of certain negotiations had with the defendant, and it is then alleged that the Attorney General and the other officers mentioned, not considering it appropriate and proper to commit a breach of the peace by making forcible entry upon the property and taking possession thereof, have, therefore, by virtue of section 3 of said act instituted this action.\n The sufficiency of the complaint was challenged by demurrer, upon the ground, among others, that the contract in question was impaired by the act of 1917. The demurrer having been overruled, an answer was filed, alleging such impairment and this claim was asserted and insisted upon at every stage of the proceedings to their conclusion in the state Supreme Court.\n The trial court, in passing upon the demurrer, referred to the act of 1917 as authorizing a judicial proceeding and held that, coupled with a demand for possession and refusal, it was equivalent to the exercise of the right of re-entry. Upon the trial of the case that court said that the declaration in this act that there had been a failure to perform the conditions of the contract was entitled to some respect, but the court had the right to inquire into the facts and determine whether as found by the Legislature they were true. It further held that that act was binding on the court under the evidence. It is apparent that the trial court gave effect to he act of 1917, although the precise extent is not clearly disclosed. Whatever it was, it entered into and affected the judgment and this judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court.\n We accord to this ruling the respect which we must always give to the decisions of an appellate tribunal of a \n\n[261 U.S. 236, 247]\n\u00a0\n state, but, as will presently appear, we have arrived at a result respecting the merits at variance with that pronounced, a result which seems to us manifestly right and forces us to conclude that the construction put upon the contract by the state courts could only have been reached by giving effect to the statute of 1917. What was said in Terre Haute, etc., Railroad Co. v. Indiana, \n194 \nU.S. 579, 589\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 767, 769 (48 L. Ed. 1124) is apposite and controlling:\n'The state court has sustained a result which cannot be reached, except on what we deem a wrong construction of the charter, without relying on unconstitutional legislation. It clearly did rely upon that legislation to some extent, but exactly how far is left obscure. We are of opinion that we cannot decline jurisdiction of a case which certainly never would have been brought but for the passage of flagrantly unconstitutional laws, because the state court put forward the untenable construction more than the unconstitutional statutes in its judgment. To hold otherwise would open an easy method of avoiding the jurisdiction of this court.'\n\n And see Detroit United Ry. v. Michigan, \n242 U.S. 238\n, 246-248, 37 Sup. Ct. 87.\n The jurisdiction of this court is, therefore, upheld, and we proceed to the consideration of the case on its merits; and here the crucial question is: What is the nature of the contractual obligation with which the judgment of the state court deals?\n By the act of 1887 numberous obligations were imposed on the canal trustees and their assigns, among them: (a) To complete the canal within two years so as to carry a designated body of water to Gervais street; (b) furnish a measure of 1,500 horse power to the state and others; (c) keep the canal open for navigation free of charge, and (d) complete the canal as soon as practicable down to the Congaree river. No provision is made in respect of the consequences to result in case of a failure to perform any \n\n[261 U.S. 236, 248]\n\u00a0\n of these obligations. The only specific provision suggesting a forfeiture is:\n'That should the said canal not be completed to Gervais street within seven years ... all the rights, powers and privileges granted by this act shall cease and the said property shall revert to the state.'\n\n The effect of the acts of 1887 and 1890, and the subsequent transactions based on them, was to vest in the defendant title to the property in fee; and for this the consideration moving from the defendant was valuable and substantial. Did the failure to comply with the provision requiring completion of the canal to the Congaree river divest defendant of this title?\n We begin the inquiry with the general rule before us that 'conditions subsequent, especially when relied on to work a forfeiture, must be created by express terms or clear implication, and are construed strictly' ( 2 Washburn on Real Property [6th Ed.]  942), and that 'courts always construe clauses in deeds as covenants rather than conditions, if they can reasonably do so' (Id.  938). Here there are no express terms creating, and no words such as are commonly used to introduce, a condition; nor is there any provision giving the right of re-entry upon failure to perform. It is urged by the state Supreme Court that the legislative intention must be gathered from the statute as a whole, to be read in the light of its dominant purpose which was to connect the waters of the Broad and Congaree rivers above and below shoal water, so as to promote navigation; the other purposes, though important, being subsidiary. But the purpose to accomplish this result is equally consistent with the view which regards the provision in question as a covenant, the only difference being that the remedy for a b each would be different and less drastic. In Oregon & California R. R. Co. v. United States, \n238 U.S. 393\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 908, this court was called upon to construe the proviso in a land grant act to the \n\n[261 U.S. 236, 249]\n\u00a0\n effect that the lands granted must be sold only to actual settlers, etc., and it was held that this did not constitute a condition subsequent, but an enforceable covenant. In the course of the opinion (\n238 U.S. 419\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 919 [59 L. Ed. 1360]) it was said:\n'It appears, therefore, that the acts of Congress have no such certainty as to establish forfeiture of the grants as their sanction, nor necessity for it to secure the accomplishment of their purposes- either of the construction of the road or sale to actual settlers-and we think the principle must govern that conditions subsequent are not favored but are always strictly construed, and where there are doubts whether a clause be a covenant or condition the courts will incline against the latter construction; indeed, always construe clauses in deeds as covenants rather than as conditions, if it is possible to do so.'\n\n And see Woodruff v. Woodruff, 44 N. J. Eq. 349, 353, 16 Atl. 4, 1 L. R. A. 380.\n Moreover, the conveyance was absolute and for a valuable consideration, and a mere purpose to attain a particular end, however it may have influenced the legislation, could not have the effect of debasing the fee. See Stuart v. Easton, \n170 U.S. 383\n, 394-397, 18 Sup. Ct. 650, 655 (42 L. Ed. 1078) where this court said:\n'While the proprietaries may have been mainly influenced in making the grant by a desire to advance the interests of the town, or were actuated by motives of charity, yet the transaction was not a mere gift, but was upon a valuable consideration, and it was the evident intention of the grantors to convey all their estate or interest in the land for the benefit of the county. The declaration in the patent of the purposes for which the land was to be held, conjoined as it was with a reference to the act of the assembly wherein the trust was created, could not have the effect of qualifying the grant of the fee simple, any more than if the declaration of the purposes for which the land was to be held had been omitted and a declaration of the trust made in an independent instrument.'\n\n Not only does the statute contain no positive terms creating, or words requiring the provision in question to \n\n[261 U.S. 236, 250]\n\u00a0\n be construed as, a condition subsequent, but the clear implication is to the contrary. The clause relating to the section or the cannal down to Gervais street is expressly that upon failure to complete in seven years the property shall revert to the state. In contrast, it is significant that no forfeiture is specifically prescribed with respect to the noncompletion of the Congaree section of the canal. If this requirement, nevertheless, be construed as a condition subsequent, there can be no rational ground for holding that the other obligations of the contract are not susceptible of a like construction. Among these obligations is that requiring the completion of the canal to Gervais street in two years; but the express provision for a forfeiture for failure to complete it in seven years, negatives, as a matter of logical necessity, any suggestion that a forfeiture would be incurred for a failure to complete in two years. The inference, as applied to the other obligations, including that now in question, while not so direct and obvious, is, nevertheless, one which naturally flows from the premises.\n The proviso for a forfeiture in the one case is at least strongly persuasive of an intention not to impose it in other cases not so qualified. When, in addition to this, we consider all the circumstances, including the fact that the sale to the defendant was absolute and for a valuable consideration, that there are no express terms creating a condition, no clause of re-entry nor words of any sort indicating such purpose, the conclusion is unavoidable that the obligation in quest on is a covenant and not a condition subsequent. Board of Commissioners v. Young, 59 Fed. 96, 8 C. C. A. 27; opinion by Judge, afterward Justice, Lurton. We quote from page 105 of 59 Fed., from page 36 of 8 C. C. A.:\n'That the grantor ever contemplated a reverter is not to be presumed, in the light of the presence of absolute words of conveyance and quitclaim, and the absence of any provision for a reverter or re- entry. If it had been intended that the conveyance should terminate on an \n\n[261 U.S. 236, 251]\n\u00a0\n abandonment of the public use, it is strange that some language was not used indicative of such purpose. Too much weight was attached to the circumstance that the city wished the title in order to maintain a suit against a trespasser. Such suit could have been maintained without the title. Too little weight has been given to the fact that the deed was upon a valuable consideration; to the fact that it was a quitclaim of all right, title, and interest; to the fact of a previous common law dedication; and to the failure, under such circumstances, to make the title subject to an express right of re- entry. The minuteness of direction concerning the administration of property conveyed to a public use is insufficient to take the case out of the rule, supported by an overwhelming weight of authority, that the mere expression of a purpose or particular use to which property is to be appropriated will not make the estate a conditional one.'\n\n The effect of the act of 1917 is to convert that which we have held to be a covenant into a condition subsequent and to impose as a penalty for its violation the forfeiture of an extensive and valuable property. It requires no argument to demonstrate that this constitutes an impairment of the contract here involved, in violation of the Constitution. The impairment of a contract may consist in increasing its burdens as well as in diminishing its efficiency.\n'Any deviation from its terms, by postponing, or accelerating, the period of performance which it prescribes, imposing conditions not expressed in the contract, or dispensing with the performance of those which are, however minute, or apparently immaterial, in their effect upon the contract of the parties, impairs its obligation.' Green v. Biddle, 8 Wheat. 1, 84 (5 L. Ed. 547).\n\n See, also, Boise City Co. v. Boise Artesian Hot & Cold Water Co., \n230 \nU.S. 84, 90\n, 92 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 997.\n The judgment of the state Supreme Court is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Section 1.

OF MASSACHUSETTS v. MELLON(1923)\n\nArgued: Decided: June 4, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 447, 448]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D.

L. Rawls and George Arnold Frick, both of Baltimore, Md., and William H. Lamar and Lucius Q. C. Lamar, both of Washington, D. C., for Frothingham.\n\n\n[262 U.S. 447, 478]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases were argued and will be considered and disposed of together. The first is an original suit in this court. The other was brought in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. That court dismissed the bill and its decree was affirmed by the District Court of Appeals. Thereupon the case was brought here by appeal. \n\n[262 U.S. 447, 479]\n\u00a0\n Both cases challenge the constitutionality of the Act of November 23, 1921, 42 Stat. 224, c. 135, commonly called the Maternity Act. Briefly, it provides for an initial appropriation and thereafter annual appropriations for a period of five years, to be apportioned among such of the several states as shall accept and comply with its provisions, for the purpose of co-operating with them to reduce maternal and infant mortality and protect the health of mothers and infants. It creates a bureau to administer the act in co-operation with state agencies, which are required to make such reports concerning their operations and expenditures as may be prescribed by the federal bureau. Whenever that bureau shall determine that funds have not been properly expended in respect of any state, payments may be withheld.\n It is asserted that these appropriations are for purposes not national, but local to the states, and together with numerous similar appropriations constitute an effective means of inducing the states to yield a portion of their sovereign rights. It is further alleged that the burden of the appropriations provided by this act and similar legislation falls unequally upon the several states, and rests largely upon the industrial states, such as Massachusetts; that the act is a usurpation of power not granted to Congress by the Constitution-an attempted exercise of the power of local self-government reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment; and that the defendants are proceeding to carry the act into operation. In the Massachusetts Case it is alleged that the plaintiff's rights and powers as a sovereign state and the rights of its citizens have been invaded and usurped by these expenditures and acts, and that, although the state has not accepted the act, its constitutional rights are infringed by the passage thereof and the imposition upon the state of an illegal and unconstitutional option either to yield to the federal government a part of its reserved rights or \n\n[262 U.S. 447, 480]\n\u00a0\n lose the share which it would otherwise be entitled to receive of the moneys appropriated. In the Frothingham Case plaintiff alleges that the effect of the statute will be to take her property, under the guise of taxation, without due process of law.\n We have reached the conclusion that the cases must be disposed of for want of jurisdiction, without considering the merits of the constitutional questions.\n In the first case, the state of Massachusetts presents no justiciable controversy, either in its own behalf or as the repres ntative of its citizens. The appellant in the second suit has no such interest in the subject-matter, nor is any such injury inflicted or threatened, as will enable her to sue.\n First. The state of Massachusetts in its own behalf, in effect, complains that the act in question invades the local concerns of the state, and is a usurpation of power, viz. the power of local self-government, reserved to the states.\n Probably it would be sufficient to point out that the powers of the state are not invaded, since the statute imposes no obligation but simply extends an option which the state is free to accept or reject. But we do not rest here. Under article 3,  2, of the Constitution, the judicial power of this court extends 'to controversies ... between a state and citizens of another state' and the court has original jurisdiction 'in all cases ... in which a state shall be a party.' The effect of this is not to confer jurisdiction upon the court merely because a state is a party, but only where it is a party to a proceeding of judicial cognizance. Proceedings not of a justiciable character are outside the contemplation of the constitutional grant. In Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co., \n127 \nU.S. 265, 289\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 1370, 1373 (32 L. Ed. 239), Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for the court, said:\n'As to 'controversies between a state and citizens of another state': The object of vesting in the courts of \n\n[262 U.S. 447, 481]\n\u00a0\n the United States jurisdiction of suits by one state against the citizens of another was to enable such controversies to be determined by a national tribunal, and thereby to avoid the partiality, or suspicion of partiality, which might exist if the plaintiff state were compelled to resort to the courts of the state of which the defendants were citizens. Federalist, No. 80; Chief Justice Jay, in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, 475; Story on the Constitution,  1638, 1682. The grant is of 'judicial power,' and was not intended to confer upon the courts of the United States jurisdiction of a suit or prosecution by the one state, of such a nature that it could not, on the settled principles of public and international law, be entertained by the judiciary of the other state at all.'\n\n That was an action brought by the state of Wisconsin to enforce a judgment of one of its own courts for a penalty against a resident of another state, and, in pursuance of the doctrine announced by the language just quoted, this court declined to assume jurisdiction upon the ground that the courts of no country will execute the penal laws of another.\n In an earlier case it was held that a proceeding by mandamus by one state to compel the Governor of another to surrender a fugitive from justice was not within the powers of the judicial department, since the duty of the Governor in the premises was in the nature of a moral rather than a legal obligation. Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 109. In New Hampshire v. Louisiana and New York v. Louisiana, \n108 U.S. 76\n, 2 Sup. Ct. 176, this court declined to take jurisdiction of actions to enforce payment of the bonds of another state for the benefit of the assignors, citizens of the plaintiff states. In Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, 75, and kindred cases, to which we shall presently refer, jurisdiction was denied in respect of questions of a political or governmental character. On the other hand, jurisdiction was maintained in Texas v. White, 7 \n\n[262 U.S. 447, 482]\n\u00a0\n Wall. 700, The State of Florida v. Anderson, \n91 U.S. 667\n, and Alabama v. Burr, \n115 U.S. 413\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 81, because proprietary rights were involved; in Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., \n206 \nU.S. 230, 237\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 618, 11 Ann. Cas. 488, because the right of dominion of the state over the air and soil within its dominion was affected; in Missouri v. Holland, \n252 U.S. 416\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 382, 11 A. L. R. 984, because, as asserted, there was an invasion, by acts done and threatened, of the quasi sovereign right of the state to regulate the taking of wild game within its borders; and in other cases because boundaries were in dispute. It is not necessary to cite additional cases. The foregoing for present purposes sufficiently indicate the jurisdictional line of demarcation.\n What, then, is the nature of the right of the state here asserted and how is it affected by this statute? Reduced to its simplest terms, it is alleged that the statute constitutes an attempt to legislate outside the powers granted to Congress by the Constitution and within the field of local powers exclusively reserved to the states. Nothing is added to the force or effect of this assertion by the further incidental allegations that the ulterior purpose of Congress thereby was to induce the states to yield a portion of their sovereign rights; that the burden of the appropriations falls unequally upon the several states; and that there is imposed upon the states an illegal and unconstitutional option either to yield to the federal government a part of their reserved rights or lose their share of the moneys appropriated. But what burden is imposed upon the states, unequally or otherwise? Certainly there is none, unless it be the burden of taxation, and that falls upon their inhabitants, who are within the taxing power of Congress as well as that of the states where they reside. Nor does the statute require the states to do or to yield anything. If Congress enacted it with the ulterior purpose of tempting them to yield, that purpose may be effectively frustrated by the simple expedient of not yielding. \n\n[262 U.S. 447, 483]\n\u00a0\n In the last analysis, the complaint of the plaintiff state is brought to the naked contention that Congress has usurped the reserved powers of the several states by the mere enactment of the statute, though nothing has been done and nothing is to be done without their consent; and it is plain that that question, as it is thus presented, is political, and not judicial in character, and therefore is not a matter which admits of the exercise of the judicial power.\n In Georgia v. Stanton, supra, this court held that a bill to enjoin the Secretary of War, and other officers, from carrying into execution certain acts of Congress, which it was asserted would annul and abolish the existing state government and establish another and different one in its place, called for a judgment upon a political question and presented no case within the jurisdiction of the court. Mr. Justice Nelson, speaking for the court, said (6 Wall. 77):\n'That these matters, both as stated in the body of the bill, and, in the prayers for relief, call for the judgment of the court upon political questions, and, upon rights, not of persons or property, but of a political character, will hardly be denied. For the rights for the protection of which our authority is invoked, are the rights of sovereignty, of political jurisdiction, of government, of corporate existence as a state, with all its constitutional powers and privileges. No case of private rights or private property, infringed, or in danger of actual or threatened infringement, is presented by the bill, in a judicial form, for the judgment of the court.'\n\n In Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, an injunction was sought to prevent certain acts of legislation from being carried into execution within the territory of the Cherokee Nation of Indians, the original jurisdiction of this court being invoked on the ground that plaintiff was a foreign nation. It was asserted that the acts in question, \n\n[262 U.S. 447, 484]\n\u00a0\n if executed, would have the effect of subverting the tribal government and subjecting the Indians to the jurisdiction of the state of Georgia. It was held that the Cherokee Nation could not be regarded as a foreign nation, within the meaning of the Judiciary Act (1 Stat. 73), but Chief Justice Marshall, delivering the opinion for the majority, said, further (5 Pet. 20):\n'That part of t e bill which respects the land occupied by the Indians, and prays the aid of the court to protect their possession, may be ... doubtful. The mere question of right might perhaps be decided by this court in a proper case with proper parties. But the court is asked to do more than decide on the title. The bill requires us to control the Legislature of Georgia, and to restrain the exertion of its physical force. The propriety of such an interposition by the court may well be questioned. It savors too much of the exercise of political power to be within the proper province of the judicial department.'\n\n And Mr. Justice Thompson, with whom Mr. Justice Story concurred, in the course of an opinion, said (6 Wall. 75):\n'It is only where the rights of persons or property are involved, and when such rights can be presented under some judicial form of proceedings, that courts of justice can interpose relief.\n\n'This court can have no right to pronounce an abstract opinion upon the constitutionality of a state law. Such law must be brought into actual, or threatened operation upon rights properly falling under judicial cognizance, or a remedy is not to be had here.'\n\n See, also, Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1; Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475, 500; Pacific Telephone Co. v. Oregon, \n223 U.S. 118\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 224; Louisiana v. Texas, \n176 \nU.S. 1, 23\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 251; Fairchild v. Hughes, \n258 U.S. 126\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 274.\n It follows that, in so far as the case depends upon the assertion of a right on the part of the state to sue in its own behalf, we are without jurisdiction. In that aspect of the case we are called upon to adjudicate, not rights of \n\n[262 U.S. 447, 485]\n\u00a0\n person or property, not rights of dominion over physical domain, not quasi sovereign rights actually invaded or threatened, but abstract questions of political power, of sovereignty, of government. No rights of the state falling within the scope of the judicial power have been brought within the actual or threatened operation of the statute, and this court is as much without authority to pass abstract opinions upon the constitutionality of acts of Congress as it was held to be, in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, supra, of state statutes. If an alleged attempt by congressional action to annul and abolish an existing state government 'with all its constitutional powers and privileges,' presents no justiciable issue, as was ruled in Georgia v. Stanton, supra, no reason can be suggested why it should be otherwise where the attempt goes no farther, as it is here alleged, than to propose to share with the state the field of state power.\n We come next to consider whether the suit may be maintained by the state as the representative of its citizens. To this the answer is not doubtful. We need not go so far as to say that a state may never intervene by suit to protect its citizens against any form of enforcement of unconstitutional acts of Congress; but we are clear that the right to do so does not arise here. Ordinarily, at least, the only way in which a state may afford protection to its citizens in such cases is through the enforcement of its own criminal statutes, where that is appropriate, or by opening its courts to the injured persons for the maintenance of civil suits or actions. But the citizens of Massachusetts are also citizens of the United States. It cannot be conceded that a state, as parens patriae, may institute judicial proceedings to protect citizens of the United States from the operation of the statutes thereof. While the state, under some circumstances, may sue in that capacity for the protection of its citizens (Missouri v. Illinois and Chicago District, \n180 \nU.S. 208, 241\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 331), it is no \n\n[262 U.S. 447, 486]\n\u00a0\n part of its duty or power to enforce their rights in respect of their relations with the federal government. In that field it is the United States, and not the state, which represents them as parens patriae, when such repres ntation becomes appropriate; and to the former, and not to the latter, they must look for such protective measures as flow from that status.\n Second. The attack upon the statute in the Frothingham Case is, generally, the same, but this plaintiff alleges, in addition that she is a taxpayer of the United States; and her contention, though not clear, seems to be that the effect of the appropriations complained of will be to increase the burden of future taxation and thereby take her property without due process of law. The right of a taxpayer to enjoin the execution of a federal appropriation act, on the ground that it is invalid and will result in taxation for illegal purposes, has never been passed upon by this court. In cases where it was presented, the question has either been allowed to pass sub silentio or the determination of it expressly withheld. Millard v. Roberts, \n202 \nU.S. 429, 438\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 674; Wilson v. Shaw, \n204 \nU.S. 24, 31\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 233; Bradfield v. Roberts, \n175 \nU.S. 291, 295\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 121. The case last cited came here from the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, and that court sustained the right of the plaintiff to sue by treating the case as one directed against the District of Columbia, and therefore subject to the rule, frequently stated by this court, that resident taxpayers may sue to enjoin an illegal use of the moneys of a municipal corporation. Roberts v. Bradfield, 12 App. D. C. 453, 459, 460. The interest of a taxpayer of a municipality in the application of its moneys is direct and immediate and the remedy by injunction to prevent their misuse is not inappropriate. It is upheld by a large number of state cases and is the rule of this court. Crampton v. Zabriskie, \n101 U.S. 601\n, 609. Nevertheless, there are decisions to the contrary. See, \n\n[262 U.S. 447, 487]\n\u00a0\n for example, Miller v. Grandy, 13 Mich. 540, 550. The reasons which support the extension of the equitable remedy to a single taxpayer in such cases are based upon the peculiar relation of the corporate taxpayer to the corporation, which is not without some resemblance to that subsisting between stockholder and private corporation. 4 Dillon, Municipal Corporations (5th Ed.)  1580 et seq. But the relation of a taxpayer of the United States to the federal government is very different. His interest in the moneys of the treasury-partly realized from taxation and partly from other sources-is shared with millions of others, is comparatively minute and indeterminable, and the effect upon future taxation, of any payment out of the funds, so remote, fluctuating and uncertain, that no basis is afforded for an appeal to the preventive powers of a court of equity.\n The administration of any statute, likely to produce additional taxation to be imposed upon a vast number of taxpayers, the extent of whose several liability is indefinite and constantly changing, is essentially a matter of public and not of individual concern. If one taxpayer may champion and litigate such a cause, then every other taxpayer may do the same, not only in respect of the statute here under review, but also in respect of every other appropriation act and statute whose administration requires the outlay of public money, and whose validity may be questioned. The bare suggestion of such a result, with its attendant inconveniences, goes far to sustain the conclusion which we have reached, that a suit of this character cannot be maintained. It is of much significance that no precedent sustaining the right to maintain suits like this has been called to our attention, although, since the formation of the government, as an examination of the acts of Congress will disclose, a large number of statutes appropriating or involving the expenditure \n\n[262 U.S. 447, 488]\n\u00a0\n of moneys for nonfederal purposes have been enacted and carried into effect.\n The functions of government under our system are apportioned. To the legislative department has been committed the duty of making laws, to the executive the duty of executing them, and to the judiciary the duty of interpreting and applying them in cases properly brought before the courts. The general rule is that neither department may invade the province of the other and neither may control, direct, or restrain the action of the other. We are not now speaking of the merely ministerial duties of officials. Gaines v. Thompson, 7 Wall. 347. We have no power per se to review and annul acts of Congress on the ground that they are unconstitutional. That question may be considered only when the justification for some direct injury suffered or threatened, presenting a justiciable issue, is made to rest upon such an act. Then the power exercised is that of ascertaining and declaring the law applicable to the controversy. It amounts to little more than the negative power to disregard an unconstitutional enactment, which otherwise would stand in the way of the enforcement of a legal right. The party who invokes the power must be able to show, not only that the statute is invalid, but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally. If a case for preventive relief be presented, the court enjoins, in effect, not the execution of the statute, but the acts of the official, the statute notwithstanding. Here the parties plaintiff have no such case. Looking through forms of words to the substance of their complaint, it is merely that officials of the executive department of the government are executing and will execute an act of Congress asserted to be unconstitutional; and this we are asked to prevent. To \n\n[262 U.S. 447, 489]\n\u00a0\n do so would be, not to decide a judicial controversy, but to assume a position of authority over the governmental acts of another and coequal department, an authority which plainly we do not possess. \n No. 24\n, Original, dismissed.\n No. 962 affirmed. \n\n\n\n","47":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOM.

Although distinct, the suits are so much alike that they have been presented at the bar substantially as a single case. They will be dealt with accordingly in this opinion. \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 582]\n\u00a0\n The West Virginia act is set forth at length in the margin. \n1\n The complainants challenge its validity on the ground that it directly interferes with interstate commerce and therefore contravenes the commerce clause of \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 583]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution of the United States (article 1,  8, cl. 3), and they rest their right to relief on the grounds that to enforce the act will subject them to irreparable injury in respect of many of their public institutions and governmental agencies, which \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 584]\n\u00a0\n long have been and now are using this gas, and will subject them to further and incalculable injury, in that (a) it will imperil the health and comfort of thousands of their people who use the gas in their homes and are largely \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 585]\n\u00a0\n dependent thereon; and (b) will halt or curtail many industries which seasonally use great quantities of the gas and wherein thousands of persons are employed and millions of taxable wealth are invested. \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 586]\n\u00a0\n The conditions out of which the suits have arisen and the facts material to their disposal are as follows:\n Natural gas is found at pronounced depths in porous strata-usually sand rock-constituting a natural reservoir, and is brought to the surface and reduced to possession through wells drilled into the containing strata. When a surface owner thus reduces it to possession he becomes its owner, and it becomes a subject of commerce, like any product of the forest, field, or mine. In the inclosing strata it is under great pressure, called rock pressure, which causes it to flow out rapidly when the strata are penetrated. If one surface owner drills wells and begins to draw off the gas, others desiring to exercise their common right must take the same course, for otherwise the g  under their lands may be drained out by those wells. After the gas is drawn from the inclosing strata there is no practicable mode of storing and holding it. It must be used promptly. Its chief use consists in producing heat and light by burning it. The points of use generally are in centers of population or of industry more or less remote from the places of production. The intervening transmission is effected through pipe lines. The normal rock pressure will carry the gas considerable distances and when that pressure wanes or is inadequate it can be supplemented by using compressors.\n In West Virginia the production of natural gas began as much as 30 years ago and for the last 14 years has been greater than in any other state. The producing fields include 32 of her 55 counties. At first the gas was produced only in the course of oil operations, was regarded as a nuisance and was permitted to waste into the air. But it soon came to be regarded as valuable for heating and lighting, and the economy and convenience attending its use made it a preferred fuel. Its use within the state became relatively general, but was far less than the production, so the producers turned \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 587]\n\u00a0\n to neighboring states, notably Pennsylvania and Ohio, for a further market.\n West Virginia sanctioned that effort. She permitted the formation under her laws of corporations for the purpose of constructing pipe lines from her gas fields into other states and carrying gas into the latter and there selling it; she also permitted corporations of other states to come into her territory for that purpose; and she extended to all these companies the use of her power of eminent domain in acquiring rights of way for their pipe lines. In no way did she then require, or assert any power to require, that consumers within her limits be preferred over consumers elsewhere. The effort to find a further market succeeded, and the gas came to be extensively carried into Pennsylvania as far as Pittsburgh, and into Ohio as far as Cleveland, Toledo, and Cincinnati. In that way the entire production was made of value to the producers. Landowners and lessees in the gas fields were greatly benefited and the taxable wealth of the state was largely increased. Approximately $300,000, 000 were invested in the business-fully one-half in West Virginia. More than 7,000 miles of the pipe lines are in that state-2,000 miles being trunk lines.\n Some of the pipe lines reach from the producing fields to the areas of consumption in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Some connect at or near the state line with others leading to the consuming areas. All are so operated that there is a continuous flow of gas from points of production to points of use. Branch lines divert some of the gas at intervening points, but without changing the general flow. Several lines cross and recross the state boundary repeatedly.\n The pipe lines are all operated as public utilities, that is, in supplying gas to the public, and this is true in Pennsylvania and Ohio as well as in West Virginia. The lines long have been and now are supplying gas to the \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 588]\n\u00a0\n three states for use in their charitable, educational, and penal institutions, to their counties and municipalities for use in county, city, and school buildings, to local utilities serving particular communities, to the people generally in many cities and towns for use in their homes, places of business, and offices, and, in seasons when there is an adequate supply, to industrial plants for use in their operation. The predominant use is for fuel purposes; that for lighting being relatively small. All gas going into Pennsylvania and Ohio is carried and supplied under prior engagements respecting its disposal-most of it under long time contracts exacted or preferred by the purchasers or consumers.\n Experience in other gas fields has shown that multiplied and prolonged drafts on the natural supply will exhaust it. Since 1916 it has been apparent that the older portions of the West Virginia fields are approaching exhaustion and that produc ion in those fields has reached and passed its maximum. The newer portions, however, in the judgment of informed operators, will make the fields commercially productive for several years more.\n Latterly during the colder months-from November 1 to May 1-the combined needs of domestic and industrial consumers have been largely in excess of the production, and the pipe line companies generally have adopted and are pursuing the policy of preferring domestic consumers during those months. All the long-time contracts contain provisions admitting of such a preference. During other months, when there is little occasion for heating homes and offices, the needs of domestic consumers drop so materially that much gas may be and is supplied for industrial use without affecting the domestic use. But increased population, enlarged industry-particularly in West Virginia-and the advantages inhering in the gas as a fuel have finally resulted in a gross demand, which cannot be satisfied even in the \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 589]\n\u00a0\n summer months. The present actual consumption is all that the production will sustain. The pipe line companies cannot supply more gas in West Virginia without cutting down what they carry into Pennsylvania and Ohio; nor can they carry more into Pennsylvania and Ohio without cutting down what they supply in West Virginia. In short, the situation is such that to constrain the companies to supply more gas in any one of the three states necessarily will constrain them to supply less in the other two.\n In 1918, 265 billion cubic feet of gas were produced in West Virginia, 38 billion were consumed within the state without becoming available to the public, and 227 billion became available in the hands of the pipe line companies. The companies supplied 70 billion to consumers in the state and carried 157 billion to consumers outside. They also brought 4 billion into the state from gas fields outside and to that extent enlarged the amount supplied to local consumers. Of that amount, 21 billion went into domestic use and 53 billion into industrial use. The major part of the gas carried into Pennsylvania went to industrial consumers, and the major part of that carried into Ohio went to domestic consumers.\n The gas carried outside the state is sold for more than that used therein, but this naturally would be so, considering the additional pipe lines, compressors, and labor employed in the longer transmission. The proportion marketed beyond the state has not varied much. It now is practically what it was 10 years ago. Nor has there been any discrimination against consumers inside the state. They have been dealt with on the same plane as others. The companies have declined to quit the existing service to communities and consumers outside and to serve only those inside, but there is nothing invidious in this. It is in the line of fair treatment rather than discrimination. \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 590]\n\u00a0\n The gas carried into Pennsylvania and Ohio, respectively, and there supplied to the state and her municipal agencies for strictly public use, is not negligible, but amounts to billions of cubic feet per year. It is the fuel with which food is cooked and water heated for thousands of dependents in charitable and penal institutions, with which hundreds of schoolhouses are heated and made comfortable for thousands of children, and with which municipal waterworks are operated in several cities, notably Cincinnati and Toledo. The heating and other appliances have been adjusted to its use, and to make the changes incident to substituting other fuel would involve an expenditure in each state of a very large sum of public money.\n In Pennsylvania the gas is used by 300,000 domestic consumers caring for 1,500,000 people, and in Ohio by 725,000 domestic consumers caring for 3,625,000 people. This is where no other natural gas service is available. To change to other fuel would require an adjustment of heating and cooking appliances at an average cost of more than $100 for each domestic consumer, or an aggregate cost exceeding $30,000,000 in Pennsylvania nd $72,500,000 in Ohio.\n The act whose enforcement is sought to be enjoined was passed by the Legislature of West Virginia February 10, 1919, and went into effect May 11th following. \n2\n These suits were brought eight days thereafter, by direction of the Legislatures of the complainant states, and by leave of this court. Interlocutory injunctions were prayed and granted at the outset and are still in force.\n Three questions bearing on the propriety of entertaining the suits were raised soon after the suits were begun, \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 591]\n\u00a0\n and consideration of them was postponed to the final hearing.\n The first question is whether the suits involve a justiciable controversy between states in the sense of the judiciary article of the Constitution. We are of opinion that they do and that every element of such a controversy is present.\n Each suit presents a direct issue between two states as to whether one may withdraw a natural product, a common subject of commercial dealings, from an established current of commerce moving into the territory of the other. The complainant state asserts and the defendant state denies that such a withdrawal is an interference with interstate commerce forbidden by the Constitution. This is essentially a judicial question. It concededly is so in suits between private parties, and of course its character is not different in a suit between states.\n What is sought is not an abstract ruling on that question, but an injunction against such a withdrawal presently threatened and likely to be productive of great injury. The purpose to withdraw is shown in the enactment of the defendant state before set forth and is about to be carried into effect by her officers acting in her name and at her command. The state is the principal, and the action of her officers rightly may be imputed to her, even though a suit for an injunction might lie against them.\n The attitude of the complainant states is not that of mere volunteers, attempting to vindicate the freedom of interstate commerce or to redress purely private grievances. Each sues to protect a twofold interest-one as the proprietor of various public institutions and schools whose supply of gas will be largely curtailed or cut off by the threatened interference with the interstate current, and the other as the representative of the consuming public whose supply will be similarly affected. Both interests are substantial and both the threatened with serious injury. \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 592]\n\u00a0\n Each state uses large amounts of the gas in her several institutions and schools-the greater part in the discharge of duties which are relatively imperative. A break or cessation in the supply will embarrass her greatly in the discharge of those duties and expose thousands of dependents and school children to serous discomfort, if not more. To substitute another form of fuel will involve very large public expenditures.\n The private consumers in each state not only include most of the inhabitants of many urban communities but constitute a substantial portion of the state's population. Their health, comfort, and welfare are seriously jeopardized by the threatened withdrawal of the gas from the interstate stream. This is a matter of grave public concern in which the state, as the representative of the public, has an interest apart from that of the individuals affected. It is not merely a remote or ethical interest, but one which is immediate and recognized by law.\n In principle these views have full support in prior decisions, such as Missouri v. Illinois, \n180 \nU.S. 208, 241\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 331, Id., \n200 \nU.S. 496, 518\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 268; Kansas v. Colorado, \n185 U.S. 125\n, 141-143, 22 Sup. Ct. 552; Id., \n206 U.S. 46\n, 95-99, 27 Sup. Ct. 655; Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., \n206 \nU.S. 30, 237\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 618, 11 Ann. Cas. 488; New York v. New Jersey, \n256 \nU.S. 296, 301\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 492; and Wyoming v. Colorado, \n259 \nU.S. 419, 464\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 552. The defendant state relies on such cases as New Hampshire v. Louisiana, \n108 U.S. 76\n, 2 Sup. Ct. 176; Louisiana v. Texas, \n176 U.S. 1\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 251; Kansas v. United States, \n204 U.S. 331\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 388; Oklahoma v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., \n220 U.S. 277\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 434, and Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n258 \nU.S. 158, 162\n, 42 S. Sup Ct. 261; but the facts on which they turned, as the opinions show, were so widely different from those here that they are not in point.\n The second question is whether the suits were brought prematurely. They were brought a few days after the West Virginia act went into force. No order under it had been made by the Public Service Commission; nor \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 593]\n\u00a0\n had it been tested in actual practice. But this does not prove that the suits were premature. Of course they were not so, if it otherwise appeared that the act certainly would operate as the complainant states apprehended it would. One does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief. If the injury is certainly impending, that is enough.\n Turning to the act, we find that by its first section it lays on every pipe line company a positive duty-to the extent of its supply of gas produced in the state, whether produced by it or others-to satisfy the needs, whether for domestic, industrial or other use, of all intending consumers, whether old or new, who are willing to pay for the gas and want it for use within the section of the state in which it is produced, in that through which it transported, or in that wherein it is supplied to others. This is a substantive provision, whose terms are both direct and certain, and to which immediate obedience is commanded. No order of the commission is required to give it precision or make it obligatory, and it leaves nothing to the discretion of those who are to enforce it. On the contrary, it prescribes a definite rule of conduct and in itself puts the rule in force. It imposes an unconditional and mandatory duty, as counsel for the state admit, and obviously is intended to enforce a preferred recognition and satisfaction of the needs of consumers within the state, present and prospective, regardless of the effect on the interstate stream or on consumers outside the state.\n The second section invests the commission with authority-on finding after notice and hearing that a company supplying gas for local needs is or probably will be without an adequate supply for the purpose-to order another company having gas in excess of what is required for its 'consumers within this state' to furnish \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 594]\n\u00a0\n the company whose supply is or will be inadequate with gas to make up the deficiency, or in the alternative to undertake itself to supply such local needs 'to the extent of such excess.' This provision, like the first, shows the purpose to give local consumers, present and prospective, a preferred status and to permit surplus gas only to be carried into other states.\n The fourth section empowers the commission to entertain complaints by persons aggrieved or affected by any 'violation' of the act and to require that the violation be discontinued and the act obeyed, subject to a right of review in the courts, and also provides means of compelling obedience to the act pending the proceedings before the commission and until the decision on review.\n Other sections contain penal and remedial provisions designed to make those just described effective. One in the fifth section declares that 'every day' during which any company, or any of its officers, agents or employees, 'shall fail to observe and comply with any order or direction of the commission, or to perform any duty enjoined by this act, shall constitute a separate and disti ct violation.' Another in the sixth section subjects any company violating the act to an action for damages by any one claiming to have been wronged by the violation.\n We regard it as entirely clear that the act is intended to compel the retention within the state of whatever gas may be required to meet the local needs for all purposes, and that its procedural, penal and remedial provisions are amply adequate to accomplish that result. And we think it equally clear from the allegations in the bills now established by the evidence, that the situation when the suits were brought was such that the act directly and immediately would work a large curtailment of the volume of gas moving into the complainant states. Indeed, the conclusion is unavoidable that, with the increasing demand in West Virginia and the decreasing production, \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 595]\n\u00a0\n the act in a few years would work a practical cessation of the interstate stream.\n It must be held therefore that the suits were not brought prematurely.\n The third question is whether the requisite parties have been brought into the suits. It is objected that the pipe line companies have not been brought in. But there is nothing which makes their presence essential. The complainant states make no complaint and seek no relief against them. They are supplying gas in those states, and evidently will continue to do so, if not restrained or prevented by the defendant state. It is only with her that the complainant states are in controversy. It also is objected that the consumers in the defendant state who will be benefited if the act is enforced have no representation in the suits. But this is a misconception. They are represented by that state, and there is nothing in the situation requiring that they be specially represented or brought in. With equal basis it could be objected in a suit to prevent the enforcement of a statute reducing railroad freight rates, or in one to prevent the enforcement of a municipal ordinance reducing telephone or electric light rates, that shippers or users who would be benefited by the reduction must be specially represented or brought in. Such an objection would, of course, be untenable; and so of the objection here.\n We turn now to the principal issue, whether a state wherein natural gas is produced and is a recognized subject of commercial dealings may require that in its sale and disposal consumers in that state shall be accorded a preferred right of purchase over consumers in other states-when the requirement necessarily will operate to withdraw a large volume of the gas from an established interstate current whereby it is supplied in other states to consumers there. Of course, in the last analysis, the question is whether the enforced withdrawal for the bene \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 596]\n\u00a0\n fit of local consumers is such an interference with interstate commerce as is forbidden to a state by the Constitution. The question is an important one; for what one state may do others may, and there are 10 states from which natural gas is exported for consumption in other states. Besides, what may be done with one natural product may be done with others, and there are several states in which the earth yields products of great value which are carried into other states and there used. But notwithstanding the importance of the question, its solution is not difficult. The controlling principles have been settled by many adjudications-some so closely in point that the discussion here may be relatively brief.\n By the Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 3) the power to regulate interstate commerce is expressly committed to Congress and therefore impliedly forbidden to the states. The purpose in this is to protect commercial intercourse from invidious restraints, to prevent interference through conflicting or hostile state laws and to insure uniformity in regulation. It means that in the matter of interstate commerce we are a single nation-one and the same people. All the states have assented to it, all are alike bound by it, and all are equally protected by it. Even th ir power to lay and collect taxes, comprehensive and necessary as that power is, cannot be exerted in a way which involves a discrimination against such commerce. Ward v. Maryland, 12 Wall. 418, 430; Welton v. Missouri, \n91 U.S. 275\n, 280; Webber v. Virginia, \n103 U.S. 344\n, 350; Coe v. Errol, \n116 \nU.S. 517, 525\n, 526 S., 6 Sup. Ct. 475; Guy v. Baltimore, \n100 U.S. 434\n, 442-443; Robbins v. Shelby Taxing District, \n120 \nU.S. 489, 498\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 592.\n Natural gas is a lawful article of commerce, and its transmission from one state to another for sale and consumption in the latter is interstate commerce. A state law, whether of the state where the gas is produced or that where it is to be sold, which by its necessary operation \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 597]\n\u00a0\n prevents, obstructs or burdens such transmission is a regulation of interstate commerce-a prohibited interference. West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., \n221 U.S. 229\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 564, 35 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1193; Public Utilities Co. v. Landon, \n249 \nU.S. 236, 245\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 268; United Fuel Gas Co. v. Hallanan, \n257 U.S. 277\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 105; Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282, 290\n, 291 S., 42 Sup. Ct. 106; Lemke v. Farmers Grain Co., \n258 U.S. 50\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 244; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Foster, \n247 U.S. 105\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 438, 1 A. L. R. 1278; Minnesota v. Barber, \n136 U.S. 313\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 862; Brimmer v. Rebman, \n138 U.S. 78\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 213. The West Virginia act is such a law. Its provisions and the conditions which must surround its operation are such that it necessarily and directly will compel the diversion to local consumers of a large and increasing part of the gas heretofore and now going to consumers in the complainant states, and therefore will work a serious interference with that commerce.\n But it is urged that there are special considerations which take the act out of the general rule and sustain its validity, even though there be an interference.\n One of these is that the pipe line companies are engaged in supplying the gas to the public in West Virginia, that this is a quasi public business, and that the act does no more than require the companies to furnish a reasonably adequate service within reasonable territorial limits. It is true that the business is of a quasi public character, but it is so in Pennsylvania and Ohio as well as in West Virginia. The obligations inhering in it and the power to insist on an adequate service are the same in all three states. The supply of gas necessarily marks the extent of the service that can be rendered. Much of the business is interstate and has grown up through a course of years. West Virginia encouraged and sanctioned the development of that part of the business and has profited greatly by it. Her present effort, rightly understood, is to subordinate that part to the local business within her borders. In other words, it is in effect an attempt to \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 598]\n\u00a0\n regulate the interstate business to the advantage of the local consumers. But this she may not do. A direction to one of her railroads when short of facilities for moving coal to haul intrastate coal to the exclusion of interstate coal would not be different in kind or force.\n Another consideration advanced to the same end is that the gas is a natural product of the state and has become a necessity therein, that the supply is waning and no longer sufficient to satisfy local needs and be used abroad, and that the act is therefore a legitimate measure of conservation in the interest of the people of the state. If the situation be as stated, it affords no ground for the assumption by the state of power to regulate interstate commerce, which is what the act attempts to do. That power is lodged elsewhere. A contention, in essence the same, was presented and considered in West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., \n221 U.S. 229\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 564, 35 . R. A. (N. S.) 1193, a case involving the validity of an Oklahoma statute designed to accomplish the retention of natural gas within the state. In the District Court the case had been heard on bill and answer, a proceeding in which the allegations of fact in the answer are taken as true. The hearing resulted in a decree adjudging the statute invalid and enjoining its enforcement. The decree was affirmed here. In the answer, as the opinion shows, it was alleged that physical conditions made it apparent that the gas field was of relatively short duration, that cities were near the field and their people needed the gas, that the state embodied only prairie land devoid of timber and there was no local fuel supply excepting coal and natural gas, that the production of coal was growing rapidly more costly, that 'substantially the only natural, practical, usable fuel, both for domestic and industrial use, is natural gas,' and that if pipe lines, such as the plaintiffs were intending to construct and put in operation, were permitted to carry gas into other states the supply would be speedily \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 599]\n\u00a0\n exhausted. Referring to these allegations and to a contention that the ruling principle of the statute was conservation of a needed natural resource, the court said (\n221 U.S. 255\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 571, 35 L. R. A. [N. S.] 1193):\n The results of the contention repel its acceptance. Gas, when reduced to possession, is a commodity; it belongs to the owner of the land, and, when reduced to possession, is his individual property subject to sale by him, and may be a subject of intrastate commerce and interstate commerce. The statute of Oklahoma recognizes it to be a subject of intrastate commerce, but seeks to prohibit it from being the subject of interstate commerce, and this is the purpose of its conservation. In other words, the purpose of its conservation is in a sense commercial-the business welfare of the state, as coal might be, or timber. Both of those products may be limited in amount, and the same consideration of the public welfare which would confine gas to the use of the inhabitants of a state would confine them to the inhabitants of the state. If the states have such power a singular situation might result. Pennsylvania might keep its coal, the Northwest its timber, the mining states their minerals. And why may not the products of the field be brought within the principle? Thus enlarged, or without that enlargement, its influence on interstate commerce need not be pointed out. To what consequences does such power tend? If one state has it, all states have it; embargo may be retaliated by embargo, and commerce will be halted at state lines. And yet we have said that 'in matters of foreign and interstate commerce there are no state lines.' In such commerce, instead of the states, a new power appears and a new welfare, a welfare which transcends that of any state. But rather let us say it is constituted of the welfare of all of the states, and that of each state is made the greater by a division of its resources, natural and created, with every other state, and those of every \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 600]\n\u00a0\n other state with it. This was the purpose, as it is the result, of the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States. If there is to be a turning backward, it must be done by the authority of another instrumentality than a court.'\n Finally, it is urged that this court cannot prescribe and execute regulations respecting the apportionment and use of the gas among the three states, and therefore that the bills should be dismissed. The conclusion does not follow from the premise. The object of the suits is not to obtain decretal regulations, but to enjoin the enforcement of the West Virginia act on the ground that it is an unconstitutional enactment and its intended enforcement will subject the complainant states to injury of serious magnitude. On full consideration, we reach the conclusion that the act is unconstitutional, that the apprehensions of the complainant states respecting the injur which will ensue from its enforcement are well founded and that it obviously will operate most inequitably against those states. In this situation the appropriate decree is one declaring the act invalid and enjoining its enforcement. To dismiss the bills and leave the act to be enforced would be quite inadmissible. If there be need for regulating the interstate commerce involved, the regulation should be sought from the body in whom the power resides.\n Decrees for complainants.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, dissenting.\n The statute seeks to reach natural gas before it has begun to move in commerce of any kind. It addresses itself to gas hereafter to be collected and states to what uses it first must be applied. The gas is collected under and subject to the law, if valid, and at that moment it is not yet matter of commerce among the States. I think that the products of a State until they are actually started to a point outside it may be regulated by the \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 601]\n\u00a0\n State notwithstanding the commerce clause. In Oliver Iron Mining Co. v. Lord, \n262 U.S. 172\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 526, 67 L. Ed. --, May 7, 1923, it was held that the State might levy an occupation tax upon the mining of iron ore equal to six per cent. of the value of the ore produced during the previous year, although substantially all the ore left the State and was put upon cars for that purpose by the same single movement by which it was severed from its bed. There could not be a case of a State's product more certainly destined to interstate commerce. It was put upon the cars by the same act by which it was produced. But as it was not yet in interstate commerce the tax was sustained. I know of no relevant distinction between taxing and regulating in other ways. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431.\n But the States have been held authorized to regulate in other ways more closely resembling the present. In Sligh v. Kirkwood, \n237 U.S. 52\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 501, a state law was sustained that made it criminal to sell or offer for shipment citrus fruits that were immature or otherwise unfit for consumption. That, upon grounds of local policy, intercepted before it got into the stream, what would have been an object of interstate commerce. The local interest in the present case is greater and more obvious than in that of green oranges. Again, the power of the State to preserve a food supply for its people by game laws notwithstanding an indirect interference with interstate commerce is established. Geer v. Connecticut, \n161 \nU.S. 519, 534\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 600; Silz v. Hesterberg, \n211 \nU.S. 31, 42\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 10. If there is any difference between the property rights of the State in game and in gas still in the ground it does not concern the plaintiffs and it is plain from the decisions cited that they do not depend upon a speculative view as to title. See Missouri v. Holland, \n252 \nU.S. 416, 434\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 382, 11 A. L. R. 984. The right of the State so to regulate the use of natural gas as to prevent waste was sustained as against the \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 602]\n\u00a0\n Fourteenth Amendment in Walls v. Midland Carbon Co., \n254 U.S. 300\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 118, and I do not suppose that the plaintiffs would have fared any better had they invoked the commerce clause. I need do no more than refer to prohibition of manufacture of articles intended for export, such as colored oleomargarine, Capital City Dairy Co. v. Ohio, \n183 \nU.S. 238, 245\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 120, or spirits. The result of that and other cases has been expressed by this Court more than once in the form of a general recognition of the right of a State to make 'reasonable provision for local needs,' Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 402\n, 410 S., 411, 33 Sup. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18; and the right has been recognized even when the interference with interstate commerce is direct, as when an interstate train is required to stop to accommodate passengers who do not leave the State, Lake Shore Michigan Southern Ry. Co. v. Ohio, \n173 U.S. 285\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 465; Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Texas, \n246 U.S. 58\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 236.\n I see nothing in the commerce clause to prevent a State from giving a preference to its inhabitants in the enjoyment of its natural advantages. If the gas were used only by private perons for their own purposes I know of no power in Congress to require them to devote it to public use or to transport it across state lines. It is the law of West Virginia and of West Virginia alone that makes the West Virginian gas what is called a public utility, and how far it shall be such is a matter the that law alone decides. I am aware that there is some general language in Oklahoma v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., \n221 \nU.S. 229, 255\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 564, 35 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1193, a decision that I though wrong, implying that Pennsylvania might not keep its coal, or the northwest its timber, etc. But I confess I do not see what is to hinder. Certainly if the owners of the mines or the forests saw fit not to export their products the Constitution would not make them do it. I see nothing in that instrument that would produce a different result if the State gave the owners \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 603]\n\u00a0\n motives for their conduct, as by effering a bonus. However for the decision in the case referred to goes it cannot outweigh the consensus of the other decisions to which I have referred and that seem to me to confirm what I should think plain without them, that the Constitution does not prohibit a State from securing a reasonable preference for its own inhabitants in the enjoyment of its products even when the effect of its law is to keep property within its boundaries that otherwise would have passed outside. Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, \n209 \nU.S. 349, 357\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 529, 14 Ann. Cas. 560.\n I agree substantially with my brothers McREYNOLDS and BRANDEIS, but think that there is jurisdiction in such sense as to justify a statement of my opinion upon the meris of the case. I think that the bill should be dismissed.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, dissenting.\n It seems to me quite clear that the record presents no justiciable controversy; certainly none within the original jurisdiction of this court.\n For the manifest purpose of protecting local consumers, West Virginia commanded her public service corporations not to transport natural gas beyond the borders of the state until they had satisfied the reasonable requirements of the people therein. Thereupon, complainants came here by original bills and alleged that if the statute were enforced they and their inhabitants could not obtain enough gas for their imperative demands from the divers pipe lines theretofore accustomed to supply them. They ask us to declare the enactment invalid because of conflict with the commerce clause of the federal Constitution and to restrain its enforcement. If the pipe lines hereafter fail to comply with their contracts, of course, they may be proceeded against in a proper forum; but to say that they probably will fail because \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 604]\n\u00a0\n of the statute and then to demand that the law-making power be enjoined is not to set up a real controversy cognizable in any court.\n If West Virginia should prohibit the drilling of new gas wells, I hardly suppose complainants could demand an injunction here even if it were admitted that their supplies would be cut off. But who not, under the doctrine announced. Production has been permitted for years and appealing hardships would follow its cessation. And suppose West Virginia should repeal the charters of all her public service corporations now transporting gas and thereby disable them, could we interfere upon the demand of another state who claimed that she would suffer?\n As originally adopted, the Constitution provided:\n'In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction.'\n\n Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall 419, declared that a citizen of one state could proceed against another state by original action here. In Louisiana v. Texas, \n176 U.S. 1\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 251, Mr. Chief Justice Fuller pointed out the character of controversies between states over which this court has original jurisdiction. With emphasis he declared that vindication of the freedom of interstate commerce is not committed to any state as parens patriae. Unless this ruling is to pass into the discard, it follows that neither of the complainants has any higher standing than one of her citizens with a contract for gas would have if there were no Eleventh Amendment. It is unnecessary to argue that the framers of the Constitution never intended to empower this court, at the suit of an individual, to enjoin a state from enforcing regulations prescribed for her own public service corporations. And yet, that possibility must be affirmed under the doctrine now announced. \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 605]\n\u00a0\n Concluding his opinion in Chisholm v. Georgia (1793) Mr. Justice Iredell exclaimed:\n'I pray to God that, if the Attorney General's doctrine, as to the law, be established by the judgment of this court, all the good he predicts from it may take place, and none of the evils with which, I have the concern to say, it appears to me to be pregnant.'\n\n A like prayer seems not inappropriate here and now.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, dissenting.\n The statement made by Mr. Justice HOLMES seems to me unanswerable. But, like Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, I think that there are reasons why the bills should be dismissed without passing upon the constitutional question presented.\n Natural gas in quantity is produced in 32 of the 55 counties of West Virginia. One-half of the inhabitants of that state have for years been dependent upon it for domestic uses, and it has been supplied to nearly 2, 000 industrial establishments. Sixty-seven concerns are engaged in the business of distributing this natural gas to the public. Most of them are corporations organized under the laws of West Virginia. A few are organized under the laws of some other state. Some are unincorporated. Each had, prior to the Act of February 17, 1919, hereinafter referred to, been declared by statute to be a public service corporation,3 endowed with the power of eminent domain. Each was under the common-law duty of furnishing to the public, \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 606]\n\u00a0\n throughout the West Virginia territory in which it does business adequate service, Carnegie Natural Gas Co. v. Swiger, 72 W. Va. 557, 79 S. E. 3, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1073; Clarksburg Light & Heat Co. v. Public Service Commission, 84 W. Va. 638, 100 S. E. 551. And as to each this duty has been confirmed by the legislation of that state.\n Prior to the World War the production of natural gas in West Virginia and the demand were such that large quantities could be exported by its public service corporations to other states without thereby lessening the ability of these concerns to give adequate service to their West Virginia customers. During the war the demand, both within and without the state, increased greatly, and thereafter the supply became smaller. Of the net supply of West Virginia natural gas available for distribution by its public service corporations, 77.1 per cent. was exported in the year 1916; 80.1 per cent. in 1917; 76.7 per cent. in 1918.4 The West Virginia consumers complained that the amount furnished them was inadequate, and that they were being discriminated against by West Virginia gas companies, in the interest of residents of other states. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[262 U.S. 553, 607]\n\u00a0\n Some of the companies which exported gas sought to justify the ina equacy of their service to West Virginia customers by asserting that they were under contract, or other duty, to supply West Virginia gas to distributing companies or consumers in other states, and that the aggregate demand of their customers in the several states exceeded the available supply. Only 12 of the 67 West Virginia public service corporations took part in the export business. The remaining 55 were engaged solely in distribution within the state, and many of these were dependent largely upon the other 12 for their gas supply. Some of these 55 companies sought to justify their inadequate service by the fact that, because of the demands for gas to be exported to the other states, the corporations on which they were dependent denied them their full supply.\n West Virginia consumers insisted that the common law forbade its public service companies to so disable themselves from performaning their duty to give adequate service within the state, and contended that the exporting public service corporations which habitually supplied the local distributing companies could not justify furnishing a reduced supply by setting up their contracts to furnish supplies to concerns in other states. These contentions were denied by the exporting companies, and it was asserted that they could not legally be controlled in this respect by the Public Service Commission of West Virginia. To remove all doubt concerning the statutory powers of the commission and to insure adequate service to West Virginia consumers, the Legislature of the state enacted chapter 71 of the Acts of 1919 approved on February 17 of that year, to take effect 90 days after its passage. That statute declared these rules of substantive law:\n\n\n (a)\n That no public service corporation engaged in distributing natural gas produced within the state shall, by exporting its supply to other states, disable itself from \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 608]\n\u00a0\n performing its duty to give adequate service within West Virginia.\n\n\n (b)\n That any such public service corporation whose gas supply is insufficient to afford such service to its customers may, under prescribed conditions, call upon any other public service corporation within the same territory, which has a surplus supply, to furnish to it such part of this surplus as may be required to enable it to give adequate service.\n Before the effective date of that act, the state of Pennsylvania and the state of Ohio each filed in this court a bill in equity against the state of West Virginia, in which it prayed that the act be declared void, because obnoxious to the federal Constitution, and that all West Virginia officials be enjoined from attempting in any way to enforce the statute. As a basis for the relief each bill set forth the extensive use of natural gas by state institutions, by their several municipalities, and by millions of residents, and it alleged that serious injury would result if these consumers were deprived of the West Virginia supply. The Ohio bill alleged lso that cutting off the West Virginia supply of natural gas would greatly reduce the value of public service properties, would reduce taxable values of these and other properties, and would thereby deprive the state of important revenues. It prayed, specifically, that the plaintiff state, and its residents, be declared to have no adequate remedy at law; that West Virginia and its officials be enjoined from interfering with the transportation of natural gas for use in Ohio; and that pending the suit an injunction be granted against their instituting in any court of the state of West Virginia and suit under the statute against any 'person, company or corporation which is engaged in the production or transportation of natural gas out of the state of West Virginia into the state of Ohio.' No public official or producer, exporter, or distributor of gas or consumer (other than \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 609]\n\u00a0\n these states) was made party plaintiff or defendant in either bill. A temporary injunction issued in each case upon the filing of the bill. In each a motion to dismiss, an answer, and a replication was filed. Without disposing of the motions to dismiss, the parties proceeded to take the evidence and, thereafter, submitted the cases for final hearing.\n Several objections made to the maintenance of these suits may be passed without discussion. It will be assumed that the constitutional question submitted is not to be deemed merely a political one, as in Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, and Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 U.S. 447\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 597, 67 L. Ed. --, decided June 4, 1923. It will be assumed that the alleged right to acquire by purchase and to bring into a state natural gas produced elsewhere is-despite a fundamental difference6-to be treated as similar legally to the right asserted in Kansas v. Colorado, \n185 U.S. 125\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 552; Id., \n206 U.S. 46\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 655, to have the water of an interstate stream continue to flow into a state, or the right recognized in Missouri v. Illinois, \n180 U.S. 208\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 331; New York v. New Jersey, \n256 U.S. 296\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 492, and Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., \n206 U.S. 230\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 618, 11 Ann. Cas. 488, to have the waters and the air within one state kept reasonably free from pollution originating in another. It will be assumed, further, that the use of natural gas in Pennsylvania \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 610]\n\u00a0\n and in Ohio is shown to be so general as to bring these suits within the rule acted upon in the cases just cited and to render inapplicable the rule declared in Kansas v. United States, \n204 U.S. 331\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 388, and Oklahoma v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co., \n220 \nU.S. 277, 286\n, 289 S., 31 Sup. Ct. 434, where the suits were dismissed because brought in aid of interests deemed provate. And finally it will be assumed-although this is still more doubtful-that a state which has permitted one of its natural resources to be freely dealt in as an article of interstate commerce may not thereafter prohibit all export thereof, although it appears that the whole of the remaining supply will be required to satisfy the needs of its own citizens. These objections raised by defendant will not be considered, because there are other objections which, in my opinion, present insuperable obstacles to the maintenance of the suits.\n First. This court is without jurisdiction of the subject-matter.\n The bills present neither a 'case,' nor a 'controversy,' within the meaning of the federal Constitution. Marbury v. Madison, I Cranch, 137; Muskrat v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346, 356\n, 359 S., 31 Sup. Ct. 250; Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n258 U.S. 158\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 261. They are not proceedings 'instituted according to the regular course of judicial procedure' to protect some right of property or personal right. They are, like McChord v. Louisville & Nashville Railroad, \n183 \nU.S. 483, 495\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 165, an attempt to enjoin, not executive action, but legislation. They are instituted frankly to secure from this court a general declaration that the West Virginia Act of February 17, 1919, is unconstitutional. Compare Giles v. Harris, \n189 \nU.S. 475, 486\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 639. The wel-settled rule that the court is without power to entertain such a proceeding applies equally, whether the party invoking its aid is a state or a private person. And the rule cannot be overcome by giving to \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 611]\n\u00a0\n pleadings the form of a institutions, themselves consumers of West Fairchild v. Hughes, \n258 U.S. 126\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 274; Atherton Mills v. Johnston, \n259 \nU.S. 13, 15\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 422; Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission, supra.\n Moreover, it is not shown that there is, in a legal sense, danger of invasion of the alleged rights. It is shown that the states of Pennsylvania and Ohio are, in their public institutions, themselves consumers of West Virginia gas-a 'makeweight' as suggested in Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., \n206 \nU.S. 230, 237\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 618, 11 Ann. Cas. 488. And it is shown that these and many other consumers within the plaintiff states would suffer serious injury if the West Virginia supply were cut off. But it is primarily at least, because of acts or omissions is threatened or that there is, in a legal sense, danger that the supply will be stopped. The mere enactment of the statute, obviously, does not constitute a threat to interrupt the flow of gas into the plaintiff states. The importation into Ohio and Pennsylvania is conducted, not by the state of West Virginia, but wholly by 12 privately owned public service corporations. If the importation ceases it will be, irimarily at least, because of acts or omissions of these 12 corporations. Yet there is not even an allegation that these corporations threaten, or intend, to discontinue the importation, or that they will be compelled to do so unless the state of West Virginia is enjoined from enforcing the statute.\n On the other hand, it clearly appears that, under the laws of West Virginia, there can be no present danger that any of these 12 corporations will be summarily prevented by that state from continuing in full volume the export of gas or will be compelled to reduce it. The only restriction, if any, imposed by the act of 1919 upon exportation of gas is that which may result from the requirement that West Virginia public service corporations shall not, by means of export, disable themselves from performing their duties to consumers and to other dis tributing \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 612]\n\u00a0\n companies within the state. Before there can be, in a legal sense, danger that restriction will result, it must appear that one or more of the 12 exporting companies is disabling itself by such exportation, or is about to do so, and also that some state official is about to take effective action to prevent the exportation. But under the legislation of West Virginia many things would have to happen and much time must elapse before any of the exporting corporations would be under any legal duty to discontinue or essen their exports, and still more time before it could actually be prevented from exporting gas. For, under West Virginia legislation, no executive officer and no court has power or jurisdiction to declare, or to enforce performance of, such alleged duty of a public service corporation until primary resort has been had to the Public Service Commission and the application to it has been acted upon, either by granting or by denying relief. United Fuel Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, 73 W. Va. 571, 80 S. E. 931; State v. Bluefield Water Works Co ., 86 W. Va. 260, 103 S. E. 340; Kelly Axe Manufacturing Co. v. United Fuel Gas. Co., 87 W. Va. 368, 105 S. E. 152. The act establishing the commission prescribes the methods and the remedies which are to be pursued in order to enforce the duty to give adequate service. Chapter 9, Acts of 1913,  11 and 18; chapter 8, Acts of 1915,  23, 24; chapter 71, Acts of 1919; chapter 150, Acts of 1921; Manufacturers' Light & Heat Co. v. Ott ( D. C.) 215 Fed. 940. If it is claimed that there is failure to give adequate service, a petition may be filed before the commission to secure it. After notice to and hearing of the corporation by the commission an order may be made. Until the commission issues some order which purports to restrict in some way the discretion theretofore exercised by a corporation in respect to exports, every such concern is, under the act of 1919, legally as free to continue the transportation of gas to Pennsylvania and to Ohio as if that statute had not been passed. \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 613]\n\u00a0\n It is possible that the commission would never be called upon to act. 7 It is possible that, if called upon, the commission would refuse to make an order. It is possible that, if the commission made an order, the order would be of such a character as not to affect seriously the interests which plaintiff seeks to protect. And it is possible that if any order were made, the state court would suspend its operation and would eventually annul it. That act makes such careful provision for judicial review of the orders of the commission and for postponing the incidence of penalties or other liabilities until \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 614]\n\u00a0\n after such review can be had, that there could never be occasion for invoking in respect to this statute the doctrine of Ex parte Young, \n209 U.S. 123\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 441, 13 L. R. A.(N.S.) 932, 14 Ann. Cas. 764.8 For the commission is without power to enforce an order or to impose a penalty To overcome disobedience, or disregard, of an order, resort must, under the West Virginia statutes, be had to the courts, and to this end an original proceeding must be instituted. Whether the suit to enforce obedience is brought by the commission or by others, the corporation is given opportunity to defend on the ground that the order is, for any reason, \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 615]\n\u00a0\n invalid; or it may itself inaugurate the proceeding by bringing suit to have the order annulled. Randall Gas Co. v. Star Glass Co., 78 W. Va. 252, 256, 88 S. E. 840; United Fuel Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, 73 W. Va. 571, 80 S. E. 931. Moreover, a final order of the commission is not enforceable, even by a court, until 30 days after entry have elapsed. That period is allowed within which any party feeling aggrieved may apply to the court for suspension of the order; and if such application is made, a speedy hearing must be given (section 16).\n Up to the time when these suits were begun no action of any kind had been taken in relation to matters dealt with by the Act of February 17, 1919, either by the commission, by any other board or official of the state, by any corporation, or by any other person who could ever be affected by any provision of the statute. And no action could have been taken, for the act was then not yet in effect. How, then, can it be said that, in any legal sense, the Pennsylvania and Ohio consumers were in present danger of irreparable injury? Plaintiffs' fears were at best premature. This court held in Oregon v. Hitchcock, \n202 \nU.S. 60, 70\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 568, that it would not, even at the instance of a state, take upon itself the decision of questions committed to another department of our government and thus anticipate the action of the federal executive. The reasons are equally strong against our interfering, in advance of decision, with the executive of a state n a matter committed to its determination. If these were private suits relief would necessarily be denied. Compare First National Bank of Albuquerque v. Albright, \n208 U.S. 548\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 349; South Carolina v. Georgia, \n93 U.S. 4\n, 14. As the suit is that of one state against another, even greater caution should be exercised by this court before assuming to act. Missouri v. Illinois, \n200 \nU.S. 496, 520\n, 521 S., 26 Sup. Ct. 268; Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46, 117\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 655; New York v. New Jersey, \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 616]\n\u00a0\n \n256 \nU.S. 296, 309\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 492. The objection here is not, as in Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., \n206 \nU.S. 230, 238\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 618, 11 Ann. Cas. 488, that those interested should be left to an action at law for redress of any injuries which may be suffered. It is that the 'judicial stage' of the controversy had not been reached when these suits were begun, and, indeed, has not been since. See Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 \nU.S. 210, 228\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 67, 43 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1015; Bacon v. Rutland R. R. Co., \n232 \nU.S. 134, 137\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 283.\n Second. There is a fatal lack of necessary parties. It is only by failure of the 12 exporting companies to continue the exportation of gas that the plaintiffs, and other consumers or the distributing companies in Pennsylvania or Ohio, can be injured. Primarily at least, it is the rights of these 12 corporations, if of any one, which would be invaded by enforcing the statute, and rights of consumers and of distributing corporations of Pennsylvania and Of Ohio are derivative merely. Whether the West Virginia corporations may furnish gas to the plaintiff states and whether those corporations may be regulated as the statute attempts, are at most controversies between West Virginia and those corporations. They have not submitted their rights to adjudication in these suits. It is intimated that these corporations wish to have the act declared void. But we may not assume that such is their wish. Conceivably a decision holding the act valid might benefit them; since it might relieve them from improvident contracts with distributing companies in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Or it may be that some of the 12 corporations would be benefited and others injured by any decision made of the question presented. Unless the 12 corporations are legally represented either by the plaintiff or the defendant, they would not be bound by a decree in either of these suits. New Orleans Water Works Co. v. New Orleans, \n164 \nU.S. 471, 480\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 161. That neither plaintiff nor defendant legally \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 617]\n\u00a0\n represents them is clear. \n9\n And since they would not be found, this court should not entertain a suit to decide the question presented; for, as was held in California v. Southern Pacific Co., \n157 U.S. 229\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 591, and Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co., \n184 \nU.S. 199, 246\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 308, it does not comport with the gravity and finality which should characterize an adjudication in the exercise of the original jurisdiction of this court to proceed, at the instance of a state, in the absence of parties whose rights would be actually passed upon and be in effect determined, even though they might not be technically bound in subsequent litigation in this, or some other tribunal. Compare Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n258 U.S. 158\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 261.\n The remaining 55 West Virginia gas corporations which do not expo t any gas are also vitally interested in the question submitted. So far as their interest is the general one qua consumer, it might be represented by the Public Service Commission, and to that end the commission (not the state) should, perhaps, have been made party defendant. But many of these gas corporations appear to have specific interests which a decision might affect directly. They have contracts with the exporting companies for their supply of gas; and the obligations under these contracts would be different if the act is held valid than if it were held to be void. A decision to the effect that the prohibition of exports declared in the act is void might seriously impair their contract rights. \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 618]\n\u00a0\n Moreover, section 8 of the act provides:\n'That the sections, provisions and clauses of this act shall be deemed separable each from the other, and also in respect to the persons, firms, corporations and consumers mentioned therein or affected thereby, and if any separable part of this act be, or be held to be unconstitutional or for any reason invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts thereof shall be and remain in full force and effect.'\n\n Surely the statute may be valid as to some exporting companies, for the action in exporting may be ultra vires; or certain West Virginia distributing companies may have acquired preferential rights to the supply of gas. How can the court determine, in view of this provision, that the act is void, in toto, when it has not before it the parties to be affected thereby and the facts which only they as litigants would be able to present? Therefore, even if it appeared that rights of the plaintiffs-or of those whom they legally represent-were in present danger of irreparable injury resulting from wrongful acts of defendant, these suits should not be maintained.\n Third. But if all other obstacles could be overcome, this court, sitting as a court of equity, should dismiss the bills, because it would be unable to grant the only relief appropriate. This court, sitting in equity, clearly should not lend its aid to enable West Virgina public service corporations to discriminate against West Virginia consumers in the interest of Ohio and Pennsylvania consumers. Therefore an appropriate decree should be framed so as to require each of the West Virginia corporations to treat West Virginia customers at least as well as it does those outside of the state and the decree should not leave any West Virginia public service corporation free to export gas in disregard of the duty not to discriminate against the public of that state. But \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 619]\n\u00a0\n natural gas is produced also in Pennsylvania and Ohio, and equitably with other states now dependent the supplies cansumed in those states. \n10\n Furthermore, West Virginia gas is exported also to Maryland, Indiana, and Kentucky and in two of those states natural gas is produced in quantity. \n11\n Clearly the court should, in no event, go further than to compel West Virginia to share its production equitable with other state now dependent upon it for a part of their gas supply. But in order to determine what is equitable (that is, what part of the West Virginia production that state might require its public service corporations to retain and what part they should be free to export to other states) it would obviously be necessary to marshall the resources and the demands, or needs, of the six states, and to consider, in respect to each, both the conduct of the business therein and the circumstances attending its development. The factors necessary to be considered in determining what division of the West Virginia production would be fair, the conditions under which the determination would have to be made, and the character of the questions to be decided are such that this court would be obliged to refuse to undertake the task. For this reason, the bills should be dismissed, even if it were held both that rights legally represented by plaintiffs were in present danger of irreparable injury by wrongful acts of defendant an that there was not a fatal lack of necessary parties. To \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 620]\n\u00a0\n do justice as between the several states the following inquiries would be essential:\n\n\n (a)\n The potential as well as the actual production in each state would have to be ascertained. The actual production during earlier years, and approximately the current production, could be ascertained from data which are regularly collected by the United States Geological. Survey and by the public utility commissions of the several states. But to ascertain the potential production, searching inquiry would have to be made into the methods of production pursued, and, among other things, to what extent recent production has been secured by forcing the wells, what the likelihood is that production lessened by forcing wells will be restored by allowing periods of rest, and to what extent recent reduced outputs may have been atributable to failure to sink enough wells or to open additional territory. \n12\n It would be necessary to inquire also into the extent and character of the existing gas reserves, where-ever situated and by whomsoever owned. In ascertaining the extent of the gas territory not yet developed, it would be necessary to inquire to what extent the reserve is controlled by, or is otherwise available to, the several public service corporations of the several states; the cost of developing particular fields and of marketing the supply therefrom; what the relation of such undeveloped territory is to that then being worked and to that already exhausted; and to what extent and how rapidly the development of new areas and new sources of supply should properly proceed.\n\n\n (b)\n The demand, actual and potential, in each state would have to be determined. In determining the demand, the court could not confine its inquiry to ascer taining \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 621]\n\u00a0\n the amount then used or called for. The rates charged in the several communities must also be considered. For upon these, as well as upon the relative cost of other kinds of fuel, would depend in large part the extent of the demand, particularly by the industries. The character of the use and the circumstances under which it had been developed would likewise be important factors in deciding what distribution would be equitable. Among other things, it would be necessary to determine to what extent there was, as in Ohio, a high percentage of waste, and what investment had been made in distributing mains and in customers' appliances and when and under what circumstances these investments had been made. For, while a long-established local distributing company might reasonably be required to restrict its business to existing customers and even to the existing needs of such, a like restriction would be a great hardship, if applied to new companies which had not yet brought their business to a paying basis.\n\n\n (c)\n No determination concerning production and none concerning demand could afford a stable basis for future action; for no factor entering into the determination would be constant. Investigations into supply and demand would have to be pursued continuously, and recurrent decisions as to distribution would be required. Thus, the estimate of the undeveloped gas territory must be ever changing; for new discovery may open territory theretogore unknown, and the sinking of test wells may establish the act that territory previously deemed valuable will be wholly unproductive. In no other field of public service regulation is the controlling body confronted with factors so baffling as in the natural gas industry, and in none is continuous supervision and control required in so high a degree.\n\n\n (d)\n The decisions to be made would be of the character which calls for the informed judgment of a board of \n\n[262 U.S. 553, 622]\n\u00a0\n experts. The tribunal would have to determine, among other things, whether inadequate service was due in the several states to inadequate supply or to improvident use by some consumers; whether to overcome inadequacy of supply new territory should be developed or more wells be sunk in old territory; whether, in view of prospective needs of the several communities, it would not be better that the reserves should be husbanded and that the uses to which gas may be put be curtailed. It would thus be called upon to review-and perhaps to control-the business judgment of those managing the companies. Pro rata distribution among all users of the gas from time to time available would obviously not result in equitable distribution; for domestic users, and also many industrial ones, would, if their gas supply were uncertain, find it necessary to assure themselves of an adequate supply for heating, cooking, and power, of either oil or some other kind of fuel, and the expense of producing the necessary alternative appliances would be large. The tribunal would have to decide, also, many other serious questions of the character usually committed for determination to public utility commissions, and the difficulties involved in these decisions would be much enhanced by differences in the laws, rules and practices of the several states regarding the duties of natural gas companies to furnish adequate service. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n[262 U.S. 553, 623]\n\u00a0\n Cearly this court not undertake such determinations. equitable distribution would be a task of such complexity and difficulty that even an interstate public service commission, with broad powers, perfected administrative machinery, ample resources, practical experience, and no other duties, might fail to perform it satisfactorily. As this court would be powerless to frame a decree and provide machinery by means of which such equitable distribution of the available supply could be effected, it should, according to settled practice, refuse to entertain the suits. Compare Marble Co. v. Ripley, 10 Wall. 339, 358; Taxas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Marshall, \n136 \nU.S. 393, 406\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 846; Giles v. Harris, \n189 \nU.S. 475, 487\n, 488 S., 23 Sup.

That every person engaged in furnishing, or required by law (whether statutory or common law) to furnish, natural gas for public use, or for the use of the public, or any part of the public, whether for domestic, industrial or other consumption, within this state, shall to the extent of his supply of said gas produced in this state (whether produced by such person or by any other person), furnish for public use within the territory of this state, and for the use of the public and every part of the public within the territory of this state, in or from which such gas is produced, or through which said gas is transported, or which is served by such person, a supply of natural gas reasonably adequate for the purposes, whether domestic, industrial or otherwise, for which natural gas is consumed or desired to be consumed by the public, or any part of the public, within said territory in this state, and for which said consumer or consumers therein shall apply and be ready and willing to make payment at lawful rates.\n\n'Sec. 2. That in case any person engaged in furnishing, or required by law (whether statutory or common law) to furnish, natural gas for public use within this state, or for the use of the public or any part of the public within this state, shall have a production or supply of natural gas which is, or probably will be, insufficient to furnish for such use, ( for the purposes, whether domestic, industrial or otherwise, for which natural gas is consumed by the public or any part of the public), within the territory in this state served by such person, then and in that event the public service commission shall have authority, and the same is hereby conferred on it, upon the application of any such person or any of his consumers within this state and after due hearing upon notice and proof to the satisfaction of the commission that public convenience and necessity so requir , to order any other person engaged in furnishing or required by law (whether statutory or common law) to furnish, natural gas for public use within this state, and producing or furnishing natural gas for public use in said territory or transporting the same through said territory, to furnish to such person having such in- \n\n sufficient production or supply, natural gas for the purpose of supplying such deficiency, at and during such times, upon and at such just and reasonable terms, conditions and rates, and in such amounts, as the commission shall prescribe. And whenever, after such hearing upon notice and proof, the commission shall determine that public convenience and necessity so require, the commission shall have authority to provide for and compel the establishment of a reasonable physical connection or connections between the lines, pipes or conduits of such person having such excess supply of gas and the lines, pipes or conduits of the person having such deficiency of supply, and to require the laying and construction of such reasonable extensions of lines, pipes or conduits as may be necessary for the establishment of such physical connection or connections, and to ascertain, determine and fix the just and reasonable terms and conditions of such connection or connections, including just and reasonable rules and regulations and provisions for the payment of the costs and expense of making the same or for the apportionment of such cost and expense as may appear just and reasonable: Provided, however, that no person shall, by virtue of this section, be ordered to furnish natural gas to any other person so engaged in furnishing, or required by law to furnish, natural gas for public use, except to the extent that the person so ordered to furnish natural gas shall, at the time, have a production or supply of natural gas in excess of the quantity sufficient to furnish a reasonably adequate supply to his consumers within the state; nor shall any person, by virtue of this section, be ordered to furnish natural gas to any other person so engaged in furnishing or required by law to furnish, natural gas for public use in a territory within the state, if and when the said person having said excess shall, to the extent of such excess, be ready and willing to furnish, and within such time as the commission shall prescribe shall actually furnish, to the consumers within said territory a reasonably adequate supply of natural gas.\n'Sec. 3. That in so far as the same shall not be in conflict with this act, all of the authority, powers, jurisdiction and duties conferred and imposed on the public service commission by the act entitled, 'An act to create a public service commission and to prescribe its powers \n\n and duties, and to prescribe penalties for the violations of the provisions of this act,' passed February twenty-first, one thousand nine hundred and thirteen, as amended by the act entitled, 'An act to amend and re-enact sections one, two, three, four, five, nine, ten, fourteen, fifteen and twenty-two, of chapter nine of the Acts of one thousand nine hundred and thirteen, creating a public service commission, prescribing its powers and duties, and penalties for violation of the provisions of said chapter, and to add thereto six sections to be known as sections twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty- eight, enlarging the powers and duties of said public service commission, prescribing additional penalties and giving to the commission power to punish for contempt,' passed February tenth, one thousand nine hundred and fifteen, are hereby conferred and imposed on the public service commission in resepect to the subject-matter of this act, or any other part thereof.\n'Sec. 4. That in case of violation of any provision of this act any person aggrieved or affected thereby may complain thereof to the public service commission in like manner, and thereupon such procedure shall be had, as is provided in respect to other complaints to or before said commission, and all such proceedings and remedies may be taken or had for the enforcement or review of the order or orders of said commission, and for the punishment of the violation of such order or orders, as are provided by law in respect to other orders of said commission. In case of the violation of any provision of this act, the public service commission, or any person aggrieved or affected by such violation, in his own name, may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction by a bill for injunction, petition for writ of mandamus or other appropriate action, suit or proceeding, to compel obedience to and compliance with this act, or to prevent the violation of this act, or any provision thereof, pending the proceedings before said commission, and thereafter until final determination of any action, suit or proceeing for the enforcement or review of the final order of said commission; and such court shall have jurisdiction to grant the appropriate order, judgment or decree in the premises.\n\n'Sec. 5. That if any person subject to the provisions of this act shall fail or refuse to comply with any requirement of the commis- \n\n sion hereunder, such person shall be subject to a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars for each offense; and such person, or the officers of the corporation, where such person is a corporation, may be indicted for their failure to comply with any requirement of the commission under the provisions of this act, and upon conviction thereof, may be fined not to exceed five hundred dollars, and in the discretion of the court, confined in jail not to exceed thirty days. Every day during which any person, or any officer, agent or employee of such person, shall fail to observe and comply with any order or direction of the commission, or to perform any duty enjoined by this act, shall constitute a separate and distinct violation of such order or direction of this act, as the case may be.\n'Sec. 6. That any person claiming to be damaged by any violation of this act may bring suit in his own behalf for the recovery of the damage from the person or persons so violating the same in any circuit court having jurisdiction. In any such action the court may compel the attendance of the person or persons against whom said action is brought, or any officer, director, agent or employee of such person or persons, as a witness, and also require the production of all books, papers and documents which may be useful as evidence, and in the trial thereof such witness may be compelled to testify, but any such witness shall not be prosecuted for any offense concerning which he is compelled hereunder to testify.\n\n'Sec. 7. That the word 'person' within the meaning of this act shall be construed to meanan, and to include, persons, firms and corporations.\n\n'Sec. 8. That the sections, provisions and clauses of this act shall b deemed separable each from the other, and also in respect to the persons, firms, corporations and consumers mentioned therein or affected thereby, and if any separable part of this act be, or be held to be unconstitutional or for any reason invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts thereof shall be and remain in full force and effect.\n\n'Sec. 9. That all acts and parts of acts in conflict with this act are hereby repealed.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Under the state Constitution the act went into effect on the expiration of 90 days after its 'passage' by the Legislature, as distinguished from its approval by the Governor. State v. Mounts, 36 W. Va. 179, 14 S. E. 407, 15 L. R. A. 243. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'The words 'public service corporation' used in this act shall include all persons, associations of persons, firms, corporations, municipalities and agencies engaged or employed in any business herein enumerated, or in any other public service business whether above enumerated or not, whether incorporated or not.' Acts 1913, c. 9,  3; Acts 1915, c. 8,  3; Acts 1921, c. 150,  3. See Acts 1919, c. 71,  3. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] A large part of the gas produced is not available for distribution to the public. Much is consumed within the state for field purposes-such as drilling and cleaning out wells or the operation of compressor or pump stations to transport the gas. The producer must also, under reservations in the leases, ordinarily deliver to the landowner free gas service. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] The temptation to discriminate may have been great. For Pennsylvania and Ohio Communities formerly supplied from local production of natural gas could, if this is no longer possible, afford to pay a vary high price for gas rather than to discard existing gas appliances and to install new ones which would be required if oil or coal were to be substituted as fuel. In 1921 the average price per M cubic feet for domestic consumption was 26 cents in West Virginia, 44 cents in Pennsylvania, and 42 cents in Ohio. For industrial consumption it was 16 cents in West Virginia, 32 cents in Pennsylvania, and 34 cents in Ohio. United States Geological Survey, 'Natural Gas in 1919-1921,' published May 22, 1923. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The state has a property interest in running water naturally flowing into it and in the public waters and air within its boundaries. Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., \n206 \nU.S. 230, 237\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 618, 11 Ann. Cas. 488. If the running water is withheld, its property is taken. If the public waters or the air is polluted, its territorial integrity is invaded. But the alleged right to purchase in interstate commerce and to import a natural resource is, in no sense, a right of the state. It would be described appropriately as a privilege of citizens of the United States. Compare Louisiana v. Texas, \n176 \nU.S. 1, 24\n, 25 S., 20 Sup. Ct. 251. Such privileges the state is not charged by the federal Constitution with the duty to enforce, and the fact that the institution of these suits was specially authorized by the Legistures of Pennsylvania and of Ohio can be of no legal significance. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The Attorney General of Ohio states in his brief: 'The supply of gas was adequate, both for consumption inside the state of West Virginia and for transportation to other states, until during the time of the World War in 1917 and 1918. Record, pp. 331 and 334. By reason of the vast demand for gas for industrial consumption, which occurred as a result of the war, and which drew upon the lines of the gas companies during the summer as heavily as or more heavily than during the winter, the gas companies had no opportunity to rest their wells or to accumulate a surplus of gas, as they had been under normal conditions. The federal government, unde normal conditions. The federal governent, through the Fuel Administration, gave orders to the gas companies to supply essential industrial plants with all the gas possible. Wells were drilled and turned into lines which, under normal conditions, would have been held in reserve, to assure a future supply. Record, pp. 333, 334. The supply of gas has never been adequate for all purposes, during periods of maximum demand, since that time.'\n It may be that production will increase. The war has closed. The excessive post-war activities of 1919 and early 1920 ceased, and were followed by a period of industrial depression. There may again be opportunity for periodic rest which gas wells, as well as human beings, appear to need, and thus seemingly exhausted wells may be restored. Furthermore, hitherto undeveloped gas areas may be worked, or more wells may be drilled in areas already developed, or new areas may be opened. For of the 2,725,798 acres of the gas territory held by the 67 public service corporations of the state in 1919, a large part are still undeveloped.\n Moreover, the demand may lessen. Except in times of emergency, use of natural gas by the industries will be determined largely by its relative cost as compared with coal or oil. The demands of economy in manufacture may alone compel a reduction of its use in industry and thus, for some time, leave the supply ample for domestic purposes. In 1920 Pennsylvania used for manufacturing purposes three times as much natural gas as it imported from West Virginia in 1921. U. S. Geological Survey, 'Natural Gas, 1919-1921,' published May 22, 1923, pp. 347, 355. Domestic consumption amounts to only 30 or 40 per cent. of the total consumption. U. S. Geological Survey, 'Natural Gas, 1919-1921,' supra, p. 352. Moreover, the present large waste may be stopped. The waste in Ohio in 1919 was in per cent.; in 1920 it was 18 per cent.; in 1921 it was 19 per cent. On the other hand, in West Virginia the waste in 1919 was only 1 per cent.; in 1920 and 1921, only 2 per cent. 'Natural Gas,' supra, p. 352. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The situation is wholly unlike that pressented in Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 520\n, 521 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 715, which is relied upon by plaintiffs. There the suit was against the state chemist, the executive official vested with power to act, and he had 'threatened the complainant that in default of such compliance he would cause the arrest and prosecution of every person dealing in the article within the state and had distributed broadcast throughout the state warning circulars.'\n Moreover, even if the West Virginia statute were construed as imposing penalties for disobedience so severe and menacing as to require the interposition of a federal court, it would be the public service corporations of West Virginia-not the states of Pennsylvania and Ohio- which would thereby be denied due process of law under the doctrine of Ex parte Young. And it is those corporations which would have to sue, as in Oklahoma Operating Co. v. Love, \n252 U.S. 331\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 338, here relied upon by plaintiff. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] 'It is not sufficient to say that the Attorney General, or the Governor, or even the Legislature of the state, can be conclusively deemed to represent the public interests in such a controversy as that presented by the bill. Even a state, when it voluntarily becomes a complainant in a court of equity, cannot claim to represent both sides of the controversy.' Minnesota v.

Geological Survey Bulletin, 'Natural Gas in 1919-1921,' supra, p. 345. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Some idea may be formed of the scope of this inquiry by examining the data concerning the natural gas operations collected by the United States Geological Survey. \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] For instance: If it should appear that the potential supply in Pennsylvania is ample for all present needs, but that its concerns prefer to husband their resources for the remoter future, would it be unjust discrimination on the part of the West Virginia companies to deny to their customers within the state an adequate supply while supplying to Pennsylvania distributing companies an amount of gas which these might have produced from reserves within Pennsylvania? Or if Kentucky had ample supplies and undeveloped fields, but sought gas from West Virginia because the Kentucky companies did not have the funds, or the inclination, to make, at the time, a large investment required to secure a supply within that state, would, under those circumstances, West Virginia companies be justified in supplying the Kentucky demand while leaving that of its West Virginia customers unsatisfied? Should distributing companies in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana be permitted to extend their mains or add new customers after West Virginia had recognized the insufficiency of the supply to satisfy the needs of consumers within the state? And what shall be deemed the existing demand of a state? Is existing demand to be limited to customers already connected? And does it mean the amount theretofore taken by such customers, or that which they may wish to take through existing appliances. \n\n\n\n\n","49":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMMERCIAL TRUST CO. OF NEW JERSEY v. MILLER(1923)\nNo. 575\nArgued: April 10, 1923Decided: April 10, 1923\n\n\nDecided Apr l 23, 1923.\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 51, 52]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Selden Bacon, of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. James A. Fowler, of Knoxville, Tenn., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit under the Trading with the Enemy Act of October 6, 1917, and the amendment of November 4, 1918, 40 Stat. 411, 1020 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/2 a et seq.). It was commenced by Francis P. Garvan as Alien Property Custodian. He ceasing to be such, Thomas W. Miller was appointed his successor, and substituted as petitioner. \n\n[262 U.S. 51, 53]\n\u00a0\n Section 7 of the act provides that, 'if the President shall so require, any money or other property ... held for the benefit of an enemy,' without license 'which the Prsident after investigation shall determine ... is so held, shall be conveyed, transported, assigned, delivered, or paid over to the alien property custodian.'\n The act has received exposition in Central Trust Co. v. Garvan, \n254 U.S. 554\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 214, and Stoehr v. Wallace, \n255 U.S. 239\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 293, and what it authorizes, and the conditions of the exercise of its authorization determined.\n Whatever problems the act presents those cases resolve. They decide that the President's power may, under section 51 of the act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/2 c), be delegated to and be exercised by the Custodian, and that the determination of the Custodian is conclusive whether right or wrong. And it may be exercised by forcible seizure of the property or by suit and, if by suit, the suit is purely possessory and must be yielded to; the right of any claimant being postponed to subsequent assertion. And it was decided that the Custodian acquires by suit 'nothing but the preliminary custody, such as would have been gained by seizure. It attaches the property to make sure that it is forthcoming if finally condemned and does no more.' In other words, and in comprehensive description, the act may be denominated an exercise of governmental power in the emergency of war and its procedure is accommodated to and made adequate to its purpose, but securing as well, the assertion of opposing or countervailing rights 'by a suit in equity unembarrassed by the President's executive determination,' and if the claimant 'prevails' the property 'is to be forthwith returned to him.' \n\n[262 U.S. 51, 54]\n\u00a0\n These are the determining generalities, and the Circuit Court of Appeals applying them, affirmed the decree of the District Court, adjudging, ordering and decreeing that the Commercial Trust Company of New Jersey 'do forthwith convey, transfer, assign, deliver and pay to Thomas W. Miller, as Alien Property Custodian, all of the money and other property held by it under a certain trust agreement entered into on January 30, 1913,' between the company and Frederick Wesche and Helene J. von Schierholz. A list of the moneys and other property was attached to the decree.\n It was recited in the trust agreement that the property which consisted of bonds, was held 'for the joint account of said Frederick Wesche and Helene J. von Schierholz, and to collect the interest to become due and payable on said bonds' for their joint account, and to deliver the bonds from time to time as requested, to either 'or to the survivor of them, it being understood that the said bonds and the said interest money to be collected thereon are to be held and collected and delivered or paid over to either the said Frederick Wesche or to the said Helene J. von Schierholz, or to the survivor of them.'\n In addition to the above, the following may be quoted from the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals:\n'The Trust Company, in compliance with the provisions of the act, made a report in December, 1917, that it held stocks, bonds, mortgages, securities and money, of the value of about $600,000, in trust, as to both principal and interest, for the joint account of Frederick Wesche, of Paris, France, and Helene J. vo Schierholz, of Plaue, Germany, to be delivered and paid to either upon his or her sole demand, or to the survivor.\n\n'Upon investigation the Alien Property Custodian determined that Wesche was a neutral and von Schierholz an alien enemy not holding a license from the President, and demanded surrender of the securities. Because the \n\n[262 U.S. 51, 55]\n\u00a0\n neutral had power upon his sole order to withdraw the whole property, the Trust Company thought the Alien Property Custodian had no right to it and accordingly declined to yield possession. Because the alien enemy had like power upon her sole order to withdraw the whole property and acquire its possession, the Alien Property Custodian thought he had a right to it and accordingly demanded it. The question is, Which was right?'\n\n The court answered the Custodian by virtue of his power under the act and the efficacy of its exercise. This appeal disputes the answer, and the contention is that the power was not exercised as required because the Custodian had not made an investigation which justified in any way 'any determination that the property was all (italics counsel's) enemy property, or seizure of all (italics counsel's) the property as such.' In support of the contention, it is urged, that no investigation was made of any interest in the property other than that of Mrs. Schierholz-none of Wesche, or none determined beyond what was shown by the report of and letter of the Commercial Trust Company. And there is also a contention that Wesche was not an enemy, and that he was given no opportunity of review, and the act, as to him, was 'unconstitutional and without due process of law' and that, consequently, surrender of the property by appellant (Trust Company) under such circumstances to the Custodian, would have afforded it no defense to the claim of Wesche for such part of the property as belonged to him. The appellant accordingly did not transfer or deliver the property as so demanded, and still retains it under supersedeas bond.\n The contentions are precluded by the cases which we have cited. As there decided, the act was of peremptory quality and effect. The suit was tantamount to physical seizure-gave preliminary custody such as seizure gives, and was intended to be not 'less immediately effective than a taking with a strong hand.' \n\n[262 U.S. 51, 56]\n\u00a0\n It is manifest, therefore, that the defenses upon which the contentions are based were not available to either claimant of the property. And besides, under the act, it is to be remembered, the Custodian succeeds to all the rights in the property to which the enemy is entitled as completely as if by conveyance, transfer or assignment, and the Trust Company in the present case held the bonds for the joint account of Wesche and Mrs. Schierholz to be paid over to either of them. She had the power, therefore, to demand the bonds and receive them and to this power the Custodian determined he succeeded, and, therefore, exercised. What interest Wesche had or has does not require decision, nor can the Trust Company urge it, the act requiring submission to the determination of the Custodian.\n The case, therefore, has no complexity and we do not think it is necessary to trace through the elaborate argument of counsel by which he attempts to sustain the contention of the Trust Company. Its foundation is, as said by the Circuit Court of Appeals, that the Trust Company 'claims the right to have property interests judicially determined by a court of equity before a right to the possession of the property can be asserted by the Alien Property Custodian.' The claim is precluded, we have seen, by Central Union Trust Co. v. Garvan, and Stoehr v. Wallace, Supra. Those cases decide, as we have also seen, that the suit is as of peremptory character as 'seizure in pais' and is the dictate and provision for the emergency of war, not to be defeated or delayed by defenses; its only condition, therefore, being the determination by the Alien Property Custodian that it was enemy property. It was recognized that there is impl cation in the act that mistakes may be made, but it, the act, assumes 'that the transfer will take place whether right or wrong.' In other words, it is the view of the opinions that the act provides for an exercise of government, but also provides, as \n\n[262 U.S. 51, 57]\n\u00a0\n we have said, redress for mistakes in its exercise by the claimant of the property filing a claim under section 9 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/2 e), which, if not yielded to, may be enforced by suit.\n The next contention of the Trust Company is that, the act being a provision for the emergency of war, is ceased with the cessation of war, ceased with the joint resolution of Congress declaring the state of war between Germany and the United States at an end, and its approval by the President, July 2, 1921 (42 Stat. 105), and the proclamation of peace by the President August 25, 1921. The contention, however, encounters in opposition the view that the power which declared the necessity is the power to declare its cessation, and what the cessation requires. The power is legislative. A court cannot estimate the effects of a great war and pronounce their termination at a particular moment of time, and that its consequences are so far swallowed up that legislation addressed to its emergency had ceased to have purpose or operation with the cessation of the conflicts in the field. Many problems would yet remain for consideration and solution, and such was the judgment of Congress, for it reserved from its legislation the Trading with the Enemy Act and amendments thereto, and provided that all property subject to that act shall be retained by the United States 'until such time as the Imperial German government ... shall have ... made suitable provision for the satisfaction of all claims.' Section 5. See Kahn v. Anderson, \n255 U.S. 1\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 224, and Vincenti v. United States (C. C. A.) 272 Fed. 114, and \n256 U.S. 700\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 538\n\n\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] By section 5 the President is in terms authorized to exercise 'any' of his powers 'through such officer or officers as he shall direct.' By section 6 (section 3115 1\/2 cc) he is authorized to appoint and 'prescribe the duties of' the officer to be known as the Alien Property Custodian. \n\n\n\n\n","50":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCONCRETE STEEL CO. v.

BARTON(1923)\nNo. 193\nArgued: Decided: January 29, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs.\nHarry A. Hegarty and James B. Flynn, both of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Frank H. Haskell, of Portland, Me., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Suit to redeem a mortgage which was executed by defendant in error to one George W. Towle to secure his \n\n[260 U.S. 677, 678]\n\u00a0\n promissory note for the payment to Towle of the sum of $2,000 and interest. The note and mortgage were dated October 14, 1905\n\n\n On February 20, 1919, a breach of the mortgage was committed and the holder of it, under the laws of the state, foreclosed it by taking possession of the mortgaged premises and duly recorded a certificate of the fact in the registry of deeds of the proper county.\n The bill as originally drawn was based upon an alleged effort to redeem the mortgaged premises by payment of the amount due upon the note and mortgage before the time of redemption expired, in which effort plaintiff alleges he failed by the absence of Conley from his residence and place of business.\n Plaintiff (defendant in error), however, amended his bill to read as follows:\n'The plaintiff further alleges that more than three months have elapsed since the expiration of one year from the time when the legal representatives of the mortgagee of the mortgage described in the plaintiff's bill took possession of the mortgaged property for the purpose of foreclosing said mortgage, but neither the mortgagee nor the holder of record of said mortgage, nor the legal representative or legal representatives, of either the mortgagee or holder of record of said mortgage nor any other person, has signed and sworn to an affidavit as required in cases of foreclosure of mortgages of real estate by section 4 of chapter 95 of the Revised Statutes of Maine as amended by chapter 192 of the Public Laws of A. D. 1917, and no such affidavit has been recorded in the registry of deeds where the certificate of said foreclosure is recorded, as required by said statute, and these facts were not known to the plaintiff at the time of filing his said bill as said three months had not elapsed at the time of filing said bill.'\n\n Plaintiff in error, answering the amendment, alleges that chapter 192 of the Public Laws of 1917 'has no application \n\n[260 U.S. 677, 679]\n\u00a0\n and no relevancy to the plaintiff's (plaintiff in error's) rights or cause of action herein,' and that if it be claimed that such chapter grants any additional time beyond the one year as covenanted in the mortgage deed, the act 'would be contrary to the provisions of section 10 [article 1] of the Constitution of the United States and to the covenant of the mortgage deed itself and, therefore, void and of no effect.' An estoppel was also pleaded.\n The mortgage contained a provision by which the mortgagor covenanted with the mortgagee that the right to redeem the mortgaged premises should be forever foreclosed in one year next after the commencement of foreclosure by any of the methods then provided by law, and one of the methods provided was entry into possession of the mortgaged premises and holding the same by consent in writing of the mortgagor, or the person holding under him.\n It is, however, provided by chapter 192 of the Public Laws of 1917, that possession so obtained (or by any other of the three modes provided) 'and continued for one year' will 'forever foreclose the right of redemption,' provided, however, 'that an affidavit signed and sworn to by the mortgagee or by the holder of record of the mortgage, or their legal representatives, is, written three months after the expiration of one year from the taking of such possession, recorded in the registry of deeds where the certificate of foreclosure is recorded. ...' Section 1.\n On February 20, 1919, a breach of the mortgage having been committed, the holder of the mortgage assigned it to the plaintiff in error, Conley, but two years before that time the act providing for the filing of the affidavit as above stated was passed, and its effect is the principal controversy in this case. Defendant in error urges it to sustain his right to redemption; plaintiff in error asserts that it is inapplicable, and contends that if held applicable, it is invalid as impairing the obligation of his contract, the mortgage. \n\n[260 U.S. 677, 680]\n\u00a0\n The trial court decided that the provision as applicable and valid. These conclusions were affirmed by the Supreme Court. 119 Me. 581, 112 Atl. 670.\n'There can be no doubt,' the Supreme Court said, 'that the amendment by its terms relates to all foreclosures begun after its passage including foreclosures of prior existing mortgages.'\n\n In reply to the contention that the statute impairs the obligation of the contract constituted by the mortgage 'by extending the foreclosure period for three months after the expiration of the year,' it was said:\n'But the statute does not extend the foreclosure period. In effect it imposes a condition which the mortgagee must perform or be held to have waived his foreclosure. He may perform the condition at once on the expiration of the year or at his option at any time within three months. If the affidavit is seasonably the foreclosure is complete at the end of the year. If not, it is invalidated.'\n\n By a rescript by one of the Justices the case is given a clearer definition. Chapter 192 of the Laws, it was decided, requires a mortgagee within 30 days after completion of foreclosure to record in the registry of deeds an affidavit setting forth the facts and that the affidavit is made the condition upon which the validity of the foreclosure depends, and further that it applied to mortgages dated before 1917 and which contain a one-year foreclosure covenant, which the court denominated 'the familiar form.' The conclusion was that such 'foreclosure clause' was 'not a contract contemplated and protected by the Constitution,' and further that the act related to the remedy for the enforcement of rights and that while an act may not so far affect the remedy as to impair the obligation of a contract, the test in such case 'is whether the value of the contract is lessened and whether a substantial and efficacious remedy remains.' It was decided that the act sustained the test.\n The basic principles that determine this case are elementary. The obligation of a contract cannot be impaired \n\n[260 U.S. 677, 681]\n\u00a0\n by a law passed after the contract was entered into, and the remedy for enforcement of the contract may be so far a part of it as to be within the principle that protects it. But the remedy may not have that intimacy of relation and a regulation or change of it may not impair its efficiency or lessen the obligation of the contract.\n It is recognized that the Legislature may modify or change existing remedies or prescribe new modes of procedure without impairing the obligation of contracts if a substantial or efficacious remedy remains or is given, by means of which a party can enforce his rights under the contract. Oshkosh Waterworks Co. v. Oshkosh, \n187 U.S. 437\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 234; Barnitz v. Beverly, \n163 U.S. 118\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 1042. These cases are complementary. In the first, an alteration of the remedy was sustained; in the second, the remedy was adjudged so intimate in its relation to the contract as to be within its obligation and immunity from change. The first is the reliance of defendant in error; the second, of plaintiff in error. Our inquiry, therefore, is: Which determines the case at bar?\n The statute, in execution of the purpose of the state, enjoins a duty upon the mortgagee, the effect of the nonperformance of which the mortgagor may avail of. In other words, the duty not performed, the attempt at foreclosure is null and void, and necessarily, therefore, it is no impediment to redemption of the mortgage by the mortgagor. It does not withhold possession of the premises for a single day, nor does it defeat the efficacy of possession as foreclosure. And we have seen the supreme Court of the state, passing upon it, decided that compliance with it does not involve any delay. The mortgagee may perform the condition at once or at his option any time within 3 months. It therefore only imposes a condition, easily complied with, which the law, for its purposes, requires; and the condition was required, and its purpose declared long before plaintiff in error's attempt at foreclosure. \n\n[260 U.S. 677, 682]\n\u00a0\n We think it would be extreme to hold that this is outside of the power of the state over remedies, and the law of the state has precedents of justification in Vance v. Vance, \n108 U.S. 514\n, 2 Sup. Ct. 854, and Curtis v. Whitney, 13 Wall. 68.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","52":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCRAIG v.

C.) 279 Fed. 900; Ex parte Craig %(c. c. a.) 282 f\/ed. 138.\n In October, 1919, petitioner Craig, Comptroller of New York City, wrote and published a letter to Public Service Commissioner Nixon, wherein he assailed United States District Judge Mayer because of certain action taken in receivership proceedings then pending. The United States district attorney filed an information charging him with criminal contempt under section 268, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1245). \n\n[263 U.S. 255, 269]\n\u00a0\n Having heard the evidence, given the matter prolonged consideration and offered the accused opportunity to retract, on February 24, 1921-some fifteen months after the offense-Judge Mayer, holding the District Court, sentenced petitioner to jail for 60 days and committed him to the custody of the United States marshal. Immediately, without making any effort to appeal, Craig presented his verified petition, addressed 'To the Honrable Martin T. Manton, Circuit Judge of the United States,' asking for a writ of habeas corpus and final discharge. The record of all evidence and proceedings before the District Court was annexed to, or by reference made part of, the petition. The judge promptly signed and issued the following writing, which bore neither seal of court nor clerk's attestation:\n'The United States of America, Second Judicial Circuit, Southern District of New York-ss.:\n\n'We command you that the body of Charles L. Craig, in your custody detained, as it is said, together with the day and cause of his caption and detention, you safely have before Honorable Martin T. Manton, United States Circuit Judge for the Second Judicial Circuit, within the circuit and district aforesaid, to do and receive all and singular those things which the said judge shall then and there consider of him in this behalf; and have you then and there this writ.\n\n'Witness the Honorable Martin T. Manton, United States Circuit Judge for the Second Judicial Circuit, this 24th day of February, 1921, and in the 145th year of the Independence of the United States of America.\n\n'Martin T. Manton, U. S. C. J.\n\n The marshal made return, and set up the contempt proceedings in the District Court along with the order of commitment. This was traversed, and Judge Manton heard the cause. He said and ruled: \n\n[263 U.S. 255, 270]\n\u00a0\n 'Was there a cause pending within the rule of contempt concerning libelous publications? A cause is pending when it is still open to modifications, appeal or rehearing, and until the final judgment is rendered. Did the letter concern a cause pending? If it did not, it could not obstruct the administration of justice. The application before the court, which is the subject-matter of the letter, was the matter of a coreceiver. As to this the court had definitely decided adverse to the comptroller. The court's action was complete in respect to this matter. ... The District Judge pointed out, as did the information, that the whole railroad situation was before the court, since it was an equity proceeding; but it is not of this that the defendant wrote. This is fully corroborated by the testimony of the defendant. He also testified that he had no intention of obstructing the delivery of justice or misbehaving himself so as to obstruct the administration of justice. He stands convicted upon his letter alone, and such inferences as may be drawn therefrom. His conviction rests upon an issue between the court and the defendant, and it is one of terminology or interpretation. There is no criminal intent discoverable from this record to support the interpretation placed upon it by the court, nor was there pending sub judice a proceeding before the court at the time the letter was written. The conclusion is irresistible that the court exceeded its jurisdiction by an excess of power in adjudging the defendant guilty. The petition for discharge is granted.' 274 Fed. 187.\n'It is ordered that the papers in this proceeding be filed with the clerk of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, in his office in the Post Office Building, in the borough of Manhattan, city of New York, and that this order be recorded in said court.'\n\n Circuit Judge Hough allowed an appeal. Being of opinion that Circuit Judges, as such, are without power \n\n[263 U.S. 255, 271]\n\u00a0\n to grant writs of habeas corpus, the Circuit Court of Appeals treated the cause as determined by the District Court, to which Judge Manton had been assigned, and held:\n'We find no reason why this case is not governed by the general rule that a habeas corpus proceeding cannot be used as a writ of error, but must be limited to jurisdictional questions. ... The sole question which could be considered in the habeas corpus proceedings was as to the jurisdiction of the District Judge. If he had jurisdiction of the person of the petitioner, Craig, and jurisdiction of the subject and authority to render the judgment which he pronounced, there was no right to inquire further in the habeas corpus proceedings, and no right to determine whether or not, in the exercise of that jurisdiction, the District Judge had committed error. If errors were committed, the law afforded a remedy therefor, but not by habeas corpus.' 282 Fed. 151.\n\n It concluded that the District Court, Judge Mayer presiding, had jurisdiction of both offense and person, and reversed the order of discharge.\n The court correctly held that United States Circuit Judges, as such, have no power to grant writs of habeas corpus.\n Two sections of the Revised Statutes authorize the granting and issuing of such writs.\n'Sec. 751. The Supreme Court and the Circuit and District Courts shall have power to issue writs of habeas corpus.\n\n'Sec. 752. The several justices and judges of said courts, within their respective jurisdictions, shall have power to grant writs of habeas corpus for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of restraint of liberty.'\n\n Comp. St.  1279, 1280\n\n\n The Judiciary Act of 1789 (1 Stat. 73) provided for the organization of Circuit Courts. Until 1869 they were presided over by District Judges and Justices of the Supreme Court. The Act of April 10, 1869, 16 Stat. 44, created the office \n\n[263 U.S. 255, 272]\n\u00a0\n of Circuit Judge:\n'For each of the nine existing judicial circuits there shall be appointed a Circuit Judge, who shall reside in his circuit, and shall possess the same power and jurisdiction therein as the justice of the Supreme Court allotted to the circuit.' Section 2.\n\n This provision became part of section 607, Rev. Stats:\n'For each circuit there shall be appointed a Circuit Judge, who shall have the same power and jurisdiction therein as the justice of the Supreme Court allotted to the circuit. ... Every Circuit Judge shall reside within his circuit.'\n\n The Act of March 3, 1911 (Judicial Code,  289, 291, 297 [Comp. St .  1266, 1268, 1274]), abolished Circuit Courts, conferred their duties, and powers upon the District Courts, and specifically repealed section 607, Rev. Stats. It also repealed 'all acts and parts of acts authorizing the appointment of United States Circuit or District Judges ... enacted prior to February 1, 1911.' Section 118, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1109), provides:\n'There shall be in the second, seventh, and eighth circuits, respectively, four Circuit Judges; in the fourth circuit, two Circuit Judges; and in each of the other circuits, three Circuit Judges, to be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. ... The Circuit Judges in each circuit shall be judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals in that circuit, and it shall be the duty of each Circuit Judge in each circuit to sit as one of the judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals in that circuit from time to time according to law: Provided, that nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any Circuit Judge holding District Court or serving in the Commerce Court, or otherwise, as provided for and authorized in other sections of this act.'\n\n Sections 751 and 752, Rev. Stats. give authority to grant writs of habeas corpus only to judges and justices of the courts therein specified- Supreme, Circuit and District. The Judicial Code abolished the Circuit Courts. Only justices of the Supreme Court and judges of District Courts remain within the ambit of the statute. \n\n[263 U.S. 255, 273]\n\u00a0\n Section 18, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  985):\n'Whenever in the judgment of the senior Circuit Judge of the circuit in which the district lies, or of the Circuit Justice assigned to such circuit, or of the Chief Justice, the public interest shall require, the said judge, or Associate Justice, or Chief Justice, shall designate and appoint any Circuit Judge of the circuit to hold said District Court.'\n\n A duly executed writing designated and appointed Judge Manton--\n'to hold a session of the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York for the trial of causes and the hearing and disposition of such ex parte and other business as may come before him during the period beginning February 21, 1921, and ending March 5, 1921.'\n\n Petitioner's counsel took care to show this assignment, and, responding to the motion that the judge should proceed as a District Court in hearing the application for petitioner's discharge, he stated:\n'Our position is, your honor, that the writ is issued by you as a Circuit Judge. In addition thereto, you were designated formally under the statute, and under that form of designation you had the power and the duty in chambers of doing the acts and proceedings of a District Court judge, and we therefore claim that there was superadded to your powers, if necessary, the powers and activities of a District Court judge.'\n\n And in the brief here counsel maintains:\n'In issuing the writ Circuit Judge Manton, in addition to his powers as a Circuit Judge, was exercising the powers of a District Judge under designation.'\n\n As Circuit Judges have no authority to issue writs of habeas corpus, Judge Manton acted unlawfully unless the proceeding was before him either as District Judge or as the District Court. The record shows he did not rely solely on his authority as Circuit Judge, and, considering his assignment and all the circumstances, we agree with the court below that he was exercising the \n\n[263 U.S. 255, 274]\n\u00a0\n powers of the District Court. He was not a District Judge, but Circuit Judge assigned 'to hold a session of the District Court.'\n If it be conceded that he acted as District Judge, and not as the District Court, nevertheless his action was subject to review. Webb et al. v. York (1896) 74 Fed. 753, 21 C. C. A. 65, holds that an appeal lies to the Circuit Court of Appeals from the final orders of a judge at chambers in habeas corpus proceedings. Notwithstanding Hoskins et al. v. Funk, 239 Fed. 278, 152 C. C. A. 266, to the contrary, we approve the conclusion reached in Webb v. York and think it is supported by sound argument. The court said:\n'The present motion to dismiss ... raises the question whether an appeal lies to this court from an order made by a District Judge at chambers in a habeas corpus proceeding, directing the discharge of a prisoner. Prior to the Act of March 3, 1891, creating Circuit Courts of Appeals ... an appeal lay from such orders to the Circuit Court for the district by virtue of section 763, Rev. St. ...\n\n\"Sec. 763. From the final decision of any court, justice or judge inferior to the Circuit Court, upon an application for a writ of habeas corpus or upon such writ when issued, an appeal may be taken to the Circuit Court for the district in which the cause is heard . ...'\n\n'In the case of United States v. Fowkes, 3 U. S. App. 247, 3 C. C. A. 394, 53 Fed. 13, it was held that the Act of March 3, 1891, supra, operated to divest the Circuit Courts of their appellate jurisdiction in habeas corpus cases, under section 763, and that by virtue of the provisions of the Act of March 3, 1891, the various Circuit Courts of Appeals had acquired the jurisdiction to review the decisions of District Court in habeas corpus cases that had previously been exercised by the Circuit Courts. This conclusion, we think, was fairly warranted by the following clause. ...\n\n'Sec. 4. That no appeal, whether by writ of error or otherwise, shall hereafter be taken or allowed from any \n\n[263 U.S. 255, 275]\n\u00a0\n District Court to the existing Circuit Courts, and no appellate jurisdiction shall hereafter be exercised or allowed by said existing Circuit Courts, but all appeals by writ of error or otherwise, from said District Courts shall only be subject to review in the Supreme Court of the United States or in the Circuit Court of Appeals hereby established. ...'\n\n'See, also Duff v. Carrier, 5 C. C. A. 177, 55 Fed. 433.\n\n'The result is that, unless the Act of March 3, 1891, is construed as lodging in the Circuit Courts of Appeals the appellate jurisdiction, under Section 763, from final decisions of District Judges, that was previously exercised by the Circuit Courts, the right of appeal, plainly granted by that section, from final decisions of District Judges at chambers in habeas corpus cases is lost, and becomes valueless, because no court has been designated to which appeals in such cases may be taken. We think it clear that it was not the purpose of Congress to thus legislate. If it had intended to abolish the right of appeal from the decisions of District Judges in habeas corpus cases, it would doubtless have done so in plain and direct terms.\n\n'The fact that the right of appeal was not thus abolished furnishes a persuasive inference that Congress intended to designate a court to hear and determine such appeals. In McLish v. Roff, \n141 \nU.S. 661, 666\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 118, and in Lau Ow Bew v. United States, \n144 U.S. 47\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 517, it was said, in substance, by the Supreme Court of the United States that it was the purpose of the Act of March 3, 1891, to distribute the entire appellate jurisdiction theretofore exercised by the federal courts between the Supreme Court of the United States and the Circuit Courts of Appeals that were thereby established. This intent, we think, is plainly apparent from the terms of the act. Moreover, the act in question very much enlarged the right of appeal, and that was one of its chief objects. In no single instance, so far as we are aware, \n\n[263 U.S. 255, 276]\n\u00a0\n was a previous right of appeal abolished.\n\n'We think, therefore, that it may be fairly concluded that it was the intention of Congress to confer on the Circuit Courts of Appeals the right to hear appeals from final orders made by District Judges in habeas corpus cases, as well as to hear appeals from final decisions of District Courts made in such cases. We can conceive of no reason why the right should be denied in the one case and granted in the other, and such we believe was not the intent of the lawmaker.\n\n'In the case of United States v. Gee Lee, 7 U. S. App. 183, 1 C. C. A. 516, 50 Fed. 271, it was held that the words 'the judge of the District Court for the district,' as used in an act of Congress, were equivalent to the words 'District Court for the district.' By a similar latitude of construction, the intent being clear, we think that section 4 of the act of March 3, 1891, may be held to authorize an appeal to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals from a final decision of a District Judge at chambers in a habeas corpus case, as well as from a final decision of a District Court.'\n\n See also United States, Petitioner, \n194 U.S. 194\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 629.\n Carper v. Fitzgerald, \n121 U.S. 87\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 825, Ex parte Lennon, \n150 U.S. 393\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 123, McKnight v. James, \n155 U.S. 685\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 248, Lambert v. Barrett, \n157 U.S. 697\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 722, and Harkrader v. Wadley, \n172 U.S. 148\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 119, are cited by petitioner to show that no appeal lay from the order discharging petitioner. These cases relate to the jurisdiction of this court, not the Circuit Court of Appeals. The one first cited and most relied upon was decided in 1887. It recognizes the distinction between orders of a judge, as such, and decrees by the court. It denied the right to appeal here from a judge's order; it did not discuss the power of Circuit Courts to review such orders. The later cited cases go no further than to hold that appeals do not lie to this court from orders by judges at chambers.\n Although in point, we cannot agree with Ex parte Jacobi (C. C.) 104 Fed. 681, where the opinion of the Circuit \n\n[263 U.S. 255, 277]\n\u00a0\n Judge attempts to support denial of an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals from an order granted at chambers.\n The court below had jurisdiction of the appeal,\n On the merits, there is nothing unusual about the cause now before us. Unlike Ex parte Hudgings, \n249 \nU.S. 378, 384\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 337, 340 (63 L. Ed. 656, 11 A. L. R. 333), it cannot be regarded as 'an exception to the general rules of procedure.' Nor do we think it presents circumstances sufficiently extraordinary to bring it within any class of 'exceptional cases.' Henry v. Henkel, \n235 \nU.S. 219, 228\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 54, 56 (59 L. Ed. 203).\n The matter heard by Judge Mayer was an ordinary contempt proceeding and Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, \n247 U.S. 402\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 560 is enough to show that the District Court had power to entertain it, decide whether the evidence established an offense within the statute and determine petitioner's guilt or innocence. When the latter found himself aggrieved by the decree his remedy by appeal was plain. Neglecting that course, he asked a single judge to review and upset the entire proceedings, and now claims there was no appeal from the favorable order. As tersely stated by Judge Hough:\n'There is no new matter in this record attacking jurisdiction; what really happened was that the case was tried over again, and the socalled writ was no more than a device for obtaining a new trial.'\n\n The course taken indicates studied purpose to escape review of either proceeding by an appellate court. Petitioner may not complain of unfortunate consequences to himself.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals correctly applied the well-established general rule that a writ of habeas corpus cannot be utilized for the purpose of proceedings in error. Harlan v. McGourin, \n218 \nU.S. 442, 445\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 44, 21 Ann. Cas. 849; Matter of Gregory, \n219 \nU.S. 210, 213\n, 217 S., 31 Sup. Ct. 143; Glasgow v. Moyer, \n225 \nU.S. 420, 428\n, 429 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 753. Its decree is affirmed, and the cause will be remanded to the District Court for the Southern District of New York, with directions to vacate the order \n\n[263 U.S. 255, 278]\n\u00a0\n releasing petitioner; discharge the writ, and take such further proceedings as may be necessary to carry this opinion into effect.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, concurring.\n I concur fully in the opinion of the Court.\n It is of primary importance that the right freely to comment on and criticize the action, opinions and judgments of courts and judges should be preserved inviolate; but it is also essential that courts and judges should not be impeded in the conduct of judicial business by publications having the direct tendency and effect of obstructing the enforcement of their orders and judgments, or of impairing the justice and impartiality of verdicts.\n If the publication criticizes the judge or court after the matter with which the criticism has to do has been finally adjudicated and the proceedings are ended so that the carrying of the court's judgment cannot be thereby obstructed, the publication is not contempt and cannot be summarily punished by the court however false, malicious or unjust it may be. The remedy of the judge as an individual is by action or prosecution for libel. If, however, the publication is intended and calculated to obstruct and embarrass the court in a pending proceeding in the matter of the rendition of an impartial verdict, or in the carrying out of its orders and judgment, the court may, and it is its duty to protect the administration of justice by punishment of the offender for contempt.\n The federal statute concerning contempts as constructed by this court in prior cases vests in the trial judge the jurisdiction to decide whether a publication is obstructive \n\n[263 U.S. 255, 279]\n\u00a0\n or defamatory only. The delicacy there is in the judge's deciding whether an attack upon his own judicial action is mere criticism or real obstruction, and the possibility that impulse may incline his view to personal vindication are manifest. But the law gives the person convicted of contempt in such a case the right to have the whole question on facts and law reviewed by three judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals who have had no part in the proceedings, and if not successful in that court, to apply to this Court for an opportunity for a similar review here.\n The petitioner and his counsel have made such a review impossible. Instead of pursuing this plain remedy for injustice that may have been done by the trial judge and securing by an appellate court a review of this very serious question on the merits, they sought by applying to a single judge of only coordinate authority for a writ of habeas corpus to release the petitioner on the ground that the trial judge was without jurisdiction to make the decision he did. This raised the sole issue whether the trial judge had authority to decide the question, not whether he had rightly decided it.\n Relying on a decision of this court made years ago when the statutory provisions were different from those which now apply, the petitioner and his counsel thought that if they could secure a decision from a single Circuit Judge releasing the petitioner, no appeal would lie from his decision and that thus resort to the appellate courts could be avoided. The single judge to whom they applied released the prisoner. They were, however, mistaken in supposing that no appeal lay to the judge's decision on the question of the trial court's jurisdiction. The government prosecuted its appeal, and the only issue presented in that review is the matter of the trial court's jurisdiction which the Circuit Court of Appeals and we uphold. In this way, the petitioner and his counsel threw \n\n[263 U.S. 255, 280]\n\u00a0\n away opportunity for a review of the case on its merits in the Circuit Court of Appeals and in this court in their purpose to make a short cut and secure final release through the act of a single judge. This is the situation the petitioner finds himself in and we are without power to relieve him.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, dissenting.\n I think that the petitioner's resort to habeas corpus in this case was right and was the only proper course. Very possibly some of the cases confuse the principles that govern jurisdiction with those that govern merits. See Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230, 235\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 641. But I think that this should be treated as a question of jurisdiction. The statute puts it as a matter of power:\n'The said courts shall have power ... to punish ... contempts of their authority: Provided, that such power to punish contempts shall not be construed to extend to any cases except the misbehavior of any person in their presence, or so near thereto as to obstruct struct the administration of justice,' etc. Judicial Code,  268 (Comp. St.  1245).\n\n I think that these words should be taken literally and that we do not need a better illustration of the need to treat them as jurisdictional and to confine the jurisdiction very narrowly than the present case. For we must not confound the power to punish this kind of contempts with the power to overcome and punish disobedience to or defiance of the orders of a court, although unfortunately both are called by the same name. That of course a court may and should use as fully as needed, but this, especially if it is to be extended by decisions to which I cannot agree, makes a man judge in matters in which he is likely to have keen personal interest and feeling although neither selfprotection nor the duty of going on with the work requires him to take such a part. It seems to me that the statute on its face plainly limits the jurisdiction of the judge in this class of cases to those \n\n[263 U.S. 255, 281]\n\u00a0\n where his personal action is necessary in a strict sense in order to enable him to go on with his work. But wherever the line may be drawn it is a jurisdictional line. 'The jurisdiction attaches only when the suit presents a substantial claim under an act of Congress.' Blumenstock Brothers Advertising Agency v. Curtis Publishing Co., \n252 \nU.S. 436, 441\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 385, 387 (64 L. Ed. 649); Ex parte Hudgings, \n249 U.S. 378\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 337, 11 A. L. R. 333.\n I think that the sentence from which the petitioner seeks relief was more than an abuse of power. I think it should be held wholly void. I think in the first place that there was no matter pending before the Court in the sense that it must be to make this kind of contempt possible. It is not enough that somebody may hereafter move to have something done. There was nothing then awaiting decision when the petitioner's letter was published. The English cases show that the law of England at least is in accord with my view. Metzler v. Gounod, 30 Law Times R. (N. S.) 164. But if there had been, and giving the most unfavorable interpretation to all that the letter says, I do not see how to misstate past matters of fact of the sort charged here could be said to obstruct the administration of justice. Suppose the petitioner falsely and unjustly charged the judge with having excluded him from knowledge of the facts, how can it be pretended that the charge obstructed the administration of justice when the judge seemingly was willing to condone it if the petitioner would retract? Unless a judge while sitting can lay hold of any one who ventures to publish anything that tends to make him unpopular or to belittle him I cannot see what power Judge Mayer had to touch Mr. Craig. Even if feeling was tense there is no such thing as what Keating, J., in Metzler v. Gounod calls contingent contempt. A man cannot be summarily laid by the heels because his words may make publich feeling more unfavorable in case the judge should be asked to act at some \n\n[263 U.S. 255, 282]\n\u00a0\n later date, any more than he can for exciting public feeling against a judge for what he already has done.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","53":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCRAMER v. U S(1923)\nNo. 207\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[261 U.S. 219, 220]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. F. R. Ogilby, of Washington, D. C., and Frank Thunen, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellants.\n\n\n[261 U.S. 219, 223]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Riter, for the United States. \n\n[261 U.S. 219, 224]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal brings up for review a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, directing the cancellation of a land patent issued in 1904 by the United States to the defendant, the Central Pacific Railway Company, in so far as it purports to convey certain legal subdivisions of land in sections 13 and 23, township 43 north, range 8 west, M. D. M., Siskiyou county, Cal. 276 Fed. 78. \n\n[261 U.S. 219, 225]\n\u00a0\n The suit was brought in the federal District Court for the Northern District of California by the United States, acting in behalf of three Indians, who, it was claimed, had occupied the lands continuously since before 1859. The Act of July 25, 1866, 14 Stat. 239, c. 242, granted to the predecessor of the defendant company a series of odd-numbered sections of land, including those named, but excepted from the grant such lands as 'shall be found to have been granted, sold, reserved, occupied by homestead settlers, pre-empted or otherwise disposed of.' \n1\n The obligations of the grant were complied with, and patent conveying the sections mentioned above, with others, was issued to the defendant company, as successor in interest of the legislative grantee.\n The original complaint alleged an actual occupancy by the individual Indians, but sought cancellation of the patent primarily on the ground that the lands formed part of an Indian reservation provided for in a treaty which was pending for ratification when the act of 1866 was passed; but this last contention was abandoned on the trial, it appearing that the treaty had been rejected by the Senate prior to that date.\n But the District Court found for the plaintiff upon the issue of actual occupancy and entered a decree confirming the right of possession in the Indians, which, however, was confined to the land actually inclosed, being an irregular body of about 175 acres and which did not in terms cancel the patent. \n\n[261 U.S. 219, 226]\n\u00a0\n After the submission of the case plaintiff was allowed, over defendants' objection, to amend its bill by reciting that in bringing the suit the government proceeded in its own right and as guardian of its Indian wards, thereafter named in the bill, by omitting all reference to the treaty, and by making the allegations respecting the Indian occupancy somewhat more specific.\n The District Court refused to reopen the case on the defendants' application to allow further proof on the issue last stated, holding that, as the occupation by the Indians was alleged in the origi al bill, defendants should have offered their evidence on that issue at the trial. The court found that as early as 1859 the Indians named lived with their parents upon the lands described and had resided there continuously ever since; that they had under fence between 150 and 175 acres in an irregularly shaped tract, running diagonally through the two sections, portions of which they had irrigated and cultivated; that they had constructed and maintained dwelling houses and divers outbuildings, and had actually resided upon the lands and improved them for the purpose of making for themselves homes. These findings have support in the evidence and will be accepted here. Adamson v. Gilliland, \n242 \nU.S. 350, 353\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 169.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with that of the District Court generally, but extended the right of possession to the whole of each of the legal subdivisions which was fenced and cultivated in part, and reversed the decree with instructions to enter one canceling the patent in respect of the entire 360 acres.\n A reversal of this decree is now sought upon several grounds.\n\n 1. \nIt is urged that the occupancy of land by individual Indians does not come within the exceptive provision of the grant.\n Until the Act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 402, 420, c. 131, extending the homestead privilege to Indians, the right \n\n[261 U.S. 219, 227]\n\u00a0\n of an individual Indian to acquire title to public lands by entry was not recognized. It cannot, therefore, be said that these lands were occupied by homestead settlers nor were they granted, sold or pre-empted, but the question remains, were they 'reserved ... or otherwise disposed of?' Unquestionably it has been the policy of the federal government from the beginning to respect the Indian right of occupancy, which could only be interfered with or determined by the United States. Beecher v. Wetherby, \n95 U.S. 517\n, 525; Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 \nU.S. 373, 385\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 650. It is true that this policy has had in view the original nomadic tribal occupancy, but it is likewise true that in its essential spirit it applies to individual Indian occupancy as well; and the reasons for maintaining it in the latter case would seem to be no less cogent, since such occupancy being of a fixed character lends support to another well understood policy, namely, that of inducing the Indian to forsake his wandering habits and adopt those of civilized life. That such individual occupancy is entitled to protection finds strong support in various rulings of the Interior Department, to which in land matters this court has always given much weight. Midway Co. v. Eaton, \n183 \nU.S. 602, 609\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 261 Hastings, etc., R. R. Co. v. Whitney, \n132 \nU.S. 357, 366\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 112. That department has exercised its authority by issuing instructions from time to time to its local officers to protect the holdings of nonreservation Indians against the efforts of white men to dispossess them. See 3 Land Dec. 371; 6 Land Dec. 341; 32 Land Dec. 382. In Poisal v. Fitzgerald, 15 Land Dec. 19, the right of occupancy of an individual Indian was upheld as against an attempted homestead entry by a white man. In State of Wisconsin, 19 Land Dec. 518, there had been granted to the state certain swamp lands within an Indian reservation, but the right of Indian occupancy was upheld, although the grant in terms was not subject \n\n[261 U.S. 219, 228]\n\u00a0\n thereto. In Ma-Gee-See v. Johnson, 30 Land Dec. 125, Johnson had made an entry under section 2289, Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  4530), which applied to 'unappropriated public lands.' It appeared that at the time of the entry and for some time thereafter the land had been in the possession and use of the plaintiff, an Indian. It was held that under the circumstances the land was not unappropriated within the meaning of the statute, and therefore not open to entry. In Schumacher v. State of Washington, 33 L. D. 454, 456, certain lands, claimed by the state under school grant, were occupied and had been improved by an Indian living apart from his tribe, but application for allotment had not been made until after the state had sold the land. It was held that the grant to the state did not attach under the provision excepting lands 'otherwise disposed of by or under authority of an act of Congress.' Secretary Hitchcock, in deciding the case, said:\n'It is true that the Indian did not give notice of his intention to apply for an allotment of this land until after the state had made disposal thereof, but the purchaser at said sale was bound to take notice of the actual possession of the land by the Indian if, as alleged, he was openly and notoriously in possession thereof at and prior to the alleged sale, and that the act did not limit the time within which application for allotment should be made.'\n\n Congress itself, in apparent recognition of possible individual Indian possession, has in several of the state enabling acts required the incoming state to disclaim all right and title to lands 'owned or held by any Indian or Indian tribes.' See 25 Stat. 676, c. 180,  4, par. 2; 28 Stat. 107, c. 138,  3, par. 2.\n The action of these individual Indians in abandoning their nomadic habits and attaching themselves to a definite locality, reclaiming, cultivating, and improving the soil and establishing fixed homes thereon, was in harmony with the well-understood desire of the government which \n\n[261 U.S. 219, 229]\n\u00a0\n we have mentioned. To hold that by so doing they acquired no possessory rights to which the government would accord protection would be contrary to the whole spirit of the traditional American policy toward these dependent wards of the nation.\n The fact that such right of occupancy finds no recognition in any statute or other formal governmental action is not conclusive. The right, under the circumstances here disclosed, flows from a settled governmental policy. Broder v. Water Co., \n101 U.S. 274\n, 276, furnishes an analogy. There this court, holding that the Act of July 26, 1866, 14 Stat. 251, c. 262,  9 (Comp. St.  4647), acknowledging and confirming rights of way for the construction of ditches and canals, was in effect declaratory of a pre-existing right, said:\n'It is the established doctrine of this court that rights of ... persons who had constructed canals and ditches ... are rights which the government had, by its conduct, recognized and encouraged and was bound to protect, before the passage of the act of 1866. We are of opinion that the section of the act which we have quoted was rather a voluntary recognition of a pre-existing right of possession, constituting a valid claim to its continued use, than the establishment of a new one.'\n\n Then, referring to the land grant to the Pacific Railroad Companies, which was made expressly subject to 'pre-emption, homestead, swamp-land, or other lawful claims,' and which antedated the act of 1866, the court held that defendant's right of way for its canal, independent of that act, was within the excepting provision of that grant and said:\n'We have had occasion to construe a very common clause of reservation in grants to other railroad companies, and in aid of other works of internal improvements, and in all of them we have done so in the light of the general principle that Congress, in the act of making these donations, could not be supposed to exercise its liberality at the expense of preexisting rights, which, though imperfect, were \n\n[261 U.S. 219, 230]\n\u00a0\n still meritorious, and had just claims to legislative protection.'\n\n We are referred to Buttz v. Northern Pacific Railroad, \n119 U.S. 55\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 100, but that case affords no aid to the defendant. There the railroad ran through a section of the country where the original right of Indian occupancy had not been extinguished and this court held \n119 U.S. 66\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 104 (30 L. Ed. 330):\n'The grant conveyed the fee subject to this right of occupancy. The railroad company took the property with this incumbrance.'\n\n The U ited States, however, undertook to extinguish the Indian title as rapidly as might be consistent, etc., and when this was done the right of the company, it was held, immediately attached free from the Indian title.\n In our opinion the possession of the property in question by these Indians was within the policy and with the implied consent of the government. That possession was definite and substantial in character and open to observation when the railroad grant was made, and we have no doubt falls within the clause of the grant excepting from its operation lands 'reserved ... or otherwise disposed of.'\n\n 2. \nIt is insisted that any rights these Indians might otherwise have had are barred by the provisions of the Act of March 3, 1851, 9 Stat. 631, c. 41. This statute required every person claiming lands in California by virtue of any right or title derived from the Spanish or Mexican governments to present the same for settlement to a commission created by the act. There was a provision directing the commission to ascertain and report the tenure by which the mission lands were held and those held by civilized Indians, and other Indians described. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[261 U.S. 219, 231]\n\u00a0\n The act plainly has no application. The Indians here concerned do not belong to any of the classes described therein and their claims were in no way derived from the Spanish or Mexican governments. Moreover, it does not appear that these Indians were occupying the lands in question when the act was passed.\n Barker v. Harvey, \n181 U.S. 481\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 690, does not support the defendants' contention. There the Indians whose claims were in dispute were Mission Indians claiming a right of occupancy derived from the Mexican government. They had failed to present their claims to the Commission, and this, it was held, constituted an abandonment. The Indians here concerned have no such claim and are not shown to be within the terms of the act of 1851 in any respect. It further appeared in that case that prior to the cession to the United States the Mexican authorities, upon examination, found that the Indians had aban doned \n\n[261 U.S. 219, 232]\n\u00a0\n the lands and thereupon made an absolute grant to the plaintiff's predecessors, and, this grant having been confirmed by the Commission, a patent for the lands had issued.\n\n 3. \nThe contention that the United States was without authority to maintain the suit in the capacity of guardian for these Indians is without merit. In United States v. Kagama, \n118 \nU.S. 375, 383\n, 384 S., 6 Sup. Ct. 1109, 1114, the general doctrine was laid down by this court that the Indian tribes are wards of the nation, communities dependent on the United States. 'From their very weakness and helplessness, so largely due to the course of dealing of the federal government with them and the treaties in which it has been promised, there arises the duty of protection, and with it the power.' This duty of protection and power extend to individual Indians, even though they may have become citizens. United States v. Nice, \n241 \nU.S. 591, 598\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 696, and cases cited; Heckman v. United States, \n224 \nU.S. 413, 436\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 424; United States v. Gray et al., 201 Fed. 291, 119 C. C. A. 529; United States v. Fitzgerald, 201 Fed. 295, 119 C. C. A. 533. In United States v. Gray, supra, the capacity of the United States to sue for the breach of a lease made by an Indian allottee was asserted and upheld. After pointing out the fact that it was the policy of the government to protect all Indians and their property and to teach and persuade them to abandon their nomadic habits the court said:\n'The civil and political status of the Indians does not condition the power of the government to protect their property or to instruct them. Their admission to citizenship does not deprive the United States of its power nor relieve it of its duty. ...'\n\n In United States v. Fitzgerald, supra, it was held that the United States had capacity to sue for the taking of personal property from an Indian held by him subject to the management of an Indian agent, on the ground, among others, that such taking obstructs the execution of its governmental policy. At page 296 of 201 Fed., at page 534 of 119 C. C. A. the \n\n[261 U.S. 219, 233]\n\u00a0\n court said:\n'The United States may lawfully maintain suits in its own courts to prevent interference with the means it adopts to exercise its powers of government and to carry into effect its policies. It may maintain such suits, although it has no pecuniary interest in the subjectmatter thereof, for the purpose of protecting and enforcing its governmental rights and to aid in the execution of its governmental policies.'\n\n Congress may, if it thinks fit, emancipate the Indians from their wardship wholly or partially, United States v. Waller, \n243 \nU.S. 452, 459\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 430; but in respect of the Indians here concerned that has not been done. It results, from the conclusion we have reached to the effect that these Indians had occupied the lands in dispute with the implied consent of the United States and in accordance with its policy, that the United States sustains such a relation to the subject matter and persons that its authority to maintain the suit cannot be questioned.\n\n 4. \nThe suit is not barred by the Act of March 3, 1891, c. 561,  8, 26 Stat. 1095, 1099, limiting the time within which suits may be brought by the United States to annul patents.\n The object of that statute is to extinguish any right the government may have in the land which is the subject of the patent, not to foreclose claims of third parties. Here the purpose of the annulment was not to establish the right of the Unite States to the lands, but to remove a cloud upon the possessory rights of its wards. As stated by establish the right of the United States to R. R. Co., \n165 \nU.S. 463, 475\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 368, 371 (41 L. Ed. 789) the statute was passed in recognition of--\n'the fact that when there are no adverse individual rights, and only the claims of the government and of the present holder of the title to be considered, it is fitting that a time should come when no mere errors or irregularities on the part of the officers of the land department should be open for consideration.'\n\n After the \n\n[261 U.S. 219, 234]\n\u00a0\n lapse of the statutory period, the patent becomes conclusive against the government, but not as against claims and rights of others, merely because the relation of the government to them is such as to justify or require its affirmative intervention. See Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 355, 367\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 368; La Roque v. United States, \n239 \nU.S. 62, 68\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 22.\n\n 5. \nNeither is the government estopped from maintaining this suit by reason of any act or declaration of its officers or agents. Since these Indians with the implied consent of the government had acquired such rights of occupancy as entitled them to retain possession as against the defendants, no officer or agent of the government had authority to deal with the land upon any other theory. The acceptance of leases for the land from the defendant company by agents of the government was, under the circumstances, unauthorized and could not bind the government; much less could it deprive the Indians of their rights. See and compare Lee v. Munroe and Thornton, 7 Cranch, 366, States, \n93 U.S. 247\n, 257; States, \n93 U.S. 247\n; Dubuque, etc., R. R. Co. v. Des Moines Valley R. R. Co., \n109 U.S. 329\n, 336. 3 Sup. Ct. 188; Pine River Logging Co. v. United States, \n186 \nU.S. 279, 291\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 920\n\n\n 6. We think, however, the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in holding that the right of the Indians extended to the entire area of each legal subdivision, irrespective of the inclosure, and we agree with the District Court in confining the right to the lands actually inclosed, including the whole of the northeast quarter of the southwest quarter of section 13, the small portion thereof which had not been enclosed having been impr ved. The Court of Appeals, in support of its conclusion, relied upon Quinby v. Conlan, \n104 U.S. 420\n. In that case Conlan had entered upon a quarter section of land, occupied a portion thereof, and declared his purpose to acquire a pre-emption right to the whole, and soon thereafter had filed his declaratory \n\n[261 U.S. 219, 235]\n\u00a0\n statement in legal form, claiming the whole as a pre-emptor. This court sustained Conlan's claim as against Quinby, a subsequent settler. Here the claim for the Indians is based on occupancy alone, and the extent of it is clearly fixed by the inclosure, cultivation and improvements. The evidence does not disclose any act of dominion on their part over, or any claim or assertion of right to, any lands beyond the limits of their actual possessions as thus defined. Under the circumstances, their rights are confined to the limits of actual occupancy and cannot be extended constructively to other lands never possessed or claimed, simply because they form part of the same legal subdivisions. See Garrison v. Sampson, 15 Cal. 93, 95, where the Supreme Court of California said:\n'A fatal objection to the judgment consists in the finding of the judge in favor of the plaintiff for the whole tract of land sued for. The plaintiff claims by force of prior possession and a contract or consent on the part of the defendant, whom he mediately or immediately let into possession, to hold the premises for him or subject to his order. The land is public land. It was not taken up by the plaintiff under the Possessory Act of this state, nor was it inclosed. There was a house and corral on the land. Of these he may be said to have been in the actual occupancy. But we cannot see from the proofs any right of possession to the whole of the quarter section, or even any claim to it. We do not understand that the mere fact that a man enters upon a portion of the public land, and builds or occupies a house or corral on a small part of it, gives him any claim to the whole subdivision, even as against one entering upon it without title. The case would be different if he claimed under the Possessory Act, and pursued the necessary steps prescribed by it, or if he had made his entry under the pre-emption laws of the United States. But merely going on waste and uninclosed land, and building a house and corral, and even subse quently \n\n[261 U.S. 219, 236]\n\u00a0\n cutting hay on a part, did not extend his possession to the whole of the 160 acres.'\n\n This is in accordance with the general rule that possession alone, without title or color of title, confers no right beyond the limits of actual possession. See Green v. Liter, 8 Cranch, 229, 250; Watkins v. Holman et al., 16 Pet. 25, 55; Marine Ry. Co. v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 47, 65\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 32; Humphries v. Huffman, 33 Ohio St. 395, 401; Langdon v. Templeton, 66 Vt. 173, 179, 28 Atl. 866; Ryan v. Kilpatrick, 66 Ala. 332, 337.\n Certain other contentions of defendants we deem it unnecessary to review, although they have been carefully considered. Aside from that stated in the last paragraph we find no error, but for the reasons there given, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court, with instructions to amend its decree, so as to cancel the patent in respect of the lands possessed by the Indians, and, as so amended, that decree is affirmed.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 2. ...

NYE TOOL & MACHINE WORKS(1923)\nNo. 240\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1923\n\n\n\n This was a bill in equity filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by the Nye Tool & Machine Works, a corporation of Illinois, having its place of business in Chicago, against the Crown Die \n\n[261 U.S. 24, 25]\n\u00a0\n & Tool Company, a corporation of the same state and doing business in the same city. The plaintiff sought to enjoin the infringement of a patent for a machine for forming screw-thread cutting devices, and for an accounting of profits and for damages. The inventors were Wright & Hubbard, and the patent issued to their assignee, the Reed Manufacturing Company of Pennsylvania.\n The plaintiff based its right to sue on the following instrument which it terms as assignment:\n Exhibit A.\n Whereas, Reed Manufacturing Company, a corporation of Pennsylvania, is the owner of letters patent of the United States, No. 1,033,142, for a machine for forming screw-thread cutting devices, granted July 23, 1912, on an application of Wright & Hubbard; and\n Whereas, under said patent said Reed Manufacturing Company has the right to exclude others from manufacturing, using and selling the devices of said patent; and\n Whereas, it is believed by the parties that Crown Die & Tool Company, a corporation of Illinois, has been manufacturing and using devices in infringement of said patent; and\n Whereas, Nye Tool & Machine Works is engaged in the manufacture of dies with which the dies made by said Crown Die & Tool Company, by the use of said infringing machine, are in competition; and\n Whereas, Nye Tool & Machine Works is desirous of acquiring from Reed Manufacturing Company all of its rights of exclusion under said patent, so far as the same may be exercised against the Crown Die & Tool Company, together with all rights of the Reed Manufacturing Company against the Crown Die & Tool Company arising out of the infringement aforesaid: \n\n[261 U.S. 24, 26]\n\u00a0\n Now, therefore, in consideration of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), and other good and valuable considerations, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Reed Manufacturing Company hereby assigns and sets over to the Nye Tool & Machine Works all claims recoverable in law or in equity, whether for damages, profits, savings, or any other kind or description which the Reed Manufacturing Company has against the Crown Die & Tool Company arising out of the infringement by the Crown Die & Tool Company of the Wright & Hubbard patent, No. 1,033,142, and for the same consideration assigns and sets over all the rights which it now has arising from said patent of excluding the Crown Die & Tool Company from the practice of the invention of said patent, the intention being that, in so far as concerns the exclusion of the Crown Die & Tool Company under said patent, the Nye Tool & Machine Works shall be vested with as full rights in the premises as the Reed Manufacturing Company would have had had this assignment not been made, and that the Nye Tool & Machine Works shall have the full right to bring suit on said patent, either at law or in equity against said Crown Die & Tool ompany, and for its own benefit, to exclude the Crown Die & Tool Company from practicing the invention of said patent, and for its own use and benefit to collect damages which may arise by reason of the future infringement of said patent by the Crown Die & Tool Company, but nothing herein contained shall in any way affect or alter the rights of the Reed Manufacturing Company against other than the Crown Die & Tool Company, and for the same consideration all rights as are herein given against the Crown Die & Tool Company are given as asainst any successor or assignee of the business thereof.\n Reed Manufacturing Company,\n By P. D. Wright, Its President. \n\n[261 U.S. 24, 27]\n\u00a0\n The defendant moved to dismiss the bill as follows:\n Now comes the defendant, Crown Die & Tool Company, by its solicitor, and moves the court to dismiss the bill of complaint instituted in the above-entitled cause upon grounds and reasons therefor as follows:\n\n 1. \nThat the bill of complaint states an alleged cause of action arising out of the assumed infringement of a patent in which plaintiff has no title, and prays an injunction, and accounting and damages.\n\n 2. \nThat the owner of the entire or any part of the legal title to the patent sued on is not made a party to the suit.\n\n 3. \nThat the legal effect of the alleged assignment set up as the basis of this cause of action and forming part of the bill of complaint herein is contrary to the statutes covering suits for infringement of patents, and shows on its face that the plaintiff has no interest in the patent sued on.\n\n 4. \nThat the bill of complaint herein, including the alleged assignment, evidences a conspiracy against this defendant by the parties to the document identified as 'Exhibit A,' in which the plaintiff and the Reed Manufacturing Company assumed the function of the court in having already decreed that this defendant infringes patent No. 1,033,142, and now seeks to utilize this court to annoy and harass the Crown Die & Tool Company by instituting legal proceedings when no right of action exists.\n\n 5. \nThat 'Exhibit A' attached to the bill of complaint in this case purports only to convey to plaintiff all claims recoverable in law or in equity which the Reed Manufacturing Company may have against the Crown Die & Tool Company, over which subject-matter this court has no jurisdiction.\n\n 6. \nPrior suit pending, between the same parties in this court, decision of which will determine any questions involved in this case. \n\n[261 U.S. 24, 28]\n\u00a0\n Therefore this defendant respectfully moves the court to dismiss said bill of complaint with its reasonable costs and charges in its behalf most wrongfully sustained.\n Crown Die & Tool Co.,\n By Florence King, Solicitor for Defendant.\n The District Judge in the interest of expedition granted the motion to dismiss, in order that the main question, i. e., the plaintiff's right to sue might be determined by the Circuit Court of Appeals before the expense of an accounting should be incurred, although he thought the plaintiff had acquired the right under the instrument 270 Fed. 587. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree of dismissal, holding the instrument to be a valid assignment of an interest in the patent conferring the right to sue and remanded the cause to the District Court for an accounting and further proceedings. 276 Fed. 376.\n Although the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is not final the importance of the question involved and the possible saving of useless litigation led this court to grant the writ of certiorari before further proceedings in the District Court.\n Miss Florence King, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Russell Wiles, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n\n[261 U.S. 24, 33]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner raises a question of jurisdiction. It says that the suit does not arise under the patent laws of the United States, but is merely a suit on a contract like one for royalties under a license of which the Di trict Court could not have jurisdiction because the parties are both citizens of the same state. To sustain this argument are cited Albright v. Teas, \n106 U.S. 613\n, 1 Sup. Ct. 550; Pratt v. Paris Gaslight Co., \n168 U.S. 255\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 62; and Excelsior Wooden Pipe Co. v. Pacific Bridge Co., \n185 U.S. 282\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 681. The cases have no application and the point is without merit. The bill in this case is based on an assignment of a patent claimed to be valid under the statutes of the United States, and asking the protection of the patent right thus assigned by injunction and an accounting. It therefore involves the validity of the assignment of a patent, which is a question arising under the patent laws because it depends upon their construction, and if the assignment is valid, the suit is just an ordinary suit for injunction and profits dependent on the validity of the patent and its infringement under those same laws. There is no question of royalties by contract in the case.\n The main question is an interesting one. The argument of counsel for the respondent and the one upon which the Circuit Court of Appeals proceeded to its conclusion \n\n[261 U.S. 24, 34]\n\u00a0\n is that the right which the patentee derives from the government by its grant is not the right to make, use and vend; that such a right is a so- called natural right, not dependent on statute, but arises under the common law, and has no peculiar federal source or protection other than any other right of liberty or property. All that the government grants and protects is the power to exclude others from making, using, or vending during the grant of 17 years. Under the patent law, section 4898, R. S. ( Comp. St.  9444), a patentee may assign by an instrument in writing his patent or any interest therein. It is argued that, as the patent is only the power to exclude all from making, using and vending, the power to exclude some particular person from doing so is a part of that power of exactly the same nature, and therefore is a definite interest in the patent that can be assigned.\n The analysis of the rights which a patentee acquires under the grant is sustained by a line of authorities. Bloomer v. McQuewan, 14 How. 539, 548; Patterson v. Kentucky, \n97 U.S. 501\n; United States v. Bell Telephone Co., \n167 \nU.S. 224, 249\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 809; Bement v. National Harrow Co., \n186 \nU.S. 70, 90\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 747; Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co., \n210 U.S. 405\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 748; Heaton Peninsular Co. v. Eureka Specialty Co., 77 Fed. 288, 294, 25 C. C. A. 267, 35 L. R. A. 728; Fuller v. Berger, 120 Fed. 274, 56 C. C. A. 588, 65 L. R. A. 381. The fullest and most satisfactory discussion of the subject is found in the Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co., supra. In that case it was sought to defeat a suit by a patent owner for infringement of a patent on the ground that he was not entitled to ask a court of equity to aid him in protecting the grant of the patent to him by the government because he had failed and neglected ever to use the patent himself or to allow anybody else to do so, and therefore had not rendered to the public the benefit and consideration for which the patent was granted. This court held that the benefit which the government intended to secure was not the \n\n[261 U.S. 24, 35]\n\u00a0\n making or use of the patent for the benefit of the public during the 17 years of the grant. except as the patentee might voluntarily confer it from motives of gain, but only the benefit of its public use after the grant expired. The court held that the government did not confer on the patentee the right himself to make, use or vend his own invention, that such right was a right under the common law, not arising under the federal patent laws, and not within the grant of power to Congress to enact such laws, and that, in the absence of the express statutory imposition upon the patentee of the obligation to ake, use or vend his patented invention as a condition of receiving his patent, it would not be implied. The court further held that in its essence all that the government conferred by the patent was the right to exclude others from making, using or vending his invention.\n We do not think, however, that these clearly established principles sustain the next step in the reasoning of the counsel for the respondent and the Circuit Court of Appeals which is that they make the mere right to exclude persons from the making, using and vending of an invention such an interest in a patent that it can be assigned. It ignores the indispensable condition of the granting and establishment of a patent right and patent property that the patentee shall have himself the common-law right of making, using and vending the invention. The sole reason and purpose of the constitutional grant to Congress to enact patent laws is to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to inventors the exclusive right to their respective discoveries. Article 1,  8, cl. 8. In pursuance thereof, section 4886, R. S., as amended, 29 Stat. 692 (Comp. St.  9430), provides that any person who has invented or discovered any new and useful art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new or useful improvements thereof, upon certain conditions not important here, may obtain a patent \n\n[261 U.S. 24, 36]\n\u00a0\n therefor. Section 4884, R. S. (Comp. St.  9428), directs that the grant of a patent shall be to the patentee, his heirs or assigns, for the term of 17 years of the exclusive right to make, use and vend the invention or discovery throughout the United States. An inventor may in writing assign his invention and the right to a patent before the patent is granted, and under section 4895, R. S. (Comp. St.  9439), a patent will issue to the assignee. Can it be claimed that an assignment of the right to exclude all from making, using and vending and excepting therefrom the right to make, use and vend in the assignee, would be such an assignment as would justify the Patent Office in issuing the patent under the statute to the assignee? Yet if all that there is in a patent property is the bare right to exclude others from making, using or vending something, the patent should issue in such a case.\n The error in the position of the respondent and the court below is in a failure to distinguish between the property or title or interest in a patent capable of assignment and the chief incident of that property, title or interest, an incident which can only pass by assignment when attached to the right to make, use and vend. It is the fact that the patentee has invented or discovered something useful and thus has the common-law right to make, use and vend it himself which induces the government to clothe him with power to exclude every one else from making, using or vending it. In other words, the patent confers on such common-law right the incident of exclusive enjoyment and it is the common-law right with this incident which a patentee or an assignee must have. That is the implication of the descriptive words of the grant 'the exclusive right to make, use and vend the invention.' The government is not granting the common-law right to make, use and vend, but it is granting the incident of exclusive ownership of that common-law right, which can not be enjoyed save with the common-law right. \n\n[261 U.S. 24, 37]\n\u00a0\n A patent confers a monopoly. So this court has decided in the Paper Bag Case, supra, and in many other cases. The idea of monopoly held by one in making, using and vending connotes the right in him to do that thing from which he excludes others.\n Dealing with question of patent assignments under the laws of the United States, Mr. Justice Gray, in Waterman v. Mackenzie, \n138 \nU.S. 252, 255\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 334, 335 (34 L. Ed. 923), said:\n'The monopoly thus granted is one entire thing, and cannot be divided into parts, except as authorized by those laws. The patentee or his assigns may, by instrume t in writing, assign, grant, convey, either, first, the whole patent, comprising the exclusive right to make, use and vend the invention throughout the United States; or, second, an individual part or share of that exclusive right; or, third, the exclusive right under the patent within and throughout a specified part of the United States. Rev. Stat.  4898. A transfer of either of these three kinds of interests is an assignment, properly speaking, and vests in the assignee a title in so much of the patent itself, with a right to sue infringers; in the second case, jointly with the assignor; in the first and third cases, in the name of the assignee alone. Any assignment or transfer, short of one of these, is a mere license, giving the licensee no title in the patent, and no right to sue at law in his own name for an infringement. Rev. Stat.  4919; Gayler v. Wilder, 10 How. 477, 494, 495; Moore v. Marsh, 7 Wall. 515.'\n\n The learned Justice then proceeds (\n138 U.S. 256\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 334) to give examples of what would and would not constitute an assignment. A grant of an exclusive right to make, use, and vend two patented machines within a certain district, he points out, citing Wilson v. Rousseau, 4 How, 646, 686, is an assignment because the right, although limited to making, using and vending two machines excludes all other persons even the patentee from making, using or \n\n[261 U.S. 24, 38]\n\u00a0\n vending like machines within the district. 'On the other hand,' he says, 'the grant of an exclusive right under the patent within a certain district, which does not include the right to make, and the right to use, and the right to sell, is not a grant of a title in the whole patent right within the district, and is therefore only a license.'\n In Gayler v. Wilder, 10 How. 477, it was held that the grant of an exclusive right to make and vend an article within a certain territory upon paying to the assignor a cent per pound, reserving to the assignor the right to use and manufacture the article by paying the assignee a cent per pound, was only a license, and that a suit for the infringement of the patent right must be brought in the name of the assignor. The effect of the opinion in that case is that the monopoly granted the patentee is for one entire thing and in order to enable an assignee to sue he must have received the entire and unqualified monopoly in the territory specified. Chief Justice Taney's reason for this (10 How. 494) is useful in this case. 'For,' said he, 'it was obviously not the intention of the Legislature to permit several monopolies to be made out of one, and divided among different persons within the same limits. Such a division would inevitably lead to fraudulent impositions upon persons who desired to purchase the use of the improvement, and would subject a party who, under a mistake as to his rights, used the invention without authority, to be harassed by a multiplicity of suits instead of one, and to successive recoveries of damages by different persons holding different portions of the patent right in the same place.' See also Pope Manufacturing Co. v. Gormully Manufacturing Company, \n144 \nU.S. 238, 250\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 637.\n These cases do not present the same facts as the one before us; but they indicate clearly what view the courts deciding them would have taken of an effort like that in the case at bar to divide up the monopoly of patent property \n\n[261 U.S. 24, 39]\n\u00a0\n so that the patentee retains the right to make, use and vend, but gives to many different individuals the right to sue certain named infringers, respectively, and that with the sole motive of harassing them such as is avowed in the recitals of the instrument before us. If held legal, it would give the patentee an opportunity without expense to himself to stir up litigation by third persons that is certainly contrary to the purpose and spirit of the statutory provisions for the assigning of patents.\n Nor do we think that the principle of Patterson v. Kentucky, \n7 U.S. 501\n, or the instance of a patent for an improvement on a machine, patent for which is held by another, involves anything inconsistent with our conclusion that the right to exclude others conferred in a patent can only be conferred upon one who has the common- law right to use, make and vend. In Patterson v. Kentucky, the patentee had the common-law right to make, use and vend, but the state of Kentucky exercising her lawful police power restricted him in it. In the case of the patentee for improvement on a patented machine, the patentee has the right to make, use and vend the improvement, but he cannot make it profitable or useful unless he can secure the right to put it onto another machine.\n For the reasons given, we think the attempted assignment in this case carried no part of the title to the patent or interest in it and therefore conferred no right to sue for damages for infringement of the patent after the execution of the instrument.\n The remaining question is whether the instrument relied on by the plaintiff below gave it the right to sue in its own name in this case for damages for past infringements. We think not.\n The plaintiff below could not bring such a suit for past infringements without joining with it the owner of the \n\n[261 U.S. 24, 40]\n\u00a0\n patent when the infringements were committed. It is said that the claim of an owner of a patent for damages for infringement is only a chose in action which in modern days may be so assigned that the assignee acquires full title and the right to sue at law as well as in equity without joining his assignor. This view ignores the peculiar character of patent property and the recognized rules for the transfer of its ownership and its incidents. Patent property is the creature of statute law and its incidents are equally so and depend upon the construction to be given to the statutes creating it and them, in view of the policy of Congress in their enactment. This is shown by the opinion of this Court in Waterman v. MacKenzie, \n138 U.S. 252\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 334, already cited, and in the line of authorities followed therein. It is not safe, therefore, in dealing with a transfer of rights under the patent law to follow implicitly the rules governing a transfer of rights in a chose in action at common law.\n As Chief Justice Taney said in Gayler v. Wilder, 10 How. 477, 494 (13 L. Ed. 504):\n'The monopoly did not exist at common law, and the rights, therefore, which may be exercised under it cannot be regulated by the rules of the common law. It is created by the act of Congress; and no rights can be acquired in it unless authorized by statute, and in the manner the statute prescribes.'\n\n The law as to who should bring a suit at law for damages by infringement of a patent is clearly and correctly stated in Robinson on Patents, vol. 3,  937, as follows:\n'With a single exception the plaintiff in an action at law must be the person or persons in whom the legal title to the patent resided at the time of the infringement. An infringement is an invasion of the monopoly created by the patent, and the law which defines and authorizes this monopoly confers only upon its legal owners the right to institute proceedings for its violation. These owners are the patentee, his assignee, his grantee, or his \n\n[261 U.S. 24, 41]\n\u00a0\n personal representatives; and none but these are able to maintain an action for infringement in a court of law. Moreover, the injury inflicted by an act of infringement falls upon the individual who owns the monopoly at the date of the infringement. It does not affect former owners whose interest had terminated before the infringement was committed, nor does it so directly prejudice a future owner that the law can recognize his loss and give him a pecuniary redress. Hence the plaintiff must not only have a legal title to the patent, but must have also been its owner at the time of the infringement. The exception above referred to arises where an assignment of a patent is coupled with an assignme t of a right of action for past infringements. In this case the present owner of the monopoly may institute proceedings for its violation during the ownership of his assignor as well as for infringements committed since the transfer of the title to himself.'\n\n In Moore v. Marsh, 7 Wall. 515, the question was whether a sale and assignment by a patentee of his patent right was, under the fourteenth section of the Patent Act of 1836 (chapter 357, 5 Stat. 117, 123) now embodied in section 4919 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  9464), a bar to an action by him to recover damages for an infringement committed before such sale and transfer. The section provided:\n'And such damages may be recovered by action on the case, in any court of competent jurisdiction, to be brought in the name or names of the person or persons interested, whether as patentees, assignees, or as grantees of the exclusive right within and throughout a specified part of the United States.'\n\n The neat issue in that case was whether 'the name or names of the person or persons interested' meant the person interested when the infringement took place or when the suit was brought. The court held that it meant the person who was patentee, assignee, or grantee when \n\n[261 U.S. 24, 42]\n\u00a0\n the infringement occurred and the cause of action accrued. The court held, therefore, that the proper plaintiff in a suit for past infringements was not the present owner of the patent, and that he did not acquire the right to bring suits for prior infringements merely by the conveyance of the full title to the patent and its enjoyment. This case was followed by that of Gordon v. Anthony, on the circuit reported in 16 Blatchf. 234, 10 Fed. Cas. 773, No. 5605. The decision was by Blatchford, Circuit Judge of the Second Circuit, who had been District Judge, and who subsequently became a justice of this court and had great experience in the administration of the patent law.\n The question before him was whether the vendee and assignee of a receiver appointed by a state court of New York in proceedings supplementary to execution on a judgment against a debtor whose assets included a patent right, and who was directed by the court to convey the same to the receiver, but did not do so, could sue for damages, for infringement of the patent occurring before the receivership. After saying that under the law of 1836 and under the Revised Statutes in which the sections of that law were embodied, no one could bring a suit either at law or in equity for infringement of a patent in his own name alone unless he were patentee, assignee, or grantee, the judge continues:\n'A claim to recover profits or damages for past infringement cannot be severed from the title by assignment or grant, so as to give a right of action for such claim, in disregard of the statute. The profits or damages for infringement cannot be sued for except on the basis of title as patentee, or as such assignee or grantee, to the whole or a part of the patent, and not on the basis merely of the assignment of a right to a claim for profits and damages, severed from such title. Therefore, if, in the present case, no such assignment or grant has been made to the defendants \n\n[261 U.S. 24, 43]\n\u00a0\n as the statute contemplates, they could not bring suit, in their own names, under the assignment made to them, to recover any claims, profits or damages for infringement, which belonged to Gordon (i. e., the patentee), nor can they use the assignment as a defense against any such claims existing against themselves in favor of Gordon. In this case there has been no assignment executed by Gordon.'\n\n See, also, Ball v. Coker (C. C.) 168 Fed. 304, 307.\n Counsel for plaintiff cites Hayward v. Andrews (C. C.) 12 Fed. 786, to maintain the contrary and to sustain the right of the assignee of claims for past infringements to maintain suit. The case cited is not in point, the assignee in that case held the legal title to the patent.\n The sole exception to the rule that only he who is the owner of th patent at the time of the infringement can sue for damages to which Professor Robinson refers is when such owner assigns the patent and also the claim for past infringements to the same person. In such a case, as the title and ownership of the claims are united, it is held that the owner may sue. Dibble v. Augur, 7 Blatchf. 86, 7 Fed. Cas. 642, No. 3,879; Hamilton v. Rollins, 5 Dill. 495, 11 Fed. Cas. 364, No. 5,988; Henry v. Francestown Soapstone Stove Co., 2 Ban. & A. 221, 11 Fed. Cas. 1180, No. 6, 382; Consolidated Oil Well Packer Co. v. Eaton, Cole & Burnham Co. (C. C.) 12 Fed. 865, 870; Spring v. Domestic Sewing Machine Co. (C. C.) 13 Fed. 446, 449; Nellis v. Pennock Mfg. Co. (C. C.) 38 Fed. 379. Under this exception, therefore, if the instrument here relied on had been effective to make the plaintiff an assignee or grantee of the patent or 'of any interest therein' within the meaning of section 4898, R. S., as amended, then the plaintiff could have maintained this action for damages for infringements prior to the execution of the instrument; but, as we hold, the instrument did not have this effect.\n But it is urged that under equity rule 37 (33 Sup. Ct. xxviii) every action \n\n[261 U.S. 24, 44]\n\u00a0\n must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest, and therefore, as the plaintiff is the beneficial owner of the claims for past infringements, it should be permitted to sue in a court of equity. The equity rule was not intended to set aside a policy and rule having its source in the patent statutes and cannot affect this case. The rule laid down by Circuit Judge Blatchford in Gordon v. Anthony, supra, applied to both actions in equity and law, and grew out of the sections of statutes quoted by him and not since amended. Both at law and in equity, either the owner of the patent at the time of the past infringement, or the subsequent owner of the patent who is at the same time the assignee of the claims for past infringement, must be a party to a suit for damages for the past infringement. If the owner of the patent when the infringements took place has assigned his patent to one, and his claims for damages for infringement to another, then the latter cannot sue at law at all but must compel his assignor of the claims to sue for him. In equity both such assignor and the assignee who is the real party in interest must join as plaintiffs. Such assignor is a necessary party and a bill for accounting and damages is fatally defective otherwise. Robinson, vol. 3,  1099; Dibble v. Augur, 7 Blatchf. 86, 7 Fed. Cas. 642, No. 3,879; Gamewell Fire Alarm Telegraph Co. v. City of Brooklyn (C. C.) 14 Fed. 255; Ball v. Coker ( C. C.) 168 Fed. 304. As the owner of the patent is not a party to this bill, the result is that on no ground can the bill of the plaintiff be sustained and that the motion to dismiss should have been granted.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and that of the District Court is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","55":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCUDAHY PACKING CO. OF NEBRASKA v. PARRAMORE(1923)\nNo. 107\nArgued: November 14, 1923Decided: December 10, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. Geo. T. Buckingham, of Chicago, Ill., for plaintiff in error.[ Cudahy Packing Co. of Nebraska v. Parramore \n263 U.S. 418\n (1923) ]\n\n\n[263 U.S. 418, 420]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Robert Robinson and William A. Hilton, both of Salt Lake City, Utah, for defendants in error. \n\n[263 U.S. 418, 421]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case arises under the provisions of the Utah Workmen's Compensation Act, which provides for the payment of compensation for personal injury or death of an employee by accident 'arising out of, or in the course of his employment.' Compiled Laws Utah 1917,  3113, and amendment by Laws Utah 1919, c. 63.\n The Cudahy Packing Company, on August 9, 1921, and prior thereto, owned and operated a meat-packing plant at a point about six miles north of Salt Lake City. Its employees generally resided in that city and in villages located north and south of the plant, only a few living in the immediate vicinity thereof.\n In going to and form the plant the workmen proceeded along a main highway running north and south and passing the plant at a distance of about half a mile to the east. From this point a public road runs west to and beyond the plant, crossed, before reaching the plant, by three lines of railroad, one of which, the Rio Grande Western, lies immediately adjacent to, and from which switches lead directly into, the plant. The only practicable way of ingress and egress for employees was along this road and across these railroad tracks, and that was the way customarily used. Joseph Parramore was, and for a considerable time had been, employed at the plant at a weekly salary as a stationary engineer. He lived at Salt Lake City. On the morning of August 9, 1921, he rode to the plant in the automobile of another employee, for the purpose of going to work. The automobile crossed over two of the railroad tracks and when upon that of the Rio Grande was struck by an engine and Parramore was instantly killed. This happened about seven minutes before the time when his \n\n[263 U.S. 418, 422]\n\u00a0\n service as an engineer was to begin. Upon these facts the Utah Industrial Commission awarded compensation to Parramore's dependents. The Supreme Court of the state, upon a review, affirmed the award and held that the accident was one within the terms of the statute. 60 Utah, 161, 207 Pac. 148.\n By this construction and application of the statute we are bound and the case must be considered as though the statute had, in specific terms, provided for liability upon the precise facts hereinbefore recited. Ward v. Krinsky, \n259 \nU.S. 503, 510\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 529. The question saved in the state court and presented here is whether the statute, as thus construed and applied, is valid under the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Defendants in error have submitted a motion to dismiss the writ of error on the ground that no federal question in involved, but it is clearly without substance, and is overruled.\n That the statute is constitutional upon its face is established by previous decisions of this court (New York Central R. Co. v. White, \n243 U.S. 188\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; Hawkins v. Bleakly, \n243 U.S. 210\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 255, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 637; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 U.S. 219\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642; Arizona Copper Co. v. Hammer, \n250 U.S. 400\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 553, 6 A. L. R. 1537; Madera Co. v. Industrial Comm., \n262 U.S. 499\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 604), and the only inquiry we need make is whether it is constitutional as applied and enforced in respect of the facts of the instant case. See Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282, 288\n, 289 S., 42 Sup. Ct. 106. It is settled by the decisions of this court and by an overwhelming array of state decisions, that such statutes are not open to constitutional objection because they abrogate common-law defenses or impose liability without fault. But the contention here, shortly stated, is that the accident was one which occurred off the premises of the employer on a public road, outside the hours of employment and while the employee was not engaged in any business of the employer; \n\n[263 U.S. 418, 423]\n\u00a0\n that it was not the result of any industrial risk but arose from a common peril to which the public generally was exposed; and that consequently liability is imposed arbitrarily and capriciously. It may be assumed that where an accident is in no manner related to the employment, an attempt to make the employer liable would be so clearly unreasonable and arbitrary as to subject it to the ban of the Constitution; but where the accident has any such relation we should be cautious about declaring a state statute creating liability against the employer invalid upon that ground. The modern development and growth of industry, with the consequent changes in the relations of employer and employee, have been so profound in character and degree as to take away, in large measure, the applicability of the doctrines upon which rest the common-law liability of the master for personal injuries to a servant, leaving of necessity a field of debatable ground where a good deal must be conceded in favor of forms of legislation, calculated to establish new bases of liability more in harmony with these changed conditions. Workmen's Compensation legislation rests upon the idea of status, nor upon that of implied contract; that is, upon the conception that the injured workman is entitled to compensation for an injury sustained in the service of an industry to whose operations he contributes his work as the owner contributes his capital-the one for the sake of the wages and the other for the sake of the profits. The liability is based, not upon any act or omission of the employer, but upon the existence of the relationship which the employee bears to the employment because of and in the course of which he has been injured. And this is not to impose liability upon one person for an injury sustained by another with which the former has no connection; but it is to say that it is enough if there be a causal connection between the injury and the business in which he employes the latter-a connection substantially \n\n[263 U.S. 418, 424]\n\u00a0\n contributory though it need not be the sole or proximate cause. Legislation which imposes liability for an injury thus related to the employment, among other justifying circumstances, has a tendency to promote a more equitable distribution of the economic burdens in cases of personal injury or death resulting from accidents in the course of industrial employment, and is a matter of sufficient public concern ( Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, supra, \n243 U.S. 239\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642) to escape condemnation as arbitrary, capricious, or clearly unreasonable. Whether a given accident is so related or incident to the business must depend upon its own particular circumstances. No exact formula can be laid down which will automatically solve every case. The fact that the accident happens upon a public road or at a railroad crossing and that the danger is one to which the general public is likewise exposed is not conclusive against the existence of such causal relationship, if the danger be one to which the employee, by reason of and in connection with his employment, is subjected peculiarly or to an abnormal degree.\n Upon this question of causal relationship, the English decisions are instructive. In Pierce v. Provident Clothing and Supply Co., Limited, [ 1911] 1 K. B. 997, where a collector of the company, while riding a bicycle in the course of his employment, with the acquiescence of the company, was knocked down and killed by a tram car, the employer was held liable because, by reason of his duties, the employee was more exposed to the risks of the streets than ordinary members of the public. In the opinion by Buckley, L. J., it is said (page 1003):\n'An accident arises out of the employment where it results from a risk incidental to the employment, as distinguished from a risk common to all mankind, although the risk incidental to the employment may include a risk common to all mankind.'\n\n See, also, Martin v. J. Lovibond & Sons, Limited, \n\n[263 U.S. 418, 1914]\n\u00a0\n 2 K. B. 227.\n So where a wrokman was employed in a \n\n[263 U.S. 418, 425]\n\u00a0\n place and under circumstances exposing him to more than ordinary risk of injury by lightning, such an injury was held to be one arising out of the employment. Andrew v. Failsworth Industrial Society, Limited, \n\n[263 U.S. 418, 1904]\n\u00a0\n 2 K. B. 32.\n In Anderson & Co., Limited, v. Adamson, 50 Scottish Law Reporter, 855, where a workman engaged during a violent gale in erecting a structure was injured by a slate blown from the roof of an adjoining building, a risk that all persons were more or less exposed to, it was held that as the workman was obliged to work in a stooping position and therefore could not see the slate coming, he was exposed beyond the normal risk, and could recover. The court said:\n'If it is the normal risk merely which causes the accident, the answer must be that the accident did not arise out of the employment. But if the position which the workman must necessarily occupy in connection with his work results in excessive exposure to the common risk (cf. Ismay's Case, \n\n[263 U.S. 418, 1908]\n\u00a0\n A. C. 437; Rodger, \n\n[263 U.S. 418, 1912]\n\u00a0\n S. C. 584), or if the continuity or exceptional amount of exposure aggravates the common risk (cf. M. Neice, \n\n[263 U.S. 418, 1911]\n\u00a0\n S. C. 12; Warner, \n\n[263 U.S. 418, 1912]\n\u00a0\n A. C. 35), then it is open to conclude that the accident did not arise out of the common risk, but out of the employment.'\n\n The same doctrine has been declared, under the American statutes, by many of the states courts. See, for example, Procaccino v. E. Horton & Sons, 95 Conn. 408, 111 Atl. 594; Empire Health & Accident Ins. Co. v. Purcell (Ind. App.) 132 N. E. 664; Judson Manufacturing Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission, 181 Cal. 300, 184 Pac. 1; In re Bollman, 73 Ind. App. 46, 126 N. E. 639; Lumbermen's Reciprocal Ass'n v. Behnken, (Tex. Civ. App .) 226 S. W. 154; De Constantin v. Public Service Commission, 75 W. Va. 32, 83 S. E. 88, L. R. A. 1916A, 329. The basis of these decisions is that under the special facts of each case the employment itself involved peculiar and abnormal exposure to a common peril, which was annexed as a risk incident to the employment. \n\n[263 U.S. 418, 426]\n\u00a0\n Here the location of the plant was at a place so situated as to make the customary and only practicable way of immediate ingress and egress one of hazard. Parramore could not, at the point of the accident, select his way. He had no other choice than to go over the railway tracks in order to get to his work; and he was in effect invited by his employer to do so. And this he was obliged to do regularly and continuously as a necessary concomitant of his employment, resulting in a degree of exposure to the common risk beyond that to which the general public was subjected. The railroad over which the way extended was not only immediately adjacent to the plant, but, by means of swithches, was connected with it, and in principle it was as though upon the actual premises of the employer.\n We attach no importance to the fact that the accident happened a few minutes before the time Parramore was to begin work, and was therefore, to that extent, outside the specified hours of employment. The employment contemplated his entry upon and departure from the premises as much as it contemplated his working there, and must include a reasonable interval of time for that purpose. See Gane v. Norton Hill Colliery Co., \n\n[263 U.S. 418, 1909]\n\u00a0\n 2 K. B. 539, 544; De Constantin v. Public Service Commission, supra.\n In view of the facts and circumstances peculiar to this case it was fairly open to the state Supreme Court to conclude that the necessary causal relation between the employment and the accident sufficiently appeared to save it from the constitutional objection; and its judgment is accordingly\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, and Mr. Justice BUTLER dissent. \n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCULLINAN v. WALKER(1923)\nNo. 301\nArgued: March 9, 1923Decided: April 30, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. John Walsh, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error. \n\n[262 U.S. 134, 135]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A tax of $156,212.66 was laid upon Cullinan, under the Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463, tit. 1,  1 and 2, 39 Stat. 756, 757 (Comp. St .  6336a, 6336b), for additional gain or income of that year, assessed at $1,571,760. He paid the tax, under protest, and brought, in the federal court for Southern Texas, this action against the local collector of internal revenue to recover the amount. The question was whether certain securities received by Cullinan in that year should be deemed gain or income. The case was tried by the court without a jury, upon agreed facts, and judgment was entered for defendant. Cullinan contends that sec rities issued to him, which the collector treated as gain or income, were, in legal effect, like a stock dividend, and that, under Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 U.S. 189\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570, he was not taxable thereon. The government insists that the securities so distributed were gains or income within the rule laid down in United States v. Phellis, \n257 U.S. 156\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 63, and Rockefeller v. United States, \n257 U.S. 176\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 68. This issue, presented on the facts hereinafter stated, is the only matter for decision. The case is here on writ of error under section 238 of the Judicial Code, because of the constitutional question involved. Towne v. Eisner, \n245 U.S. 418\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 158, L. R. A. 1918D, 254.\n Farmers' Petroleum Company was, in 1915, a Texas corporation, with a capital stock of $100,000. Cullinan \n\n[262 U.S. 134, 136]\n\u00a0\n owned 26.64 per cent. of its stock, for which he had paid (in that and the preceding year) $26,640 in cash. Later in 1915, the company was dissolved under the Texas law, and Cullinan became one of the trustees in liquidation. In 1916 the trustees organized two Texas corporations, Republic Production Company, a producing concern, and American Petroleum Company, a pipe line concern. To these corporations the trustees transferred the assets held by them, one-half in value to each. From each they received $1,500,000 par value of its stock and $1,500,000 par value of its bonds, being the total issues. The trustees also organized under the laws of Delaware a third company, American Republics Corporation, a holding company. To this company the trustees transferred all the $1,500, 000 stock of each of the new Texas corporations; from it they received $3, 000,000 of its stock. They thus held in 1916 the $3,000,000 stock of the Delaware corporation and the $1,500,000 bonds of each of the new Texas corporations. All these securities the trustees then distributed pro rata among the persons who had been stockholders in Farmers' Petroleum Company.\n Farmers' Petroleum Company had been dissolved solely for the purpose of effecting a reorganization. The reorganization was undertaken, partly, in order to separate the pipe lines from the producing properties, which counsel advised was necessary, and, partly, in order to procure credit required for the developing business. The two new Texas corporations had, at the time of the distribution of the stock of the Delaware corporation, no assets other than those received from the trustees in liquidation. These assets were, at the time of distribution, of the same value as they were when held by the trustees in liquidation. Cullinan received 26.64 prr cent. of each class of security. The stock and bonds distributed were then all worth par. The aggregate value of the securities received by him was $ 1,598,400. The amount which he \n\n[262 U.S. 134, 137]\n\u00a0\n had invested in Farmers' Petroleum Company was $26,640. On the difference, $ 1,571,760, the internal revenue collector assessed the tax here in question.\n Cullinan insists that his gain so ascertained was merely an incident of a reorganization. This was equally true in the Phellis and the Rockefeller Cases. It is sought to differentiate those cases on the ground that there the distributed stock of the new corporation was technically a dividend paid out of surplus, and that here the segregation is not of that character. But the gain, which when segregated becomes legally income subject to the tax, may be segregated by a dividend in liquidation, as well as by the ordinary dividend. If the trustees in liquidation had sold all the assets for $6,000,000 in cash, and had distributed all of that, on one would question that the late stockholders of Farmers' Petroleum Company would, in the aggregate, have received a gain of $5,900,000, taxable as income. The result would obviously have been the same, if the trustees had taken in payment, and distributed, bonds of the value of $6, 000,000, in some new corporations. And the result must also be the same where that taken in payment is $3,000,000 of such bonds and $3,000,000 in stock of a third corporation. All the material elements which differentiate the Phellis and Rockefeller Cases from Eisner v. Macomber are present also here. The corporation, whose stock the trustees distributed, was a holding company. In this respect, it differed from Farmers' Petroleum Company, which was a producing and pipe line company. It differed from the latter, also, because it was organized under the laws of another state. It is true that, at the time this Delaware corporation's stock was distributed, it held the stock of the new oil-producing company and likewise the stock of the new pipe line company. But the Delaware corporation was a holding company. It was free, at any time, to sell the whole, or any \n\n[262 U.S. 134, 138]\n\u00a0\n part, of the stock in either of the new Texas companies and to invest the proceeds otherwise. By such a sale, and change of investments, all interest of the holding company in the original enterprise might be parted with, without in any way affecting the rights of its own stockholders. When the trustees in liquidation distributed the securities in the three new corporations, Cullinan, in a legal sense, realized his gain, and became taxable on it as income for the year 1916\n\n\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","57":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCUNARD S.

The defendants are officers of the United States charged with the act's enforcement. In the first ten cases the plaintiffs are foreign corporations and their ships are of foreign registry, while in the remaining two the plaintiff's are domestic corporations, and their ships are of United States registry. All the ships have long carried and now carry, as part of their sea stores, intoxicating liquors intended to be sold or dispensed to their passengers and crews at meals and otherwise for beverage purposes. Many of the passengers and crews are accustomed to using such beverages and insist that the ships carry and supply liquors for such purposes. By the laws of all the foreign ports at which the ships touch this is permitted and by the laws of some it is required. The liquors are purchased for the ships and taken on board in the foreign ports and are sold or dispensed in the course of all voyages, whether from or to those ports.\n The administrative inst uctions dealing with the subject have varied since the National Prohibition Act went into effect. December 11, 1919, the following instructions were issued (T. D. 38218):\n'All liquors which are prohibited importation, but which are properly listed as sea stores on vessels arriving in ports of the United States, should be placed under seal by the boarding officer and kept sealed during the entire time of the vessel's stay in port, no part thereof to be removed from under seal for use by the crew at meals or for any other purpose.\n\n'Excessive or surplus liquor stores are no longer dutiable, being prohibited importation, but are subject to seizure and forfeiture. \n\n[262 U.S. 100, 120]\n\u00a0\n\n\n'Liquors properly carried as sea stores may be returned to a foreign port on the vessel's changing from the foreign to the coasting trade, or may be transferred under supervision of the customs officers from a vessel in foreign trade, delayed in port for any cause, to another vessel belonging to the same line or owner.'\n\n January 27, 1920, the first paragraph of those instructions was changed (T. D. 38248) so as to read:\n'All liquors which are prohibited importation, but which are properly listed as sea stores on American vessels arriving in ports of the United States, should be placed under seal by the boarding officer and kept sealed during the entire time of the vessel's stay in port, no part thereof to be removed from under seal for use by the crew at meals or for any other purpose. All such liquors on foreign vessels should be sealed on arrival of the vessels in port, and such portions thereof released from seal as may be required from time to time for use by the officers and crew.'\n\n October 6, 1922, the Attorney General, in answer to an inquiry by the Secretary of the Treasury, gave an opinion to the effect that the National Prohibition Act, construed in connection with the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, makes it unlawful (a) for any ship, whether domestic or foreign, to bring into territorial waters of the United States, or to carry while within such waters, intoxicating liquors intended for beverage purposes, whether as sea stores or cargo, and (b) for any domestic ship even when without those waters to carry such liquors for such purposes either as cargo or sea stores. The President thereupon directed the preparation, promulgation and application of new instructions conforming to that construction of the act. Being advised of this and that under the new instructions the defendants would seize all liquors carried in contravention of the act as so construed and would proceed to subject \n\n[262 U.S. 100, 121]\n\u00a0\n the plaintiffs and their ships to penalties provided in the act, the plaintiffs brought these suits.\n The hearings in the District Court were on the bills or amended bills, motions to dismiss and answers, and there was a decree of dismissal on the merits in each suit. 284 Fed. 890; International Mercantile Marine v. Stuart, 285 Fed. 79. Direct appeals under Judicial Code,  238 (Comp. St.  1215), bring the cases here.\n While the construction and application of the National Prohibition Act is the ultimate matter in controversy, the act is so closely related to the Eighteenth Amendment, to enforce which it was enacted, that a right understanding of it involves an examination and interpretation of the amendment. The first section of the latter declares (40 Stat. 1050, 1941):\n'Section 1. After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.'\n\n These words, if taken in their ordinary sense, are very plain. The articles proscribed are intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes. The acts prohibited in respect of them are manufacture, sale and transportation within a designated field, importation into the same, and exportation therefrom; and the designated field is the United Stat  and all territory subject to its jurisdiction. There is no controversy here as to what constitutes intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes; but opposing contentions are made respecting what is comprehended in the terms 'transportation,' 'importation' and 'territory.'\n Some of the contentions ascribe a technical meaning to the words 'transportation' and 'importation.' We think they are to be taken in their ordinary sense, for it better comports with the object to be attained. In that- \n\n[262 U.S. 100, 122]\n\u00a0\n sense transportation comprehends any real carrying about or from one place to another. It is not essential that the carrying be for hire, or by one for another; nor that it be incidental to a transfer of the possession or title. If one carries in his own conveyance for his own purposes it is transportation no less than when a public arrier at the instance of a consignor carriers and delivers to a consignee for a stipulated charge. See United States v. Simpson, \n252 U.S. 465\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 364, 10 A. L. R. 510. Importation, in a like sense, consists in bringing an article into a country from the outside. If there be an actual bringing in it is importation regardless of the mode in which it is effected. Entry through a custom house is not of the essence of the act.\n Various meanings are sought to be attributed to the term 'territory' in the phrase 'the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof.' We are of opinion that it means the regional areas- of land and adjacent waters-over which the United States claims and exercises dominion and control as a sovereign power. The immediate context and the purport of the entire section show that the term is used in a physical and not a metaphorical sense-that it refers to areas or districts having fixity of location and recognized boundaries. See United States v. Bevans, 3 Wheat. 336, 390.\n It now is settled in the United States and recognized elsewhere that the territory subject to its jurisdiction includes the land areas under its dominion and control, the ports, harbors, bays and other enclosed arms of the sea along its coast and a marginal belt of the sea extending from the coast line outward a marine league, or three geographic miles. Church v. Hubbart, 2 Cranch, 187, 234; The Ann, 1 Fed. Cas. No. 397, p. 926; United States v. Smiley, 27 Fed. Cas. No. 16317, p. 1132; Manchester v. Massachusetts, \n139 \nU.S. 240, 257\n, 258 S., 11 Sup. Ct. 559; Louisiana v. Mississippi, \n202 \nU.S. 1, 52\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 408; 1 Kent's Com. (12th Ed.) *29; 1 Moore, \n\n[262 U.S. 100, 123]\n\u00a0\n International Law Digest,  145; 1 Hyde, International Law,  141, 142, 154; Wilson, International Law (8th Ed.)  54; Westlake, International Law ( 2d Ed.) p. 187, et seq; Wheaton, International Law (5th Eng. Ed. [ Phillipson]) p. 282; 1 Oppenheim International Law (3d Ed.)  185-189, 252. This, we hold, is the territory which the amendment designates as its field of operation; and the designation is not of a part of this territory but of 'all' of it.\n The defendants contend that the amendment also covers domestic merchant ships outside the waters of the United States, whether on the high seas or in foreign waters. But it does not say so, and what it does say shows, as we have indicated, that it is confined to the physical territory of the United States. In support of their contention the defendants refer to the statement sometimes made that a merchant ship is a part of the territory of the country whose flag she flies. But this, as has been aptly observed, is a figure of speech, a metaphor. Scharrenberg v. Dollar S. S. Co., \n245 \nU.S. 122, 127\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 28; In re Ross, \n140 \nU.S. 453, 464\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 897; 1 Moore International Law Digest,  174; Westlake, International Law (2d Ed.) p. 264; Hall, International Law (7th Ed. [Higgins])  76; Manning, Law of Nations (Amos), p. 276; Piggott Nationality, pt. II, p. 13. The jurisdiction which it is intended to describe arises out of the nationalit of the ship, as established by her domicile, registry and use of the flag, and partakes more of the characteristics of personal than of territorial sovereignty. See The Hamilton, \n207 \nU.S. 398, 403\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 133; American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., \n213 \nU.S. 347, 355\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 511, 16 Ann. Cas. 1047; 1 Oppenheim International Law (3d Ed.)  123-125, 128. It is chiefly applicable to ships on the high seas, where there is no territorial sovereign; and as respects ships in foreign territorial waters it has little application beyond what is affirmatively or tacitly permitted by the local sovereign. 2 Moore International \n\n[262 U.S. 100, 124]\n\u00a0\n Law Digest,  204, 205; Twiss, Law of Nations (2d Ed.)  166; Woolsey, International Law (6th Ed.)  58; 1 Oppenheim International Law (3d Ed.)  128, 146, 260.\n The defendants further contend that the amendment covers foreign merchant ships when within the territorial waters of the United States. Of course, if it were true that a ship is a part of the territory of the country whose flag she carries, the contention would fail. But, as that is a fiction, we think the contention is right.\n The merchant ship of one country voluntarily entering the territorial limits of another subjects herself to the jurisdiction of the latter. The jurisdiction attaches in virtue of her presence, just as with other objects within those limits. During her stay she is entitled to the protection of the laws of that place and correlatively is bound to yield obedience to them. Of course, the local sovereign may out of considerations of public policy choose to forego the exertion of its jurisdiction or to exert the same in only a limited way, but this is a matter resting solely in its discretion. The rule, now generally recognized, is nowhere better stated than in The Exchange, 7 Cranch, 116, 136, 144 (3 L. Ed. 287), where Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for this court, said:\n'The jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is necessarily exclusive and absolute. It is susceptible of no limitation not imposed by itself. Any restriction upon it, deriving validity from an external source, would imply a diminution of its sovereignty to the extent of the restriction, and an investment of that sovereignty to the same extent in that power which could impose such restriction.\n\n'All exceptions, therefore, to the full and complete power of a nation within its own territories, must be traced up to the consent of the nation itself. They can flow from no other legitimate source . ...- \n\n[262 U.S. 100, 125]\n\u00a0\n\n\n'When private individuals of one nation spread themselves through another as business or caprice may direct, mingling indiscriminately with the inhabitants of that other, or when merchant vessels enter for the purposes of trade, it would be obviously inconvenient and dangerous to society, and would subject the laws to continual infraction, and the government to degradation, if such individuals or merchants did not owe temporary and local allegiance, and were not amenable to the jurisdiction of the country. Nor can the foreign sovereign have any motive for wishing such exemption. His subjects thus passing into foreign countries, are not employed by him, nor are they engaged in national pursuits. Consequently there are powerful motives for not exempting persons of this description from the jurisdiction of the country in which they are found, and no one motive for requiring it. The implied license, therefore, under which they enter can never be construed to grant such exemption.'\n\n That view has been reaffirmed and applied by this court on several occasions. United States v. Diekelman, \n92 \nU.S. 520, 525\n, 526 S.; Wildenhus' Case, \n120 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 385; Nishimura Ekiu v. United States, \n142 \nU.S. 651, 659\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 336; Knott v. Botany Mills, \n179 \nU.S. 69, 74\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 30; Patterson v. Bark Eudora, \n190 \nU.S. 169, 176\n, 178 S., 23 Sup. Ct. 821; Strathearn S. S. Co. v. Dillon, \n252 \nU.S. 348, 355\n, 356 S., 40 Sup. Ct. 350. And see Buttfield v. Stranahan, \n192 \nU.S. 470, 492\n, 493 S., 24 Sup. Ct. 349; Oceanic Steam Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, \n214 \nU.S. 320, 324\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 671; Brolan v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 216, 218\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 285. In the Patterson Case the court added:\n'Indeed, the implied consent to permit them [foreign merchant ships] to enter our harbors may be withdrawn, and if this implied consent may be wholly withdrawn it may be extended upon such terms and conditions as the government sees fit to impose.'\n\n In principle, therefore, it is settled that the amendment could be made to cover both domestic and foreign \n\n[262 U.S. 100, 126]\n\u00a0\n merchant ships when within the territorial waters of the United States. And we think it has been made to cover both when within those limits. It contains no exception of ships of either class and the terms in which it is couched indicate that none is intended. Such an exception would tend to embarrass its enforcement and to defeat the attainment of its obvious purpose, and therefore cannot reasonably be regarded as implied.\n In itself the amendment does not prescribe any penalties, forfeitures, or mode of enforcement but by its second section1 leaves these to legislative action.\n With this understanding of the amendment, we turn to the National Prohibition Act, c. 85, 41 Stat. 305, which was enacted to enforce it. The act is a long one and most of its provisions have no real bearing here. Its scope and pervading purpose are fairly reflected by the following excerpts from title 2:\n'Sec. 3. No person2 shall on or after the date when the eighteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States goes into effect, manufacture, sell, barter, transport, import, export, deliver, furnish or possess any intoxicating liquor except as authorized in this act, and all the provisions of this act shall be liberally construed to the end that the use of intoxicating liquor as a beverage may be prevented. ...'\n\n'Sec. 21. Any room, house, building, boat, vehicle, structure, or place where intoxicating liquor is manufactured, sold, kept, or bartered in violation of this title, and all intoxicating liquor and property kept and used \n\n[262 U.S. 100, 127]\n\u00a0\n in maintaining the same, is hereby declared to be a common nuisance . ...'\n\n'Sec. 23. That any person who shall, with intent to effect a sale of liquor, by himself, his employee, servant, or agent, for himself or any person, company or corporation, keep or carry around on his person, or in a vehicle, or other conveyance whatever, ... any liquor ... in violation of this title is guilty of a nuisance. ...'\n\n'Sec. 26. When the commissioner, his assistants, inspectors, or any officer of the law shall discover any person in the act of transporting in violation of the law, intoxicating liquors in any wagon, buggy, automobile, water or air craft, or other vehicle, it shall be his duty to seize any and all intoxicating liquors found therein being transported contrary to law. ...'\n\n Other provisions show that various penalties and forfeitures are prescribed for violations of the act, and that the only instance in which the possession of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes is recognized as lawful is where the liquor was obtained before the act went into effect and is kept in the owner's dwelling for use therein by him, his family, and his bona fide guests.\n As originally enacted the act did not in terms define its territorial field, but a supplemental provision3 afterwards enacted declares that it 'shall apply not only to the United  ates but to all territory subject to its jurisdiction,' which means that its field coincides with that of the Eighteenth Amendment. There is in the act no provision making it applicable to domestic merchant ships when outside the waters of the United States, nor any provision making it inapplicable to merchant ships, either domestic or foreign, when within those waters, save in the Panama Canal. There is a special provision dealing \n\n[262 U.S. 100, 128]\n\u00a0\n with the Canal Zone4 which excepts 'liquor in transit through the Panama Canal or on the Panama Railroad.' The exception does not discriminate between domestic and foreign ships, but applies to all liquor in transit through the canal, whether on domestic or foreign ships. Apart from this exception, the provision relating to the Canal Zone is broad and drastic like the others.\n Much has been said at the bar and in the briefs about the Canal Zone exception, and various deductions are sought to be drawn from it respecting the applicability of the act elsewhere. Of course the exception shows that Congress, for reasons appealing to its judgment, has refrained from attaching any penalty or forfeiture to the transportation of liquor while 'in transit through the Panama Canal or on the Panama Railroad.' Beyond this it has no bearing here, save as it serves to show that where in other provisions no exception is made in respect of merchant ships, either domestic or foreign, within the waters of the United States, none is intended.\n Examining the act as a whole, we think it shows very plainly, first, that it is intended to be operative throughout the territorial limits of the United States, with the single exception stated in the Canal Zone provision; secondly, that it is not intended to apply to domestic vessels when outside the territorial waters of the United States; \n\n[262 U.S. 100, 129]\n\u00a0\n and, thirdly, that it is intended to apply to all merchant vessels, whether foreign or domestic, when within those waters, save as the Panama Canal Zone exception provides otherwise.\n In so saying we do not mean to imply that Congress is without power to regulate the conduct of domestic merchant ships when on the high seas, or to exert such control over them when in foreign waters as may be affirmatively or tacitly permitted by the territorial sovereign; for it long has been settled that Congress does have such power over them. Lord v. Steamship Co., \n102 U.S. 541\n; The Abby Dodge, \n223 \nU.S. 166, 176\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 310. But we do mean that the National Prohibition Act discloses that it is intended only to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment and limits its field of operation, like that of the amendment, to the territorial limits of the United States.\n The plaintiffs invite attention to data showing the antiquity of the practice of carrying intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes as part of a ship's sea stores, the wide extent of the practice and its recognition in a congressional enactment, and argue therefrom that neither the amendment nor the act can have been intended to disturb that practice. But in this they fail to recognize that the avowed and obvious purpose of both the amendment and the act was to put an end to prior practices respecting such liquors, even th ugh the practices had the sanction of antiquity, generality and statutory recognition. Like data could be produced and like arguments advanced by many whose business, recognized as lawful theretofore, was shut down or curtailed by the change in national policy. In principle the plaintiffs' situation is not different from that of the innkeeper whose accustomed privilege of selling liquor to his guests is taken away, or that of the dining-car proprietor who is prevented from serving liquor to those who use the cars which he operates to and fro across our northern and southern boundaries. \n\n[262 U.S. 100, 130]\n\u00a0\n It should be added that after the adoption of the amendment and the enactment of the National Prohibition Act Congress distinctly withdrew the prior statutory recognition of liquors as legitimate sea stores. The recognition was embodied in section 2775 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St .  5471) which was among the provisions dealing with customs administration, and when, by the Act of September 21, 1922, those provisions were revised, that section was expressly repealed along with other provisions recognizing liquors as legitimate cargo. Ch. 356, Title 4 and  642, 42 Stat. 858, 948, 989. Of course, as was observed by the District Court, the prior recognition, although representing the national policy at the time, was not in the nature of a promise for the future.\n It therefore is of no importance that the liquors in the plaintiffs' ships are carried only as sea stores. Being sea stores does not make them liquors any the less; nor does it change the incidents of their use as beverages. But it is of importance that they are carried through the territorial waters of the United States and brought into its ports and harbors. This is prohibited transportation and importation in the sense of the amendment and the act. The recent cases of Grogan v. Walker & Sons and Anchor Line v. Aldridge, \n259 U.S. 80\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 423, 22 A. L. R. 1116, are practically conclusive on the point. The question in one was whether carrying liquor intended as a beverage through the United States from Canada to Mexico was prohibited transportation under the amendment and the act, the liquor being carried in bond by rail, and that in the other was whether the transshipment of such liquor from one British ship to another in the harbor of New York was similarly prohibited, the liquor being in transit from Scotland to Bermuda. The cases were considered together and an affirmative answer was given in each, the court saying in the opinion, \n259 U.S. 89\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 424, 22 A. L. R. 1116.\n'The Eighteenth Amendment meant a great revolution in the policy of this country, and presumably and \n\n[262 U.S. 100, 131]\n\u00a0\n obviously meant to upset a good many things on as well as off the statute book. It did not confine itself in any meticulous way to the use of intoxicants in this country. It forbade export for beverage purposes elsewhere. True this discouraged production here, but that was forbidden already, and the provision applied to liquors already lawfully made. See Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., \n251 U.S. 146\n, 151, note 1. It is obvious that those whose wishes and opinions were embodied in the amendment meant to stop the whole business. They did not want intoxicating liquor in the United States and reasonably may have though that if they let it in some of it was likely to stay. When, therefore, the amendment forbids, not only importation into and exportation from the United States, but transportation within it, the natural meaning of the words expresses an altogether probable intent. The Prohibition Act only fortifies in this respect the interpretation of the amendment itself. The manufacture, possession, sale and transportation of spirits and wine for other than beverage purposes are provided for in the act, but there is no provision for transshipment or carriage across the country from without. When Congress was ready to permit such a transit for special reasons, in the Canal Zone, it permitted it in expr  words Title III,  20, 41 Stat. 322.'\n\n Our conclusion is that in the first ten cases, those involving foreign ships, the decrees of dismissal were right and should be affirmed, and in the remaining two, those involving domestic ships, the decrees of dismissal were erroneous, and should be reversed, with directions to enter decrees refusing any relief as respects the operations of the ships within the territorial waters of the United States and awarding the relief sought as respects operations outside those waters.\n Decrees in Nos. 659, 660, 661, 662, 666, 667, 668, 669, 670 and 678, affirmed.\n Decrees in Nos. 693 and 694, reversed. \n\n[262 U.S. 100, 132]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissents.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND dissenting.\n I agree with the judgment of the court in so far as it affects domestic ships, but I am unable to accept the view that the Eighteenth Amendment applies to foreign ships coming into our ports under the circumstances here disclosed.\n It would serve no useful purpose to give my reasons at any length for this conclusion. I therefore state them very generally and briefly.\n The general rule of international law is that a foreign ship is so far identified with the country to which it belongs that its internal affairs, whose effect is confined to the ship, ordinarily are not subjected to interference at the hands of another state in whose ports it is temporarily present, 2 Moore, Int. Law. Dig., p. 292; United States v. Rodgers, \n150 \nU.S. 249, 260\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 109; Wildenhus's Case, \n120 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 385; and, as said by Chief Justice Marshall, in Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 2 Cranch, 64, 118 (2 L. Ed. 208):\n'... An act of Congress ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations, if any other possible construction remains. ...'\n\n That the government has full power under the Volstead Act to prevent the landing or transshipment from foreign vessels of intoxicating liquors or their use in our ports is not doubted, and, therefore, it may provide for such assurances and safeguards as it may deem necessary to those ends. Nor do I doubt the power of Congress to do all that the court now holds has been done by that act, but such power exists not under the Eighteenth Amendment, to whose provisions the act is confined, but by virtue of other provisions of the Constitution, which Congress here has not attempted to exercise. With great deference to the contrary conclusion of the court, due regard for the principles of international comity, which exists between \n\n[262 U.S. 100, 133]\n\u00a0\n friendly nations, in my opinion, forbids the construction of the Eighteenth Amendment and of the act which the present decision advances. Moreover, the Eighteenth Amendment, it must not be forgotten, confers concurrent power of enforcement upon the several states, and it follows that if the general government possesses the power here claimed for it under that amendment, the several states within their respective boundaries, possess the same power. It does not seem possible to me that Congress, in submitting the amendment or the several states in adopting it, could have intended to vest in the various seaboard states a power so intimately connected with our foreign relations and whose exercise might result in international confusion and embarrassment.\n In adopting the Eighteenth Amendment and in enacting the Volstead Act the question of their application to foreign vessels in the circumstances now presented does not appear to have been in mind. If, upon consideration, Congress shall conclude that when such vessels, in good faith carrying liquor among their sea stores, come temporarily into our ports their officers should, ipso facto, become liable to drastic punishment and the ships themselves subject to forfeiture, it will be a simple matter for that body to say so in plain terms. But interference with the purely internal affairs of a foreign ship is of so delicate a nature, so full of possibilities of international misunderstandings and so likely to invite retali tion that an affirmative conclusion in respect thereof should rest upon nothing less than the clearly expressed intention of Congress to that effect, and this I am unable to find in the legislation here under review. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The second section says: 'The congress and the several states shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.'

U S(1923)\nNo. 341\nArgued: Decided: May 21, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 215, 216]\n\u00a0\n In November, 1912, the United States filed 79 bills in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of California, seeking to set aside patents for land in the Susanville la d district in California, issued by it under the Timber and Stone Act (Act Cong. June 3, 1878, 20 Stat. 89, as amended by Act Aug. 4, 1892, 27 Stat. 348, c. 375,  2 [Comp. St.  4671-4673]), to various patentees, and by them conveyed to one Gregory, and by him to the Curtis, Collins & Holbrook Company, a corporation of California, on the ground that the patents had been obtained by fraud. The entries were filed and the patents were issued in the last six months of the year 1902, and shortly thereafter. The cases were consolidated into groups, and were referred to a master, who reported at length, finding that, as to the 79 patents, only 24 had been obtained in fraud of the United \n\n[262 U.S. 215, 217]\n\u00a0\n States and in violation of the statute, but that, as to all of these, the Curtis, Collins & Holbrook Company was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the fraud. The District Court sustained the findings of the master and dismissed the bills. The United States then prosecuted appeals as to the 24 patents whose issue had been found by the master to have been obtained by fraud, to reverse the finding by the master and the District Court that the Curtis, Collins & Holbrook Company was a bona fide purchaser without notice of the fraud. The Circuit Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit, to which the appeals were taken, found with the government on this issue, reversed the decree of the District Court in the 24 cases, and remanded them, with direction to cancel the patents. The Curtis, Collins & Holbrook Company has now prosecuted appeals to this court in all these 24 cases, under section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1218). The parties, as the master did below, selected as a typical case of the 24 cases in which fraud was found, the patent issued to one Edward L. Cooksey. That has been argued in this court, with the understanding that the other 23 cases are to abide the decree in this, because the facts, so far as notice of the fraud is concerned, are substantially the same.\n In 1901 persons owning lands within the limits of the national forests could convey them to the United States and select in lieu thereof, and secure title by patent to, timber lands belonging to the United States outside of the forest reservations. One Tuman and C. H. Holbrook agreed to seek capitalists and induce them to purchase lands in forest reservations and exchange them for timber land outside. Tuman was a cruiser, who had prepared a list of desirable lieu lands which could be selected. In December, 1901, Holbook made a contract with Curtis and Collins by which he agreed to sell to them at $7.50 an acre 42,000 acres of timber land in Cali- \n\n[262 U.S. 215, 218]\n\u00a0\n fornia-described in a schedule-title to which Holbrook was to obtain by conveying to the United States lands of the same amount in national forest reservations. The forest reservation lands were to be conveyed to Thompson, trustee, by the owners, who were to be paid, upon request of Holbrook and on an attorney's certificate of title, not exceeding $5 an acre, to be paid by the Bank of California out of a fund of $200,000 deposited with it by Curtis and Collins. The trustee was then to make application for the lieu lands described in the list, and when he had acquired title he was, upon notice from Holbrook that he had been paid, to convey to Curtis and Collins or to anyone to whom they directed. After the title to the whole amount had been acquired Holbrook was to receive the balance of the price for the lands amounting to more than $115,000, partly in cash and promissory notes and in 789 shares of stock in a corporation of California to be formed with 5,000 shares, of $100 par value each, to which the lands were to be conveyed. Curtis and Collins were to receive 3,156 shares, 1, 844 shares remaining in the treasury, out of which Holbrook's shares were to be taken. Holbrook was to be a director and vice president and general manager. If Holbrook could not secure the whole of the 42,000 acres from the forest reserve rights, he was given the right to obtain it through any other legal means or source.\n Holbrook and his son, with Tuman's assistance, procured the whole 42, 000 acres in lieu of forest reservation lands. Holbrook reported to Curtis and Collins that forest reservation lands had become scarce and expensive, and suggested that there were valuable timber lands which could be secured under the Timber and Stone Act, ubisupra. Under this law, land belonging to the United States valued chiefly for timber or stone, and unfit for cultivation, in quantities not exceeding 160 acres, could be sold to a citizen of the United States at a minimum \n\n[262 U.S. 215, 219]\n\u00a0\n price of $2.50 an acre. But any person seeking such land was required to file with the register of the proper district a written statement, under oath, in duplicate, setting forth a number of necessary facts concerning the land and also--\n'that he has made no other application under this act; that he does not apply to purchase the same on speculation, but in good faith to appropriate it to his own exclusive use and benefit; and that he has not, directly or indirectly, made any agreement or contract, in any way or manner with any person or persons whatsoever, by which the title which he might acquire from the government of the United States should inure, in whole or in part, to the benefit of any person except himself.'\n\n Curtis and Collins accepted Holbrook's suggestion as to the Timber and Stone Act, and it was orally agreed that about 30,000 acres should be thus acquired and that Holbrook was to be paid $10.00 an acre. The entries in this and the other 23 cases were procured by agents of Tuman, who made entries under an agreement to convey the lands to any one he might direct, he paying all the expenses and $100 for each entry, and the entrymen making false oaths in violation of the statute. The land thus entered was conveyed by the entrymen to one Gregory whose name was used with his consent as trustee by Tuman and Holbrook. Gregory neither paid nor received any money, and merely acted as a conduit for the titles. All the stone and timber entries were filed in the last six months of 1902, and the deeds to Gregory were made soon after proof by the entrymen, but were not recorded until 1904. The Curtis, Collins & Holbrook Company was organized in accord with the terms of the original contract, August 14, 1902, the incorporators being J. G. Curtis and his son, D. G. Curtis, T. D. Collins and his son, E. S. Collins, Charles H. Holbrook and his son, Charles H. Holbrook, Jr., and Irving \n\n[262 U.S. 215, 220]\n\u00a0\n F. Moulton. Gregory conveyed to this corporation the interests conveyed to him by the entrymen at different times up to 1904, but none of the deeds to the corporation was recorded until October, 1909, and some were not recorded until 1910 and 1911\n\n\n Curtis and Collins lived in Pennsylvania, but they, together with Tuman and Holbrook, went out to look at the lands in 1902, after the contract was made. D. G. Curtis, Jr., who was treasurer of the company, also frequently went upon the lands. Young Curtis testified that he talked much with Holbrook, who managed the company and did everything in connection with the acquisition of these lands by it, and that they all had the utmost confidence in his getting them good titles.\n Tuman and Holbrook fell out as to the division of the profit between them. Collins, Sr., effected a compromise, whereby Tuman received 200 shares in the company and $10,000 cash, and after this litigation was begun Collins paid Tuman $750 a share for this stock, although it was twice what it was worth, as Collins admitted. Tuman was a witness, and testified that he told Holbrook what he had done in procuring the entries to be made and in paying expenses and the $100 apiece to the entrymen, and there was evidence strongly tending to show that the money used to pay these expenses came from an account in a San Francisco bank, opened by Holbrook in the name of Collins and Holbrook, upon which checks were drawn in favor of an account in Holbrook's name in a bank at Susanville upon which Tuman drew checks for this work. There was no evidence that C llins knew of the San Francisco account in the name of Collins and Holbrook. There was evidence that in 1904 and 1906 land office agents were investigating the validity of entries made as to other lands suspected of having been sold in advance to the Curtis, Collins & Holbrook Company, and that Tuman, Holbrook, and Collins talked over \n\n[262 U.S. 215, 221]\n\u00a0\n the matter, and that Collins agreed they were lost, and 'that was all there was to it.'\n Messrs. Charles A. Shurtleff and R. B. Gaylord, both of San Francisco, Cal., for appellant.\n Mr. S. W. Williams, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals attached importance to the conduct of Collins toward Tuman and the compromise made between him and Holbrook, to his willingness to abandon other titles secured by Holbrook when questioned, and to the long delay in recording the deeds to the company ( Linn & Lane timber Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 574, 576\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 440), as suspicious circumstances indicating a consciousness on the part of the capitalists in the company that the titles of the company to the lands here in question were vulnerable because of the practices of Holbrook and Tuman. Without minimizing the significance of these circumstances, we put our concurrence in the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals on the other ground stated by that court.\n While the contract of December, 1901, called it a sale of 42,000 acres of forest reservation lieu lands by Holbrook to Curtis and Collins, we think that, in the light of all the circumstances, it was rather a contract of agency and joint adventure, by which Holbrook was to procure the land for his principals at a stipulated profit for himself, they to furnish the money with which he could make the purchases for them. Even if the written contract \n\n[262 U.S. 215, 222]\n\u00a0\n would not bear this construction, the practical construction by the parties justifies it; and this is especially true of the subsequent oral contract under which the additional 30,000 acres of stone and timber land was to be purchased. The title to the land was never put in Holbrook, or in Curtis and Collins. Through a naked trustee, it was conveyed directly from the entrymen to the company. The whole procedure under the Timber and Stone Act was intrusted by Curtis and Collins to the initiation and execution of Holbrook as the manager and vice president of the company, in which Curtis and Collins had three-fifths interest, and Holbrook had one- sixth. The only safeguard imposed was that a reputable attorney was to pass on the paper title. The company was in being and under the active management of Holbrook when these entries were being made and final proof submitted. Holbrook knew of the fraud practiced on the government in making the entries, because Tuman says that he told him, and the circumstances as to the payment of money for expenses and bonuses out of moneys furnished by Holbrook confirms his complicity in it.\n Under these circumstances, we do not think the company can be treated as a bona fide purchaser. It is charged with Holbrook's knowledge, because he was the sole actor for the company in procuring the fraudulent patents. It sufficiently appears that young Curtis, the treasurer of the company, and Curtis and Collins, the capitalists, understood the difference there was between the procedure and limitations attending the acquisition of title to lands under the Forest Reservation Act and under the Timber and Stone Act and that they depended wholly on Holbrook to secure a good title under the latter act.\n The general rule is that a principal is charged with the knowledge of the agent acquired by the agent in the course of the principal's business. Here the business was \n\n[262 U.S. 215, 223]\n\u00a0\n the acquisition of land patented by the government under the Timber and Stone Act. The company and all its stockholders were charged with notice of any facts impairing the titles, of which, in securing them, H lbrook was advised. In other words, the company, in taking over the titles, took them cum onere. Hovey v. Blanchard, 13 N. H. 145; Warren v. Dixon, 74 N. H. 355, 68 Atl. 193; Atlantic Cotton Mills v. Indian Orchard Mills, 147 Mass. 268, 273, 17 N. E. 496, 9 Am. St. Rep. 698; Bank of New Milford v. Town of Milford, 36 Conn. 93, 101; Holden v. New York & Erie Bank, 72 N. Y. 286, 294; Bank v.

A. 475; Mechem on Agency (2d Ed.) vol. 2,  1818.\n Appellants seek to avoid the application of this principle by asserting an exception to it when the agent's attitude is one adverse in interest to that of the principal, because of which it cannot be inferred that the agent would communicate the facts against his own interest to his principal. The case relied on to establish this exception is that of American National Bank v. Miller, \n229 U.S. 517\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 883. In that case one who was president of a bank at Macon, Ga., owed his own bank $3,000, and paid it by a check on a Nashville bank, in which he was a depositor, but which he owed $50,000. The Nashville bank received the check from the Macon bank for collection, and then credited the Macon bank with the amount and send a letter advising the Macon bank. The president of the Macon bank was insolvent, and a petition of involuntary bankruptcy was filed against him the day his check was credited by the Nashville bank. The Nashville bank sought to charge off the credit to the Macon bank on the ground that that bank was chargeable with notice of its president's insolvency. We held that such knowledge could not be imputed to the Macon bank merely because the president knew it, for the reason that it was not to be \n\n[262 U.S. 215, 224]\n\u00a0\n inferred that he would communicate such knowledge to his own bank.\n We do not think the case applicable here. The president of the Macon bank was engaged in something in which his interest was plainly independent of any agency of his on behalf of his bank. His payment of his note was his own business, and not the bank's as his princiapl. In the case at bar, Holbrook was the sole agent acting for the company in securing titles to land for it. It is true that, the more titles he got, the more profit he would make out of the agency, and we may assume that, as between him and the company, in securing fraudulent titles for the company, he was violating his instruction; but he and the company were in a common adventure, and, if the company insists on retaining the fruits of that adventure, it must be charged with the knowledge of the agent through whom the fruits came. The interest of Collins, Curtis and Holbrook in the acquisition of the titles was common. Curtis and Collins knew exactly how far Holbrook's interest was adverse to theirs, but trusted him in the joint enterprise notwithstanding. The adverse interests as between them in sharing the fruits of the common business cannot enable the company to retain its share and repudiate the agent with all he knew. This view is sustained by the authorities above cited, it was taken by the Circuit Court of Appeals, and we concur in it.\n Appellant relies on the cases of the United States v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., \n200 U.S. 322\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 282, and United States v. Clark, \n200 U.S. 601\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 340, to justify the plea of bona fide purchase in this case. The facts in those cases were different from the facts in the case before us. In the Detroit Company Case, there was no question of agency at all. It was the purchase by one company from another and it was sought to charge the purchasing company with knowledge of the vendor's violations of the statute by \n\n[262 U.S. 215, 225]\n\u00a0\n assuming that if the purchaser had looked into its books it might have inferred something irregular. The court held that there was nothing to put the purchaser on such an inquiry. In the Clark Case, Clark bought outright from Cobban by direct warranty deeds lands patented under the Timber and Stone Act. It did appear that Cobban had negotiations with Clark before Cobban acquired title to some of the land, and it further appeared that Clark lent money to Cobban, secured by mortgage on land and timber owned by Cobban, to enable him to buy additional land. But this court and the two lower courts held that Clark and Cobban dealt at arm's length. We found expressly that the claim that Cobban was Clark's agent broke down.\n These two cases were seemingly relied upon by the master and the District Court to show that the defense of bona fide purchaser is not an affirmative defense, the burden of sustaining which is on the defendant; but such a construction of those cases is refuted by the express ruling of this court in Wright-Blodgett Co. v. United States, \n236 U.S. 397\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 339.\n We think the case before us comes within the class of cases of which McCaskill Co. v. United States, \n216 U.S. 504\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 386; and United States v. Kettenbach, 208 Fed. 209, 219, 125 C. C. A. 409, are instances.\n Decree affirmed in this and the other 23 cases. \n\n\n\n","59":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAVIS v. FARMERS' CO-OP. EQUITY CO.(1923)\nNo. 270\nArgued: Decided: May 21, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 312, 313]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Gardiner Lathrop and Homer W. Davis, both of Chicago, Ill., and William T. Faricy and Thomas F. Quinn, both of St. Paul, Minn., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Morton Barrows, of St. Paul, Minn., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A statute of Minnesota (Laws 1913, c. 218, p. 274; General Statutes 1913,  7735) provides that:\n'Any foreign corporation having an agent in this state for the solicitation of freight and passenger traffic or either thereof over its lines outside of this state, may be served \n\n[262 U.S. 312, 314]\n\u00a0\n with summons by delivering a copy thereof to such agent.'\n\n Whether this statute, as construed and applied, violates the federal Constitution, is the only question for decision.\n The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company is a Kansas corporation engaged in interstate transportation. It does not own or operate any railroad in Minnesota; but it maintains there an agent for solicitation of traffic. In April, 1920, suit was brought by another Kansas corporation in a court of Minnesota against the Director General of Railroads, as agent, on a cause of action arising under federal control. Service was made pursuant to the Minnesota statute. \n1\n The recovery sought was for loss of grain shipped under a bill of lading issued by the carrier in Kansas for transportation over its line from one point in that state to another. So far as appears the transaction was in no way connected with Minnesota or with the soliciting agency located there. Defendant appeared specially, claimed that, as to it, the statute authorizing service violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the commerce clause, and moved to dismiss the suit for want of jurisdiction. The motion was denied. After appropriate proceeding, the trial court entered final judgment for plaintiff, its judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Minnesota (150 Minn. 534, 186 N. W. 130), and the case is here on writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214). \n\n[262 U.S. 312, 315]\n\u00a0\n Solicitation of traffic by railroads, in states remote from their lines, is a recognized part of the business of interstate transportation. McCall v. California, \n136 U.S. 104\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 881. As construed by the highest court of Minnesota, this statute compels every foreign interstate carrier to submit to suit there as a condition of maintaining a soliciting agent within the state. Jurisdiction is not limited to suits arising out of business transacted within Minnesota. Compare Mitchell Furniture Co. v. Selden Breck Co., \n257 U.S. 213\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 84; Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Clarendon Boat Oar Co ., Inc., 257 U. S., 533, 42 Sup. Ct. 210; Chipman, Limited, v. Thomas B. Jeffery Co., \n251 U.S. 373\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 172. It is asserted, whatever the nature of the cause of action, wherever it may have arisen, and although the plaintiff is not, and never has been, a resident of the state. Armstrong Co. v. New York Central R. R. Co., 129 Minn. 104, 151 N. W. 917, L. R. A. 1916E, 232, Ann. Cas. 1916E, 335; Langergren v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 130 Minn. 35, 152 N. W. 1102; Rishmiller v. Denver & Rio Grande R. R. Co., 134 Minn. 261, 159 N. W. 272; Merchants' Elevator Co. v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., 147 Minn. 188, 179 N. W. 734; Callaghan v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., 148 Minn. 482, 182 N. W. 1004. This condition imposes upon interstate commerce a serious and unreasonable burden, which renders the statute obnoxious to the commerce clause. Compare Sioux Remedy Co. v. Cope, \n235 \nU.S. 197, 203\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 57.\n That the claims against interstate carriers for personal injuries and for loss and damage of freight are numerous; that the amounts demanded are large; that in many cases carriers deem it imperative, or advisable, to leave the determination of their liability to the courts; that litigation in states and jurisdictions remote from that in which the cause of action arose entails absence of employees from their customary occupations; and that this impairs efficiency in operation, and causes, directly and indirectly, heavy expense to the carriers-these are matters of common knowledge. Facts, of which we, also, take judicial notice, indicate that the burden upon interstate \n\n[262 U.S. 312, 316]\n\u00a0\n carriers imposed specifically by the statute here assailed is a heavy one; and that the resulting obstruction to commerce must be serious. \n2\n During federal control absences of e ployees incident to such litigation were found, by the Director General, to interfere so much with the physical operation of the railroads, that he issued General Order No. 18 (and 18A) which required suit to be brought in the county or district where the cause of action arose or where the plaintiff resided at the time it accrued. That order was held reasonable and valid in Alabama & Vicksburg Railway Co. v. Journey, \n257 U.S. 111\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 6. The facts recited in the order, to justify its issue, are of general application, in time of peace as well as of war.\n The fact that the business carried on by a corporation is entirely interstate in character does not render the corporation immune from the ordinary process of the courts of a state. International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 U.S. 579\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 944. The requirements of orderly, effective administration of justice are paramount. In Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160, 167\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 30, a statute was sustained which required nonresident owners of motor vehicles to appoint a state official as agent upon whom process might be served in suits arising from their use within the state, because the burden thereby imposed upon interstate commerce was held to be a reasonable requirement for the protection of the public. It may be that a statute like that here assailed would be valid, although applied to suits in which the cause of action arose elsewhere, if the transaction out of which it arose had been entered \n\n[262 U.S. 312, 317]\n\u00a0\n upon within the state,3 or if the plaintiff was, when it arose, a resident of the state. \n4\n These questions are not before us, and we express no opinion upon them. But orderly effective administration of justice clearly does not require that a foreign carrier shall submit to a suit in a state in which the cause of action did not arise, in which the transaction giving rise to it was not entered upon, in which the carrier neither owns nor operates a railroad, and in which the plaintiff does not reside. The public and the carriers are alike interested in maintaining adequate, uninterrupted transportation service at reasonable cost. This common interest is emphasized by Transportation Act 1920, which authorizes rate increases necessary to ensure to carriers efficiently operated a fair return on property devoted to the public use. See Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., \n257 U.S. 563\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 232, 22 A. L. R. 1086; The New England Divisions Case, \n261 U.S. 184\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 270, 67 L. Ed. --. Avoidance of waste, in interstate transportation, as well as maintenance of service, have become a direct concern of the public. With these ends the Minnesota statute, as here applied, unduly interferes. By requiring from interstate carriers general submission to suit, it unreasonably obstructs, and unduly burdens, interstate commerce.\n The case at bar resembles, in its facts, but is not identical with, Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Reynolds, \n255 U.S. 565\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 446, and St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Alexander, \n227 U.S. 218\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 245, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 77. In the former, the validity of a similar Massachusetts statute was sustained in a per \n\n[262 U.S. 312, 318]\n\u00a0\n curiam opinion. In the latter, jurisdiction was upheld in the absence of a statute concerning solicitation. But in both cases the only constitutional objection asserted was violation of the due process clause. See Reynolds v. Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co., 224 Mass. 379, 113 N. E. 413; Id., 228 Mass. 584, 117 N. E. 913. Since we hold that the Minnesota statute as construed and applied violates the commerce clause, we have no occasion to consider whether it also violates the Fourteenth Amendment. \n5\n\u00a0\n\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The alleged cause of action having arisen during federal control, the action was brought pursuant to sect on 206(a) of Transportation Act Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 461, against the Director General, as Agent. A contract had been made with the carrier for the conduct of litigation arising out of operation during federal control. Hence, under section 206(b) process could be served upon the agent of the company 'if such agent ... is authorized by law to be served with process in proceedings brought against such carrier.' The question of the validity of the service is thus the same as if suit had been brought against the company on such a cause of action arising after federal control had terminated. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] A message, dated February 2, 1923, of the Governor of Minnesota to its Legislature, recites that a recent examination of the calendars of the district courts in 67 of the 87 counties of the state disclosed that in those counties there were then pending 1,028 personal injury cases in which nonresident plaintiffs seek damages aggregating nearly $26,000,000 from foreign railroad corporations which do not operate any line within Minnesota. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Compare International Harvester Co. v.

L N DANTZLER LUMBER CO.(1923)\nNo. 228\nArgued: Decided: February 26, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. R. C. Beckett and Carl Fox, both of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. W. A. White, of Gulfport, Miss., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents an asserted conflict between the laws of Mississippi, subjecting property to attachment, and the statutes of the United States which empowered the President to take control of the railroad transportation systems of the United States, and exempt their property from state processes. Act August 29, 1916, 39 Stat. 619, 645; 40 Stat. 451 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 a-3115 3\/4 p). See, also, 41 Stat. 456.\n The respondent, the L. N. Dantzler Lumber Company, herein called the lumber company, is a corporation of Mississippi. It filed a bill for attachment under the Code of Mississippi of 1906 against the Texas & Pacific \n\n[261 U.S. 280, 281]\n\u00a0\n Railway Company, a nonresident of Mississippi, and certain other railroads, including the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company, a Mississippi corporation, having officers and agents in the state.\n The purpose of the bill was to subject the indebtedness of the defendant railroads to the Texas & Pacific Railway Company to the satisfaction of a claim for damages to a shipment of cattle from Fort Worth, Tex., to a station in Harrison county, Miss. The shipment was evidenced by a bill of lading dated October 10, 1917\n\n\n The charge is that, by reason of the negligence of the railroad companies, the lumber company was damaged in the sum of $5,600, and for the payment of this amount a claim was rendered by the lumber company to the Texas & Pacific Railway Company. Payment was refused.\n It is further charged that the several railroad companies are indebted to the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, and that the lumber company has the right to subject such sums to the satisfaction of its claim against the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, that company being a nonresident of Mississippi, and having no officer in the state upon whom service of process can be had. Personal service is prayed against those companies upon which it can be had, and service by publication upon those companies upon which personal service cannot be had, and that they make answer stating what funds of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company they have in their hands, and in what amounts they will be indebted to that company in the future, and that the respective funds in their hands be subjected to the demand of the lumber company.\n The Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company alleged that the suit is one in attachment and that the company was made a party simply as garnishee in order that any indebtedness from it to the Texas & Pacific Railway Company \n\n[261 U.S. 280, 282]\n\u00a0\n might be condemned to pay the demand of the lumber company, and that the service for that process is mesne process and within the prohibition of the act of Congress (41 Stat. 305), violates that act, and is void.\n A statement of its indebtedness to the Texas & Pacific Railway Company was attached to the answer, showing an indebtedness of $3,053.94.\n The company, further answering, alleged that on December 26, 1917, the President of the United States took possession of and assumed control of the transportation systems of the United States, including the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company and the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, and proclaimed in part, as follows:\n'Except with the prior written consent of said Director General [a Director General was appointed by the President] no attachment by mesne process or on execution shall be levied on or against any of the property used by any of said transportation systems in the conduct of their business as common carriers.'\n\n And further that Congress ratified the action of the President and provided for the control of the railroads by an act approved March 21, 1918, section 10 of which provides as follows:\n'No process, mesne or final, shall be levied against any property under such federal control.'\n\n And that any money due from the company to the Texas & Pacific Railway Company is property under federal control within the meaning of the President's proclamation and the act of Congress under the orders of the Director General appointed by the President.\n A decree pro confesso was entered against the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, the decree reciting that the company had been summoned according to law, and, having failed to appear and plead, answer, or demur, the allegations of the bill were taken as confessed against the company. \n\n[261 U.S. 280, 283]\n\u00a0\n Subsequently the cause was set down for hearing on the decree, the answer of the other railroads, including that of the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company, and upon the motion of the latter to discharge it as garnishee. The motion was sustained and the writ of garnishment dismissed as to it. Relief against the other roads, however, was denied, the court being of the opinion that it had no jurisdiction. The dismissal was reversed on appeal by the Supreme Court of the state. Dantzler Lumber Co. v. Texas & P. Ry. Co., 119 Miss. 328, 80 South. 770, 4 A. L. R. 1669.\n The Supreme Court stated the question to be whether the suit could be maintained by reason of the attachment, no other property of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company being within the state than the indebtedness of the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company to the Texas & Pacific Railway Company.\n The court decided the question in the affirmative, expressing a contrary view of the President's proclamation and the acts of Congress than that asserted by the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company, and even intimating that otherwise the proclamation and acts would be an encroachment upon the power of the state. The court, besides, defined the words 'mesne' to mean 'intermediate; intervening; the middle between two extremes.' This being the definition of 'mesne' process, it was the conclusion of the court, as we understand its opinion, that the present proceeding was commenced under the law of the state by original process and did not incur the prohibition of section 10.\n The conclusion and judgment were that the--\n'court below erred in discharging the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company as garnishee, and in holding that it had no jurisdiction to proceed to determine the controversy before it.'\n\n Upon return of the case a supplemental bill was filed and a new garnishment served on the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company. \n\n[261 U.S. 280, 284]\n\u00a0\n The company answered the bill, repeating, in effect, its former answer, and making other defenses, not of importance to consider.\n The Director General filed what he called an amended answer to the bill, averring that his former answer was filed in the name of the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company, and was intended to be, and was in fact the answer of the Director General, and the indebtedness admitted therein to be due the Texas & Pacific Railway Company was the indebtedness of the Director General, and not the indebtedness of the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company. It set forth, as the answer of the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company had done, that on December 26, 1917, the President by proclamation issued in pursuance of law, took possession of the railroad transportation systems of the United States, including the property of the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company. The Director General of Railroads was created by the President, to whom the present Director General is the successor, and as such was, at the time of the summons against the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company, operating the same, and that the latter company has not been in possession or control of, nor has it operated or had anything to do with the operation of, that railroad since December 28, 1917.\n And the Director General further answered that after the answer of the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company was filed, in order to avoid confusion, he issued General Order No. 50, afterward amended by Order No. 50a, providing that suits or causes of action arising out of the operation of railroads by him should be brought against him and not against the railroad companies, and further that after the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company (and other railroad companies) was taken over by him the account between it (and other railroad companies) was continued as before government control, and that in--\n'the sense that there was money due from the Director General on account of \n\n[261 U.S. 280, 285]\n\u00a0\n his operation of the Mobile & Ohio Railroad to the Director General on account of his operation of the Texas & Pacific Railroad, there was an indebtedness as set out in the original answer filed herein, but that it was not a debt in the true sense of the word or within the meaning of the laws of Mississippi, subjecting debts to garnishments in cases of this kind.'\n\n And he prayed to be dismissed with costs.\n Of the second trial of the case it is only necessary to say that the court refused to let the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company out of the case, or the Director General into it (the answer of the Director General was struck out on motion of the lumber company), and, the Texas & Pacific Railway Company having failed to appear, a decree was rendered against it in favor of the lumber company in the sum of $6,552.\n It was further decreed that there was an admitted indebtedness from the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company to the lumber company in the sum of $3, 053.94, which was ordered to be paid into the chancery court of Harrison county, Miss., within 30 days, to be disbursed in accordance with the decree.\n An appeal was taken by the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company to the Supreme Court, and in that court, James C. Davis, Director General of Railroads, as Agent of the United States, operating the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company, was substituted as defendant, the court saying:\n'The record now makes the Director General, an agent of the United States government, the defendant in garnishment.'\n\n The court reversed the decree of the chancery court against the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company, deciding that it should have been discharged as garnishee, and ordered a decree against Davis as Director General for the sum of $3,053.94, with interest at 6 per cent. from June 29, 1920, until paid. To review that judgment is the purpose of this certiorari. \n\n[261 U.S. 280, 286]\n\u00a0\n In its opinion upon the second appeal the court reaffirmed the view expressed upon the first appeal, and sustained the validity and operation of the state statute against the acts of Congress and the proclamation of the President, rejecting the defense set up that the carrier was an instrumentality or agency of the Federal Government, citing Missouri Pacific Railroad Co. and Hines, Director General v. Ault, \n256 U.S. 554\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 593.\n It was deduced from that decision that the Director General was to be treated as a Director General of each separate system of transportation, and that the separate systems being operated by the Director General are separate parties within the meaning of the purposes of the Federal Control Act, and that therefore the judgment against the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company was, in effect, in view of the substitution made, a judgment against the Director General of the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company and that the lumber company was entitled to recover.\n It was, however, decided that the Director General could not be required to pay the amount of the judgment into court, but that the lumber company would have to secure it in a manner provided for by the Federal Control Act.\n We think the decision of the Supreme Court is based on a misunderstanding of the Ault Case. The liability of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company occurred before the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company passed under government control, and while the liability continued and the Texas & Pacific Railway Company was subject to suit after the assumption of such control, necessarily, the procedure had to be in accordance with the acts of Congress.\n As to what this procedure should be, the contentions of the parties are in conflict. We have seen that the Supreme Court upon the first appeal, Dantzler Lumber Co. v. Texas & P. R. Co., 119 Miss. 328, 80 South. 770, 4 A. L. R. 1669, decided that a carrier, though operated under government \n\n[261 U.S. 280, 287]\n\u00a0\n control, might be subject to garnishment, and that judgment could be rendered against it for a debt it owed to the principal defendant, and, further, that the indebted company (in this case the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company) could not plead any defense which was personal to the principal defendant (in this case the Texas & Pacific Railway Company). From these conclusions the court considered it was not precluded by section 10 of the Federal Control Act, which provided that 'no process, mesne or final, shall be levied against any property under such federal control.'\n This makes the question in the case.\n The lumber company contests the pertinency of the provisions and their control. It asserts that no decree in rem had been rendered in the case, and that--\n'the final decree of the Supreme Court of Mississippi discharged the fund, and that this court is dealing solely with the judgment in personam against the Director General, which there has been no effort to enforce.'\n\n In other words, it is said:\n'The Supreme Court expressly released the fund and rendered a decree in personam, and not a word in the decree or the opinion relates to a refusal to pay the money into court, but the opinion expressly provides, this is not to be done or any other sort of execution to issue.'\n\n And again the contention is that the lumber company--\n'was proceeding as it unquestionably had a right to, but for federal control, and the Director General came into court saying in effect, 'Because of federal control, I am the one to sue,' and procured dismissal of the other defendants.'\n\n And further:\n'He cannot assume responsibility for the purpose of raising or attempting to raise a federal question and then deny the liability on the merits.'\n\n It would be unjust, therefore, is the contention, 'now for the Director General to be even heard to say that he is not responsible for the debt,' and 'the natural consequences to \n\n[261 U.S. 280, 288]\n\u00a0\n follow his substitution upon the grounds stated by him was to render the decree against him and as such substitute and he is complaining of the very ruling he himself invoked.' And this, it is contended, contravenes the Ault Case.\n The view is partial and overlooks antagonistic things-overlooks that the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company was made a defendant through garnishment, attempting thereby to defeat the provision of the Federal Control Act, which provides:\n'No process, mesne or final, shall be levied against any property under such federal control.'\n\n And the prohibition was necessary to the unity and effectiveness of control in the President and, under him, in the Director General. Such is the ruling in the Ault Case, where it is decided that the railroad systems could be 'dealt with as active responsible parties, answerable for their own wrongs,' but it was also decided that 'levy or execution upon their property was precluded as inconsistent with the government's needs.' 'Thus, under section 10,' is the declaration, 'if the cause of action arose prior to government control, suit might be instituted or continued to judgment against the company as though there had been no taking over by the government, save from the immunity of physical property from levy. ...'\n To repeat, the right of suit against the carriers was decided, but there was also decided the exemption of their property from levy or execution. The garnishment proceedings against the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company was an infraction of the exemption-an infringement of the prohibition of the proclamation of the President and congressional enactments. It is not excluded from the condemnation because it is a procedure under the statutes of the state.\n The defense was seasonably made. It is to be remembered that the Mobile & Ohio Railr ad Company, im mediately \n\n[261 U.S. 280, 289]\n\u00a0\n in the proceeding against it, attacked the jurisdiction of the court and adduced the proclamation of the President exempting the property of any of the railroad systems of the United States from process, and also adduced section 10. The attack was successful in the trial court. It was declared impotent by the Supreme Court of the state, and the case was remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the law of the state; that is, in execution of the garnishment proceedings against the indebtedness of the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company to the Texas & Pacific Railway Company. The Director General then entered the case and took up the contest commenced by the Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company against the law of the state and the jurisdiction of the state court to enforce it.\n This the Director General did, and nothing more. In other words, the Director General contested the jurisdiction and power of the court to proceed against property under the control of the United States, and which the proclamation of the President and the statutes of the United States had exempted from state control.\n Reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAVIS v. SLOCOMB(1923)\nNo. 530\nArgued: Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 158, 159]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Arthur E. Griffin, of Seattle, Wash., for defendant in error.\n Messrs. F. G. Dorety, of St. Paul, Minn., and Edwin C. Matthias, of Seattle, Wash., for plaintiff in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in 1921 by a citizen of Washington in a court of that state to recover, under a state statute, for death caused by the negligence of the Great Northern Railway while under federal control. The government had surrendered possession February 28, 1920. The railway, a Minnesota corporation, and James Cox Davis, as Agent designated by the President pursuant to title 2,  206a, of Transportation Act Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, were made defendants. Removal to the federal court was prayed for, and granted, on the ground of diversity of citizenship and also on the ground that the suit was one arising under the laws of the United States. The District Court ordered that the suit be dismissed as against the railway; and later entered judgment \n\n[263 U.S. 158, 160]\n\u00a0\n against Davis. That judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals and is brought here by writ of error under section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1218). Respondent moves to dismiss the writ of error on the ground that under section 128 (Comp. St.  1120) the judgment below is final.\n The cause of action for a death was created by state statute. But the case is one arising under the laws of the United States; for it is only by reason of the federal law that any suit may be brought against this defendant. Sonnentheil v. Moerlein Brewing Co., \n172 \nU.S. 401, 404\n, 405 S., 19 Sup. Ct. 233; Matter of Dunn, \n212 U.S. 374\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 299. The amount in controversy exceeds $1,000, besides costs. The ground of removal set out in the petition is both diversity of citizenship and that the case arises under federal law. It may, therefore, be brought here under section 241 (Southern Pacific Co. v. Stewart, \n245 U.S. 359\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 130; Id., \n245 U.S. 562\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 203), unless the case is one of those arising under federal law in which Congress has denied the right of removal to the federal court, and\/or is one of those so arising in which the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals has been made final. The question presented is one of construction.\n The right to sue the government for injuries arising under federal control rests on section 10 of the Federal Control Act of March 21, 1918, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 j), Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Ault, \n256 U.S. 554\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 593. That section provides that 'actions at law ... may be brought by and against such carriers ... as now provided by law,' but that there shall not be 'transferred to a federal court any action ... which ... was not so transferable prior to the federal control.' Therefore, if, during federal control, this suit had been begun against the Director General he could not have removed it to the federal court on the ground that it is a suit arising under the laws of the United States; and, since the jurisdiction of the District Court would have rested wholly on diversity of citizenship, the \n\n[263 U.S. 158, 161]\n\u00a0\n judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals would have been final. Upon the termination of federal control it was necessary to make provision for suits then pending, and also for such as might thereafter be brought based on causes of action arising during the period of operation by the government. This was done in Transportation Act 1920, by section 206, subdivisions (a), (b), (c), (d), and (f), which provide, among other things, that an agent to be designated by the President shall be substituted for the Director General in suits then pending; and that the agent shall be made the defendant in suits thereafter commenced. That act contains no provision relating to the removal of causes to the federal courts. There is no reason to suppose that Congress intended to make a change in this respect and give the right of removal in suits then pending, merely because the representative of the government was, after February 28, 1920, to be designated agent and to have limited powers, instead of being the Director General who possessed broad powers. Nor is any reason suggested why Congress should have desired to confer upon such agent larger rights of removal, or of review by this court, than had been enjoyed theretofore by the Director General. In the absence of specific provision to that effect we must assume that Congress intended to leave the law unchanged.\n The only ground for removal in this case was diversity of citizenship. Hence the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is final.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","62":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAVIS v. WECHSLER(1923)\nNo. 70\nArgued: October 12, 1923Decided: October 22, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 22, 23]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Roy B. Thomson, H. M. Langworthy, and O. H.

The suit was brought against Walker D. Hines, the Director General, on January 29, 1920, in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri. The cause of action arose in another county and the plaintiff then and when the suit was brought resided in Illinois. By General Order 18-A it was ordered that--\n'all suits against carriers while under Federal control must be brought in the county or district where the plaintiff resided at the time of the accrual of the cause of action or in the county or district where the cause of action arose.'\n\n The defendant pleaded a general denial and also that the Court was without jurisdiction because of the foregoing facts. The plaintiff by replication relied upon the invalidity of the order, a point now decided against him. Alabama & Vicksburg Ry. Co. v. Journey, \n257 U.S. 111\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 6. On February 25, 1921, the plaintiff amended and John Barton Payne, Director General of Railroads and agent designated by the President under Transportation Act, 1920 (41 Stat. 456), was substituted by agreement as successor of Hines and according to the record the 'substituted defendant entered his appearance in said cause and adopted the answer theretofore filed by said Walker D. Hines, defendant.' It was not disputed and was stated \n\n[263 U.S. 22, 24]\n\u00a0\n by the Court below that by Missouri practice the defendant had a right to unite a plea to the jurisdiction and a defence on the merits, but it was held by the Court of Appeals affirming a judgment for the plaintiff that the provision in General Order 18-A went only to the venue of the action and was waived by the appearance of Payne. A similar effect was attributed to the appearance of the present petitioner Davis in the place of Payne. A writ of certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court of the State.\n We are of opinion that the judgment must be reversed. Whatever springes the State may set for those who are endeavoring to assert rights that the State confers, the assertion of Federal rights, when plainly and reasonably made, is not to be defeated under the name of local practice. Even if the order went only to the venue and not to the jurisdiction of the Court, each Director General in turn plainly indicated that he meant to adopt the position of his predecessor, and to insist that the suit was brought in the wrong county. His lawful insistence cannot be evaded by attempting a distinction between his appearance and his substantially contemporaneous adoption of the plea. Indeed when the law requires him to unite his defence on the merits, which imports an appearance pro hac vice, with his preliminary plea, it is hard to understand how any effect could be attributed to the statement that he appeared. The state courts may deal with that as they think proper in local matters but they cannot treat it as defeating a plain assertion of Federal right. The principle is general and necessary. Ward v. Love County, \n253 \nU.S. 17, 22\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 419. If the Constitution and laws of the United States are to be enforced, this Court cannot accept as final the decision of the state tribunal as to what are the facts alleged to give rise to the right or to bar the assertion of it even upon local grounds.

This is familiar as to the substantive law and for the same reasons it is necessary to see that local practice shall not be allowed to put unreasonable obstacles in the way. See American Ry.

As found by the Supreme Court of Missouri his evidence tended to show the following facts: While the freight train of which he was conductor was at a station, moving slowly, he was standing on the side of one of the cars with his feet in a sill-step fastened to the bottom of the car within about a foot of its end, and holding on with his right hand to a grab iron or handhold directly over the sill-step and about three or four feet from it. This grab iron consisted of a round iron bar bent at the ends, which were bolted into the wooden side of the car. The wood had rotted or been worn away, so that the bolts had a play or movement of about an inch, which made the grab iron loose and defective and permitted it to move to that extent. While thus standing on the sill-step \n\n[263 U.S. 239, 241]\n\u00a0\n and holding on to the grab iron with his right hand, Wolfe signalled the fireman with his left hand to stop the train. But instead of stopping it moved forward with a violent jerk at accelerated speed, and by reason of the movement of the loose grab iron to which Wolfe was holding, he was caused to fall to the ground beside the car and one of its wheels ran over his left arm and injured it so that it had to be amputated at the shoulder joint. It was, furthermore, not unusual for conductors or brakemen to stand in the sill-step and hold on to the grab iron to signal orders as to the movement of the train. The loose condition of the grab iron was not disputed.\n The argument in behalf of the petitioner is, in substance, that on these facts Wolfe was not in a situation where the defective grab iron operated as a breach of duty imposed for his benefit by Section 4 of the Act, which, it is urged, merely requires the furnishing and maintenance of grab irons in behalf of employees engaged in coupling or uncoupling cars or a service connected therewith, and does not require them as a means of or aid to the transportation of employees.\n While there is no previous decision of this Court relating to this aspect of Section 4, a controlling analogy is to be found in its decisions as to the application of Section 2 of the Act, which, as amended, makes it unlawful to use on a railroad engaged in interstate commerce any car not equipped with automatic couplers capable of being coupled and uncoupled 'without the necessity of men going between the ends of the cars.' This section has been considered in four cases in which the injured employees were not engaged either in coupling or uncoupling or in any service connected therewith.\n In St. Louis Railroad v. Conarty, \n238 U.S. 243\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 785, a switch engine ran, in the dark, into a standing car whose coupler and drawbar had been pulled out, and the engine, \n\n[263 U.S. 239, 242]\n\u00a0\n in the absence of these appliances, coming in immediate contact with the end of the car, a switchman riding on the footboard of the engine was caught between it and the body of the car; and in Lang v. New York Central Railroad, \n255 U.S. 455\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 381, through failure to stop in time a string of cars that had been kicked in on a siding, it ran into a standing car whose coupler attachment and bumpers were gone, and the brakemen on the end of the string of cars was caught between the car on which he was riding and the standing car. In these cases it was held that, the collisions not being proximately attributable to the absence of automatic couplers on the standing cars, the carriers were not liable for the injuries received by the employees, even if the collisions would not have resulted in injuries to them had the couplers been on the standing cars, the requirement of automatic couplers not being intended to provide a place of safety between cars brought into collision through other causes.\n In Louisville Railroad v. Layton, \n243 U.S. 617\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 456, the failure of couplers to work automatically in a switching operation resulted in a collision of cars, from one of which a brakeman was thrown while preparing to release brakes; and in Minneapolis Railroad v. Gotschall, \n244 U.S. 66\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 598, a brakeman was thrown from a train as the result of defective couplers coming open while the train was in motion. In these cases, the defect in the couplers being in each the proximate cause of the injury, it was held that the employees were entitled to recover. In the Layton Case the court, after specifically distinguishing the Conarty Case on the ground that in that case the collision resulting in the injury was not proximately attributable to a violation of the Act (page 621 of 243 U. S., page 457 of 37 Sup. Ct. [61 L. Ed. 931]), said:\n'While it is undoubtedly true that the immediate occasion for passing the laws requiring automatic couplers was the great number of deaths and injuries caused to employees who were obliged to go between cars to couple \n\n[263 U.S. 239, 243]\n\u00a0\n and uncouple them, yet these laws as written are by no means confined in their terms to the protection of employees only when so engaged. The language of the acts and the authorities we have cited make it entirely clear that the liability in damages to employees for failure to comply with the law springs from its being made unlawful to use cars not equipped as required-not from the position the employee may be in or the work which he may be doing at the moment when he is injured. This effect can be given to the acts and their wise and humane purpose can be accomplished only by holding, as we do, that carriers are liable to employees in damages whenever the failure to obey these safety appliance laws is the proximate cause of injury to them when engaged in the discharge of duty.' (Page 621.)\n\n The doctrine of this case was explicitly recognized in the Lang Case, in which the Layton Case was distinguished, on the facts, on the ground that 'necessarily there must be a causal relation between the fact of delinquency and the fact of injury' (p. 459 of 255 U. S., p. 383 of 41 Sup. Ct. [65 L. Ed. 729]).\n The rule clearly deducible from these four cases is that, on the one hand, an employee cannot recover under the Safety Appliance Act if the failure to comply with its requirements is not a proximate cause of the accident which results in his injury, but merely creates an incidental condition or situation in which the accident, otherwise caused, results in such injury; and, on the other hand, he can recover if the failure to comply with the requirements of the Act is a proximate cause of the accident, resulting in injury to him while in the discharge of his duty, although not engaged in an operation in which the safety appliances are specifically designed to furnish him protection.\n This construction of the Act is substantially that given by the Circuit Courts of Appeals of the Second, Fourth and Sixth Circuits in Director General v. Ronald \n\n[263 U.S. 239, 244]\n\u00a0\n (C. C. A.) 265 Fed. 138, Philadelphia Railway v. Eisenhart (C. C. A.) 280 Fed. 271, and McCalmont v. Pennsylvania Railroad (C. C. A.) 283 Fed. 736; and by the State courts in McNaney v. Chicago Railway, 132 Minn. 391, 157 N. W. 650, and Ewing v. Coal Railway Co., 82 W. Va. 427, 96 S. E. 73.\n It results that in the present case, as there was substantial evidence tending to show that the defective condition of the grab iron required by Section 4 of the Safety Appliance Act was a proximate cause of the accident resulting in injury to Wolfe while in the discharge of his duty as a conductor, the case was properly submitted to the jury under the Act; and the issues having been determined by the jury in his favor the judgment of the trial court was in that behalf properly affirmed.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri is accordingly\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","64":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDENBY v. BERRY(1923)\nNo. 47\nArgued: October 5, 1923Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 29, 30]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Geo. Ross Hull, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Daniel Thew Wright, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a petition for mandamus filed in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia by a member and officer of the Naval Reserve Force, as relator, to compel the Secretary of the Navy to revoke an order directing the release of the relator from active service in the Navy and to make an order sending him before a retiring board, with a view to his retirement by the President. \n\n[263 U.S. 29, 31]\n\u00a0\n The Supreme Court sustained a demurrer to the amended answer of the Secretary and, the latter electing not to plead further, the court issued a mandamus as prayed. The Secretary carried the case on appeal to the Court of Appeals of the District, which affirmed the part of the mandamus directing revocation of the order of release, and reversed the part requiring that the Secretary send the relator before a retiring board. The Secretary brings this writ of error to the judgment of the Court of Appeals. The case involves the construction of the general statutes of the United States applicable to the Naval Reserve Force and the retirement of its officers. We, therefore, have jurisdiction of the writ under section 250, par. 6, of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1227).\n The relator, being an officer in the Naval Reserve Force, was ordered before a naval board of medical survey, and on October 14, 1919, was found by that board to be under permanent disability, which was incurred in line of duty and was not the result of his own misconduct. The board recommended that the relator be sent before a retiring board. The Secretary of the Navy forwarded this recommendation to the Bureau of Navigation, the executive bureau of the Navy, disapproved, and directed that 'this officer be ordered to proceed to his home and be released from active duty.' The Bureau of Navigation, on November 17, 1919, accordingly issued to the relator this announcement:\n'You are hereby detached from such duty as may have been assigned you; you will proceed to your home and regard yourself honorably discharged from active service in the Navy.'\n\n The relator wrote to the Secretary of the Navy, requesting that his case be referred to a retiring board for consideration, to which the Secretary replied, denying the plaintiff's right either to have his case so considered or to be placed on the retired list. The next day, November 18, 1919, this action was brought. \n\n[263 U.S. 29, 32]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Appeals held that, because the relator as Naval Reserve officer, if disabled in the line of duty, was eligible for retirement under the same conditions as provided for regular naval officers, and because no officer of the Navy could under section 1455, R. S. (Comp. St.  2634), be retired from active service or wholly retired without a full and fair hearing before a Navy retiring board, if he should demand it, the Secretary had retired him from the service in violation of law, and that he could be compelled to revoke his action. This would reinstate him to the status of a Naval Reserve officer in the active service with full pay as such from October 18, 1919\n\n\n The Naval Reserve Force was established by the Naval Appropriation Act of August 29, 1916 (39 Stat. c. 417, pp. 556, 587 [Comp. St.  2900 1\/2 a et seq.]). By its provisions, the Naval Reserve Force was to be composed of citizens of the United States who by enrollment therein or transfer thereto should obligate themselves to serve in the Navy in time of war or during an emergency declared by the President. Enrollment was to be for four years. A clothing gratuity was allowed and retainer pay of $12 a year or more according to class was to be paid to those who kept the Secretary advised of their whereabouts. The same grades and ranks were provided up to the rank of Lieutenant Commander as existed in the rank and file of the Navy. The President commissioned the commissioned officers. The Secretary issued warrants to the warrant officers. During peace, or when no national emergency existed, members might be discharged at their own request on return of the clothing gratuity. Members might be ordered into active service in the Navy by the President in time of war, or when in his opinion a national emergency existed, and might be required to perform such service throughout the war, or until the national emergency ceased to exist. Enrolled members were to be subject to the laws, regulations, and orders for the government of the regular Navy \n\n[263 U.S. 29, 33]\n\u00a0\n only during such time as they might be required in the active service. The members of the Force, when in active service, were entitled to the same pay, allowance, gratuities, and other emoluments as men of the same rank or grade in the regular Navy, but when on inactive duty they were entitled only to what was expressly provided in the act. The Secretary of the Navy was to make all necessary and proper regulations not inconsistent with law for the administration of these Naval Reserve Force provisions.\n It is quite evident from the foregoing that members of this force occupied two statuses, one that of inactive duty, and the other of active service. It is further clear that it was within the power of the President and of the Secretary of the Navy acting for him, to change the members of the Reserve Force from one status to the other. The power to call them from inactive duty to actual service was express. The power to order them from actual service to inactive duty was necessarily implied. How this should be done was within the discretion of the President and his alter ego in the Navy Department, the Secretary. United States v. Jones, 18 How. 92, 95. The vesting of the right to make regulations to carry out the act in the Secretary shows that he was to act for the President. As a matter of practice in the department, the method of calling out the members of the Reserve Force and of sending them back to inactive duty, was, by order of the Secretary of the Navy (Gen. Order No. 237 of October 6, 1916), left to the Bureau of Navigation, and under that bureau mobilization and demobilization of the Reserve Force were carried on under special orders and circulars. Orders releasing individuals from active service and putting them on inactive duty were clearly within the power of the President and of the Secretary of the Navy acting for him in the administration of the \n\n[263 U.S. 29, 34]\n\u00a0\n act. Nowhere is there found any limitation upon the discretion of the Executive in this regard. The orders in such cases were in the nature of military orders by the Commander in Chief in the assignment or withdrawal of available forces to or from duty for the good of the service. Such orders of withdrawal could not and did not make members of the Naval Reserve Force civilians. They did not release them from obligation under their enrollment to render active service again, when ordered to do so by the proper authority. When the Bureau of Navigation detached relator from active duty and told him to go home and regard himself as honorably discharged from active service in the Navy, he was not ousted from the Naval Reserve Force or the Navy. The words 'honorably discharged' were only to advise him and others that the change of his status from active to inactive duty was not because of his fault or misconduct.\n The Court of Appeals, however, construed this order to be an effort to retire the relator from the Navy in the sense in which that term is used in section 1455, R. S. (Comp. St.  2634), which reads as follows:\n'No officer of the Navy shall be retired from active service, or wholly retired from the service, without a full and fair hearing before such Navy retiring-board, if he shall demand it, except in cases where he may be retired by the President at his own request, or on account of age or length of service, or on account of his failure to be recommended by an examining board for promotion.'\n\n This section was adopted in 1861 (12 Stat. c. 42, p. 291), and applied to regular officers in the Navy. The retirement from active service, and complete retirement provided in the section, are to be understood as they apply to such officers. Officers in the Regular Navy who have become unfit for service before the retiring age are subject to three methods of retirement. One is when the disability is in the line of duty, and their retirement pay is \n\n[263 U.S. 29, 35]\n\u00a0\n three-fourths of the pay of their rank on active duty. The other two are when the disability is not incurred in line of duty; and in one the retirement pay is furlough or one-half of leave of absence pay of their rank in active service, and in the other there is full retirement to civilian life on a year's full pay of their rank. Sections 1453, 1454, R. S. (Comp. St.  2632, 2633). Section 1455 was enacted to prevent an abuse of the power of retirement by superior officers. Section 1455, R. S., has been made applicable to officers on active service in the Naval Reserve Force when disabled in line of duty, first by implication in a proviso of the Act of July 1, 1918 (40 Stat. 704, 710, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  2900 1\/2 a [15 1\/2]), 'that no member of the Naval Reserve Force shall be eligible for retirement other than for physical disability incurred in line of duty,' and then, after this suit was brought, by direct provision in the Act of June 4, 1920 (41 Stat. c. 228, p. 834,  2), as follows:\n'That all officers of the Naval Reserve Force and temporary officers of the Navy who have heretofore incurred or may hereafter incur physical disability in line of duty shall be eligible for retirement under the same conditions as now provided by law for officers of the Regular Navy who have incurred physical disability in line of duty.'\n\n By act approved July 12, 1921 (42 Stat. c. 44, pp. 122, 140,  6), the above was amended by adding a proviso as follows:\n'Provided, however, that application for such retirement shall be filed with the Secretary of the Navy not later than October 1, 1921.'\n\n The proviso shows reflexively that Congress had always intended to give one entitled to retirement the right to apply for it.\n To be retired from active service under the sections from 1448 to 1455, R. S., inclusive (Comp. St.  2627-2634), means retired with pay, and has had this meaning for many years. Brown v. United States, \n113 \nU.S. 568, 572\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 648. To be wholly retired means to be removed from the service entirely on \n\n[263 U.S. 29, 36]\n\u00a0\n payment of a lump sum and to become a civilian. Miller v. United States, 19 Ct. Cl. 338, 353; 29 Op. Attys. Gen. 401. No form of retirement is a removal by way of punishment. Indeed, section 1456, R. S. (Comp. St.  2635), expressly forbids retirement because of misconduct on account of which an officer may be sent before a courtmartial. It is very clear, therefore, that a mere change of status from active service to inactive duty in the Naval Reserve Force is not a 'retirement' in the meaning of section 1455, R. S., the Act of July 1, 1918, or that of Jule 4, 1920.\n There was no reason why, after the relator had been ordered to inactive duty in the Naval Reserve Force, he might not have applied for retirement under the provision of the act of 1918, or later under the Act of June 4, 1920.\n But it is said that the Secretary directed the release of the relator from active service and refused him a retiring board because he was of opinion that under the Act of July 1, 1918, and before the Act of June 4, 1920, Reserve Force officers were not entitled to be retired on pay, but that they must apply for the relief extended to persons disabled in the service by sections 300 and 302 of the War Risk Insurance Act of October 6, 1917 (40 Stat. cc. 105, 398, 405, 406,  2 [Comp. St. 1918,  514qqq, 514r]). Because the Secretary gave a wrong reason for his action is not a ground for requiring him by mandamus to revoke the order putting the relator on inactive duty, if he had discretion to do this, as we have found he did have.\n Nor was the Secretary of the Navy under obligation to order the relator before a retiring board because a board of medical survey recommended it.\n Section 1448, R. S. (Comp. St.  2627), provides that whenever an officer reports himself unable to perform his duties, or whenever in the opinion of the President he is incapacitated, the President may in his discretion direct the Secretary of the Navy to refer the case to a retiring board. By the following sections, 1449 to 1454 (Comp. St.  2628- 2633), the board is to report its finding as to the incapacity of the officer, and, \n\n[263 U.S. 29, 37]\n\u00a0\n if it exists, whether it was an incident of the service. The record is to be transmitted to the Secretary, and by him laid before the President, whose approval is necessary to the retirement.\n The mode of dealing with cases of disability is covered by the regulations of the Navy approved by the President to which the statute gives the force of law. Section 1547, R. S. (Comp. St.  2805). Naval Regulation 361 of 1913 gave authority to the commander in chief of a fleet, commandant of a station, or other commanding officer, to order a medical survey of any person in his command. Under regulation 364 the board of survey of an officer was authorized to recommend treatment, or sick leave; but, if the disability was deemed permanent, it might recommend that the officer be ordered before a retiring board. By regulations 365 when a person surveyed was within the United States or the waters thereof, or in the Carribbean or adjacent waters, and was found unfit for duty, and the commanding officer approved the finding and recommendation of the board as to what should be done, this was to be carried out, 'except in cases involving discharge, travel, leave, or retirement, which shall be referred to the department.'\n Regulation 331, subdivision 5, once provided:\n'When any officer on the active list becomes physically incapacitated to perform the duties of his office, and the probable future duration of such incapacity is permanent or indefinite, he will immediately be ordered before a retiring board, and pending final action upon the question of his retirement will not be examined for promotion.'\n\n Counsel for the relator has maintained that the Secretary by reason of this regulation is under a statutory duty to order a retiring board for an officer physically incapacitated and that he has no discretion in the matter. Its history and the abuse it was intended to stop, as well as section 1448, would make such a construction hard to sustain, but we need not go into this. It suffices to say that, \n\n[263 U.S. 29, 38]\n\u00a0\n adopted in 1915, it has since lost its statutory force. By order of the President, dated January 14, 1916, it was stricken from the Navy Regulations and was thereafter embodied in instructions to naval retiring boards. Section 679, Naval Courts and Boards, 1917. Even if it could have been construed as claimed, when it had the effect of law, it could not now be made the basis of a proceeding in mandamus against the Secretary. It governs his subordinates only and may be ignored by him. United States v. Burns, 12 Wall. 246, 252; Smith v. United States, 24 Ct. Cl. 209. A board of medical survey is simply an executive instrumentality which the Secretary may use to obtain an expert opinion as to the physical capacity of an officer or man. Its recommendations involving retirement must always come to the Secretary for his approval. In the due course of business in the Navy Department applications for retirement dependent on disability must also come before the Secretary, who, acting for and in aid of the President, makes preliminary inquiry into the need of ordering a retiring board. The statute does not require the President to direct the Secretary of the Navy to refer a case to a retiring board. It expressly puts it in the discretion of the President to do so or not to do so. It would be a curious inconsistency in the procedure if the Secretary were compelled by law to order a retiring board to consider an officer's case which the President is given discretion to grant or withhold.\n But it is argued that an officer disabled in the line of his duty is by section 1455 entitled as of right to retirement on pay and that the courts should secure him that right. The right is one dependent by statute on the judgment of the President and not on that of the courts. If, on the preliminary inquiry of the Secretary, he disapproves the application for a retiring board, the officer may appeal directly to the President for action on his petition. This opportunity was provided by section 5323, Naval Instructions 1913, and would exist without it. \n\n[263 U.S. 29, 39]\n\u00a0\n For these reasons, we think that the demurrer to the answer should have been overruled.\n Judgment reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings. \n\n\n\n","65":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDES MOINES NAT BANK v. FAIRWEATHER(1923)\nNo. 17\nArgued: October 3, 1923Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 103, 104]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. G. Gamble, of Des Moines, Iowa, for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Ben J. Gibson and John J. Halloran, both of Des Moines, Iowa, for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DE VANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a proceeding begun by a national bank in Iowa to secure a reduction in an assessment of the shares of its capital stock for taxing purposes, made in 1919\n\n\n The proceeding was in the nature of an appeal from the action of a board of equalization, and ultimately reached the Supreme Court of the state. The bank objected that the board had proceeded on a mistaken construction of the state statute respecting such assessments and that the statute, as construed and applied by the board, was invalid in that it was in conflict with the state Constitution and with laws of the United States. The objections were overruled and the assessment upheld. 191 Iowa, 1240, 181 N. W. 459, 184 N. W. 313. The bank then sued out this writ of error. \n\n[263 U.S. 103, 105]\n\u00a0\n The facts may be shortly stated. No assessment was made against the bank, save of its real property. The shares of its capital stock were assessed to their several owners, the stockholders. The aggregate of the bank's capital, surplus and undivided earnings, was taken as the value of the shares, and from this the amount actually invested in real property was deducted. A proportionate part of the remaining sum was attributed to each share. Among the bank's assets were various securities of the United States, concededly exempted from state taxation by laws of the United States. There was also some stock in a federal reserve bank, claimed to be likewise exempted. The bank sought to have these securities and this stock excluded in making the assessment, that is, to have their value deducted from the total of the capital, surplus, and undivided earnings. The board declined to make the deduction, and pursued a like course in assessing shares in corporate state banks. Among the bank's competitors were some banks conducted by individuals-private banking being admissible in that state. In assessing the moneyed capital employed by these private bankers in their banking business, the board excluded so much thereof as was invested in nontaxable securities of the United States. Twenty per cent. of of each of the assessments here described, whether of bank shares or money employed in private banking, was set down or listed as the taxable value, as distinguished from the real value. The tax levy was to be at a uniform rate on such taxable value.\n We are asked to go into the proper construction of the state statute and its validity under the state Constitution. But these are questions of local law, the decision of which by the Supreme Court of the state is controlling. First National Bank of Garnett v. Ayers, \n160 \nU.S. 660, 664\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 412; Merchants' & Manufacturers' National Bank v. Pennsylvania, \n167 U.S. 461\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 829; Lindsley v.

Ct. 892.\n The only contentions made by the bank which we can consider are, first, that the state statute in substance commands an assessment of the property of the bank, rather than the shares of the stockholders, contrary to the terms of section 5219 of the Revised Statutes of the United States ( Comp. St.  9784); secondly, that the statute, even if commanding as assessment of the shares of the stockholders, subjects securities of the United States and stock in a federal reserve bank to state taxation in disregard of exemptions arising out of laws of the United States; and, thirdly, that, if the assessment be of the shares, the statute subjects them to a higher rate of taxation than is laid on other moneyed capital of individual citizens-meaning the private bankers-and thereby violates a restriction imposed by section 5219 of the Revised Statutes of the United States.\n It is settled that the relation of the national banks to the United States and the purposes intended to be subserved by their creation are such that there can be no taxation, by or under state authority, of the banks, their property or the shares of their capital stock otherwise than in conformity with the terms and restrictions embodied in the assent given by Congress to such taxation.

Stat.  5219, which reads as follows:1- \n\n[263 U.S. 103, 107]\n\u00a0\n 'Nothing herein shall prevent all the shares in any association from being included in the valuation of the personal property of the owner or holder of such shares, in assessing taxes imposed by authority of the state within which the association is located; but the Legislature of each state may determine and direct the manner and place of taxing all the shares of national banking associations located within the state, subject only to the two restrictions, that the taxation shall not be at a greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of such state, and that the shares of any national banking association owned by non-residents of any state shall be taxed in the city or town where the bank is located, and not elsewhere. Nothing herein shall be construed to exempt the real property of associations from either state, county, or municipal taxes, to the same extent, according to its value, as other real property is taxed.'\n This section shows, and the decisions under it hold, that what Congress intended was that national banks and their property should be free from taxation under state authority, other than taxes on their real property and on shares held by them in other national banks; and that all shares in such banks should be taxable to their owners, the stockholders, much as other personal property is taxable, but subject to the restriction that the shares be not taxed higher than other taxable moneyed capital employed in competition with such banks, and to the further restriction that the taxing of the shares of nonresidents of the state be at the place where the bank is located. People v. Commissioners, 4 Wall. 244; National Bank of Redemption v. Boston, \n125 \nU.S. 60, 69\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 772; Mercantile National Bank v. New York, supra; Owensboro National Bank v. Owensboro, supra; Bank of California National Association v. Richardson, \n248 U.S. 476\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 165; First National Bank of Gulfport v. Adams, supra.\n With this understanding of the terms and restrictions of the congressional assent we proceed to an examination \n\n[263 U.S. 103, 108]\n\u00a0\n of the state statute and the particulars in which it is said to be in conflict with them and with tax-exempting laws of the United States. The main provisions of the statute are found in sections 1310, 1322, 1322-1a, and 1325 of the Code of Iowa,2 which read as follows:\n'Sec. 1310. ... All moneyed capital within the meaning of section fifty-two hundred nineteen of the revised statutes of the United States shall be listed and assessed against the owner thereof at his place of business, and if a corporation at its principal place of business, at the same rate as state, savings, national bank and loan and trust company stock is taxed, in the same taxing district, and at the actual value of the moneyed capital so invested. The person or corporation using moneyed capital in competition with bank capital shall furnish the assessor upon demand a full and complete itemized sworn statement showing the amount of moneyed capital so used.'\n\n'Sec. 1322. Shares of stock of national banks and state and savings banks, and loan and trust companies, located in this state, shall be assessed to the individual stockholders at the place where the bank or loan and trust company is located. At the time the assessment is made the officers of national banks and state and savings banks and loan and trust companies shall furnish the assessor with lists of all the stockholders and the number of shares owned by each, and the assessor shall list to each stockholder under the head of corporation stock the total value of such shares. To aid the assessor in fixing the value of such shares, the said corporation shall furnish him a verified statement of all the matter provided in section thirteen hundred twenty-one of the supplement to the Code, 1907, which shall also show separately the amount of \n\n[263 U.S. 103, 109]\n\u00a0\n the capital stock and the surplus and undivided earnings, and the assessor from such statement shall fix the value of such stock based upon the capital, surplus, and undivided earnings. In arriving at the total value of the shares of stock of such corporations, the amount of their capital actually invested in real estate owned by them and in the shares of stock of corporations owning only the real estate ( inclusive of leasehold interest, if any,) on or in which the bank or trust company is located, shall be deducted from the real value of such shares, and such real estate shall be assessed as other real estate, and the property of such corporation shall not be otherwise assessed. A refusal to furnish the assessor with the list of stockholders and the information required under this section shall be deemed a misdemeanor and any bank or officer thereof so refusing shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars.'\n\n'Sec. 1322-1a. For the purpose of placing the taxation of bank and loan and trust company stock and moneyed capital as nearly as possible upon a taxable value relatively equal to the taxable value at which other property is now actually assessed throughout the state as compared with the actual value thereof, it is hereby provided that state, savings and national bank stock and loan and trust company stock and moneyed capital shall be assessed and taxed upon the taxable value of twenty per cent. of the actual value thereof, determined as herein provided, which twenty per cent. of the actual value shall be taken and considered as the taxable value and shall be taxed as other property in such taxing district.'\n\n'Sec. 1325. The corporations described in the preceding sections shall be liable for the payment of the taxes assessed to the stockholders of such corporations, and such tax shall be payable by the corporation in the same manner and under the same penalties as in case of taxes \n\n[263 U.S. 103, 110]\n\u00a0\n due from an individual taxpayer, and may be collected in the same manner as other taxes, or by action in the name of the county. Such corporations may recover from each stockholder his proportion of the taxes so paid, and shall have a lien on his stock and unpaid dividends therefor. If the unpaid dividends are not sufficient to pay such tax, the corporation may enforce such lien on the stock by public sale of the same, to be made by the sheriff at the principal office of such corporation in this state, after giving the stockholders thirty days' notice of the amount of such tax and the time and place of sale, such notices to be by registered letter addressed to the stockholder at his post-office address, as the same appears upon the books of the company, or is known by its secretary.'\n\n Section 1321 referred to in section 1322 relates to the assessment of capital employed in private banking. For present purposes it may be described as requiring the banker to submit to the assessor a sworn statement of the assets and liabilities of his bank with a particular description of such of the assets as are exempt from taxation, and as directing an assessment based on the aggregate value of moneys and credits less deposits, of bonds and stocks less such as are otherwise taxed in the state and of the other property pertaining to the business, but omitting the real estate, which is to be specially assessed as other real estate. The section does not purport to create any exemption or to do more in that regard than possibly to imply that exemptions otherwise created are to be respected. In practice the assessing officers when assessing the capital of private banks do deduct so much thereof as is invested in tax-exempt securities of the United States, but they do this because they regard it as necessary under the tax-exempting laws of the United States.\n As construed by the Supreme Court of the state, the statute as a whole contemplates, and section 1322 requires, that \n\n[263 U.S. 103, 111]\n\u00a0\n the shares be assessed to the stockholders as their property, and as illustrating that the statute makes a clear distinction between the shares and the property of the bank, the court points to the provision which requires that the real estate be assessed against the bank and to the succeeding provision which declares that 'the property of such corporation shall not be otherwise assessed.' This, without more, seems competely to refute the contention that what the statute really directs is an assessment of the bank's property instead of the stockholders' shares. The only argument advanced in support of the contention is drawn from the fact that the capital, surplus and undivided earnings of the bank are made the measure of the value of the shares (see First National Bank of Remsen v. Hayes, 186 Iowa, 892, 900, 171 N. W. 715), and from the fact that the bank is required primarily to pay the tax on the shares. In our opinion neither fact gives color to the contention.\n The value of the shares must depend chiefly on the capital, surplus and undivided earnings of the bank. These are the substantial elements and are susceptible of ready ascertainment. Other possible elements are of relatively small weight and difficult of estimation. That controlling consideration is given to the former and none to the latter may result in an undervaluation, but it does not make the assessment any the less an assessment of the shares. Besides, it hardly lies with the stockholders or the bank to object that the assessment is too low. Stanley v. Supervisors of Albany, \n121 \nU.S. 535, 549\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 1234.\n While the bank is required primarily to pay the tax on the shares, the statute (section 1325) shows that the payment is to be on behalf of the stockholders and that the bank is accorded ample means of enforcing reimbursement from them. It is on the stockholders that the burden ultimately rests. This mode of collecting through the bank the tax against the stockholders has been widely \n\n[263 U.S. 103, 112]\n\u00a0\n adopted and this court has pronounced it not inconsistent with the terms of the congressional assent. National Bank v. Commonwealth, 9 Wall. 353, 361; Aberdeen Bank v. Chehalis County, \n166 \nU.S. 440, 444\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 629; Covington v. First National Bank, \n198 \nU.S. 100, 111\n, 112 S., 25 Sup. Ct. 562; First National Bank of Gulfport v. Adams, supra.\n The next contention-that the statute subjects securities of the United States to taxation contrary to exempting laws of the United States in that it requires that the assessment be based on the aggregate of the capital, surplus and undivided earnings without any deduction or allowance on account of the investment in such securities-confuses the shares, which are the property of the stockholders, with the corporate assets, which are the property of the bank. It is quite true that the states may not tax such securities, but equally true that they may tax the shares in a corporation to their owners, the stockholders, although the corporate assets consist largely of such securities, and that in assessing the shares it is not necessary to deduct what is invested in the securities. The difference turns on the distinction between the corporate assets and the shares-the one belonging to the corporation as an artificial entity and the other to the stockholders. As respects national banks, the rule is the same as with corporations in general. The subject was extensively considered by this court in Van Allen v. Assessors, 3 Wall. 573, which involved the power of a state to tax stockholders in national banks on their shares without making any deduction on account of tax- exempt bonds of the United States in which the capital of the banks was chiefly invested. In sustaining the power, the court said (3 Wall. 583):\n'The tax on the shares is not a tax on the capital of the bank. The corporation is the legal owner of all the property of the bank, real and personal, and within the powers conferred upon it by the charter, and for the purposes \n\n[263 U.S. 103, 113]\n\u00a0\n for which it was created, can deal with the corporate property as absolutely as a private individual can deal with his own. ... The individual members of the corporating are no doubt interested in one sense in the property of the corporation, as they may derive individual benefits from its increase, or loss from its decrease, but in no legal sense are the individual members the owners.\n\n'The interest of the shareholder entitles him to participate in the net profits earned by the bank in the employment of its capital, during the existence of its charter, in proportion to the number of his shares, and, upon its dissolution or termination, to his proportion of the property that may remain of the corporation after the payment of its debts. This is a distinct independent interest or property, held by the shareholder like any other property that may belong to him. Now, it is this interest which the act of Congress has left subject to taxation by the states, under the limitations prescribed, as will be seen on referring to it.'\n\n Then, after noticing the use made of the term 'shares' in other parts of the act, the court added (3 Wall. 588):\n'In all of these instances, it is manifest that the term as used means the entire interest of the shareholder; and it would be singular, if in the use of the term in the connection of state taxation, congress intended a totally different meaning, without any indication of such intent.\n\n'This is an answer to the argument that the term, as used here, means only the interest of the shareholder as representing the portion of the capital, if any, not invested in the bonds of the government, and that the state assessors must institute an inquiry into the investment of the capital of the bank, and ascertain what portion is invested in these bonds, and make a discrimination in the assessment of the shares. If Congress had intended any such discrimination, it would have been an easy matter to \n\n[263 U.S. 103, 114]\n\u00a0\n have said so. Certainly, so grave and important a change in the use of this term, if so intended, would not have been left to judicial construction.\n\n'Upon the whole, after the maturest consideration which we have been able to give to this case, we are satisfied that the states possess the power to tax the whole of the interest of the shareholder in the shares held by him in these associations, within the limit prescribed by the act authorizing their organization.'\n\n That ruling often has been reaffirmed, but never qualified, and is now settled law in this court. People v. Commissioners, 4 Wall. 244; National Bank v. Commonwealth, supra, 9 Wall. 359; Palmer v. McMahon, \n133 \nU.S. 660, 666\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 324; Bank of Commerce v. Tennessee, \n161 \nU.S. 134, 146\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 456; New Orleans v. Citizens Bank, \n167 \nU.S. 371, 402\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 905; Owensboro National Bank v. Owensboro, supra, \n173 U.S. 681\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 537; Home Savings Bank v. Des Moines, \n205 \nU.S. 503, 518\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 571. The latest application of the ruling was at the last term in People's National Bank of Kingfisher v. Board of Equalization, \n260 U.S. 702\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 98, where a decision of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, 79 Okl. 312, 193 Pac. 622, which had followed Van Allen v. Assessors, was affirmed 'upon the authority of' that case and National Bank v. Commonwealth.\n Counsel for the bank regard the case of Bank of California National Association v. Richardson, \n248 U.S. 476\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 165, as qualifying Van Allen v. Assessors and other cases which reaffirmed and applied its ruling. But the case is not fairly open to that interpretation. Some expressions are found in the opinion which, if taken literally and alone, seem to treat the stockholders and the bank as one for taxing purposes; but the opinion as a whole and the ultimate decision demonstrate that these expressions fairly cannot be taken in that way and that there was no purpose to qualify the ruling so often announced and applied in earlier cases. That case was exceptional in its facts. A national bank owning shares in two other banks, one national and the \n\n[263 U.S. 103, 115]\n\u00a0\n other state (see section 5154, Rev. Stat. [Comp. St.  9694]), was taxed on those shares. Its stockholders were also taxed on their shares in it- their shares being taxed on a valuation which took into account all the assets of the bank, other than real estate, including its shares in the other banks. The bank objected to being taxed on its shares in the state bank and also to its stockholders being taxed on a valuation of their shares besed in part on its shares in the other banks-the ground of each objection being that the tax was not in accord with the terms and spirit of the congressional assent. The decision shortly stated was as follows: ( 1) The bank was wrongly taxed on its shares in the state bank; but those shares were rightly taken into account in valuing the shares of the stockholders. (2) The bank was rightly taxed on its shares in the other national bank, for the reasons given in National Bank of Redemption v. Boston, \n125 \nU.S. 60, 69\n, 70 S., 8 Sup. Ct. 772. (3) The shares in the other national bank were wrongly taken into account in valuing the shares of the stockholders, because the provision under which they were taxed to the bank was intended to be exclusive and to prevent the values in the shares from being made, directly or indirectly, a basis for any other or further taxation. On the first and second points, the members of the court were all in accord, but on the third there was a strong dissent-the matter in difference being whether the state, consistently with the terms and spirit of the congressional assent, could tax the shares in the hands of the bank which owned them, and also subject the values in them to another tax laid on the bank's stockholders. The difference was resolved against the further taxation because of what was deemed an implicit restriction in the congressional assent. There had been no prior decision on that point, and it is not involved in the case now under consideration.\n What has been said respecting the taxexempt securities among the bank's assets disposes of the contention \n\n[263 U.S. 103, 116]\n\u00a0\n relating to its stock in a federal reserve bank. If, as is insisted, the stock was exempt, it was to be treated and considered in the same way that the securities were. And whether exempt or not, there was no authority for taxing it to the bank, but only for taking it into account in valuing the shares of the stockholders.\n The contention that the state statute subjects shares in a national bank to a higher rate of taxation than is laid on other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens is rested on the fact that in assessing capital employed in private banking the part invested in tax-exempt securities of the United States is deducted, while in assessing national bank shares the bank's investment in such securities is not deducted.\n The provision found in the congressional assent, that the taxation of the shares 'shall not be at a greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of such state,' has been considered by this court so many times that its purpose and meaning have come to be pretty well understood. Its mainpurpose is to render it impossible for the state, in levying such a tax, to create and foster an unequal and unfriendly competition, by favoring institutions or individuals carrying on a business similar to that of national banks or engaging in operations and investments of a like character; and the restriction comprehends a discrimination effected through rules for fixing valuations quite as much as one effected by using different percentages in computing taxes on fixed valuations. People v. Weaver, \n100 U.S. 539\n, 545; Mercantile National Bank v. New York, \n121 \nU.S. 138, 155\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 826; Amoskeag Savings Bank v. Purdy, \n231 \nU.S. 373, 385\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 114.\n Our concern here is not with a voluntary refusal or intentional omission on the part of the state to tax other moneyed capital of citizens as it taxes national bank shares, but with a submission by the state to superior \n\n[263 U.S. 103, 117]\n\u00a0\n laws of the United States exempting a part of the other moneyed capital from state taxation. It may be helpful to state the matter in another way. National bank shares are taxable-made so by the congressional assent. That much or little of the bank's assets consists of tax-exempt securities of the United States does not affect the taxability of the shares-they being destinct from the corporate assets. The state taxes such shares without regard to the exempt government securities held by the bank. The capital of private bankers is taxable, save the part invested in exempt government securities. The state taxes all of that capital, save the exempt securities. They are exempt because the United States makes them so, and the state merely respects the exemption. In what is thus done does the state discriminate against national bank shares and in favor of other moneyed capital in the sense of the restriction? The question is not new; nor can it be regarded as an open one in this court.\n In people v. Commissioners, 4 Wall. 244, the question was whether, in the presence of the restriction, a state could assess and tax to their owners shares in national banks without making any deduction on account of tax-exempt securities of the United States held by the banks, when in taxing moneyed capital of individuals employed in competition with those banks such a deduction was made. The court gave an affirmative answer to the question, saying (4 Wall. 256):\n'The answer is, that upon a true construction of this clause of the act, the meaning and intent of the lawmakers were, that the rate of taxation of the shares should be the same, or not greater, than upon the moneyed capital of the individual citizen which is subject or liable to taxation. That is, no greater proportion or percentage of tax in the valuation of the shares should be levied than upon other moneyed taxable capital in the hands of the citizens. \n\n[263 U.S. 103, 118]\n\u00a0\n\n\n'This rule seems to be as effectual a test to prevent unjust discrimination against the shareholders as could well be devised. It embraces a class which constitutes the body politic of the state, who make its laws and provide for its taxes. They cannot be greater than the citizens impose upon themselves. It is known as sound policy that, in every well-regulated and enlightened state or government, certain descriptions of property, and also certain institutions-such as churches, hospitals, academies, cemeteries, and the like-are exempt from taxation; but these exemptions have never been regarded as disturbing the rates of taxation, even where the fundamental law had ordained that it should be uniform.\n\n'The objection is a singular one. At the time Congress enacted this rule as a limitation against descrimination, it was well known to that body that these securities in the hands of the citizens were exempt from taxation. It had been so held by this court, and, for abundant caution, had passed into a law.\n\n'The argument founded on the objection, if it proves anything, proves that these securities should have been taxed in the hands of individuals to equalize the taxation, and, hence, that Congress by this clause in the proviso intended to subject them, as thus situated, to taxation, and, therefore, there was error in the deduction. This we do not suppose is claimed. But if this is not the result of the argument, then, the other conclusion from it is, that Congress required that the commissioners should deduct the securities, and at the same time intended the deduction, if made, should operate as a violation of the rate of the tax prescribed. We dissent from both conclusions.'\n\n That view of the matter has been adopted and given effect in all subsequent cases presenting the question. Lionberger v. Rowse, 9 Wall, 468, 475; Hepburn v. School Directors, 23 Wall. 480, 485; Adams v. Nashville, 95 U. S. \n\n[263 U.S. 103, 119]\n\u00a0\n 19, 22; Mercantile National Bank v. New York \n121 \nU.S. 138, 149\n, 161 S., 7 Sup. Ct. 826. Counsel for the bank regard Van Allen v. Assessors, supra, 3 Wall. 581, as making for the other view. But that it does not do so is plainly pointed out in Mercantile National Bank v. New York, supra, \n121 U.S. 152\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 826. We perceive no reason for disturbing prior decisions on the point.\n Our conclusion is that none of the objections urged against the state statute is well taken.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Several important changes in section 5219 were made by an amendatory Act of March 4, 1923 (42 Stat. 1499), but they have no bearing on this case. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The reference is to the Code as amended April 6, 1911 (Acts 34th General Assembly, p.45), the amendments being shown in the Code Supplement of 1913. \n\n\n\n\n","66":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDIAZ A v. PATTERSON(1923)\nNo. 113\nArgued: November 28, 1923Decided: December 10, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 399, 400]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. H. Jackson and Harry P. Gamble, of New Orleans, La., for appellants.\n Mr. Edwin T. Merrick, of New Orleans, La., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the heirs and representatives of Domingo Diaz against Patterson alleging their possession of an estate known as Lo de Caceres in the Canal Zone and an adverse claim set up by Patterson. It prays that the petitioners may be confirmed in their title and, by an amendment, that all parties claiming any interest in the land may be summoned to appear in this case and that the petitioners may be declared entitled to a fund deposited in the registry of the Court, since this suit was begun, upon expropriation of the land by the United States. At the first trial the petitioners obtained a decree, but as material questions of fact had not been decided by the Judge the decree was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Patterson v. Diaz, 262 Fed. 899. At the second trial there was a careful finding of facts and a decree for the defendant, Patterson, which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 281 Fed. 394. The petitioners appealed to this Court and contend that they have been denied rights conferred upon them by the laws of the Canal Zone.\n The trial Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals have found that the defendant has established recorded title to the land by an unbroken chain from the original grant from the Spanish Crown in 1695, and also that he and his predecessors have held open, uninterrupted, and notorious possession of the same since 1790. These findings we shall not disturb. The facts relied upon by the petitioners are that there was a sale in 1832, afterwards set aside, purporting to convey the land; that the heir of the grantee made a simulated sale to herself, and that this \n\n[263 U.S. 399, 401]\n\u00a0\n fictitious title was recorded in 1895, although none of the grantees ever was in possession at any time, or brought any action until 1917, in which year the present suit was begun. The ground of this extraordinary claim is found in article 2526 of the Civil Code of Panama;\n'The acquisitive prescription of real property or of real rights constituted therein does not obtain against a recorded title, except by virtue of another recorded title, nor shall it begin to run but from the date of the record of the second.'\n\n The petitioners contend that the effect of this article is that the mere recording of what purports to be a conveyance by a stranger to the title who is and remains out of possession, will give to the grantee a good title by what is called the ordinary prescription of ten years, article 2529, notwithstanding the requirement of regular uninterrupted possession for that result in article 2528. It is argued that constructive possession follows the record and is enough, and it is supposed that this transaction will defeat the previous registered possession and title by ordinary prescription although by article 789 that possession does not cease until the record is canceled, by consent, or by a transfer from the registered possessor, or by a judicial decree. It is supposed also to destroy a title complete by the extraordinary prescription of thirty years to which 'no title whatsoever is necessary.' Article 2531\n\n\n The effect attributed to article 2526 depends in part upon its operation after the Canal Zone was taken over by the United States as the ten years had not run when the Zone was transferred. It would be extreme to construe the article as meaning something different now from what it would have meant before the transfer. Taking it simply as a law of the United States we should see no reason for attributing to it the unjust operation contended for. It is not necessary to consider what such a registration might do in the way of interrupting a prescription \n\n[263 U.S. 399, 402]\n\u00a0\n not yet complete, but we see no sufficient ground for converting it into a disseizin when the previous owners maintain their possession undisturbed under a registered title in favor of which prescription already has run. If we recur to the origin of the law we do not believe that a different view would be taken in Panama. But the considerations that have been urged for following local decisions in places like Porto Rico having their own peculiar system, do not apply in the same degree to a code that in its present application governs a predominantly American population and derives its force from Congress and the President. Panama R. R. Co. v. Bosse, \n249 U.S. 41\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 211. The opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals on the first appeal was not res judicata or conclusive here, as the defendant seems to suppose, Remington v. Central Pacific R. R. Co., \n198 \nU.S. 95, 99\n, 100 S., 25 Sup. Ct. 577; Messinger v. Anderson, \n225 \nU.S. 436, 444\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 739, but we are of opinion that upon the question before us it was right.\n The petitioners attempt to fortify their case by the absence of an order calling upon the rest of the world to come in and assert whatever claim anyone may have to the fund in the registry of the Court. The purpose of the suit was to remove Patterson's claim to the land. He alone was made a party. It does not concern the petitioners after their failure to establish either possession or title, whether some third person has a better title than Patterson or what precautions the Court shall take before giving him the fund that has taken the place of the land.\n The record is at once defective and unduly prolix, and this and other considerations perhaps might have warranted a dismissal of the appeal. But as both parties desired a decision upon the merits and as the costs will fall upon the appellants we have thought it better to indicate our opinion that the reasons for the appeal are untenable and that the decree should be affirmed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","67":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDIAZ v.

The land is in the judicial district of Humacao. In 1908 the widow obtained authority to make the sale from the District Court of the judicial district of San Juan, and the sale was made. This suit proceeds on the ground that only the Court of the judicial district where the land was situated had power to authorize the sale of the minors' interest in the land.\n The argument that prevailed with the Circuit Court of Appeals is forcible and perhaps might prevail with us if we looked at the face of the statutes invoked, without more. By section 229 of the Civil Code of Porto Rico, as amended by an Act of March 14, 1907, Laws of 1907, \n\n[261 U.S. 102, 104]\n\u00a0\n p. 284:\n'The exercise of the patria potestas does not authorize the father or mother to alienate or burden real property which in any manner belongs to the child, and over which either of them may have the administration, except after securing judicial authorization, which shall be accorded by the District Court of the Judicial District where said property is situated, upon proof being furnished as to the necessity or utility of such transfer or burden.'\n\n This naturally enough is taken to mean that the Court of that istrict alone can give the authority required. The interpretation gains further force when it is known that this section of the Civil Code of 1902 originally gave the power to the District Court of the minors' domicile and that it was amended to its present form in 1907, with a provision, in case of a sale by auction, for a publication in a newspaper having a circulation in the district. It certainly is not unnatural to read the quoted section as excluding the application of the more general sections 76 and 77 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1904, by which:\n (76) 'In accordance with its jurisdiction, a court shall have cognizance of the suits to which the maintenance of all kinds of actions may give rise, when the parties have agreed to submit the suit to decision of court.'\n (77) 'The submission shall be understood to be made: 1. By the written agreement of the parties. 2. By the plaintiff through the mere act of applying to the court and filing the complaint. 3. By the defendant when, after his appearance in court, he takes any step other than to request that the trial be held in the proper court.'\n One might doubt even whether the last cited sections apply to any ex parte proceedings. The respondents made the most of the doubt. But those sections embody earlier law and practice and we accept the conclusion of the Supreme Court that they have been taken to extend to such cases. Martorell v. J. Ochoa & Bro., 26 P. R. 625. Agenjo v. Santiago Rosa, 26 P. R. 648. The most forcible objection \n\n[261 U.S. 102, 105]\n\u00a0\n is that which we have stated; that a special law definitely applicable limits general expressions in other laws that otherwise might be sufficient. We will not repeat the argument quoted from Manresa and Scaevola that jurisdiction is a matter of adjective law and that the general provisions with regard to it are not repealed by a repeal of the substantive law or change in the Civil Code. Mantorell v. J. Ochoa & Bro., 26 P. R. 631, 632. We will do no more than note Manresa's conclusion that although it would be more prudent to apply to the Jodge specially designated, any Judge having jurisdiction of this class of cases is made competent by the submission implied from invoking his action. The distinction taken seems to be similar to that which we take between jurisdiction and venue. Martorell v. J. Ochoa & Bro., 25 P. R. 707, 729. A mistake as to the latter is waived by submission, Lee v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., \n260 U.S. 653\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 230, 67 L. Ed. --, January 22, 1923, and in the Porto Rican law an exparte application is an adequate submission. This is a perfectly intelligible view, and when we are assured by the Supreme Court that it long has been taken, 25 P. R. 729; 26 P. R. 634; interrupted only by a momentary obstruction caused perhaps by accepting too broadly and absolutely an expression in Garzot v. Rios de Rubio, \n209 \nU.S. 283, 303\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 548, we see no reason for not taking it here. The fact alleged that this interpretation of the law has become a rule of property, 25 P. R. 730, is very important and is not weakened by there being only a small number of decisions on the point. If it has been accepted by the practice of the community it should not be disturbed except upon an unescapable conclusion that it is wrong.\n This Court has stated many times the deference due to the understanding of the local courts upon matters of purely local concern. It is enough to cite Villanueva v. Villanueva, \n239 \nU.S. 293, 299\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 109; Nadal v. May, \n233 \nU.S. 447, 454\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 611. This is especially true in dealing with the decisions of a Court inheriting and brought up in a different \n\n[261 U.S. 102, 106]\n\u00a0\n system from that which prevails here. When we contemplate such a system from the outside it seems like a wall of stone, every part even with all the others, except so far as our own local education may lead us to see subordinations to which we are accustomed. But to one brought up within it, varying emphasis, tacit ssumptions, unwritten practices, a thousand influences gained only from life, may give to the different parts wholly new values that logic and grammar never could have gotten from the books. In this case a slight difference in the caution felt in dealing with the interest of minors (Baerga v. Registrar of Humacao, 29 p. r. 440, 442), and a slight change of emphasis in the reading of statutes, explain the divergence between the Supreme Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals. Our appellate jurisdiction is not given for the purpose of remodeling the Spanish-American law according to common law conceptions except so far as that law has to bend to the expressed will of the United States. The importance that we attribute to these considerations led to our granting the writ of certiorari and requires us to reverse the judgment below.\n Judgment of Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. Judgment of Supreme Court of Porto Rico affirmed. \n\n\n\n","68":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDIER v. BANTON(1923)\nNo. 330\nArgued: April 17, 1923Decided: May 7, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. Nash Rockwood, of New York City, for appellants. \n\n[262 U.S. 147, 148]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John Caldwell Myers, Asst. Dist. Atty., of New York City, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal is from an order of the District Court for the Southern District of New York discharging a rule nisi and \n\n[262 U.S. 147, 149]\n\u00a0\n refusing an injunction. On January 14th a petition in involuntary bankruptcy was filed against Elmore D. Dier and others, partners, as E. D. Dier & Co. Two days after the filing of the petition, Mandred Ehrich was appointed receiver of the estate of the alleged bankrupts, and they and their servants were directed to turn over all their property, assets, account books and records, and were restrained from suing out of any other court any process to impound or take possession of them. This order was complied with and the receiver took possession of the books and papers of the alleged bankrupts and of the firm. On February 16th, Dier informed the court that the district attorne of New York City had applied to the receiver for the production of these books and papers before the grand jury, and asked for the rule nisi against the receiver and the district attorney, and upon a hearing thereof an injunction to prevent the use of such books and papers against him before the grand jury, on the ground that they would incriminate him and that his right to refuse to testify against himself under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments would thus be violated by the process of the federal District Court. Judge Learned Hand, sitting in bankruptcy, discharged the rule and refused to enjoin the proposed use of the books. Judge Hand's action was based on the ruling of this court in Johnson v. United States, \n228 U.S. 457\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 572, 47 L. R. A. (N. S.) 263. He quoted the language used in the Johnson Case:\n'A party is privileged from producing the evidence, but not from its production.'\n\n He alluded to the circumstance that in the Johnson Case there were both title and possession in the trustee, whereas in this case the books and papers were in the hands of the receiver, who has no title; but that, he said, made no difference. We agree with this view, and hold that the right of the alleged bankrupt to protest against the use of his books and papers relating to his business as evidence against him ceases as soon as his possession \n\n[262 U.S. 147, 150]\n\u00a0\n and control over them pass from him by the order directing their delivery into the hands of the receiver and into the custody of the court. This change of possession and control is for the purpose of properly carrying on the investigation into the affairs of the alleged bankrupt and the preservation of his assets pending such investigation, the adjudication of bankruptcy vel non, and, if bankruptcy is adjudged, the proper distribution of the estate. It may be that the allegation of bankruptcy will not be sustained, and in that case the alleged bankrupt will be entitled to a return of his property, including his books and papers, and, when they are returned, he may refuse to produce them and stand on his constitutional rights. But while they are, in the due course of the bankruptcy proceedings, taken out of his possession and control, his immunity from producing them, secured him under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, does not inure to his protection. He has lost any right to object to their use as evidence because, not for purpose of evidence, but in the due investigation of his alleged bankruptcy and the preservation of his estate pending such investigation, the control and possession of his books and papers relating to his business were lawfully taken from him.\n It is pressed upon us that the bankrupt may prevent the use of such books and papers taken over by a receiver in the bankruptcy proceedings for evidence in a criminal case in the state court by resisting surrender and protesting against their use for such a purpose at the time the receiver took possession. But we think the alleged bankrupt has no such right. We so held in Matter of Fuller, \n262 U.S. 91\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 496, 67 L. Ed. --, decided April 30, 1923, in which it was sought to attach conditions of this kind to the turning over of the books and papers of a bankrupt to the trustee in bankruptcy. We are of opinion that the same principle must apply to the delivery of the books and papers relating to the bankrupt's business and property included in the estate into the custody of the receiver of the bankruptcy court. \n\n[262 U.S. 147, 151]\n\u00a0\n Of course, where such books and papers are in the custody of the bankruptcy court, they cannot be taken therefrom by subpoena of a state court, except upon consent of the federal court. In granting or withholding that consent, the latter exercises a judicial discretion dependent on the circumstances, and having due regard to the comity which should be observed toward state courts exercising jurisdiction within the same territory. Ponzi v. Fessenden, \n258 \nU.S. 254, 259\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 309, 22 A. L. R. 879. All we hold here is that, the court below having exercised discretion to allow the use of the books and papers in the custody of its officer upon subpoena by another court, the alleged bankrupt's rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments have not been violated.\n Order affirmed. \n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDIRECTOR GENERAL OF RAILROADS v. KASTENBAUM(1923)\nNo. 39\nArgued: Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. Thomas R. Wheeler, of Buffalo, N. Y., for petitioner.\n Mr. Israel G. Holender, of Buffalo, N. Y., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court. \n\n[263 U.S. 25, 26]\n\u00a0\n Respondent brought an action in the Supreme Court of Erie county, New York, against the Director General of Railroads, seeking damages for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. The trial court, at the close of the plaintiff's case, dismissed the cause of action for malicious prosecution, but allowed the trial to proceed to verdict and judgment for $ 500 for false imprisonment. The judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court and a motion for leave to appeal was denied by the Court of Appeals of the state.\n The brief for petitioner on the merits states the single question to be:\n Does an action for false arrest lie against the petitioner, an officer of the United States government, under the provisions of section 10 of the Act of Congress of March 21, 1918 (40 Stat. c. 25, p. 451 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4 j]), providing for federal control of carriers?\n Twenty-one tubs of butter were taken from a freight car of the Lehigh Valley Railroad in Buffalo. A trolley car of that city, late at night, collided with a horse and wagon, and in the wreck which followed the stolen tubs of butter were discovered. Two men who had been driving the wagon escaped. The detective force of the railway company sought to discover the owner of the horse, and thought they had traced the ownership to Kastenbaum, who was a huckster. The railroad detective notified the police authorities of the city, who detailed two policemen to accompany him to Kastenbaum's house, where they arrested him without warrant. They took him to a police station, and kept him there overnight and until he was released the next day on bail. He was brought to a hearing before an examining magistrate on a charge of grand larceny and burglary. After four or five adjournments, at the instance of the prosecution, the magistrate discharged Kastenbaum. His horse proved to be one of another color. Under the charge of the court \n\n[263 U.S. 25, 27]\n\u00a0\n the jury were permitted to return only compensatory damages.\n Section 10 of the Federal Control Act provides:\n'That carriers while under federal control shall be subject to all laws and liabilities as common carriers, whether arising under state or federal laws or at common law, except in so far as may be inconsistent with the provisions of this act or any other act applicable to such federal control or with any order of the President. Actions at law or suits in equity may be brought by and against such carriers and judgments rendered as now provided by law; and in any action at law or suit in equity against the carrier, no defense shall be made thereto upon the ground that the carrier is an instrumentality or agency of the federal government.'\n\n By General Order No. 50, the executive so limited suits to be brought against carriers for injuries to person or property under the section as to exclude those for recovery of fines, penalties and forfeitures.\n As we said in Missouri v. Ault, \n256 \nU.S. 554, 563\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 593, 597 (65 L. Ed. 1087):\n'The government undertook as carrier to observe all existing laws; it undertook to compensate any person injured through a departure by its agents or servants from their duty under such law; but it did not undertake to punish itself for any departure by the imposition upon itself of fines and penalties or to permit any other sovereignty to punish it.'\n\n The action for false imprisonment is in the nature of a trespass for a wrong or illegal act in which the defendant must have personally participated directly or by indirect procurement. The gist of it is an unlawful detention, and, that being shown, the burden is on the defendant to establish probable cause for the arrest. The want of probable cause, certainly in the absence of proof of guilt or conviction of the plaintiff, is measured by the state of \n\n[263 U.S. 25, 28]\n\u00a0\n the defendant's knowledge, not by his intent. It means the absence of probable cause known to the defendant when he instituted the suit. But the standard applied to defendant's consciousness is external to it. The question is not whether he thought the facts to constitute probable cause, but whether the court thinks they did. Holmes on the Common Law, 140. Probable cause is a mixed question of law and fact. The court submits the evidence of it to the jury, with instructions as to what facts will amount to probable cause if proved. Stewart v. Sonneborn, \n98 U.S. 187\n, 194; Pollock on Torts (8th Ed.) 225; 1 Cooley on Torts (3d Ed.) p. 321. Counsel for petitioner contends that in an action against the sovereign government, it must be conclusively presumed that good faith existed upon its part so far as it is responsible for the arrest, and therefore that a complete defense of probable cause on its part is always made out. But, as we have seen, good faith is not enough to constitute probable cause. That faith must be grounded on facts within knowledge of the Director General's agent, which in the judgment of the court would make his faith reasonable.\n The government under section 10, in a case of false imprisonment, stands exactly as if it were a railway corporation operating as a common carrier. Such a corporation would clearly be responsible for an arrest of the kind here shown, if without probable cause and made by one of its detectives employed to protect the property intrusted to its care as a common carrier. It is within the scope of the agency of such an employee to discover the perpetrators of crime against the property in order to recover it and to procure the arrest of supposed offenders and their prosecution and conviction in order to deter others from further depredations. If, in the field of such employment, the agent acts without probable cause and an illegal arrest without judicial warrant is made, the corporation \n\n[263 U.S. 25, 29]\n\u00a0\n is liable as for any other act of its agents within the scope of their employment in carrying on the business of a common carrier. Philadelphia, Washington & Baltimore Railway v. Quigley, 21 How. 202, 210; Genga v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co. (Mass.) 137 N. E. 637.\n We have not before us the question whether the Director General might be held for exemplary damages in a case like this under the restrictions of Order No. 50, as construed in the Ault Case, because, as already said, the court limited the recovery to compensatory damages.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","70":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDOUGLAS v. NOBLE(1923)\nNo. 159\nArgued: January 2, 1923Decided: February 19, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. Malcolm Douglas, of Seattle, Wash., and Lindsay L. Thompson, of Olympia, Wash., for appellants.\n Mr. C. E. Gates, of Seattle, Wash., for appellee. \n\n[261 U.S. 165, 166]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1893 the Legislature of Washington provided that only licensed persons should practice dentistry. It vested the authority to license in a board of examiners, consisting of five practicing dentists, and it required that persons desiring to practice should apply to that board and undergo examination before it. Every person of good moral character with a diploma from a reputable dental college was declared eligible, and, if he or she passed the examination, became entitled to a license. Laws of Washington 1893, c. 55. That statute, with amendments not here material ( Laws of 1901, c. 152), has since been continuously in force. It is now embodied in Remington's 1915 Code and Statutes of Washington,  8412-8425. The validity of the statute has been attacked on various grounds; and it has been repeatedly upheld by the highest court of the state. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n In 1921 Noble brought this suit in the federal court for the Western District of Washington to enjoin the King county p osecuting attorney from proceeding criminally against him for practicing dentistry without a license. Jurisdiction of that court was invoked solely on the ground that rights guaranteed plaintiff by the federal Constitution were being invaded. The bill charged that these were violated, both because the licensing statute was void and because the board in administering it had exercised its power arbitrarily. The case was heard by three judges upon application for an interlocutory injunction \n\n[261 U.S. 165, 167]\n\u00a0\n under section 266 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243). It was admitted that plaintiff was of good moral character; that he had a diploma from a reputable dental college; that he had submitted himself to the dental board for examination; that he had been examined, but had not passed the examination; and that, although refused a license, he had persisted in practicing dentistry. The board denied, by its answer, that it had acted arbitrarily in refusing a license; and this charge does not appear to have been further insisted upon.\n Plaintiff rested his case solely on the claim that the statute violated the federal Constitution. It was conceded that a state may, consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment, prescribe that only persons possessing the reasonably necessary qualifications shall practice dentistry (Dent v. West Virginia, \n129 U.S. 114\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 231), and that the Legislature may, if consistent with the state Constitution, confer upon an administrative board the power to determine whether an applicant possesses the qualifications which the Legislature has declared to be necessary. The contention is that the statute purports to confer upon the board arbitrary power to exclude applicants from the practice of dentistry, and thus violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court held the act void on that ground, and issued a permanent injunction. Noble v. Douglas, 274 Fed. 672. Whether it erred in so holding is the only question presented for our consideration on this appeal.\n The argument is that, since the act does not state in terms what the scope and character of the examination shall be, arbitrary power is conferred upon the board to grant or withhold licenses. It is pointed out that the statute does not in terms direct that the examination shall relate to the appellants' qualifications to practice dentistry; that it does not prescribe the subjects upon which applicants shall be examined, or whether proficiency \n\n[261 U.S. 165, 168]\n\u00a0\n shall be determined by knowledge of theory or by requiring applicants to demonstrate skill with the tools and materials of the profession; that it does not provide whether the examination shall be oral or written, or what percentages of correct answers shall be required to pass the examination; and that it does not require the keeping of records of the proceedings which could be used for purposes of review.\n What authority the statute purports to confer upon the board is a question of construction. If it purported to confer arbitrary discretion to withhold a license, or to impose conditions which have no relation to the applicant's qualifications to practice dentistry, the statute would, of course, violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendament. Its construction is a question of state law. Since the case is here on appeal from a federal court, we must condider it. Darvis v. Wallace, \n257 U.S. 478\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 164. But in passing upon such questions we follow applicable decisions of the highest court of the state. Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley, \n164 \nU.S. 112, 154\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 56. The statutory provisions involved in the present case were construed 20 years ago by the Supreme Court of Washington in Re Thompson, 36 Wash. 377, 379, 78 Pac. 899, 2 Ann. Cas. 149. It was insisted there that the grant of the power to hold examinations was a delegation of arbitrary legislative power to the dental examiners. The court assumed that to delegate power to mak such rules was consistent with the Constitution of the state, and that the statute had conferred upon the board power to make rules. It declared that the board must have adopted rules 'in order to properly determine the good character of the applicant and the good standing of the college issuing his diploma, and to conduct the examinations upon subjects reasonably required in that profession.' And it held that, if there was an abuse of authority, the remedy is to review, by some appropriate proceeding, the conduct of the board, \n\n[261 U.S. 165, 169]\n\u00a0\n not to attack the validity of the act. Thus, the highest court of the state has construed this statute as not conferring arbitrary power upon the board in respect to the scope and character of the examination. The statute has been in force for 30 years. The correctness of the views expressed in Re Thompson do not appear to have been questioned by that court since. Under such circumstances, we should, even in the absence of controlling decision, decline to give the statute a construction which would render it void, unless compelled to do so by unequivocal language in the act. Knights Templars' Indemnity Co. v. Jarman, \n187 \nU.S. 197, 205\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 108. Obviously there is none of that character.\n The statute provides that the examination shall be before a board of practicing dentists, that the applicant must be a graduate of a reputable dental school, and that he must be of good moral character. Thus, the general standard of fitness and the character and scope of the examination are clearly indicated. Whether the applicant possesses the qualifications inherent in that standard is a question of fact. Compare Red 'C' Oil Co. v. North Carolina, \n222 \nU.S. 380, 394\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 152. The decision of that fact involves ordinarily the determination of two subsidiary questions of fact: The first, what the knowledge and skill is which fits one to practice the profession; the second, whether the applicant possesses that knowledge and skill. The latter finding is necessarily an individual one. The former is ordinarily one of general application. Hence it can be embodied in rules. The Legislature itself may make this finding of the facts of general application, and by embodying it in the statute make it law. When it does so, the function of the examining board is limited to determining whether the applicant complies with the requirements so declared. But the Legislature need not make this general finding. To determine the subjects of which one must have knowledge in order to be fit to practice \n\n[261 U.S. 165, 170]\n\u00a0\n dentistry, the extent of knowledge in each subject, the degree of skill requisite, and the procedure to be followed in conducting the examination- these are matters appropriately committed to an administrative board. Mutual Film Corporation v. Ohio Industrial Commission, \n236 \nU.S. 230, 245\n, 246 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 387, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 296. And a Legislature may, consistently with the federal Constitution, delegate to such board the function of determining these things, as well as the functions of determining whether the applicant complies with the detailed standard of fitness. Reetz v. Michigan, \n188 U.S. 505\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 390. That the scope of the discretion here granted to the examining board was well within the limits allowed by the federal Constitution, and that it is not to be presumed that powers conferred upon the administrative boards will be exercised arbitrarily, is settled by Lieberman v. Van de Carr, \n199 U.S. 552\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 144.\n Appellees relied upon Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 U.S. 356\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 1064. There the licensing board habitually exercised its power arbitrarily, and discrimination was practiced. Seattle v. Gibson, 96 Wash. 425, 165 Pac. 109, and State exrel. Makris v. Pierce, 113 Wash. 296, 193 Pac. 845, 12 A. L. R. 1428, strongly relied upon by appellees, are not inconsistent with In re Thompson. The ordinances involved in these later cases were construed by the state court to vest in the city officials an arbitrary discretion to grant or withhold, and to revoke, licenses. Whether the Constitution of the state permits delegation to the examining board of the power to ascertain and fix the essentials of fitness is wholly a state question. Welch v. Swasey, \n214 \nU.S. 91, 104\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 567; Bradley v. Richmond, \n227 \nU.S. 477, 482\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 318.

It refused to make the improvement as required by an ordinance; thereupon the city caused the work to be done and assessed the cost against it. The formality of the proceeding is not questioned.\n Recovery is resisted upon two grounds: (1) That the original contract under which the railway lines were constructed and operated exempts and corporation from liability to pave the roadbed. Constitution,  10, art. 1 . (2) That the assessment is excessive, unreasonable and wholly arbitrary and to enforce it would deprive plaintiff in error of property without due process of law and deny it the equal protection of the laws, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The original contract with the city is dated February 4, 1901, and the claim of exemption rests upon the following clause therein:\n'The said Durham Traction Company [now the Durham Public Service Company] whenever it shall be required so to do, shall cause its roadbed and track to be brought to surface grade at its own expense and costs, but nothing herein contained shall be construed to require said Durham Traction Company to pave its roadbed, but it shall be required to restore the roadbed to the condition in which it was it the time of laying said track, provided, however, that if the said city decides to put in or change its sewerage pipes on any of the streets of said city on which the tracks of said Durham Traction Company may be laid, the said city may require the said Durh m Traction Company to remove and replace at its own expense, the said tracks, for said purpose, and said city shall incur no liability for any delays or interruptions of the business or traffic of the said Durham Traction Company, caused thereby.'\n\n The court below held that while this contract imposes \n\n[261 U.S. 149, 152]\n\u00a0\n no liability for paving, neither does it grant exemption therefrom. And we agree with their conclusion. Such exemptions must plainly appear. The general rule is that doubts as to provisions in respect of them must be resolved in favor of the municipality or state. Cleveland Electric Ry. Co. v. Cleveland, \n204 \nU.S. 116, 130\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 202.\n Purporting to proceed under 'An act relating to local improvements in municipalities,' ratified by the General Assembly of North Carolina, February 27, 1915-chapter 56-the governing body of Durham by resolution provided for improving Main street and directed plaintiff in error to pave between and for 18 inches outside its tracks. The company refused to comply and the challenged assessment followed. Among other things the act of 1915 provides:\n'Sec. 4. Every municipality shall have power, by resolution of its governing body, upon petition made as provided in the next succeeding section, to cause local improvements to be made and to defray the expense of such improvements by local assessment, by general taxation, and by borrowing, as herein provided. ...\n\n'Sec. 6. ... If the resolution shall provide for a street improvement, it shall direct that any street railway company or other railroad company having tracks on the street or streets or part thereof to be improved shall make such street improvement with such material and of such a character as may be approved by the governing body, in that part of such street or streets or part thereof which the governing body may prescribe, not to exceed, however, the space between the tracks, the rails of the tracks, and eighteen inches in width outside of the tracks of such company, and that unless such improvement shall be made on or before a day specified in such resolution, the governing body will cause such improvement to be made: Provided, however, that where any such company shall occupy such street or streets under a franchise or contract which \n\n[261 U.S. 149, 153]\n\u00a0\n otherwise provided, such franchise or contract shall not be affected by this act, except in so far as this act may be consistent with the provisions of such franchise or contract. ...'\n\n By agreement of parties, the cause was tried without a jury and the court found the facts. Those so found and presently relied upon to show the arbitrary and unreasonable character of the assessment follow:\n That the section of Main street over which the assessment extends is 2.02 miles in length and including double tracks there are 2.65 miles of track on Main street; that there are 154 abutting property owners upon this portion of Main street; that the assessment against said company for paving Main street is $102,942.30 and against said 154 property owners is $89,909.56; that the value of the property of this defendant on Main street within the area which is directly affected by said paving is $100,000 and the assessed value of said abutting property is approximately $5,083,250 exclusive of the value of property on Main street not taxed.\n That the cost to the Traction Company of furnishing new rails and new cross-ties, of taking up and relaying its track on Main street and doing other work preparatory to the placing of the pavement upon Main street was $75,108.85, which has been paid by the Traction Company and which said outlay and expenditure was made at the order of the city of Durham; that during the twelve months ending May 31, 1921, the company's railway showed a loss of $17,388.73 of meeting the operating expense and allowance for depreciation and if the company is required to pay the paving assessment of the city of Durham as demanded, to wit, one-tenth of said assessment each year, with interest, then there will be an addition l expense of one-tenth of $ 102,942.30 plus interest and depreciation on same; that the gross earnings of said company from all sources for the year ending December \n\n[261 U.S. 149, 154]\n\u00a0\n 31, 1920, were approximately $540,000, the net earnings $147,000, the company having other valuable property and business not on Main street, including other railway not on Main street.\n The court below held the recited facts insufficient to show that the municipal authorities acted unreasonably or arbitrarily, and we are unable to say that this was error. Counsel concede that the Constitution of North Carolina reserves to the Legislature power to alter or repeal corporate charters; also that, in general, the Legislature either directly or through recognized governmental agencies may impose assessments for local improvements and prescribe the basis of apportionment. But the claim is that the Legislature undertook arbitrarily to direct plaintiff in error to pave more than one-third of the street, while the owners of more valuable property fronting thereon are required to pay out much less and are assessed upon the front-foot basis.\n Gast Realty & Investment Co. v. Schneider Granite Co., \n240 U.S. 55\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 254; Hancock v. City of Muskogee, \n250 U.S. 454\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 528; and Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Road Improvement District, \n256 U.S. 658\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 604-are cited in support of this insistence; but they do not go so far. The power of the Legislature to make reasonable classifications and to impose a different burden upon the several classes cannot be denied. There are obvious reasons for imposing peculiar obligations upon a railway in respect of streets occupied by its tracks. The facts and circumstances disclosed by the present record are not sufficient to justify us in overruling the judgment of the state court, which held that the assessment was not the result of arbitrary or wholly unreasonable legislative action.

C., for the United States.\n Mr. P. J. Farrell, of Washington, D. C., for appellee Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. Joseph E. Davies, of Washington, D. C., for appellee American Wholesale Lumber Ass'n.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought against the United States by an Illinois lumber concern in a federal court for Illinois to set aside as void an order entered by the Interstate Commerce Commission against carriers on February 11, 1922. The Commission and the American Wholesale Lumber Association-the petitioner in the proceedings before it-intervened in this suit as defendants. No carrier intervened. The plaintiffs had not been parties to the proceedings before the Commission, nor were they named in the order assailed. The United States moved to dismiss the bill on the ground that the plaintiffs had not shown such an interest in the subject matter as would entitle them to sue, and also for want of equity. The case was heard before three judges on application for a preliminary \n\n[263 U.S. 143, 145]\n\u00a0\n injunction. It was agreed that the hearing should be treated as a final hearing. The court sustained the motion of the United States and entered a final decree dismissing the bill. That decree is here on direct appeal under the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220 (Comp. St.  998).\n The essential facts are these: On October 20, 1919, the Director General of Railroads established a so-called penalty charge of $10 per car per day on lumber held at reconsignment points. \n1\n The declared purpose of the charge was 'to prevent undue detention of equipment under the present emergency.' The charge (in modified form) remained in force throughout the period of federal control, and thereafter it was continued by the carriers. \n\n[263 U.S. 143, 146]\n\u00a0\n In September, 1920, the American Wholesale Lumber Association instituted proceedings before the Commission to secure cancellation of this charge as being unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, unduly prejudicial, and without warrant in law. The transit car privilege, permitting storage in cars for a short period at reconsignment points, is deemed an essential of the business by its members who are largely jobbers, and have no lumber yards. Protests against cancellation of the charge were filed by some associations of lumber manufacturers and dealers who customarily ship direct from the mills to their own lumber yards and have little occasion to use this reconsignment privilege. The imposition of the penalty charge was a direct benefit to them, since it subjected the jobbers, their competitors, to a severe handicap, and to that extent curbed the activities of these rivals. After extensive hearings the Commission held that it was within the power of the Director General, and of carriers, to establish penalty charges in order to prevent undue detention of equipment by shippers, that conditions existing at the time had warranted the establishment of a penalty charge, and that the charge then imposed had not been shown to be unreasonable. But the Commission also found that conditions had changed; that at the time of its decision there was a large surplus of service cars, which left the retention of the penalty charge without justification; and that while present conditions continue it is and will be unreasonable. An order was entered requiring carriers 'to cease and desist ... until further order of the Commission' from collecting the charge. The report stated 'that our approval of the elimination of the charge at this time is based solely on existing conditions, and is not to be construed as an inhibition on the carriers to publish penalty charges in the future if and when conditions warrant.' American Wholesale Lumber Association v. Director General, as Agent, etc., 66 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 393, 395, 408. \n\n[263 U.S. 143, 147]\n\u00a0\n Plaintiffs are large manufacturers and dealers whose shipments are made mainly direct from the mills to destination. They claim that the order canceling the penalty charge infringes their rights both as shipper and as prospective carrier. As shipper they claim to be injured because the jobbers are relieved from the handicap of the penalty charge; and also because longer detention of the cars at reconsignment points (which cancellation of the charge encourages) will subject shippers to the danger of car shortage, whenever general business again becomes active. Their claim of injury as prospective carrier is this; Plaintiffs are constructing in connection with a mill in Mississippi a local railroad which will soon be ready for operation. Cars acquired by them for use on their own railroad will naturally move to connecting lines and may then, in the absence of a deterring penalty charge, be used, like other cars for temporary storage at reconsignment points; and the order of cancellation will encourage the use of plaintiff's cars for storage, whereas their only legal use is for transportation. In this way the order entered not only prevents 'the railroad from taking necessary steps to join the bulk of the lumber industry in suppressing the evil and dishonest practices' of jobbers, but prevents the railroads from charging an adequate rental (the penalty charge) for their equipment. The contention is that the order deprives railroads of the use of their property without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the federal Constitution to the detriment of plaintiffs who are interested in maintaining both a wholesome lumber business and effective transportation.\n The mere fact that plaintiffs were not parties to the proceedings in which the order was entered does not constitute a bar to this suit. For it is brought to set aside an order alleged to be in excess of the Commission's power. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Diffen baugh, \n\n[263 U.S. 143, 148]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 42, 49, 32 Sup. Ct. 22; Skinner & Eddy Corporation v. United States, \n249 U.S. 557\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 375. But plaintiffs could not maintain this suit merely by showing (if true) that the Commission was without power to order the penalty charges canceled. They must show also that the order alleged to be void subjects them to legal injury, actual or threatened. This they have wholly failed to do. It is not alleged that the carriers wish to impose such charges and, but for the prohibition contained in the order, would do so. For aught that appears carriers are well satisfied with the order entered. Cancellation of a charge by which plaintiffs' rivals in business have been relieved of the handicap theretofore imposed may conceivably have subjected plaintiffs to such losses as are incident to more effective competition. But plaintiffs have no absolute right to require carriers to impose penalty charges. Compare Interstate Commerce Commission v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry., \n218 \nU.S. 88, 111\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 651. Plaintiffs' right is limited to protection against unjust discrimination. For discrimination redress must be sought by proceedings before the Commission. Its findings already made, and the order entered, negative such claim in this connection. The correctness of those findings cannot be assailed here; among other reasons, because the evidence on which they were made is not before the court. Louisiana & Pine Bluff Railway Co. v. United States, \n257 U.S. 114\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 25.\n The further claims of plaintiffs are, if possible, even more unsubstantial. They fear that, by reason of the order, they may, in the future, suffer in times of car shortage through the greater use of cars for storage. They fear that the equipment to be used in connection with the railroad which they expect to operate, may be diverted, at some time in the future, from transportation uses. If their fears are realized it will be open to them to apply to the Commission for relief. As the plaintiffs \n\n[263 U.S. 143, 149]\n\u00a0\n do not show any interest which entitles them to sue, we have no occasion to consider either the power of carriers to impose the penalty charge or the power of the Commission to order its cancellation.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The penalty was made payable for each day or fraction thereof, but only for the period that cars loaded with lumber or other forest products were held for reconsignment beyond 48 hours after the hour at which free time began to run under the car demurrage rules. By these rules 24 hours free time is allowed before any charge is made for storage and detention of the car at the reconsignment point. National Car Demurrage Rules ( January, 1916) rule 2,  B, par. 2. The penalty charge is declared to be 'in addition to any existing demurrage and storage charges.' Sullivan Lumber Co., v. Great Northern Railway Co., 58 Interst. Com. Com'n, 110, 111. The then existing demurrage charges were $2 a day per car for the first four days after expiration of the free time; and $5 per day for the fifth day and each day thereafter. Compare Lowry Lumber Co. v. Director General, 58 Interst. Com. Com'n, 113, 59 Interst. Com. Com'n, 90; Wharton Steel Co. v. Director General, 59 Interst. Com. Com'n, 613. Besides these demurrage charges there is a charge for the reconsignment privilege of $3 per car when reconsignment instructions are received at the reconsignment point prior to the arrival of the car, and a charge of $7 per car when the instructions are received after the arrival of the car. Compare Reconsignment Case, 47 Interst. Com. Com'n, 560; Reconsignment Case No. 3, 53 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 455. Unlike the penalty charge, both demurrage charges and reconsignment charges are assessed upon shipments of all commodities. The demurrage charge is in part compensation to the carrier and in part a penalty to secure the release of equipment and tracks. Demurrage Charges, 25 Interst. Com.

MINNESOTA & ONTARIO PAPER CO.(1923)\nNo. 178\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[261 U.S. 45, 46]\n\u00a0\n This was a bill in equity charging the infringement of a patent and seeking an injunction, an accounting and damages. The patent, No. 845,224, issued to William Eibel, February 26, 1907. The application was filed August 22, 1906. The specifications de cribe the patent as for an improvement for Fourdrinier machines for paper making, and say that 'it has for its object to construct and arrange the machine whereby it may be run at a very much higher speed than heretofore and produce a more uniform sheet of paper which is strong, even and well formed.' The contention of the plaintiff, the petitioner here, is that his improvement was an important step in the art of paper making, and increased the daily product from 20 to 30 per cent.\n The patent was held void by the District Court for the Western District of New York in the Case of Eibel Process Co. v. Remington-Martin Co., 226 Fed. 766 (1914). On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the decree of dismissal in the District Court, sustained the patent, and found infringement of claims Nos. 1, 2 and 3, but did not pass upon claims Nos. 7, 8 and 12. 234 Fed. 624, 148 C. C. A. 390 (1916). The bill in the present case was filed in the District Court for Maine, January 1, 1917. That court in 1920 held the patent valid and entered a decree of injunction and for damages. 267 \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 47]\n\u00a0\n Fed. 847. On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed the decree and directed the dismissal of the bill, 274 Fed. 540 ( 1921). Because of the conflict in the two circuits, certiorari was granted to review the latter decree.\n The Fourdrinier machine has for many years been well known and most widely used for making news print paper. Its main feature is an endless wire cloth sieve passed over a series of rolls at a constant speed. The sieve known as the 'wire' is woven with 60 or 70 meshes to the inch. It may be 70 feet or more in length, and is often more than 100 inches in width. Its working surface, with the total length of 70 feet, is about 30 feet; the rest being taken up in the return of the wire underneath. At what is called the 'breast roll,' at one end of the machine, there is discharged upon the wire, from a flow box or pond, a constant stream of papermaking stock of fibers of wood pulp mixed with from 135 to 200 times their weight of water of the consistency and fluidity of diluted milk. As this stream moves along the wire, the water drains through its meshes and the fibers are deposited thereon. The process is stimulated by a device to shake the wire with constant and rapid sidewise thrusts, forward and back, which insures the proper interlocking and felting of the stock as it progresses; the water continuing to drain from it. At the end of the surface length of the wire, the stock reaches what are called the 'couch rolls,' between which it is pressed, and then in the form of a sheet of uniformly distributed pulp, felted sufficiently to hold together, it leaves the wire and is carried through a series of rolls or calendars by which the sheet is pressed and dried, and from which it emerges to be rolled up as finished paper.\n In the flow box, or 'pond,' where the stream of pulp stock is stored, there is a gate or door, forming the end of the flow box, called the 'slice,' by lifting which the stock \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 48]\n\u00a0\n is given the opportunity to flow upon the wire. The stream thus issuing is given a width of the desired sheet of paper and a depth regulated by the height to which the slice is lifted. The stream on the wire is prevented from flowing off the sides by 'deckle straps,' which are thick rubber bands, resting on each side of the wire at each side of the pulp. Traveling with the wire, they form lateral walls confining the stock till it is too dry to flow. Between the breast roll, where the stream of liquid stock strikes the wire, and the couch rolls, at the end of the surface length of the wire, there is a series of parallel horizontal rolls supporting the wire, called table rolls, and 20 feet from the breast roll there are placed, under the wire and in contact with it, three suction boxes in succession, in which a partial vacuum is maintained, and through them is sucked out the greater part of the water remaining in the wet sheet of the pulp. Placed above the wire, and just beyond the first suction box, is what is called the 'dandy roll,' which is faced with wire cloth. Its office is to impress the upper surface of the forming sheet of paper and give it a texture similar to that which the lower surface of the paper has from its contact with the wire. It may also carry the design which is to give the watermark to the sheet, if such a mark is desired. Beyond this is a larger roll, called the 'guide roll,' arranged with an automatic device varying its axis, so as to keep the wire straight. From the guide roll the wire drops below the plane to the couch rolls, already referred to.\n These machines are very large, some of them weighing more than 1,000, 000 pounds, and their cost will range as high as $125,000. They are run night and day, in order that the capital invested in them may yield a proper return. Speed, which increases production, is therefore of the highest importance. Eibel's patent had for its avowed purpose of increase of this speed. \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 49]\n\u00a0\n Eibel says in his specifications:\n'My invention is embodied, essentially, in the first part or element of the machine having the Fourdrinier wire or paper-making wire, and consists in causing the stock to travel by gravity in the direction of movement of the making wire and approximately as fast as the making wire moves, thereby resulting in a 'gravity feed' for the machine. The stock may be and preferably is caused to travel more rapidly than the normal or usual speed of the making wire for a certain grade of stock, and means are provided for increasing the speed of the machine, so as to cause the making wire to move at a higher rate of speed than usual, being substantially equal to the speed of the rapidly moving stock. To accomplish this result in a simple manner, the breast roll end of the paper-making wire is maintained at a substantial elevation above the level, thereby providing a continuous downwardly moving paper-making wire, and the declination thus given to the wire is such that the stock is caused to travel by gravity in the direction of the movement of the wire and substantially as fast as the wire moves. The declination of the paper- making wire may be adjustable, or the speed of the wire may be variable, or both the declination and speed of the wire may be adjustable, in order that the velocity produced by gravity in the stock on the declining wire will approximately equal the speed of the wire. By this arrangement the speed of the machine may be increased to such an extent as to bring the speed of the making wire up to the maximum velocity of the rapidly moving stock and a strong, even, and wellformed sheet produced, which is more uniform than usual.'\n\n Two figures accompany the specifications of the Eibel patent. Figure No. 1 shows the wire of the Fourdrinier machine in outline from the breast roll to the guide and couch rolls, with a screw device for raising and lowering \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 50]\n\u00a0\n the breast roll and wire from the horizontal. The outline shows an elevation of the breast roll and wire, so that the angle between the wire and the horizontal at the guide roll is about 4 per cent., which in a surface length of 30 feet would mean an elevation of 12 inches at the breast roll. The other figure, No. 2, shows a device for regulating the speed of the wire applied at the lower couch roll.\n Again the patentee says:\n'For the purpose of increasing the speed of the machine to the maximum I maintain the breast roll end of the making wire at a high elevation above the level, so that the stock travels by gravity much faster than the making wire ordinarily runs for a certain grade of stock, and I then increase the speed of the machine to such extent as to bring the rate of speed of the making wire up to the speed of the rapidly moving stock, and as a result the capacity of the machine is largely increased.\n\n'I find in practice that by providing a gravity feed operating substantially as herein described, the stock runs smoothly and evenly without wavin or rippling, nd the fibers are thereby permitted to settle with great uniformity as regards their distribution over the wire, so that the paper in addition to being well formed is very uniform. Furthermore, as the stock is moving with the paper-making wire, instead of being moved by the wire, or essentially by the wire, the formation of the paper will begin at the start, and will continue to the end of the travel of the stock with the wire.'\n\n The claims in question are:\n\n 1. \nA Fourdrinier machine, having the breast roll end of the paper- making wire maintained at a substantial elevation above the level, whereby the stock is caused to travel by gravity, rapidly in the direction of movement of the wire, and at a speed approximately equal to the speed of the wire, substantially as described.\n\n 2. \nA Fourdrinier machine having the breast roll end of the paper- making wire maintained at a high elevation, \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 51]\n\u00a0\n whereby the stock is caused to travel by gravity faster than the normal speed of the wire for a certain grade of stock, and having means for increasing the speed of the machine to cause the wire to travel at substantially the same rate of speed as the rapidly-moving stock, substantially as described.\n\n 3. \nA Fourdrinier machine having the paper-making wire declined from the breast roll to the guide roll, the breast roll end of the wire being maintained at a substantial elevation above the level, whereby the stock is caused to travel by gravity, rapidly, in the direction of movement of the wire and at a speed approximately equal to the speed of the wire, substantially as described.\n\n 7. \nA Fourdrinier machine having the paper-making wire declined from the breast roll to the guide roll, and the suction boxes supported at a corresponding declination, substantially as described.\n\n 8. \nA Fourdrinier machine having the paper-making wire declined from the breast roll to the guide roll, and the several suction boxes arranged at different elevations, substantially as described.\n 12. In a Fourdrinier machine, a downwardly moving paper-making wire, the declination and speed of which are so regulated that the velocity of the stock down the declining wire, caused by gravity, is so related to the velocity of the wire in the same direction, that waves and ripples on the stock are substantially avoided and the fibers deposited with substantial uniformity on the wire, substantially as described.\n Messrs. Frederick P. Fish and Harrison F. Lyman, both of Boston, Mass ., for petitioner.\n Mr. Amasa C. Paul, of Minneapolis, Minn., for respondent. \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 52]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The evidence in the case establishes that, before Eibel entered the field, continued high speeds in the wire of the Fourdrinier machine much beyond 500 feet a minute resulted in defective paper. Eibel concluded that this was due to the disturbance and ripples in the stock as it was forming at a point between the breast roll and the first suction box, caused by the fact that at that point the wire was traveling much faster than the stock, and that if at that point the speed of the flowing stock could be increased approximately to the speed of the wire, the disturbance and rippling in the stock would cease, and the defects would disappear from the paper product. Accordingly he proposed to add to the former speed of the stock by substantially tilting up the wire and giving the stock the added force of the down hill flow. He thought that as long as he could thus maintain equality of speed between stock and wire at the crucial point, and prevent the disturbance and rippling there, a further increase in the speed of the wire would not result in a defective product. He confirmed this by actual trial.\n The first and most important question is whether this was a real discovery of merit. The Circuit Court of Appeals thought not. The prior art and the obvious application of the principle that water will run down hill in their opinion robbed it of novelty or discovery. The issue is one larg ly of evidence.\n The plaintiff below introduced the patent and some evidence of infringement, and a single expert to explain the discovery and invention, and rested. Then the defendant brought in a mass of evidence to show prior discovery and use, to impeach the utility of plaintiff's alleged invention, and to demonstrate the indefiniteness of specification and claims. The fact that the adjudication of the \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 53]\n\u00a0\n validity of the patent would impose a royalty on many of the paper manufacturers of the country who were not already licensees of the plaintiff led to the defendant's sending a circular letter to awaken the interest and secure the help of all so situated. This, as the record shows, had the effect to invoke offers of testimony on the critical points in the case from the unlicensed part of the trade. The plaintiff introduced a few witnesses in rebuttal as to particular details and the same expert as in chief. The plaintiff's case as presented on the record is largely the presumption of validity and novelty attaching to the patent and such evidence as comes from defendants' witnesses. A case that can be made out in all its elements by cross-examination of opposing witnesses is a strong case. Implication of facts and conditions falling from the mouths of witnesses when only collateral to the exact point of inquiry for which they are called is generally the most trustworthy evidence because the result of the natural, so to say, subconscious adherence to truth uninfluenced by a knowledge or perception of the bearing of the implication on the ultimate issue in the case.\n A thorough examination of the whole voluminous record produces a satisfying conviction first that for years news print paper makers and manufacturers of paper-making machinery were engaged in seeking a method of increasing the speed of the news print machines, and that they had succeeded by improving the stock and by strengthening the parts in bringing the speed of the wire and the delivered paper up to between 500 and 600 feet a minute, but that when these high speeds were attained and maintained for any length of time, though they served to enable manufacturers to advertise such maximums, their continued and regular operation showed defects in the paper, which were only overcome by a reduction of speed to something less than 500 feet. As against advertisement, and the exuberant \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 54]\n\u00a0\n memory of witnesses, the actual contemporaneous record of daily figures of production whenever brought to light justifies this conclusion. A leading manufacturer, one of the most enthusiastic witnesses on the subject of speed before Eibel produced a memorandum of a visit he made in October, 1904, less than two years before Eibel's application, to see the operation of a machine he had manufactured which he called 'the banner installation of the world' and made an entry in his diary, 'Grand sight-475 feet.' There is the usual unconscious straining of memory without written record carried back 10 or 15 years, but the evidence on the whole is satisfying that the practical speed for the regular production of good news print paper never much exceeded that speed which had gratified the pride of this witness. A typical case is in that of machines made by Bagley & Sewall, large manufacturers of paper-making machines for the Laurentide Paper Company. The president of Bagley & Sewall testified that the speed of the machine was 552 feet a minute with satisfactory paper, and that he visited Laurentide in October, 1904, and counted the revolutions himself. He produced a letter from Mr. Chahoon, of the Laurentide Company, of about the same date confirming his statement of the count and the satisfactory product and an advertisement of Bagley & Sewall to the same effect of January, 1905. In rebuttal, a monthly record of the work of the machine is produced by the foreman at Laurentide for this same machine from January, 1905 to December, 1906, showing the speed to vary from a maximum of 518 in 1905, to 475 in 1908, with a genera average of less than 500, and an explanation that the high speeds did not make a good product and were reduced. Our conclusion is confirmed, and indeed the importance of the issue of fact as to maximum speed before Eibel is minimized by the circumstance, uncontroverted, that the owners of these fastest machines, at once upon Eibel's publication \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 55]\n\u00a0\n of his discovery, adopted his pitch and increased their product.\n What Eibel tried to do was to enable the paper maker to go to 600 or 700 feet and above in speed and retain a good product. Did he do it? Eibel was the superintendent of a paper mill at Rhinelander, Wis. Before August, 1906, he raised the pitch of the wire from 2 or 3 inches to 12 inches, and greatly increased the speed, with a satisfactory product, and in that month he applied for a patent. The defendant's witnesses without exception refer to that disclosure as something that surprised and startled the paper-making trade. It spread, to use the expression of one witness, like wildfire. There were those who hesitated to take the venturesome step to give such an unheard-of pitch to the wire, and waited until others assumed the risk, but the evidence is overwhelming that witnin a short interval of a year or two all of the fast machines were run with wires at a pitch of 12 inches and that this pitch has been increased to 15 and 18, and even 24, inches; that the speed of the machines with satisfactory product has increased to 600, 650, and even 700 feet, with plans now even for 1,000 feet and that the makers of two-thirds of the print paper of the country are licensees of Eibel.\n Defendant attempts to break the effect of this evidence by showing that five of the largest paper manufacturers who are licensees of Eibel are also shareholders in the Eibel Process Company, the plaintiff, and that they make 2,200 tons of the 5,000 tons of paper made daily in the United States. This circumstance seems to have had influence with the Circuit Court of Appeals. There are, however, 10 other paper-making companies, not shareholders, who are licensees and use the Eibel pitch, and whose aggregate production is 1,200 tons a day; and what is equally significant, 13 other companies have contributed \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 56]\n\u00a0\n to a fund to help in resisting the establishment of the right of Eibel to claim a royalty for the use of this high or substantial pitch of the wire in the making of paper. Presumably they, too, find it wise to use the Eibel pitch. The paper makers in this country, who do not use the Eibel pitch, therefore, are few. It can hardly be that dividends on the shares of stock in the Eibel Company held by the five large companies would furnish motive enough for them to continue to be licensees, and to use something that was not of great advantage to them in their chief business of making of paper, and certainly no such motive would explain the action of the licensees, who are not stockholders, or that of the infringers, in continuing to use the Eibel pitch. It should be said that one of the large manufacturers of paper-making machinery called by the defendant said that since 1907 he had not installed a single machine without the Eibel pitch.\n The fact that the Eibel pitch has thus been generally adopted in the paper-making business, and that the daily product in paper making has thus been increased at least 20 per cent. over that which had been achieved before Eibel, is very weighty evidence to sustain the presumption from his patent that what he discovered and invented was new and useful. Of course, although very persuasive, it is not conclusive, and may be explained. This brings us to the consideration of the evidence of the prior art, and the contention of the defendant and the conclusion of the court below, that the step taken by Eibel, so far as he took one, was a mere obvious application of fully developed devices in the prior art.\n Eibel in his patent gives this measure of the prior art:\n'The Fourdrinier wire has usually been arranged to move in a horizontal plane, a though I am aware that means have been provided for adjusting the breast roll and of the wire to different elevations usually below the level, to provide for running with different grades of \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 57]\n\u00a0\n stock-as, for instance, with quick stock and slow stock; but so far as I am aware the making wire has always had to perform the work of drawing along the stock, and as the wire moved much faster than the stock the stock waved or rippled badly near the breast roll end of the wire, which gradually diminished until an equilibrium was established, and a smooth, even, glassy surface presented, and not until the waving or rippling ceased did the fibers lay down uniformly and produce a well-formed sheet of paper. The machine has been run necessarily at a slow rate of speed to give ample time for the water to escape and for the fibers to lay down, so as to make a uniform sheet, and in case the time was insufficient, the breast roll end of the wire has been lowered still further until the desired result was accomplished. In accordance with my invention I operate entirely above the level, to cause the stock to travel by gravity at a velocity approximately equal to the speed of the making wire, which I believe to be a new principle of operation.'\n\n It is important that the stock, when it reaches the 'dandy' roll beyond the first suction box of the machine, shall be, on the one hand, free enough of water to be a formed sheet and take an impression from the dandy roll, and on the other that it shall not be so dry that it will not retain the impression. Paper of such a heavy composition of fiber and water that it holds water long is said to be 'slow stock.' Paper of lighter and thinner composition, parting with water easily and drying quickly, is called 'quick stock.' Various means were adopted to give the stock the proper degree of dryness at the dandy roll, usually by adjustment of the composition of the stock. What Eibel describes in this reference was another means. It was not widely used, however. It was a slight depression or elevation in the wire at the breast roll, so that slow stock could be made to run up hill from the flow box to the dandy roll, lengthening the time of \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 58]\n\u00a0\n the movement, and thus giving more opportunity in its progress for the needed draining of the stock. On the other hand, fast or thin stock, from which the water flowed too easily, could be made to retain sufficient water by hastening its progress to the dandy roll by the downhill tilt of the wire. This tilt was obtained by raising the breast roll end of the wire, either by putting shimming blocks under that end of the machine or by special devices to be described. The sole object was greater or less drainage of stock for the dandy roll. The Eibel invention is distinguished from the prior art in two ways: First, in that the pitch of the wire was for a different purpose, to be accomplished, not at the dandy roll, some 20 or more feet from the breast roll, but at a point only 9 or 10 feet from there; and, second, by the fact that to achieve his purpose a high or substantial pitch must be given to the wire, while only a small or trivial pitch was needed for the drainage of the prior art. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n This difference in purpose and degree of pitch between Eibel's device and the prior art is quite clearly shown by reference to a patent granted to Barrett and Horne, assignors to J. H. Horne & Sons, one of the important manufacturers of paper machinery of the country, in 1899. Their specifications showed a device capable of elevating the breast roll less than 3 inches, and its sole purpose was for drainage. Their specifications say: \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 59]\n\u00a0\n 'In certain kinds of pulp, notably the wood pulp which is now largely used in making paper, the water drains away very rapidly, so that the pulp may become nearly dry before it leaves the shake frame, and thus not be properly laid when it reaches the rollers. This tendency may be obviated to a considerable extent by downwardly inclining the shake frame toward the rollers, so that the w ter tends to travel along with the pulp, and will not, therefore, drain out through the wire so rapidly, It is further desirable that the amount of inclination or slope should be variable, so as to adapt the machine for pulp of different kinds or grades.'\n The Bayliss Austin Machine, one of three chiefly relied on to show prior use, was made by the Horne Company and was designed by Barrett and Horne on the model of this patent. It is very clear, from an examination of the design and contract for this machine, that the pitch of the wire in it could not have exceeded 3 inches, and that it was used for drainage. Other patents were set up in defense; some of them showing devices for raising the breast roll and wire above the level, and lowering them below the level for the purpose of drainage. The angle of elevation and depression was always small. There was a constant straining by the witnesses for the defense to increase the elevation before Eibel. On the direct examination they began with a positive assertion that a pitch of 4, 5, and even 6 inches, had been used in certain machines before Eibel's time; but written records, contracts, and specifications brought out on cross-examination show nothing more than 3 inches provided for purpose of drainage, and not more than that was used. This is not to say that witnesses in the face of such records did not testify to a higher elevation; but in such cases the amount of elevation rested in memory running back more than 10 or 15 years, a memory stimulated by the subsequent high pitches of Eibel and the retrospect of the \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 60]\n\u00a0\n progress that now seems so easy and clear to every one. There was, too, always indefiniteness as to when such increase in elevation of the wire had taken place, whether before or after August, 1906, Eibel's date, and there was no evidence of weight, we think, after a full examination of the record, sufficient to justify a finding that such elevations had ever exceeded 3 inches before his application.\n This is confirmed by the fact that greater elevation was not needed for the purpose of drainage for which it was devised and used. It is true that some witnesses testify that they realized, before Eibel's application, that speeding up the stock to equal velocity with the wire would solve the difficulty and aid the speed. But there is not a single written record, letter, or specification of prior date to Eibel's application that discloses any such discovery by any one, or the use of the pitch of the wire to aid the speed of the mechine. The oral evidence on this point falls far short of being enough to overcome the presumption of novelty from the granting of the patent. The temptation to remember in such cases and the ease with which honest witnesses can convince themselves after many years of having had a conception at the basis of a valuable patent, are well known in this branch of law, and have properly led to a rule that evidence to prove prior discovery must be clear and satisfactory. Barbed Wire Patent Case, \n143 \nU.S. 275, 284\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 443; Loom Co. v. Higgins, \n105 U.S. 580\n, 591. Indeed, when we consider the indisputable fact that Eibel's successful experiment at Rhinelander and his application for a patent surprised the whole paper trade, and that for a short time many held back from risking so radical a change and then all adopted it, oral evidence that some persons had discovered the source of trouble and the means of remedying it some years before Eibel is incredible. We are confirmed in this conclusion by the finding of Judge Hale in the District Court, which is not \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 61]\n\u00a0\n offset by the reversal of his decree in the Circuit Court of Appeals, because that court seems to have reached its conclusion chiefly on other grounds yet to be considered.\n The defendant's counsel contend that the specifications of the Eibel patent require that the only force to be used in giving speed to the stock shall be the force of gravity created by the angle of down-hill inclin tion of the wire. They say that the patentee mentions no other means of acceleration, that he must be confined to this, and that a machine which uses other factors for this purpose does not infringe. We do not understand the Circuit Court of Appeals to go quite so far, but it does seem to give a construction requiring the force of gravity caused by the pitch of the wire to be the predominating cause of the increased speed of the stock. The factors of speed of the stock in such a machine, before the factor of pitch was applied to increase it, were the head or hydraulic pressure of the stock in the flow box behind the slice, imparting movement to it as it came out onto the wire under the lifted slice, and the carrying effect of the moving wire upon the fluid stock as it fell upon the wire and proceeded gradually to form into a web as the fibers were laid and the water drained.\n Many calculations were made by defendant's expert Carter, based on the laws of hydraulic pressure and flow, to show that, under varying conditions of head and pitch and the speed of the wire, the chief factor would be head, the next the 'drag' or carrying effect of the wire, and the least in degree and importance in making the velocity of the stock and the wire equal would be the pitch, and that Eibel's invention could not be present, because the 'drag' of the wire and its influence upon the speed of the stock must be eliminated under Eibel's specifications. We do not so understand it. As the stock descends upon the wire with the head of the flow box, it is thin and liquid, the wire at its greater speed necessarily imparts additional \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 62]\n\u00a0\n speed to the stock, and in its unformed fluidity the added speed does not disturb or ripple the stock to the injury of the process of paper making. It is only after the stock proceeds a third or a half of the surface length of the wire that the point is reached where the overspeed of the drag becomes troublesome in the felting or formation of the web of the pulp. Before that point is reached, the 'drag' may be useful in bringing the speed of the stock nearer to that of the wire without injury. The truth seems to be, and this is brought out with force in the testimony of the defendant's expert witness Livermore, that while it is possibel to calculate to a nicety the velocity of the free flowing liquid stock due to head and pitch, when unaffected by drainage, variation in viscosity and fluidity, and the like, yet, when these conditions are present, as they always are, and the other less calculable factor of the drag of the wire enters the problem, there is no means, short of actual experiment, to enable one to anticipate results, and it is quite impossible to apportion to each factor its real influence. This fact reflects on the question whether Eibel's discovery was invention rather than the mere obvious and simple application of known natural forces.\n The defendant introduced expert evidence to show that with a head of 2 1\/4 inches in the flow box and a speed of 585 feet to the minute in the wire, and excluding the factor of 'drag' of the wire, it would require an elevation of 48 inches to make up the difference in speed of the stock given by the head and the speed of the wire at a distance 10 feet from the point of discharge on the wire. The conclusion drawn from this seems to be that, as no practical machine uses 48 inches pitch, the Eibel invention has never been used or infringed. Disregarding its error in omitting necessary factors already adverted to, this reasoning seems to us to depend on too narrow a construction of the patent. \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 63]\n\u00a0\n In administering the patent law, the court first looks into the art, to find what the real merit of the alleged discovery or invention is, and whether it has advanced the art substantially. If it has done so, then the court is liberal in its construction of the patent, to secure to the inventor the reward he deserves. If what he has done works only a slight step forward, and that which he says is a discovery is on the border line between mere mechanical change and real invention, then his patent, if sustained, will be given a narrow scope, and infringement will be found only in approximate copies of the new device. It is this differing attitude of the courts toward genuine discoveries and slight improvements that reconciles the sometimes apparently conflicting instances of construing specifications and the finding of equivalents in alleged infringements. In the case before us, for the reasons we have already reviewed, we think that Eibel made a very useful discovery, which has substantially advanced the art. His was not a pioneer patent, creating a new art; but a patent which is only an improvement on an old machine may be very meritorious, and entitled to liberal treatment. Indeed, when one notes the crude working of machines of famous pioneer inventions and discoveries, and compares them with the modern machines and processes exemplifying the principle of the pioneer discovery, one hesitates in the division of credit between the original inventor and the improvers, and certainly finds no reason to withhold from the really meritorious improver, the application of the rule 'ut res magis valeat quam pereat,' which has been sustained in so many cases in this court. Winans v. Denmead, 15 How. 338, 341; Corning v. Burden, 15 How. 265, 269; Turrill v. Railroad Co., 1 Wall. 491, 510; Rubber Co. v. Goodyear, 9 Wall. 788, 795; McClain v. Ortmayer, \n141 \nU.S. 419, 425\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 76.\n Eibel was an avowed improver, not in the art of paper making generally, but upon a well-known and universally \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 64]\n\u00a0\n used machine. In that machine, the speed of the stock, which was the subject-matter of his improvement, had always been controlled by two factors, the head of the stock in the flow box, and the carrying effect of the under-moving wire. He says nothing in his specifications to exclude these factors; he merely adds another factor of speed to secure the equality of speed of the stock with the wire. He says:\n'For the purpose of increasing the speed of the machine to the maximum I maintain the breast roll end of the making wire at a high elevation above the level, so that the stock travels by gravity much faster than the making wire ordinarily runs for a certain grade of stock, and I then increase the speed of the machine to such an extent as to bring the rate of the making wire up to the speed of the rapidly moving stock, and as a result the capacity of the machine is largely increased.'\n\n We agree fully with Judge Hale in the District Court in his comment on this:\n'The process invented by him [Eibel] begins to operate after the stock has entered upon the wire. His apparent attempt was to get rid of bubbles and wrinkles, before he got to the place on the machine where the paper is formed. To do this, he allowed gravity to work with 'drag' and with 'head.' He harnessed all the elements he could find. He brought gravity in with the other elements, and so brought the speed of the stock up to equality with that of the wire. By this means he achieved high speed and also freed the stock on the wire from waves and ripples.' 267 Fed. 855.\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals questions the assumption that gravity was a new factor with Eibel, because the head of the flow box is only another application of the force of gravity. This is a mere criticism of a term, which, whether accurate or not, is not misleading. What Eibel was dealing with in his patent as a new factor was the additional \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 65]\n\u00a0\n force acquired by the pitch of the wire, and that he called gravity; and Judge Hale, in the passage quoted, uses the word with the same meaning, and without any confusion to the reader.\n We think, then, that the Eibel patent is to be construed to cover a Fourdrinier machine in which the pitch of the wire is used as an appreciable factor, in addition to the factors of speed theretofore known in the machine, in bringing about an a proximation to the equal velocity of the stock and the wire at the point where, but for such approximation, the injurious disturbance and ripples of the stock would be produced.\n The next objection to the patent, which prevailed in the Circuit Court of Appeals, is that its terms are too vague, because the extent of the factor of pitch is not defined, except by the terms 'substantial' and 'high.' The figure accompanying the specification and illustrating the improvement indicates an angle of 4 per cent., or an elevation of 12 inches, and the reference to the small elevations for drainage shown in earlier devices indicated that the patentee had in mind elevations substantial as compared with them, in order to achieve his purpose of substantially increasing the speed of the stock. It was difficult for him to be more definite, due to the varying conditions of speed and stock existing in the operations of Fourdrinier machines and the necessary variation in the pitch to be used to accomplish the purpose of his invention. Indefiniteness is objectionable, because the patent does not disclose to the public how the discovery, if there is one, can be made useful, and how its infringement may be avoided. We do not think any such consequences are involved here. This patent and its specifications were manifested to readers who were skilled in the art of paper making and versed in the use of the Fourdrinier machine. The evidence discloses that one, so skilled, had no difficulty, \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 66]\n\u00a0\n when his attention was called to their importance, in fixing the place of the disturbance and ripples to be removed, or in determining what was the substantial pitch needed to equalize the speeds of the stock and wire at that place. The immediate and successful use of the pitch for this purpose by the owners of the then fastest machines and by the whole trade is convincing proof that one versed in paper making could find in Eibel's specifications all he needed to know, to avail himself of the invention. Expressions quite as indefinite as 'high' and 'substantial,' in describing an invention or discovery, in patent specifications and claims, have been recognized by this court as sufficient. In Tilghman v. Proctor, \n102 U.S. 707\n, the claim sustained was for 'the manufacturing of fat acids and glycerine from fatty bodies by the action of water at a high temperature and pressure.' See, also, Rubber Co. v. Goodyear, 9 Wall. 788, 794; Mowry v. Whitney, 14 Wall. 620, 629; Lawther v. Hamilton, \n124 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 342; Carnegie Steel Co. v. Cambria Iron Co., \n185 \nU.S. 403, 436\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 698; Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Baldwin, \n245 \nU.S. 198, 205\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 104.\n It is contended on behalf of the defendant that, whether Barrett and Horne perceived the advantage of speeding up the stock to an equality with the wire, yet the necessary effect of their devices was to achieve that result, and therefore their machine anticipated Eibel. In the first place, we find no evidence that any pitch of the wire, used before Eibel, had brought about such a result as that sought by him, and, in the second place, if it had done so under unusual conditions, accidental results, not intended and not appreciated, do not constitute anticipation. Tilghman v. Proctor, \n102 U.S. 707\n, 711; Pittsburgh Reduction Co. v. Cowles Electric Co. (C. C.) 55 Fed. 301, 307; Andrews v. Carman, 13 Blatchford, 307, 323, Fed. Cas. No. 371.\n It is next objected that the alleged invention covers only a matter of degree in pitch, which cannot be the subject of a patent. The prior art showed the application \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 67]\n\u00a0\n of gravity by use of the pitch of the wire to the improvement of the Fourdrinier machine, and Eibel, it is said, merely increased degree of pitch and gravity for the same general purpose. We think this attack upon the patent cannot prevail. Eibel's high or substantial pitch was directed toward a wholly different object from that of the prior art. He was seeking thereby to remove the disturbance and ripples in the formation of the stock about 10 feet from the discharge, while the slight pitches of the prior art were planned to overcome the dryness in the formed web of the stock at double the distance from the discharge. It would seem that the greater speed of the stock produced by Eibel would make difficult the joint application of the principles of Eibel and Barrett and Horne, and that the function of adjusting the drainage for the dandy roll must be carried on by some of the other methods known to the art when Eibel's pitch is used. But, however this may be, the object of the one was entirely different from that of the other. Livermore, an expert witness called by the defendant, when asked the question whether the purpose of the Barrett and Horne patent had anything in common with the theory of the Eibel patent answered:\n'I should say not. It looks to me as if Barrett and Horne referred to the adjustment of inclination with one effect in mind, and that Eibel referred to like adjustment with another effect in mind. ... In this particular case, the two effects have, so far as I can see, no special correlation to one another, and an adjustment made with one effect in mind might or might not produce a desirable effect as to the other function or phenomenon.'\n\n In considering this phase of the controversy, we must not lose sight of the fact that one essential part of Eibel's discovery was that the trouble causing the defective paper product under high machine speed was in the disturbance and ripples some 10 feet from the discharge, and that \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 68]\n\u00a0\n they were due to the unequal speeds of stock and wire at that point and could be removed by equalizing the speeds. The invention was not the mere use of a high or substantial pitch to remedy a known source of trouble. It was the discovery of the source not before known, and the application of the remedy, for which Eibel was entitled to be rewarded in his patent. Had the trouble which Eibel sought to remedy been the well-known difficulty of too great wetness or dryness of the web at the dandy roll, and had he found that a higher rather than a lower pitch would do that work better, a patent for this improvement might well have been attacked on the ground that he was seeking monopoly for a mere matter of degree. But that is not this case. On the other hand, if all knew that the source of the trouble Eibel was seeking to remedy was where he found it to be, and also knew that increased speed of the stock would remedy it, doubtless it would not have been invention on his part to use the pitch of the wire to increase the speed of the stock, when such pitch had been used before to do the same thing, although for a different purpose and in less degree. We cannot agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the causal connection between the unequal speeds of the stock and the wire, and the disturbance and rippling of the stock, and between the latter and the defective quality of the paper in high speeds of the machine, was so obvious that perception of it did not involve discovery which will support a patent. The fact that in a decade of an eager quest for higher speeds this important chain of circumstances had escaped observation, the fact that no one had applied a remedy for the consequent trouble until Eibel, and the final fact that, when he made known his discovery, all adopted his remedy, leave no doubt in our minds that what he saw and did was not obvious, and involve discovery and invention.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals dwells on the fact that the use of the pitch of wire was not really the introduction \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 69]\n\u00a0\n of a new factor in the solution of the problem, because the same result would have followed if the head of the flow box had been made greater, in order increase by gravity the speed of the stock. Doubtless this could have been done. There were difficulties, however, in such a method, when Eibel's application was filed, because in the then machines the flow box as supported by an apron over the wire, and the necessary addition to the weight of the stock in the flow box, in increasing the head. Would have interfered with the free working of the wire. Since that time an improvement has been adopted, by which the flow box does not rest on the wire, and additional head can be imparted to the stock. The defendant invites attention to the fact that one or two paper makers are increasing this head and giving up the pitch, for the purpose of increasing the speed of the stock. We do not see that these circumstances in any way affect the validity of the Eibel patent. If defendant or others can do what Eibel accomplished in another way, and by means he did not include in his specifications and claims, i. e., by additional head and the abandonment of a substantial pitch, they are at liberty to do so and avoid infringement.\n We come finally to the question of infringement. If the Eibel patent is to be construed as we have construed it, there can be no doubt that the defendant uses the Eibel invention. The device which the defendant uses for tilting the wire-i. e., by shimming blocks-and that for regulating and increasing the speed of the wire are plainly equivalents of the same elements in the new combination, which Eibel shows in his drawings and specifications. The defendant uses a Fourdrinier machine having the breast roll end of the paper-making wire maintained at an elevation of 15 inches above the level whereby the stock is caused to travel by gravity rapidly in the direction of the movement of the wire, and at a speed approximately \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 70]\n\u00a0\n equal to the speed of the wire substantially as described. This brings the defendant's machines within the first claim of the patent, if 15 inches is a substantial elevation of the making wire, as all the witnesses concede that it is. The same conclusion must be reached as to the second claim, because the defendant uses a machine 'having the breast roll end of the paper making wire maintained at a high elevation, whereby the stock is caused to travel by gravity faster than the normal speed of the wire for a certain grade of stock, and having means for increasing the speed of the machine to cause the wire to travel at substantially the same rate of speed as the rapidly moving stock, substantially as described.' The same thing is true of the third claim.\n Question has been made whether these three claims are for a machine or a process. We think they are claims for a machine, i. e., for an improvement on a machine, and that the devices for such improvement, to wit, the elevation by a screw or other equivalent method, and the control of the speed of the wire, are shown by the specifications and the figures, together with a sufficient description of their operation.\n The seventh and eighth claims are for the same improvement, with the suction boxes changed from their usual position in the unimproved machine, to make them effectively function on the pitched wire. They are machine claims, and are infringed by the defendant. Their new adjustment is part of a new combination, and the words 'substantially as described' limit them to a combination including the elements included in the first three claims.\n Claim No. 12 is as follows:\n'12. In a Fourdrinier machine, a downwardly moving paper-making wire, the declination and speed of which are so regulated that the velocity of the stock down the declining wire, caused by gravity, is so related to the \n\n[261 U.S. 45, 71]\n\u00a0\n velocity of the wire in the same direction that waves and ripples on the stock are substantially avoided and the fibers deposited with substantial uniformity on the wire, substantially as described.'\n\n This comes nearer to being a process claim, but, whether it is or not, the defendant infringes it.\n The evidence discloses that, after the suit was brought, the defendant reduced the pitch of one of its machines to 6 inches, and the contention of defendant is that the machine ran as well and gave as good results as when its pitch was 15 inches. We are not called upon to decide whether this contention can be sustained, because the reduction was after the bill was filed. It may be noted, however, that the admissions of witnesses seem to show that this reduction was made for purposes of the suit, and that, immediately after the defendant won the suit in the Circuit Court of Appeals, it restored the pitch of this machine to 15 inches, and, when the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals proved not to be final, the wire was lowered again to a 6-inch pitch. Much evidence was taken, and much discussion has followed, upon the point whether a 6-inch pitch, accomplishing in whole or in part what Eibel sought to do, would infringe a patent for a substantial pitch. We do not find it necessary to pass definitely on the question, because it is not before us on the record, though we cannot prevent the natural inferences upon this point to be drawn from the conclusions we have reached.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, dismissing the bill, is reversed, and the decree of the District Court is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It is true that defendant's expert, Carter, points out that in some of the machines of the prior art, in which means were provided for tilting up the wire, the tilting was confined to that part of the surface length covered by the shake frame, say 18 feet, and did not extend to the first suction box; whereas, Eibel's tilting involved the entire surface length of 30 feet. It would follow from this that the elevation of 3 inches in such machines would mean a greater angle of declination than 3 inches for the full surface length and that the disparity between 3 inches and 12 inches was not so great as the figures would lead one to think. But, whatever difference this might make, the fact remains that Eibel's pitch was substantially greater than anything in the prior art. \n\n\n\n\n","74":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nESSGEE CO. OF CHINA v. U S(1923)\nNo. 706\nArgued: Decided: May 7, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 151, 152]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. M. K. Olcott and A. A. Silberberg, both of New York City, for plaintiffs in error and appellants.\n Messrs. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., C. H. Byrnes, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Francis A. McGurk, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are appeals and writs of error to review the action of the District Court in denying petitions of the two companies, the Essgee Company of China and the Hanclaire Trading Corporation, praying that the books and papers produced by an officer of the two companies, in response to a duces tecum issued to them by order of the federal grand jury, be returned to the petitioners, on the ground that the process issued and the detention of the books by the government were and are in violation of their rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the federal Constitution.\n Both appeals and writs of error were allowed in these case . This was unnecessary. The review sought is of an order of the District Court in a special proceeding in \n\n[262 U.S. 151, 153]\n\u00a0\n which no jury can intervene. It likens itself in its appellate character to a review of cases in equity or in admiralty or of an order upon a writ of habeas corpus in which issues of facts are triable to the court, and in which the review may properly involve a re-examination by the reviewing court of the whole record and of the findings of the court upon both the law and the evidence therein. Since the passage of the Act of September 6, 1916, entitled an act to amend the Judicial Code (39 Stat. 726, c. 448,  4 [Comp. St.  1649a]), which provides that no court having power to review a judgment or decree passed by another shall dismiss a writ of error solely because an appeal should have been taken, or dismiss an appeal because a writ should have been sued out, but that when such mistake of error occurs, it shall disregard the same and take the action which would be appropriate if the proper appellate procedure had been followed, the distinction is not important from the standpoint of the jurisdiction of this court. In the interest, however, of orderly procedure, economy in time of both courts, and in the making up and printing of the record, counsel should make every effort to select the proper procedure in review and not duplicate methods out of an abundant caution which the act of 1916 makes unnecessary.\n The Hanclaire Trading Corporation and the Essgee Company of China were organized under the laws of New York and were doing an importing business in New York City. Schratter was an officer in both companies and Kramer was an officer of one and attorney for both. The federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York was investigating charges of frauds in importations by these two companies whose interests and transactions were intermingled. On October 14, 1921, a subpoena duces tecum was served upon each of the corporations by personal service upon Schratter as a chief officer thereof. Schratter then directed Kramer to gather together the \n\n[262 U.S. 151, 154]\n\u00a0\n books and papers called for and produce them at the federal court house. The subpoena was served by the United States marshal for the District. He was accompanied by three other government officials, who, it was charged, without authority examined and took away to the court house other books and papers not included in the list set forth in the duces tecum. This incident was made an issue in the affidavits; but it is evident from reading the record and the admission of counsel that we are not concerned with any such records and papers, but only with those which were produced by Kramer for the two companies in response to the duces tecum. Schratter in his affidavit and petition claims that under the subpoena some papers belonging to him individually were taken, but an examination of the list of records and papers produced, shows that the only personal paper produced by Kramer was the personal tax return of Schratter, which he does not assert was in any way relevant to the charges, or in any degree incriminating as to him. Kramer and Schratter brought the records and papers called for by the subpoena to a room in the court house and deposited them on a table where the district attorney found them and took charge of them. Neither Schratter nor Kramer was then called before the grand jury, but they were both at once arrested upon warrants for violation of the importing laws. They testified that they did not see the district attorney when he took the records and papers and that Kramer demanded a return of them and protested against their detention. Evidence to the contrary is offered by the government witnesses, cut we do not regard the issue as material.\n The next day, October 15, 1921, Schratter appeared before Judge Knox and applied for permission to go abroad in order to attend to business of vital personal importance. Schratter remained abroad until June, 1922, and on the 9th of that month appeared to plead to an indictment \n\n[262 U.S. 151, 155]\n\u00a0\n which had in the meantime been found against the two corporations and himself. Meantime, Kramer, after much solicitation on his part, was given an opportunity to testify to the grand jury and to present to them other records and papers which he voluntarily produced. He was not indicted. After Schratter's return and Kramer's escape from indictment, the two corporations and Schratter filed the petition, denial of which by the District Court is now before us for review.\n The books and papers brought before the grand jury and the court in this case were the books, records and papers of corporations of the state of New York. Such corporations do not enjoy the same immunity that individuals have, under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, from being compelled by due and lawful process to produce them for examination by the state or Federal Government. Referring to the books and papers of a corporation, Mr. Justice Hughes speaking for this court in Wilson v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 361, 382\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 538, 545 (55 L. Ed. 771, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 558), said:\n'They have reference to business transacted for the benefit of the group of individuals whose association has the advantage of corporate organization. But the corporate form of business activity, with its charter privileges, raises a distinction when the authority of government demands the examination of books. That demand, expressed in lawful process, confining its requirements within the limits which reason imposes in the circumstances of the case, the corporation has no privilege to refuse. It cannot resist production upon the ground of selfcrimination. Although the object of the inquiry may be to detect the abuses it has committed, to discover its violations of law and to inflict punishment by forfeiture of franchises or otherwise, it must submit its books and papers to duly constituted authority when demand is suitably made. This is involved in the reservation of the visitatorial power of the state, and in the \n\n[262 U.S. 151, 156]\n\u00a0\n authority of the national government where the corporate activities are in the domain subject to the powers of Congress.'\n\n Hale v. Henkel, \n201 U.S. 43\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 370, and Wheeler v. United States, \n226 U.S. 478\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 158, are to the same point.\n Counsel for appellants rely upon Silverthorne Lumber Co., Inc., v. United States, \n251 U.S. 385\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 182, but it has no application to the case before us. The Silverthorne Case was a writ of error to reverse a judgment for contempt against a corporation for refusal to obey an order of the court to produce books and documents of the company to be used to show violation of law by the officers of the company. This court found that without a shadow of authority and under color of an invalid writ, the marshal and other government officers had made a clean sweep of all the books, papers and documents in the office of the company while its officers were under arrest. These documents were copied and photographed and then the court ordered their return to the company. A subpoena was then issued to compel the production of the originals. The company refused to obey the subpoena. The court made an order requiring obedience and refusal to obey the order was the contempt alleged. This court held that the government could not, while in form repudiating the illegal seizure, maintain its right to avail itself of the knowledge obtained by that means which otherwise it would not have had. In other words, we held that the search thus made was an unreasonable one against which the corporation was protected by the Fourth Amendment and which vitiated all the subsequent proceedings to compel production. There was nothing inconsistent with the Wilson Case in this ruling for, as we have seen in the passage quoted from the opinion in that case, a corporation can only be compelled to produce its records against itself by the demand of the government expressed in lawful process, confining i  requirements within limits which reason imposes in the circumstances of the case. It is to submit its books and \n\n[262 U.S. 151, 157]\n\u00a0\n papers only to 'duly constituted authority when demand is suitably made.' In the case before us the demand was suitably made by duly constituted authority. In the Silverthorne Case it was not. Here it was expressed in lawful process, confining its requirements to certain described documents and papers easily distinguished and clearly described. Their relevancy to the subject of investigation was not denied. As said in the Wilson Case ( \n221 U.S. 376\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 542, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 558):\n'But there is no unreasonable search and seizure, where a writ, suitably specific and properly limited in its scope, calls for the production of documents which, as against their lawful owner to whom the writ is directed, the party procuring its issuance is entitled to have produced.'\n\n Objection is made that neither Kramer nor Schratter was called before the grand jury when they produced the books and papers in response to the duces tecum. That was not necessary. The subpoena only summoned the corporations to appear and produce the named documents and papers. There was no real ad testificandum clause in the subpoena because a corporation could not testify. It was expressly ruled in the Wilson Case, that the failure to put officers of the corporation on the stand in such a case did not in any way invalidate or destroy the lawful effect of the duces tecum.\n Kramer says that he protested against the retention of the documents he had produced at the time because he was not called before the grand jury. At his own solicitation he was thereafter called before that body and testified and voluntarily produced other documents and papers, and never renewed his demand for the documents produced under subpoena until after the grand jury ignored the charge against him some eight months later. Schratter, against the opposition of the district attorney, but with the consent of the court absented himself from the country for eight months and took no steps in respect to the produced documents and papers. Judge Knox \n\n[262 U.S. 151, 158]\n\u00a0\n held that such conduct constituted a waiver of any irregularities in not calling these witnesses before the grand jury when the documents and papers were produced. If a waiver were needed, as we do not think it was under the Wilson Case, this clearly would have been sufficient.\n Schratter joined with each corporation in asking a return of the documents and papers of that corporation on the ground that they might incriminate him. But the cases of Hale v. Henkel, \n201 U.S. 43\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 370; Wilson v. United States, \n221 U.S. 361\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 538, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 558, and Wheeler v. United States, \n226 U.S. 478\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 158, show clearly that an officer of a corporation in whose custody are its books and papers is given no right to object to the production of the corporate records because they may disclose his guilt. He does not hold them in his private capacity and is not, therefore, protected against their production or against a writ requiring him as agent of the corporation to produce them.\n Appellants cite the cases of Boyd v. The United States, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 524; Weeks v. United States, \n232 U.S. 383\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177, and Gouled v. United States, \n255 U.S. 298\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 261, to support their contention that the proceedings complained of herein violate their rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. Those cases were all unreasonable searches of documents and records belonging to individuals. The distinction between the cases before us and those cases lies in the more limited application of the amendments to the compulsory production of corporate documents and papers as shown in the Henkel, Wilson, and Wheeler Cases.\n The order of the District Court is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","75":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEWEN v. AMERICAN FIDELITY CO(1923)\nNo. 92\nArgued: March 1, 1923Decided: March 12, 1923\n\n\n\n Wm. R. Wilder, of New York City, and Henry E. Davis, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner. \n\n[261 U.S. 322, 323]\n\u00a0\n J. M. Proskauer, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action upon an undertaking to pay the amount of any judgment that might be recovered by one Mackey in a suit against the Illinois Surety Company, not exceeding $7,500 and interest, the contract being made by the present defendant in order to dissolve an attachment in that suit. That suit was begun in May, 1915, in New York. Mackey recovered a judgment for a much larger sum on June 21, 1919, and assigned the same and this undertaking to the present plaintiff. The defence is that the Illinois Surety Company, an Illinois corporation, had ceased to exist before the judgment was recovered, and that the judgment against it was void. On this ground judgment was given for the defendant in the District Court and the judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n On April 19, 1916, a majority of the stockholders of the Surety Company filed a bill in Illinois alleging that the Company was insolvent and praying that it be restrained from further prosecution of its business, that a receiver be appointed and that upon final hearing a decree might be entered dissolving the Company and providing for the distribution of its assets. The answer of the Company was filed with the bill. It admitted the allegations and submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court. On the same day an order was entered 'without bond from the complainants and until the further order of the Court' restraining the Company from further prosecution of its business. Later on the same day another decree appointed a receiver to collect the property, with power to institute and to defend suits and to apply to the Court for \n\n[261 U.S. 322, 324]\n\u00a0\n further orders concerning the collection and distribution of the assets and the closing of the Company's concerns for which purposes jurisdiction was retained until final hearing and settlement of all unfinished business of th Company and the receivership. The receiver continued to defend the above mentioned suit in New York until about April 28, 1919, when the counsel for the Company notified the plaintiff that they no longer were authorized to appear for it; the ground of the notice being an order of the Court in Illinois that the receiver should discontinue the defence and notify the plaintiff Mackey to file his claim in that proceeding. (This order imposed no personal obligation on Mackey as he was not within the jurisdiction of the Illinois Court.) Thereafter the defendant failed to appear, and upon a report by a referee the judgment in question was entered on June 21, 1919. This was more than three years after the Company had been restrained from transacting business. The defendant says that by the Illinois statutes the Company became extinct in one year, with a continued liability to creditors of only two years more, and that the last two years had elapsed.\n The Illinois Surety Company was organized under a general law of Illinois to be found in Hurd's Revised Statutes of Illinois 1917, c. 32,  102f and following. By section 14 of the Act (Hurd,  102s), corporations formed under it\n'shall be subject to all laws of this State governing corporations for pecuniary profit, as provided for in an Act ... approved April 18, 1872 ... and amendments thereto, in force July 1, 1897, and the duties thereof, and shall have the powers thereof, so far as the same are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act. Such Companies shall also be subject to the provisions and requirements of an Act entitled, 'An Act in regard to the dissolution of Insurance Companies,' approved February 17, 1874.'\n\n The act last mentioned allows a majority \n\n[261 U.S. 322, 325]\n\u00a0\n of the stockholders of any Illinois insurance company to apply by petition to close its concerns and authorizes the Court after due notice to all the parties interested to proceed to hear the matter and for reasonable cause to decree a dissolution. Section 2 (Hurd's Statutes, c. 73,  12). It also provides in the next section that the charters of all such companies, which either from neglect, or by vote of their members or officers, or in obedience to the decree of any Court, have ceased for one year to transact the business for which they were organized, shall be deemed extinct, with authority to the Court upon petition to fix the time within which the companies shall close their concerns:\n'Provided, that this section shall not be construed to relieve any such company from its liabilities to the assured or any of its creditors.' Section 3 (Hurd,  13).\n\n The fourth section (Hurd,  14) continues the companies for two years more for the purpose of prosecuting and defending suits, &c., but not for that of going on with their business. The facts that we have stated were thought to bring the case within this statute and so make the New York judgment void.\n We should hesitate long before deciding that the cessation of business for a year under the above mentioned decree fell within section 3 of the Insurance Act or that the proviso had no effect upon the following section 4, not to speak of other difficulties. But it is not necessary to stop at this point. The company, as has been shown, was subject also to the laws governing corporations for pecuniary profit. By section 10 of the Act of April 18, 1872 (Hurd, c. 32,  10) these corporations are continued for two years for substantially the same purposes as are insurance companies, but it is explicitly provided by section 12 that the dissolution for any cause shall not take away or impare any remedy given against such corporation, its stockholders or officers, for any liabilities incurred previous to its dissolution. The argument seems to us strong that the \n\n[261 U.S. 322, 326]\n\u00a0\n section concerning surety companies quoted at the outset takes in this section 12 without qualification and, if necessary, might be said to show that a larger signification should be given to the proviso quoted fron section 3 of th Insurance Act, at least as applied to this Company. But we are relieved from an independent consideration of the matter by the opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois in Evans v. Illinois Surety Co., 298 Ill. 101, 106, 107, 131 N. E. 262, April 21, 1921, the very case in which the above mentioned injunction was issued. On page 106 it quotes section 12 of the Corporation Act, and on page 107 says:\n'There could be no question but that the provisions of the General Incorporation Act heretofore quoted, and all the applicable provisions, apply to corporations organized under the Surety Act.'\n\n This was later than the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals and appears to us to warrant our taking the same view without discussion at greater length.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","76":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFARMERS' & MERCHANTS' BANK v. FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF RICHMOND(1923)\nNo. 823\nArgued: Decided: June 11, 1923\n\n\n Reserve Bank of Richmond \n262 U.S. 649\n (1923) ]\n\n\n[262 U.S. 649, 651]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. W. Smith, of Atlanta, Ga., and John J. Parker, of Charlotte, N. C., for petitioners.\n Mr. Henry W. Anderson, of Richmond, Va., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Legislature of North Carolina provided by section 2 of chapter 20, Public Laws of 1921, entitled 'An act to promote the solvency of state banks':\n'That in order to prevent accumulation of unnecessary amounts of currency in the vaults of the banks and trust companies chartered by this state, all checks drawn on said banks and trust companies shall, unless specified on the face thereof to the contrary by the maker or makers thereof, be payable at the option of the drawee bank, in exchange drawn on the reserve deposits of said drawee \n\n[262 U.S. 649, 652]\n\u00a0\n bank when any such check is presented by or through any Federal Reserve Bank, post office, or express company, or any respective agents thereof.'\n\n Section 1 authorizes banking institutions chartered by the state to charge a fee not in excess of one-eighth of 1 per cent. on remittances covering checks, the minimum fee on any remittance therefor to be 10 cents. Section 4 exempts from the operation of sections 1 and 2 all checks drawn in payment of obligations to the federal or the state government. Whether this statute conflicts with section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act (Act Dec. 23, 1913, c. 6, 38 Stat. 251, 263, as amended by Act Sept. 7, 1916, c. 461, 39 Stat. 752, and Act June 21, 1917, c. 32,  4, 40 Stat. 232, 234 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  9796]) or otherwise with the federal Constitution is the question for decision.\n The legislation arose out of the effort of the Federal Reserve Board to introduce in the United States universal par clearance and collection of checks through Federal Reserve Banks. See American Bank & Trust Co. v. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, \n256 U.S. 350\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 499. The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond serves the Fifth Federal Reserve District, which includes North Carolina. Upon the enactment of this statute the bank gave notice that it considered the legislation void under the federal Constitution; that, when presenting checks to North Carolina state banks for payment over the counter, it would refuse to accept exchange drafts on reserve deposits as required by section 2; and that it would return as dishonored checks for which only exchange drafts had been tendered in payment. Some checks were returned thus dishonored, and to enjoin such action this suit was brought in a court of the state by the Farmers' & Merchants' Bank of Monroe and 11 other state banks. Two hundred and seventy-one more joined later as plaintiffs. So far as appears, none of them was a member of the Federal Reserve system or was affiliated with it. The trial court granted a perpetual \n\n[262 U.S. 649, 653]\n\u00a0\n injunction. The Supreme Court of the state reversed the decree (183 N. C. 546, 112 S. E. 252), and the case is here on writ of certiorari (\n261 U.S. 610\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 361, 67 L. Ed. --). Defendant admits that, if the North Carolina statute is constitutional, plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction.\n To understand the occasion for the statute, its operation, and its effect, the applicable banking practice must be considered. \n1\n Par clearance does not mean that the payee of a check who deposits it with his bank for collection will be credited in his account with the face of the check if it is collected. His bank may, despite par clearance, make a charge to him for its service in collecting the check from the drawee bank. It may make such a charge, although both it and the drawee bank are members of the Federal Reserve system; and some third bank which aids in the process of collection may likewise make a charge for the service it renders. Such a collection charge may be made, not only to member banks by member banks, national or state, but it may be made to member banks also by the Federal Reserve Banks for the services which the latter render. The collection charge is expressly provided for in section 16 of the Federal Reserve Act ( 38 Stat. 268 [Comp. St.  9799]), which declares that:\n'The Federal Reserve Board shall, by rule, fix the charges to be collected by the member banks from its patrons whose checks are cleared through the Federal Reserve Bank and the charge which may be imposed for the service of clearing or collection rendered by the Federal Reserve Bank.'- \n\n[262 U.S. 649, 654]\n\u00a0\n\n\n Par clearance refers to a wholly different matter. It deals, not with charges for collection, but with charges incident to paying. It deals with exchange. Formerly, checks, except where paid at the banking house over t e counter, were customarily paid either through a clearing house or by remitting, to the bank in which they had been deposited for collection, a draft on the drawee's deposit in some reserve city. For the service rendered by the drawee bank in so remitting funds available for use at the place of the deposit of the check, it was formerly a common practice to make a small charge, called 'exchange,' and to deduct the amount from the remittance. This charge of the drawee bank the Federal Reserve Board planned to eliminate, and in so doing to concentrate in the 12 Federal Reserve Banks the clearance of checks and the accumulation of the reserve balances used for that purpose. The board began by efforts to induce the banks to adopt par clearance voluntarily. \n2\n The attempt was not successful. The board then concluded to apply compulsion. Every national bank is necessarily a member of the Federal Reserve system, and every state bank with the requisite qualifications may become such. Over members the board has large powers, as well as influence. The first step in the campaign of compulsion was taken in the summer of 1916, when the board issued a regulation requiring every drawee bank which is a member of the Federal Reserve system to pay without deduction, all checks upon it presented through the mail by the Federal Reserve Bank of the district. The operation of this requirement was at first limited in scope by the fact that the original act (section 13) authorized the Reserve Banks to collect only those checks which were drawn on member banks and which were deposited by a member bank of another Reserve \n\n[262 U.S. 649, 655]\n\u00a0\n Bank or the United States Few of the many state banks had then elected to become members. In September, 1916, section 13 was amended, so as to authorize a Reserve Bank to receive for collection from any member ( including other Reserve Banks) also checks drawn upon nonmember banks within its district. Thereby the Federal Reserve Board was enabled to extend par clearance to a large proportion of all checks issued in the United States. But the regulation (J) then issued expressly provided that the Federal Reserve Banks would receive from member banks, at par, only checks on those of the nonmember banks whose checks could be collected by the Federal Reserve Bank at par. It was recognized that nonmembers were left free to refuse assent to par clearance. By December 15, 1916, only 37 of the state banks within the United States, numbering about 20,000, had become members of the system, and only 8,065 of the state banks had assented to par clearance.\n Reserve Banks could not, under the then law, make collections for nonmembers. It was believed that if Congress would grant Federal Reserve Banks permission to make collection also for nonmembers, the board could offer to all banks inducements adequate to secure their consent to par clearance. A further amendment to section 13 was thereupon secured by Act of June 21, 1917, c. 32,  4 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. Ann. Supp. 1919,  9796), which provided, among other things, that Federal Reserve Banks:\n'Solely for the purposes of exchange or of collection, may receive from any nonmember bank ... deposits of ... checks ... payable upon presentation: ... Provided, such nonmember bank ... maintains with the Federal Reserve Bank of its district a balance sufficient to offset the items in transit held for its account by the Federal Reserve Bank.'\n\n To this provision, which embodied the legislation proposed by the Federal Reserve Board, there was added, \n\n[262 U.S. 649, 656]\n\u00a0\n while in the Senate, another proviso, relating to the exchange charge, now known in a modified form as the Hardwick Amendment, which declares:\n'That nothing in this or any other section of this act shall be construed as prohibiting a member or nonmember bank from making reasonable charges, to be determined and regulated by the Federal Reserve Board, but in no case to exceed 10 cents per $100 or fraction thereof, based on the total of checks and drafts presented at any one time, for collection or p yment of checks and drafts and remission therefor by exchange or otherwise; but no such charges shall be made against the Federal Reserve Banks.'\n\n Thus a Federal Reserve Bank was authorized to receive for collection checks from nonmembers who maintained with it the prescribed balance, and strenuous efforts were then made to induce all state banks to so arrange. But the law did not compel state banks to do this. May refused; and they continued to insist on making exchange charges. On March 21, 1918, the Attorney General (31 Op. Attys., Gen. 245, 251) advised the President:\n'The Federal Reserve Act, however, does not command or compel these state banks to forego any right they may have under the state laws to make charges in connection with the payment of checks drawn upon them. The act merely offers the clearing and collection facilities of the Federal Reserve Banks upon specified conditions. If the state banks refuse to comply with the conditions by insisting upon making charges against the Federal Reserve Banks, the result will simply be, so far as the Federal Reserve Act is concerned, that since the Federal Reserve Banks cannot pay these charges they cannot clear or collect checks on banks demanding such payment from them.'\n\n The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks were thus advised that they were prohibited from \n\n[262 U.S. 649, 657]\n\u00a0\n paying an exchange charge to any bank. But they believed that it was their duty to accept for collection any check on any bank, and that Congress had imposed upon them the duty of making par clearance and collection of checks universal in the United States. So they undertook to bring about acquiescence of the remaining state banks to the system of par clearance. \n3\n Some of the nonassenting state banks made stubborn resistance. \n4\n To overcome it the Reserve Banks held themselves out as prepared to collect at par also checks on the state banks which did not assent to par clearance. This they did by publishing a list of all banks from whom they undertook to collect at par, regardless of whether such banks had agreed to remit at par or not. This resulted in drawing to the Federal Reserve Banks for collection the large volume of checks which theretofore had come to the drawee bank by mail from many sources and which had been paid by remittances drawn on the bank's balance in some reserve city. If a state bank persisted in refusal to remit at par, the Reserve Banks caused these checks to be presented, at the drawee bank, for payment in cash over the counter. The practice adopted by the Reserve Banks would, if pursued, necessarily subject country banks to serious loss of income. It would deprive them of their income from exchange charges; and it would reduce \n\n[262 U.S. 649, 658]\n\u00a0\n their income-producing assets by compelling them to keep in their vaults in cash a much larger part of their resources than theretofore. That such loss must result was admitted. That it might render the banks insolvent was clear. But the Federal Reserve Banks insisted that no alternative was left open to them, since they had to collect the checks and were forbidden to pay exchange charges. The state banks denied that the Federal Reserve Banks were obliged to accept these checks for collection, and insisted that Federal Reserve Banks should refrain from accepting for collection checks on banks which did not assent to par clearance.\n It was to protect its state banks from this threatened loss, which might disable them, that the Legislature of North Carolina enacted the statute here in question. \n5\n It made no attempt to compel the Federal Reserve Bank to pay an exchange charge. It made no attempt to compel a depositor to accept something other than cash in payment of a check drawn by him. It merely provided that, unless the drawer indicated by a notation on the face of the check that he required payment in cash, the drawee bank was at liberty to pay the check by exchange drawn on its reserve deposits. Thus the statute merely sought to remove (when the drawer acquiesced) the absolute requirement of he common law that a check presented at the bank's counter must be paid in cash. It gave the drawee bank the option to pay by exchange only in certain cases, namely, when the check was 'presented by or through any Federal Reserve Bank, post office or express \n\n[262 U.S. 649, 659]\n\u00a0\n company, or any respective agents thereof.' The option was so limited, because the only purpose of the statute was to relieve state banks from the pressure which, by reason of the common-law requirement, Federal Reserve Banks were in a position to exert and thus compel submission to par clearance. It was expected that depositors would co-operate with their banks and refrain from making the prescribed notaion, and that, when the Reserve Banks were no longer in a position to exert pressure by demanding payment in cash, they would cease to solicit, or to receive, for collection checks on nonassenting state banks. Thus these would be enabled to earn exchange charges as theretofore. Such was the occasion for the statute and its purpose. Whether this legislative modification of the common-law rule which requires payment in cash violates the federal Constitution is the question for decision. That it does is asserted on five grounds.\n First. It is contended that in authorizing payment of checks by draft on reserve deposits section 2 violates the provision of article I,  10, clause 1, of the federal Constitution, which prohibits a state from making anything except gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts. This claim is clearly unfounded. The debt of the bank is solely to the depositor. The statute does not authorize the bank to discharge its obligation to its depositor by an exchange draft. It merely provides that, unless the depositor in drawing the check specifies on its face to the contrary, he shall be deemed to have assented to payment by such a draft. There is nothing in the federal Constitution which prohibits a depositor from consenting, when he draws a check, that payment may be made by a draft. And, as the statute is prospective in its operation (Denny v. Bennett, \n128 U.S. 489\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 134; Abilene National Bank v. Dolley, \n228 \nU.S. 1, 5\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 409), there is no constitutional obstacle to a state's providing that, in the absence of \n\n[262 U.S. 649, 660]\n\u00a0\n dissent, consent shall be presumed. Laws which subsist at the time and place of the making of a contract, and where it is to be performed, enter into and form a part of it, as fully as if they had been expressly referred to or incorporated in its terms. This principle embraces alike those laws which affect its construction and those which affect its enforcement or discharge. See Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 231; Von Hoffman v. Quincy, 4 Wall. 535, 550. If, therefore, the provision of section 2 authorizing payment by exchange draft is otherwise valid, it is binding upon the drawer of the check. Since it binds the drawer, it binds the payee and every subsequent holder, whether he be a citizen of North Carolina or of some other state, and wherever the transfer of the check was made. Brabston v. Gibson, 9 How. 263. For the holder of a check has, in the absence of acceptance by the drawee bank, no independent right to require payment under the general law. Bank of the Republic v. Millard, 10 Wall. 152. He takes it subject to the construction and with rights conferred by the laws of North Carolina, the place of the bank's contract and of performance. Pierce v. Indseth, \n106 U.S. 546\n, 1 Sup. Ct. 418. Compare Rouquette v. Overmann, L. R. 10 Q. B. 525.\n Second. It is contended that section 2 violates the due process clause. The argument is that defendant is a federal corporation authorized to engage in the business of collecting checks payable upon presentation within the district, a business common to all banking institutions; that the right to engage in this branch of the business is a valuable property right; that while defendant has, in the past, not made any charge for such collections, it has the right to do so, and could make this branch of its business an important source of revenue; that to compel defendant to accept in payment of checks exchange drafts on reserve deposits, whether good or bad, deprives it of liberty of contract, and in effect of an important branch \n\n[262 U.S. 649, 661]\n\u00a0\n of its business, since that of collecting checks cannot be conducted under such limitations. To this argument the answer is clear. The purpose of the statute, as its title declares, was to promote the solvency of state banks. We should, in the absence of controlling decision of the highest court of the state to the contrary, construe the statute not as authorizing payment in a 'bad' draft, but as authorizing payment in such exchange drafts only as had customarily been used in remitting for checks. So construed the statute is merely an exercise of the police power, by which the banking business is regulated for the purpose of protecting the public, and promoting the general welfare. Noble State Bank v. Haskell, \n219 \nU.S. 104, 575\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 186, 32 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1062, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 487. The regulation here attempted is not so extreme as inherently to deny rights protected by the due process clause. Compare Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co. v. McGuire, \n219 \nU.S. 549, 567\n, 568 S., 31 Sup. Ct. 259; Central Lumber Co. v. South Dakota, \n226 \nU.S. 157, 162\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 66. If the regulation exceeds the state's power to protect the public, it must be because some other provision of the federal Constitution is violated by the means adopted or by the manner in which they are applied.\n Third. It is contended that the statute is obnoxious to the equal protection clause. The argument is that the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond is obliged to accept payment in exchange drafts, whereas other banks with whom it might conceivably compete may demand cash, except in those cases where they present the check through an express company or the post office. It is well settled that the Legislature of a state may (in the absence of other controlling provisions) direct its police regulations against what it deems an existing evil, without covering the whole field of possible abuses. Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61, 81\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160; Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Mackey, \n127 U.S. 205\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 1161. If the Legislature finds that a particular instrument of trade war is being used \n\n[262 U.S. 649, 662]\n\u00a0\n against a policy which it deems wise to adopt, it may direct its legislation specifically and solely against that instrument. Central Lumber Co. v. South Dakota, supra, 226 U. S. p. 160, 33 Sup. Ct. 66. If it finds that the instrument is used only under certain conditions, or by a particular class of concerns, it may limit its prohibition to the conditions and the concerns which it concludes alone menace what it deems the public welfare. The facts recited above disclose ample ground for the classification made by the Legislature. Hence, there was no denial of equal protection of the law. There remains to consider whether section 2 exceeds the state's power, because Congress has imposed specifically upon Federal Reserve Banks duties, the performance of which section 2 obstructs, and that in this way, it conflicts with the Federal Reserve Act. This is the ground on which the invalidity of the North Carolina act has been most strongly assailed.\n Fourth. One contention is that section 2 conflicts with the Federal Reserve Act, because it prevents the federal reserve banks from collecting checks of such state banks as do not acquiesce in the plan for par clearance. The argument rests on the assumption that the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond is obliged to receive for collection any check upon any North Carolina state bank, if such check is payable upon presentation, and is obliged to collect the same at par without allowing deductions for exchange or other charge. But neither section 13, nor any other provision of the Federal Reserve Act, imposes upon reserve banks any obligation to receive checks for collection. The act merely confers authority to do so. The class of cases to which such authority applies was enlarged from time to time by Congress. But in each amendment, as in section 13, the words used were 'may receive'-words of authorization merely. It is true that in statutes the word 'may' is sometimes construed as 'shall.' But that is where the context, or the subject-matter, compels \n\n[262 U.S. 649, 663]\n\u00a0\n such construction. Supervisors v. United States, 4 Wall. 435. Here it does not. This statute appears to have been drawn with great care. Throughout the act the distinction is clearly made between what the board and the Reserve Banks 'shall' do and what they 'may' do.6\n Moreover, even if it could be held that the Reserve Banks are ordinarily obliged to collect checks for authorized depositors, it is clear that they are not required to do so where the drawee has refused to remit except upon allowance of exchange charges which Reserve Banks are not permitted to pay. There is surely nothing in the act to indicate that Reserve Banks must undertake the collection of checks in cases where it is impossible to obtain payment except by incurring serious expense, as, in presenting checks by special messenger at a distant point. Furthermore, the checks which the act declares Reserve Banks may receive for collection are limited to those 'payable on presentation.' The expression would seem to imply that the checks must be payable either in cash or in such funds as are deemed by the Reserve Bank to be- \n\n[262 U.S. 649, 664]\n\u00a0\n an equivalent. A check payable at the option of the drawee by a draft on distant reserves would seem not to be within the limited class of checks referred to in the act. The argument for the Federal Reserve Bank is not helped by reference to the incidental power conferred by section 4. It is only 'such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking within the limitations prescribed by this [the Federal Reserve] Act' which are granted. No duty or right of the Federal Reserve Bank to collect checks is obstructed by the North Carolina statute, which merely gives to the drawee bank the right to pay in the customary exchange draft, where its depositor has, by the form used in drawing the check, consented that this be done.\n Fifth. The further contention is made that section 2 conflicts with the Federal Reserve Act, because it interferes with the duty of the Federal Reserve Board to establish in the United States a universal system of par clearance and collection of checks. Congress did not in terms confer upon the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Reserve Banks a duty to establish universal par clearance and collection of checks, and there is nothing in the original act or in any amendment from which such duty to compel its adoption may be inferred. The only sections which in any way deal either with clearance or collection are 13 and 16. In neither section is there any suggestion that the Reserve Board and the Reserve Banks shall become an agency for universal clearance. On the contrary, section 16 strictly limits the scope of their clearance functions. It provides that the Federal Reserve Board--\n'may at its discretion exercise the functions of a clearing house for such Federal Reserve Banks, ... and may also require each such bank to exercise the functions of a clearing house for its member banks.'\n\n There is no reference whatever to 'par' in section 13, either as originally enacted or as amended from time to time. \n\n[262 U.S. 649, 665]\n\u00a0\n There is a reference to 'par' in section 16; and it is so clear and explicit as to preclude a contention that it has any application to nonmember banks, or to the ordinary process of check collection here involved. Section 16 (38 Stat. 268) declares:\n'Every Federal Reserve Bank shall receive on deposit at par from member banks or from Federal Reserve Banks checks and drafts drawn upon any of its depositors, and when remitted by a Federal Reser e Bank, checks and drafts drawn by any depositor in any other Federal Reserve Bank or member bank upon funds to the credit of said depositor in said reserve bank or member bank. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as prohibiting a member bank from charging its actual expense incurred in collecting and remitting funds or for exchange sold to its patrons.'\n\n The depositors in a Federal Reserve Bank are the United States, other Federal Reserve Banks, and member banks. It is checks on these depositors which are to be received by the Federal Reserve Banks. These checks from these depositors the Federal Reserve Banks must receive. And when received they must be taken at par. There is no mention of nonmember banks in this section. When, in 1916, section 13 was amended to permit Federal Reserve Banks to receive from member banks solely for collection other checks payable upon presentation within the district and when, in 1917, section 13 was again amended to permit such receipt solely for collection also from certain nonmember banks, section 16 was left in this respect unchanged. In other respects section 16 was amended both by the act of 1916 and by the act of 1917. The natural explanation of the omission to amend the provision in section 16 concerning clearance is that the section has no application to nonmember banks, even if affiliated.\n Moreover, the contention that Congress has imposed upon the Board the duty of establishing universal par \n\n[262 U.S. 649, 666]\n\u00a0\n clearance and collection of checks through the Federal Reserve Banks is irreconcilable with the specific provision of the Hardwick Amendment which declares that even a member or an affiliated nonmember may make a limited charge (except to Federal Reserve Banks) for 'payment of checks and ... remission therefor by exchange or otherwise.' The right to make a charge for payment of checks, thus regained by member and preserved to affiliated nonmember banks, shows that it was not intended, or expected, that the Federal Reserve Banks would become the universal agency for clearance of checks. For, since against these the final clause prohibited the making of any charge, then if the Reserve Banks were to become the universal agency for clearance, there would be no opportunity for any bank to make as against any bank a charge for the 'payment of checks.' The purpose of Congress in amending section 13 by the act of 1917 was to enable the Board to offer to nonmember banks the use of its facilities which it was hoped would prove a sufficient inducement to them to forego exchange charges, but to preserve in nonmember banks the right to reject such offer,7 and to protect the interests of member and affiliated nonmember banks (in competition with the nonaffiliated state banks) by allowing also those connected with the federal system to make a reasonable exchange charge to others than the reserve banks. The power of the Federal Reserve Board to establish par clearance was, thus, limited by the unrestricted right of unaffiliated nonmember banks to make a charge for exchange and the restricted \n\n[262 U.S. 649, 667]\n\u00a0\n right of members and affiliated nonmembers to make the charge therefor fixed as reasonable by the Federal Reserve Board. No bank could make such a charge against the Federal Reserve Banks-because these were prohibited from paying any such charge. Member and nonmember affiliated banks, because they were such, performed the service for the Federal Reserve Banks without charge. Unaffiliated nonmember banks were under no obligation to do so. Thus construed, full effect may be given to all clauses in the Hardwick Amendment as enacted. It in no way interferes with the right of a depositor in a nonaffiliated state bank to agree with his bank that the checks which he might draw should (unless otherwise indicated on their face) be payable, at the option of the drawee, in exchange in certain cases.\n The North Carolina statute here in question does not obstruct the performance of any duty imposed upon the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks. Nor does it i terfere with the exercise of any power conferred upon either. It is therefore consistent with the Federal Reserve Act and with the federal Constitution.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER and Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Annual Reports of the Federal Reserve Board, 1914, pp. 19, 20, 174; 1915, pp. 14-17; 1916, pp. 9-12; Regulation I, Series of 1916, p. 169; 1917, pp. 23, 24; Regulation J, Series of 1917, pp. 181-183; 1918, pp. 74- 77; 204-206; 810, 811, 817, 821; 1919, pp. 40-44; 222-228; 1920, pp. 63-69; 1921, 68-73; 228-230; Letter from the Governor of the Federal Reserve Board of January 26, 1920, Senate Document No. 184, 66th Congress, 2d Session; also 'Par Clearance of Checks,' by C.

The General Revenue Act of the State approved September 15, 1919 ( Acts Ala. 1919, p. 420), by section 361, Schedule \n\n[261 U.S. 374, 377]\n\u00a0\n 71, provides that no mortgage shall be received for record--\n'unless the following privilege or license taxes shall have been paid upon such instrument before the same shall be offered for record, to wit: ... Upon all instruments which shall be executed to secure an indebtedness of more than one hundred dollars there shall be paid the sum of fifteen cents for each one hundred dollars of such indebtedness, or fraction thereof, which is secured by said mortgage ... to be paid for by the lender, and no such paper shall be received for record unless there is filed therewith a certificate that the privilege tax was paid by the lender.'\n\n Any probate judge who shall receive a mortgage without collecting the 'recording or registration tax,' etc., is made guilty of a misdemeanor and punished.\n On the other hand the Federal Farm Loan Act of July 17, 1916, c. 245 ,  26, provides that first mortgages executed to Federal Land Banks shall be deemed--\n'instrumentalities of the government of the United States, and as such they and the income derived therefrom shall be exempt from federal, state, municipal, and local taxation.' 39 Stat. 360, 380 ( Comp. St.  9835q).\n\n The validity of this provision is not questioned. Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., \n255 \nU.S. 180, 207\n, 212 S., 41 Sup. Ct. 243. Of course therefore it must prevail over any inconsistent laws of a State.\n The tax was sustained by the Supreme Court of the State and the petition for mandamus was ordered to be dismissed on the ground that the payment was optional; that the Federal Land Bank was not required to put its deed on record, and that if it did it must pay whatever others were required to pay for the registration of its security. But the case is not quite so simple as that. The law of Alabama does make it practically necessary to record such deeds, because it overrides them if not recorded, in favor of any purchaser without notice. While it does so it cannot say that it leaves the Bank free to \n\n[261 U.S. 374, 378]\n\u00a0\n record or not. The bank has a choice it is true, but so has one who acts under duress.

Kenney v. Supreme Lodge of the World, \n252 \nU.S. 411, 415\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 371, 10 A. L. R. 716. It is not necessary to cite cases to show that an act may become unlawful when done to accomplish an unlawful end.\n Of course the State is not bound to furnish its registry for nothing. It may charge a reasonable fee to meet the expenses of the institution. But in this case the Legislature has honestly distinguished between the fee and the additional requirement that it frankly recognizes as a tax. If it attempted to disguise the tax by confounding the two, the Courts would be called upon to consider how far the charge exceeded the requirement of support, as when an excessive charge is made for inspecting articles in interstate commerce. Foote v. Maryland, \n232 U.S. 494\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 377. But it has made no such attempt. It has levied a general tax on mortgages, using the condition attached to registration as a practical mode of collecting it. In doing so, by the construction given to the statute by the Supreme Court, it has included mortgages that it is not at liberty to reach.

Milburn, of New York City, for respondent. \n\n[260 U.S. 568, 573]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The court below entered a decree setting aside an order of the Trade Commission, dated July 21, 1919, which directed respondent Publishing Company to cease and desist from entering into or enforcing agreements prohibiting wholesalers from selling or distributing the magazines or newspapers of other publishers. (C. C. A.) 270 Fed. 881. And the cause is here by certiorari.\n The commission issued an original complaint July 5, 1917, based mainly on a restrictive clause in existing contracts with so-called district agents. Thereafter respondent changed its agreement. An amended complaint followed, which amplified the original allegations and attacked the second contract and consequent conditions.\n The first section of the amended complaint declares there is reason to believe that respondent has been and is using unfair methods of competition contrary to section 5, Act of Congress approved September 26, 1914, c. 311, 38 Stat. 717 (Comp. St.  8836a-8836k),1 and specifically charges: That respondent, a \n\n[260 U.S. 568, 574]\n\u00a0\n Pennsylvania corporation with principal place of business at Philadelphia, has long engaged in publishing, selling and circulating weekly and monthly periodicals in interstate commerce. That with intent, purpose and effect of suppressing competition in the publication, sale and circulation of periodicals it now refuses and for some months past has refused to sell its publications to any dealer who will not agree to refrain from selling or distributing those of certain competitors to other dealers or distributors. That with the same intent, purpose and effect it is making and for several months last past has made contracts with numerous wholesalers to distribute its periodicals as agents, and not to distribute those of other publishers without permission. That wholesalers so restricted are the principal and often the only medium for proper distribution of weekly and \n\n[260 U.S. 568, 575]\n\u00a0\n monthly periodicals in various localities throughout the United States, and many of the so-called agents formerly operated under contracts with respondent which abridged their liberty of resale.\n The second section declares there is reason to believe respondent is violating section 3, Act of Congress approved Octo er 15, 1914 (Clayton Act) c. 323, 38 Stat. 730,2 and \n\n[260 U.S. 568, 576]\n\u00a0\n specifically charges: That respondent publishes, sells and circulates weekly and monthly periodicals in interstate commerce. That for some months past, in such commerce, it has sold and is now selling and making contracts for the sale of its publications and periodicals for use and resale and is fixing the price charged on condition, agreement or understanding that the purchaser shall not sell other publications or periodicals, thereby substantially lessening competition and tending to create a monopoly.\n Respondent replied to the notice to show cause why it should not be required to desist 'from the violations of law charged in this complaint.' It denied unlawful conduct and claimed that the parties contracted with as agents were such in fact; that their services were necessary for the maintenance of the plan originated by it of distributing publications through school boys, who require special superintendence; and further, that such agents had lawfully agreed to abstain from other connections and devote their time and attention to superintending the boys and to the general upbuilding of sales. Copies of respondent's first and second agreements with distributors accompanied the answer. The first had then been superseded and largely discontinued.\n The second contract provides that upon requisition respondent will consign its publications to the agent as he may require, retaining title until they are sold; that the agent will supply the demand of boys and dealers at specified prices, and will use reasonable efforts and devote all nec- \n\n[260 U.S. 568, 577]\n\u00a0\n essary time to promoting the sales of such publications; 'that without the written consent of the publisher he will not display, deliver, or sell any copies of any one of said publications before the authorized publication date, as specified in the printed requisition blanks, or dispose of any copies of said publications in the territory of any other district agent or special agent of the publisher, or act as agent for or supply at wholesale rates any periodicals other than those published by the publisher, or directly or indirectly furnigh to any other publisher or agent the names and addresses of the persons to whom the publisher's publications are sold or delivered;' that subject to the principal's direction and control the agent shall train, instruct and supervise an adequate force of boys for distributing the publications; and that he will return unsold copies, their cover pages or headings.\n After taking much testimony-2,500 pages-the commission made a brief and rather vague report of 2 pages, containing findings and conclusions based on the second contract with dealers and without direct reference to the earlier one. The substance of the report follows:\n Paragraph 1. Respondent, a Pennsylvania corporation with principal place of business at Philadelphia, is engaged in publishing, selling and distributing weekly and monthly periodicals among the states.\n Paragraph 2. 'That in the course of such commerce, the respondent has entered into contracts with certain persons, partnerships, or corporations to sell or distribute its magazines by the terms of which contracts, such persons, partnerships, or corporations, have agreed, among other things, not to 'act as agent for or supply at wholesale rates, any periodicals other than those published by the publisher'3-the respondent herein-without the written consent of such publisher, that of such persons, \n\n[260 U.S. 568, 578]\n\u00a0\n partnerships, or corporations, approximately, four hundered forty- seven (447), hereinafter referred to as 'dealers,' are and previous to entering into such contracts with respondent were regularly engaged in the business of wholesale dealers in newspapers or magazines, or both and as such are as aforesaid engaged in the sale or distribution of magazines, or newspapers, or both, of other publishers; that many of said four hundred forty-seven (447) dealers, and many others who have become such wholesale dealers since entering into such contracts, bound by said contract provisions as aforesaid, have requested respondent's permission to engage also in the sale or distribution of certain publications competing in the course of said commerce, with those of respondent, which permission as to said competing publications has been uniformly denied by respondent; that in enforcing said contract provision as to said dealers, and in denying them said permission, respondent has prevented and now prevents certain of its competitors from utilizing established channels for the general distribution or sale of magazines or newspapers, or both, of different and sundry publishers; that such established channels are in most instances the principal and most efficient, and in numerous cases, the only medium for the distribution of such publications in the various localities of the United States; that such method of competition so employed by respondent in the course of such commerce, as aforesaid, has proved and is unfair.'\n Paragraph 3. 'That in the course of such commerce, the respondent has made sales of its magazines to, or entered into contracts for the sale of the same with certain persons, partnerships, or corporations, by the terms of which sales or contracts for such sales, such persons, partnerships, or corporations have agreed, among other things:' [here follow, without material change, the words of paragraph 2 printed supra in italics.] That the effect of said contract provision has been, and is, to sub stantially \n\n[260 U.S. 568, 579]\n\u00a0\n lessen competition with respondent's magazines and tends to create for the respondent a monopoly in the business of publishing magazines of the character of those published by respondent.'\n The commission concluded that the method of competition described in paragraph two of the report violates section 5, Act of September 26, 1914, and that the acts and conduct specified in the third paragraph violate section 3, Act of October 15, 1914. And it thereupon ordered; That the respondent cease and desist, while engaged in interstate commerce, from entering into any contracts, agreements or understandings which forbid persons, partnerships or corporations already engaged in the sale or distribution of magazines or news papers, or both, of other publishers from acting as agents for, selling or supplying to others at wholesale rates periodicals other than respondent's without its consent; from contracting with those already engaged in the sale or distribution of magazines or newspapers, or both, of other publishers, forbidding them from selling or distributing or continuing to sell or distribute the same; and from enforcing any provision of an outstanding contract whereby one now engaged in the sale or distribution of magazines or newspapers, or both, of other p blishers is forbidden to sell or distribute the same without respondent's permission.\n The statute provides (section 5) that when the commission's order is duly challenged it shall file a transcript of the record, and thereupon the court shall have jurisdiction of the proceedings and the question determined therein and shall have power to make and enter, upon the pleadings, testimony and proceedings, a decree affirming, modifying or setting aside the order; but the commission's findings as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive. The court is also empowered to order the taking of additional evidence for its consideration.\n We have heretofore pointed out that the ultimate determination of what constitutes unfair competition is for \n\n[260 U.S. 568, 580]\n\u00a0\n the court, not the commission; and the same rule must apply when the charge is that leases, sales, agreements or understandings substantially lessen competition or tend to create monopoly. Federal Trade Commission v. Gratz, \n253 \nU.S. 421, 427\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 572.\n Manifestly, the court must inquire whether the commission's findings of fact are supported by evidence. If so supported, they are conclusive. But as the statute grants jurisdiction to make and enter, upon the pleadings, testimony and proceedings, a decree affirming, modifying or setting aside an order, the court must also have power to examine the whole record and ascertain for itself the issues presented and whether there are material facts not reported by the commission. If there be substantial evidence relating to such facts from which different conclusions reasonably may be drawn, the matter may be and ordinarily, we think, should be remanded to the commission-the primary fact-finding body- with direction to make additional findings, but if from all the circumstances it clearly appears, that in the interest of justice the controversy should be decided without further delay, the court has full power under the statute so to do. The language of the statute is broad and confers power of review not found in the Interstate Commerce Act (24 Stat. 379). Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co. v. Behlmer, \n175 \nU.S. 648, 675\n, 676 S., 20 Sup. Ct. 209, Interstate Commerce Commission v. Clyde Steamship Co., \n181 \nU.S. 29, 32\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 512, and Interstate Commerce Commission v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co ., \n186 \nU.S. 320, 340\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 824, while helpful as to proper practice, do not determine the present problem.\n Here we find a vague general complaint charging unfair methods of competition and also sales and contracts for sales on condition that the purchaser shall not deal in other publications. This is followed by an answer setting out the original agreement with dealers and also the substituted form. The findings of fact make no reference \n\n[260 U.S. 568, 581]\n\u00a0\n whatever to the first agreement, but do show that respondent had entered into the second (quoting its language) with 'certain' (no number is given, but there were 1,535) persons, partnerships and corporations, approximately 447 of whom before making such contracts were wholesale dealers in newspapers and magazines. Further, that many of this 447, as well as other parties to such contracts, have been denied permission to distribute the periodicals of other publishers. And that in these ways the most efficient established channels of distribution have been closed to competitors, competition lessened and a tendency to monopoly established.\n The present record clearly discloses the development of respondent's business, how it originated the plan of selling through schoolboys, the necessity for exclusive agents to train and superintend these boys and to devote their time and attention to promoting sales, and also contracts with 1,535 such agents. The commission's report suggests no objection as to 1,088 of these representatives who, prior to their contracts, had not been engaged in selling and distributing newspapers or periodicals for other publishers. There is no sufficien evidence to show that respondent intended to practice unfair methods, or unduly to suppress competition, or to acquire monopoly, unless this reasonably may be inferred from making and enforcing the second or substituted agreement with many important wholesale dealers throughout the country.\n Judged by its terms, we think this contract is one of agency, not of sale upon condition, and the record reveals no surrounding circumstances sufficient to give it a different character. This, of course, disposes of the charges under the Clayton Act.\n The engagement of competent agents obligated to devote their time and attention to developing the principal's business, to the exclusion of all others, where nothing \n\n[260 U.S. 568, 582]\n\u00a0\n else appears, has long been recognized as proper and unobjectionable practice. The evidence clearly shows that respondent's agency contracts were made without unlawful motive and in the orderly course of an expanding business. It does not necessarily follow, because many agents had been general distributors, that their appointment and limitation amounted to unfair trade practice. And such practice cannot reasonably be inferred from the other disclosed circumstances. Having regard to the undisputed facts, the reasons advanced to vindicate the general plan are sufficient.\n Effective competition requires that traders have large freedom of action when conducting their own affairs. Success alone does not show reprehensible methods, although it may increase or render insuperable the difficulties which rivals must face. The mere selection of competent, successful and exclusive representatives in the orderly course of development can give no just cause for complaint, and, when standing alone, certainly affords no ground for condemnation under the statute.\n In the present cause the Commission has not found all the material facts, but considering those which it has found and the necessary effect of the evidence, the order to desist is clearly wrong and should be set aside without further delay.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, doubting.\n The sentence in the majority opinion, which makes me express doubt, is that discussing the duty of the court in reviewing the action of the Federal Trade Commission when it finds that there are material facts not reported by the commission. The opinion says:\n'If there be substantial evidence relating to such facts from which different conclusions reasonably may be drawn, the matter may be and ordinarily we think, should \n\n[260 U.S. 568, 583]\n\u00a0\n be remanded to the commission-the primary fact-finding body-with directions to make additional findings, but if from all the circumstances it clearly appears that in the interest of justice the controversy should be decided without delay, the court has full power under the statute so to do.'\n\n If this means that, where it clearly appears that there is no substantial evidence to support additional findings necessary to justify the order of the commission complained of, the court need not remand the case for further findings, I concur in it. It is because it may bear the construction that the court has discretion to sum up the evidence pro and con on issues undecided by the commission, and make itself the fact- finding body, that I venture with deference to question its wisdom and correctness. I agree that, in the further discussion of the evidence, the reasoning of the opinion of the court would seem to justify the view that it does not find in the evidence sufficient to support additional findings by the commission justifying its order. I only register this doubt because I think it of high importance that we should scrupulously comply with the evident intention of Congress that the Federal Commission be made the fact- finding body and that the court should in its rulings preserve the board's character as such, and not interject its views of the facts where there is any conflict in the evidence.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs with me in this. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 5. That unfair methods of competition in commerce a e hereby declared unlawful.\n The commission is hereby empowered and directed to prevent persons, partnerships, or corporations, except banks, and common carriers subject to the acts to regulate commerce, from using unfair methods of competition in commerce.\n Whenever the commission shall have reason to believe that any such person, partnership, or corporation has been or is using any unfair method of competition in commerce, and if it shall appear to the commission that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public, it shall issue and serve upon such person, partnership, or corporation a complaint stating its charges in that respect, and containing a notice of a hearing upon a day and at a place therein fixed at least thirty days after the service of said complaint. The person, partnership or corporation so complained of shall have the right to appear at the place and time so fixed and show cause why an order should not be entered by the commission requiring such person, partnership, or corporation to cease and desist from the violation of the law so charged in said complaint. ... If upon such hearing the commission shall be of the opinion that the method of competition in question is prohibited by this act, it shall make a report in writing in which it shall state its findings as to the facts, and shall issue and cause to be served on such person, partnership, or corporation an order requiring such person, partnership, or corporation to cease and desist from using such method of competition. ... \n If such person, partnership, or corporation fails or neglects to obey such order of the commission while the same is in effect, the commission may apply to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the United States, within any circuit where the method of competition in question was used or where such person, partnership, or corporation resides or carries on business, for the enforcement of its order, and shall certify and file with its application a transcript of the entire record in the proceeding, including all the testimony taken and the report and order of the commission. Upon such filing of the application and transcript the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon such person, partnership, or corporation and thereupon shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the question determined therein, and shall have power to make and enter upon the pleadings, testimony, and proceedings set forth in such transcript a decree affirming, modifying, or setting aside the order of the commission. The findings of the commission as to facts, if supported by testimony, shall be conclusive. If either party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the proceeding before the commission, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the commission and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. ...\n Any party required by such order of the commission to cease and desist from using such method of competition may obtain a review of such order in said Circuit Court of Appeals by filing in the court a written petition praying that the order of the commission be set aside. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith served upon the commission, and thereupon the commission forthwith shall certify and file in the court a transcript of the record as hereinbefore provided. Upon the filing of the transcript the court shall have the same jurisdiction to affirm, set aside, or modify the order of the commission as in the case of an application by the commission for the enforcement of its order, and the findings of the commission as to the facts, if supported by testimony, shall in like manner be conclusive. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Sec. 3. That it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to lease or make a sale or contract for sale of goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies or other commodities, whether patented or unpatented, for use, consumption or resale within the United States or any territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other place under the jurisdiction of the United States, or fix a price charged therefor, or discount from, or rebate upon, such price, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies or other commodities of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, where the effect of such lease, sale, or contract for sale or such condition, agreement or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce. Comp. St.  8835c.\n Section 11 (Comp. St.  8835j) authorizes the Trade Commission to enforce section 3, with certain exceptions, and directs that this shall be done as prescribed by the act establishing the commission, supra, with like power of review in the courts. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] These words are quoted from the second contract. \n\n\n\n\n","79":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION v.

Four of these orders were held invalid by the Circuit Courts of Appeals for the Third and Seventh Circuits in the above entitled causes ( Sinclair Refining Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 276 Fed. 686; Standard Oil Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 282 Fed. 81), and like ones have been set aside by the Circuit Courts of Appeals for the Second and Sixth Circuits (Standard Oil Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 273 Fed. 478, 17 A. L. R. 389; Canfield Oil Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 274 Fed. 571). The proceedings, essential facts, and points of law disclosed by the four records now before us are so similar that it will suffice to consider No. 213 as typical of all.\n July 18, 1919, the commission issued a complaint charging that respondent, Sinclair Refining Company, was purchasing and selling refined oil and gasoline and leasing and loaning storage tanks and pumps as part of interstate commerce in competition with numerous other concerns similarly engaged, and that it was violating both the Federal Trade Commission Act (38 Stat. 717 [Comp. St.  8836a-8836k]), and the Clayton Act (38 Stat. 730 [Comp. St.  8835a-8835p]).\n The particular facts relied on to show violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act are thus alleged:\n'Paragraph 3. That respondent in the conduct of its business, as aforesaid, with the effect of stifling and suppressing competition in the sale of the aforesaid products, and in the sale, leasing, or loaning of the aforesaid devices and other equipments for storing and handling the same, and with the effect of injuring competitors who sell such products and devices, has within the four years last past sold, leased, or loaned, and now sells, leases, or loans, the said devices and their equipment for prices or considerations which do not represent reasonable returns on the investments in such devices and their equipments; that many such sales, leases, or loans of the aforesaid devices are made at prices below the cost of producing and vending \n\n[261 U.S. 463, 466]\n\u00a0\n the same; that many of such contracts for the lease or loan of such devices and their equipments provide or are entered into with the understanding that the lessee or borrower shall not place in such devices, or use in connection with such devices and their equipments, any refined oil or gasoline of a competitor; that only a small proportion of the dealers in gasoline and refined oil under such agreements and understandings deal also in similar products of respondent's competitors, and that only a small proportion of such dealers require or use more than a single pump outfit in the conduct of their aid business; that there are numerous competitors in the sale of such products, who are unable to enter into such lease agreements or understandings because of the large amount of investment required to carry out such lease agreements as a competitive method of selling refined oil and gasoline; that there are numerous other competitors of respondent engaged in the manufacture and sale of said devices and their equipments, who do not deal in refined oil and gasoline, and therefore do not sell or lease said devices and their equipments for a nominal consideration on a condition or understanding that their products only are to be used therein; that the said numerous competitors who were unable to enter into such lease agreements or understandings, as aforesaid, have lost numerous customers in the sale of refined oil and gasoline to respondent, because of the business practices of respondent hereinbefore set forth; that the said numerous other competitors of respondent who manufacture and sell said devices and their equipments, but do not sell refined oil and gasoline as aforesaid, have lost numerous customers and prospective customers for the purchase of their devices and equipments, because of the said business practices of respondent, as hereinbefore set forth.'\n\n To show violation of the Clayton Act the complaint alleged: \n\n[261 U.S. 463, 467]\n\u00a0\n 'Paragraph 3. That the respondent, for four years last past, in the conduct of its business as aforesaid, has leased and made contracts for the lease, and is now leasing and making contracts for the lease, of said devices and their equipments to be used within the United States, and has fixed and is now fixing the price charged therefor on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the lessees thereof shall not purchase or deal in the products of a competitor or competitors of respondent, and that the effect of such leases or contracts for lease, and conditions, agreements, or understandings, may be and is to substantially lessen competition and tend to create a monopoly in the territories and localities where such contracts are operative.'\n Respondent answered and evidence was taken. In October, 1919, the commission announced its report, findings, and conclusions, the substance of which follows:\n'1. That the respondent is a corporation organized, existing, and doing business under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Maine, with its principal business office located at the city of Chicago, in the state of Illinois, and is now and has been engaged in the business of purchasing and selling refined oil and gasoline, hereinafter referred to as products, and is largely engaged in refining crude petroleum, and that it is now and has been since January 25, 1917, in connection with the aformentioned business, engaged in the leasing and loaning, but not in the manufacture, of oil pumps, storage tanks, and containers and their equipment, hereinafter referred to as devices, in various states of the United States, but not in the District of Columbia, in competition with numerous other persons, firms, corporations, and copartnerships similarly engaged; that prior to the 25th day of January, 1917, the corporate name of respondent was the Cudahy Refining Company.\n\n'2. That the respondent, in the conduct of its business, as aforesaid, and as hereinafter more particularly described, \n\n[261 U.S. 463, 468]\n\u00a0\n extensively refines petroleum and its products and purchases refined oil and gasoline, all hereinafter referred to as 'products,' and also purchases all pumps, storage tanks, or containers, hereinafter referred to as 'devices,' the said devices being used to contain said products, the said products and devices then being handled and stored in the various states of the United States and transported in interstate commerce; that the aforesaid products are sold and the aforesaid devices are leased or loaned by respondent to various persons, firms, corporations, and copartnerships; that in the conduct of its business of purchasing and selling such products, and selling, leasing or loaning such devices, the same are constantly moved from one state to another by respondent, and there is conducted by respondent a constant current of trade in such products and devices between various states of the United States; that there are numerous competitors of respondent, who, in the conduct of their business in competition with respondent, purchase similar products and purchase and manufacture similar devices, the said devices being used to contain said products, the said products and devices then being handled and stored in the various states of the United States and transported in interstate commerce; that the aforesaid products are sold, and the aforesaid devices sold, leased, or loaned, by such competitor of respondent to various persons, firms, corporations, and copartnerships; that in the conduct of their business, as aforesaid, competitors of respondent constantly move such products and devices from one state to another, and there is conducted by said competitors a constant current of trade in such products and devices between the various states of the United States; that respondent has conducted its said business in a similar manner to that above described since January 25, 1917\n\n\n\n'3. That respondent now leases and loans, and has for the period of its business existence leased and loaned, \n\n[261 U.S. 463, 469]\n\u00a0\n devices and equipment for storing and handling its products, and that the monetary considerations received by respondent do not represent reasonable returns upon the investment in such devices and equipment; and also that such leases and loans of said devices and equipment are made for monetary considerations below the cost of purchasing and vending the same, when the business of leasing or loaning said devices and equipment and the returns received thereon are considered separate and apart from the general business and sales policy of the respondent; that respondent's form of contract with the users of such devices and equipment provides in substance that the devices and equipment shall be used for the sole purpose of storing and handling gasoline supplied by respondent, and that the uniform contract used by respondent for leasing such devices and equipment is in form, tenor, and substance as follows: [The ordinary form of contract ( printed in the margin1) is here set out. It recites the \n\n[261 U.S. 463, 470]\n\u00a0\n customer's desire to install certain equipment, and, among other things, provides that this shall be used only for storing and handling gasoline supplied by the lessor; that \n\n[261 U.S. 463, 471]\n\u00a0\n if put to any other use the lessee's right therein shall terminate; and that upon termination of the lease, by whatever means effected, the lessee may purchase the equipment for a specific sum.]\n\n'4. That the contracts mentioned in the preceding paragraph also provide that such equipments shall be used by the lessee only for the purpose of holding and storing the respondent's petroleum products; that a small proportion of such lessees handle similar products of respondent's competitors, and that only a small proportion of such lessees as handle similar products of respondent's competitors require or use more than a single pump outfit in the conduct of their said business; that the practice of leasing such devices requires a large capital investment; that many competitors of respondent do not possess sufficient capital and are not able to purchase and lease devices as respondent does as aforesaid, partly by reason of which such competitors have lost numerous customers to respondent; that the effect of the practice of leasing by contract such equipments, where such contracts contain the said provision restricting the use of the same to the storage and handling of respondent's products as aforesaid, may be to substantially lessen competition and tend to create for the respondent a monopoly in the business of selling petroleum products.\n\n'Conclusions. That the methods of competition and the business practices set forth in the foregoing findings as to the fa ts are, under the circumstances set forth therein, unfair methods of competition, in interstate commerce, in violation of the provisions of section 5 of an act of Congress approved September 26, 1914 (Comp. St.  8836e), entitled 'An act to create a Federal Trade Commission, to define its powers and duties, and for other purposes,' and are in violation of section 3 of an act of Congress approved October 15, 1914 (Comp. St.  8835c), entitled 'An act to supplement existing laws against unlawful restraints and monopolies, and for other purposes.\" \n\n[261 U.S. 463, 472]\n\u00a0\n Thereupon the commission ordered that respondent cease and desist from--\n\n'1. Directly or indirectly leasing pumps or tanks or both and their equipments for storing and handling petroleum products in the furtherance of its petroleum business, at a rental which will not yield to it a reasonable profit on the cost of the same after making due allowance for depreciation and other items usually considered when leasing property for the purpose of obtaining a reasonable profit therefrom, and from doing any matter or thing which would have the same unlawful effect as that resulting from the practice herein prohibited and by reason of which this order is made.\n\n'2. Entering into contracts or agreements with dealers of its petroleum products or from continuing to operate under any contract or agreement already entered into whereby such dealers agree or have an understanding that as a consideration for the leasing to them of such pumps and tanks and their equipments the same shall be used only for storing or handling the products of respondent, and from doing anything having the same unlawful effect as that resulting from the practice herein prohibited any by reason of which this order is made.'\n\n The Clayton Act provides:\n'Sec. 3. That it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to lease or make a sale or contract for sale of goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies or other commodities, whether patented or unpatented, for use, consumption or resale within the United States or any territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other place under the jurisdiction of the United States, or fix a price charged therefor, or discount from, or rebate upon, such price, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies \n\n[261 U.S. 463, 473]\n\u00a0\n or other commodities of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, where the effect of such lease, sale, or contract for sale or such condition, agreement or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.' Comp. St.  8835c.\n\n Respondent's written contract does not undertake to limit the lessee's right to use or deal in the goods of a competitor of the lessor, but leaves him free to follow his own judgment. It is not properly described by the complaint and is not within the letter of the Clayton Act. But counsel for the commission insist that inasmuch as lessees generally- except garage men in the larger places-will not incumber themselves with more than one equipment, the practical effect of the restrictive covenant is to confine most dealers to the products of their lessors; and we are asked to hold that, read in the light of these facts, the contract falls within the condemnation of the statute. Standard Fashion Co. v. Magrane- Houston Co., \n258 U.S. 346\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 360, and United Shoe Machinery Corporation v. United States, \n258 U.S. 451\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 363, are relied upon.\n In the Standard Fashion Co. Case the purchaser expressly agreed not to sell or permit sale of any other make of patterns on its premises. It had a retail store in Boston and sales elsewhere were not within contemplation of the parties. This court construed the contract as embodying an undertaking not to sell other patterns. In United Shoe M chinery Corporation v. United States, when speaking of certain 'tying' restrictions, this court said:\n'While the clauses enjoined do not contain specific agreements not to use the machinery of a competitor of the lessor, the practical effect of these drastic provisions is to prevent such use. We can entertain no doubt that such provisions as were enjoined are embraced in the broad terms of the Clayton Act, which cover all conditions, \n\n[261 U.S. 463, 474]\n\u00a0\n agreements, or understandings of this nature. That such restrictive and tying agreements must necessarily lessen competition and tend to monopoly is, we believe, equally apparent. When it is considered that the United Company occupies a dominating position in supplying shoe machinery of the classes involved, these covenants, signed by the lessee and binding upon him, effectually prevent him from acquiring the machinery of a competitor of the lessor, except at the risk of forfeiting the right to use the machines furnished by the United Company, which may be absolutely essential to the prosecution and success of his business. This system of 'tying' restrictions is quite as effective as express covenants could be, and practically compels the use of the machinery of the lessor, except upon risks which manufacturers will not willingly incur.'\n\n There is no covenant in the present contract which obligates the lessee not to sell the goods of another, and its language cannot be so construed. Neither the findings nor the evidence show circumstances similar to those surrounding the 'tying' covenants of the Shoe Machinery Company. Many competitors seek to sell excellent brands of gasoline and no one of them is essential to the retail business. The lessee is free to buy wherever he chooses; he may freely accept and use as many pumps as he wishes and may discontinue any or all of them. He may carry on business as his judgment dictates and his means permit, save only that he cannot use the lessor's equipment for dispensing another's brand. By investing a comparatively small sum, he can buy an outfit and use it without hindrance. He can have respondent's gasoline, with the pump or without the pump, and many competitors seek to supply his needs.\n The cases relied upon are not controlling.\n Is the challenged practice an unfair method of competition within the meaning of section of 5 of the Federal Trade \n\n[261 U.S. 463, 475]\n\u00a0\n Commission Act?2 Reviewing the circumstances, four Circuit Courts of Appeals have answered, No. And we can find no sufficient reason for a contrary conclusion. Certainly the practice is not opposed to good morals, because characterized by deception, bad faith, fraud, or oppression. Federal Trade Commission v. Gratz, \n253 \nU.S. 421, 427\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 572. It has been openly adopted by many competing concerns. Some dealers regard it as the best practical method of preserving the integrity of their brands and securing wide distribution. Some think it is undesirable. The devices are not expensive ($300 to $500), can be purchased readlly of makers and, while convenient, they are not essential. The contract, open and fair upon its face, provides an unconstrained recipient with free receptacle and pump for storing, dispensing, advertising, and protecting the lessor's brand. The stuff is highly inflammable, and the method of handling it is important to the refiner. He is also vitally interested in putting his brand within easy reach of consumers, with ample assurance of its genuineness. No purpose or power to acquire unlawful monopoly has been disclosed, and the record does not show that the probable effect of the practice will be unduly to lessen competition. Upon the contrary, it appears to have promoted the public convenience by inducing many small dealers to enter the business and put gasoline on sale at the crossroads.\n The powers of the commission are limited by the statutes. It has no general authority to compel competitors to a common level, to interfere with ordinary business methods or to prescribe arbitrary  andards for those engaged \n\n[261 U.S. 463, 476]\n\u00a0\n in the conflict for advantage called competition. The great purpose of both statutes was to advance the public interest by securing fair opportunity for the play of the contending forces ordinarily engendered by an honest desire for gain. And to this end it is essential that those who adventure their time, skill, and capital should have large freedom of action in the conduct of their own affairs.\n The suggestion that the assailed practice is unfair because of its effect upon the sale of pumps by their makers is sterile and requires no serious discussion.\n The judgments below must be\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Equipment Contract.\n This agreement, made and entered into this ___ day of _____, 19__, between Sinclair Refining Company of _____, party of the first part, and _____, of the city of _____, state of _____, party of the second part witnesseth:\n Whereas, party of the second part is now being supplied with gasoline by the party of the first part and desires to install on his premises situated at _____ the following equipment for the better storing and handling of such gasoline: _____.\n Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and of the sum of one dollar by the party of the second part to the party of the first part ( the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged), the above named parties do hereby agree as follows: \n[\nFootnote 1\n] The above described equipment shall be used by the party of the second part for the sole purpose of storing and handling the gasoline supplied by the party of the first part. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The party of the second part agrees, at his own cost, to maintain said equipment in good condition and repair so long as he shall continue to use the same. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] The party of the second part agrees that he will not incumber or remove said equipment, or do or suffer to be done anything whereby said equipment or any part thereof may be seized, taken on execution, attached, destroyed or injured, or by which the title of the party of the first part thereto may in any way be altered, destroyed or prejudiced. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In the event party of the second part should at any time use said equipment for any other purpose than the storing and handling of gasoline supplied by the party of the first part, or should cease for ___ days to handle gasoline secured from the party of the first part the right or license of the party of the second part to said equipment shall at once terminate, and thereupon party of the first part shall have the right to enter upon said premises and remove said equipment and every part thereof. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] The party of the second part shall indemnify and save harmless the party of the first part of and from any liability for loss, damage, injury, or other casualty to persons or property caused or occasioned by any leakage, fire, or explosion of gasoline stored in said tank or drawn through said pump. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] This agreement shall terminate forthwith upon the sale or other disposition of said premises by party of the second part, and in any event upon the expiration of ___ months from the date hereof; and in the event that by mutual consent said equipment remains in the possession of the party of the second part at the expiration of said period, it is agreed that the same shall be used by party of the second part subject to all of the terms and conditions of this agreement, and such may be terminated at any time after the expiration of ___ months from the date hereof by the party of the first part giving ten days' notice to that effect.

Gen., of San Francisco, Cal., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Section 1273, California Code of Civil Procedure, declares:\n'All amounts of money heretofore or hereafter deposited with any bank to the credit of depositors who have not made a deposit on said account or withdrawn any part thereof or the interest and which shall have remained unclaimed for more than 20 years after the date of such deposit, or withdrawal of any part of principal or interest, and where neither the depositor or any claimant has filed any notice with such bank showing his or her present residence, shall, with the increase and proceeds thereof, escheat to the state.'\n\n It further directs \n\n[262 U.S. 366, 367]\n\u00a0\n the Attorney General to institute actions in the superior court for Sacramento county against banks and depositors to recover all such amounts--\n'and if it be determined that the moneys deposited in any defendant bank or banks are unclaimed as hereinabove stated, then the court must render judgment in favor of the state declaring that said moneys have escheated to the state and commanding said bank or banks to forthwith deposit all such moneys with the state treasurer, to be received, invested, accounted for and paid out in the same manner and by the same officers as is provided in the case of other escheated property.'\n\n Section 15 of the Bank Act (St. 1909, p. 90) contains similar provisions.\n In a proceeding under section 1273 the trial court gave judgment for the state against plaintiff in error for the amount credited upon its books to P. A. Campbell for more than 20 years, and this was affirmed by the Supreme Court. State v. Anglo & London Paris Nat. Bank of San F ancisco, 186 Cal. 746, 200 Pac. 612. We are asked to hold that, so construed and applied, this section conflicts with the laws of the United States touching national banks and is therefore invalid.\n The trial court found--\n That for more than 20 years prior to the institution of this action there was on deposit with the said defendant bank to the credit of P. A. Campbell the sum of $1,192.25; that for more than 20 years prior to the institution of this action the said P. A. Campbell has not made any deposit to the credit of said account, or withdrawn any part thereof or any interest or dividends accruing thereon; that the said money and account so deposited and all accruing interest and dividends thereon have remained unclaimed for more than 20 years after the same were so deposited or credited, and after the withdrawal of any part of the principal or interest or dividends, and said moneys and account now are unclaimed; that the date of the last transaction in connection \n\n[262 U.S. 366, 368]\n\u00a0\n with the said deposit of the said P. A. Campbell, whether by deposit or withdrawal of any portion of such account, or by withdrawal of any interest or dividends accruing thereon, was on the 10th day of November, 1880; that neither the said depositor nor any claimant of the said deposit or account, or of any interest or dividends thereon, has filed any notice with the said defendant bank showing the present residence of the said P. A. Campbell, and the said P. A. Campbell is not known to the president or to the managing officers of the said defendant bank to be now living; that the name of the said depositor, P. A. Campbell, together with the date of the last transaction in connection with his said deposit or account, and the amount now on deposit in the said defendant bank to the credit of the said depositor, were all contained in the annual statement of the said defendant bank filed with the state controller of the state of California in January, 1917, as required by law, and the Attorney General of the state of California has been informed of all of the foregoing facts.\n The Supreme Court declined to express an 'opinion upon the question whether the judgment of the superior court herein operates as a present escheat of the rights of the several depositors against the respective banks, or whether under section 1272 they each still have the right within the time there stated to prosecute an action to obtain payment of their several deposits from the state treasurer,' and said, 'if they have such right, the judgment of the superior court would not be a bar thereto.'\n Section 5136, U. S. Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  9661) confers upon national banks power to receive deposits, which necessarily implies the right to accept loans of money, promising to repay upon demand to lender or his order. These banks are instrumentalities of the federal government. Their contracts and dealings are subject to the operation of general and undiscriminating state laws, which do \n\n[262 U.S. 366, 369]\n\u00a0\n not conflict with the letter or the general object and purposes of congressional legislation. But any attempt by a state to define their duties or control the conduct of their affairs is void, whenever it conflicts with the laws of the United States or frustrates the purposes of the national legislation, or impairs the efficiency of the bank to discharge the duties for which it was created. Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank, \n161 \nU.S. 275, 283\n, 288 S., 290, 16 Sup. Ct. 502.\n'National banks organized under the act are instruments designed to be used to aid the government in the administration of an important branch of the public service. They are means appropriate to that end . ... Being such means, brought into existence for this purpose, and intended to be so employed, the states can exercise no control over them, nor in any wise affect their operation, except in so far as Congress may see proper to permit. Anything beyond this is 'an abuse, because it is the usurpation of power which a single state cannot giv .\" Farmers' & Mechanics' National Bank v. Dearing, \n91 \nU.S. 29, 33\n, 34 S..\n\n Congressional legislation in respect of national banks--\n'has in view the erection of a system extending throughout the country, and independent, so far as powers conferred are concerned, of state legislation, which, if permitted to be applicable, might impose limitations and restrictions as various and as numerous as the states.' Easton v. Iowa, \n188 \nU.S. 220, 229\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 288.\n\n Plainly, no state may prohibit national banks from accepting deposits, or directly impair their efficiency in that regard. And we think, under circumstances like those here revealed, a state may not dissolve contracts of deposit even after 20 years and require national banks to pay to it the amounts then due; the settled principles stated above oppose such power.\n Does the statute conflict with the letter or general object and purposes of the legislation by Congress? Obviously, \n\n[262 U.S. 366, 370]\n\u00a0\n it attempts to qualify in an unusual way agreements between national banks and their customers long understood to arise when the former receive deposits under their plainly granted powers. If California may thus interfere other states may do likewise, and, instead of 20 years, varying limitations may be prescribed-3 years, perhaps, or 5, or 10, or 15. We cannot conclude that Congress intended to permit such results. They seem incompatible with the purpose to establish a system of governmental agencies specifically empowered and expected freely to accept deposits from customers irrespective of domicile with the commonly consequent duties and liabilities. The depositors of a national bank often live in many different states and countries, and certainly it would not be an immaterial thing if the deposits of all were subject to seizure by the state where the bank happened to be located. The success of almost all commercial banks depends upon their ability to obtain loans from depositors, and these might well hesitate to subject their funds to possible confiscation.\n This court has often pointed out the necessity for protecting federal agencies against interference by state legislation. The approved principle of obsta principiis should be adhered to. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316; Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738; Farmers', etc., Bank v.

W.,\n\n'Washington, D. C., March 24, 1903\n\n\n\n'Sir: The undersigned has made an invention, 'method of drying materials,' for which patent has been filed Feb. 9, 1903, Series No. 142653.\n\n'Now, in consideration of the Navy Department building an apparatus for testing this method, without expense to me, I hereby give the Navy Department the option of using my method of drying materials, if they find it to their advantage, by paying to me, my heirs, or my legal \n\n[260 U.S. 667, 669]\n\u00a0\n representatives, $0.01 (one cent) for each pound of material dried by my method.\n\n'Very respectfully,\n\n Louis Gathmann.\n'Admiral O'Neil,\n\n'Chief of Bureau of Ordnance.'\n\n He delivered with the proposition a plan or drawing for an experimental apparatus.\n To the proposition the Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance replied as follows:\n'Address Bureau of Ordnance, Navy Department, and refer to No. 3585.\n\n'Washington, D. C., March 26, 1903.\n\n'Sir: Referring to your communication of March 24th, 1903, offering the Navy Department the option of using your method of drying materials, on payment of one cent per pound on materials so dried:\n\n'The Bureau has to inform you that it accepts your proposition, and has ordered one experimental apparatus for drying smokeless powder, constructed in accordance with plan submitted by you. This apparatus will be tested without expense to you, and, if it works satisfactorily to the Bureau, the Bureau agrees to pay you, your heirs or legal representatives, one cent for each pound of smokeless powder dried by the method covered by your application or applications filed or to be filed with the U.

O'Neil,\n'Chief of Bureau of Ordnance.\n\n'Mr. Louis Gathmann,\n\n'1839 Vernon Avenue, Washington, D. C.' \n\n[260 U.S. 667, 670]\n\u00a0\n At the time of the conversation of Gathmann with the Chief of Ordnance, and his proposition and the reply to it, he, Gathmann, contemplated applying for patents for his methods, and on February 9, 1903, and subsequent dates, made applications for patents and patents were issued to him for his methods, and at various times from April, 1909, to April, 1915, the government made use of the processes and methods covered by the patents in the manufacture of smokeless powder to the amount of 23, 675,061 pounds thereof and became indebted to the estate of Gathmann in the sum of the petition, to wit, $236,750.\n\n A general traverse was filed to the claim. Upon the issues thus formed and upon considering the evidence taken, the Court of Claims made findings of fact, and from them deduced, as conclusion of law, that appellant was not entitled to recovery and dismissed her petition.\n The court decided that the proposition made by Gathmann's communication and the reply thereto presented an option only, and not a contract, and that it was terminated by the Bureau by a letter addressed to Gathmann, October 14, 1904, which was as follows:\n'Referring to your apparatus for drying power, installed at the naval proving ground for trial: The Bureau forwards herewith a copy of the report made by the inspector of ordnance in charge of that station for your information. After carefully considering this report the Bureau is of opinion that this apparatus has failed to demonstrate anything that would warrant further experiment with it, and the Bureau has instructed the inspector of ordance in charge of the naval proving ground that, when the drier can hold no more samples the whole amount be put in the dry house until dried to the proper volatiles.'\n\n The court decided, besides, that the government had not used Gathmann's methods. Appellant attacks both \n\n[260 U.S. 667, 671]\n\u00a0\n rulings, but concentrates her attention upon the first. The existence of the second, she assumes, is demonstrated by the physical laws of nature, of which the court will take judicial notice.\n The specifications of error against the first ruling are as follows:\n'(1) The letters made an express contract of license for the full term of the patents; (2) the license could not be renounced or ended in any manner except by mutual consent or the fault of Mr. Gathmann; ( 3) he had the right after the receipt of the letter of October 14, 1904, to regard the license still in force and to sue for the unpaid royalties, the government having used the inventions thereafter; (4) what was said prior to the letters of March 26 and 28, 1903, should not be considered; (5) the Court of Claims should not have considered the development and state of the art prior to the issuance of the patents; (6) the licensee is estopped from denying the validity of the patents.'\n\n To estimate these contentions, the findings of the court must be considered. A summary of them, stated narratively, is as follows:\n The material of smokeless powder in its first stages is in a plastic condition, containing about 40 per cent. of moisture due to the presence of ether and alcohol, called the 'solvent.' To make the powder ready for use, the solvent must be reduced to between 4 per cent. and 7 per cent. according to caliber. The process requires several months' time. The elements of the solvent were expensive, and it became an object to the government and its manufacture of the powder to save them for reuse.\n As early as 1900 the government had used, along with other methods of drying, what was known as the closed-circuit method of drying and solvent recovery. In this method there is, generally speaking, a heating chamber, a powder chamber, and a condensing chamber, with the \n\n[260 U.S. 667, 672]\n\u00a0\n necessary connecting pipes or conduits and means for effecting circulation of the air in the circuit, as by fan or by gravity. In operation the warm air from the heating chamber passes on to the powder chamber, where it absorbs solvent from the 'green' powder, then passes on to the condensing chamber, where the solvent carried by it is condensed to liquid form, the air then passing on to the heating chamber again for reheating and repetition of the cycle.\n When the powder is newly made, or 'green,' the solvent is given off rapidly; but as the percentage of the solvent in the mass is reduced, it volatilizes less rapidly and comes off less freely. When the solvent is reduced to about 10 per cent., this closed-circuit process is discontinued and the drying of the powder is completed in the ordinary drying houses.\n The plans of the apparatus used by the government in 1900 were secured from the California Powder Works, of California, by whom the apparatus was understood to have originated. It illustrates 'the closed- circuit method.'\n Louis Gathmann was an inventor and was interested in improving the method of expediting the manuf cture of smokeless powder and had discussed the question with Admiral O'Neil. The government at times had two systems; one for merely drying by hot air, and the other for both drying and recovery of the solvent. Gathmann claimed a method that would do both in a very much shorter time and proposed that a test be made. The letters we have quoted grew out of the conferences between Gathmann and Admiral O'Neil, and Gathmann's representation furnished the chief inducement to the Admiral to enter into the agreement shown by the letters:\n Pursuant to the agreement or option shown by the letters, the United States under the direction and supervision of Gathmann, at its own expense, constructed and \n\n[260 U.S. 667, 673]\n\u00a0\n exhaustively tested at its Indian Head (Maryland) powder plant the experimental apparatus and method so proposed by Gathmann. The apparatus and method were substantially the same as those shown and described in Gathmann's letters patent.\n The tests began in October, 1903, and continued until October, 1904, during which time reports of the results obtained by the tests, comparative and otherwise, were periodically made by the officer making the tests, comparison being made with results obtained from concurrent operations under the regular government method. In making the tests, the instructions and wishes of Gathmann were complied with, except that he desired a continuous and unbroken operation, though he had acceded at first to the closing down of the operation of the government plant on Sundays. His desire was not acceded to.\n In the tests the time required for drying the power was not reduced, nor did it appear that the former methods used and results obtained by the government in drying and solvent recovery were otherwise improved upon, nor did Gathmann's apparatus work satisfactorily to the Bureau of Ordnance, and at the close of the tests, Gathmann was so notified by a letter from the Acting Chief of Ordance.\n No change was made in the government's solvent recovery and drying processes as a result of the test of Gathmann's method.\n On June 28, 1904, a patent, No. 763,387, in pursuance to his application of February 9, 1903, was issued to Gathmann. On the same day there was granted to Gathmann and his assignees of a fourth interest therein, United States patent No. 763,388. These patents and the applications upon which they were granted were the applications and patents in contemplation by Gathmann, and Admiral O'Neil in their respective letters of March 24 and 26, 1903. \n\n[260 U.S. 667, 674]\n\u00a0\n Beginning in 1907 the Navy Department at various times in the manufacture of smokeless powder used drying and solvent recovery apparatuses and methods.\n They are illustrated by figures attached to the findings. From August 1, 1910, to 1916, an apparatus known as the box-type method was used, in which 'the circulation is gravity circulation, induced wholly by the heating and the cooling of the air in the different parts of the circuit.' It is not necessary to reproduce the illustrations, and the processes need but little explanation. They are all of the closed-circuit method of drying and solvent recovery. All have a heating chamber, a powder chamber, and a condensing chamber, with connecting pipes or conduits and means of effecting circulation of air in the circuit, as by fan or by gravity. It is not necessary to compare their mechanisms. We think that the apparatus received by the Bureau from the California Powder Works did not differ in essential structure from them and, of course, it differed from that of Gathmann's apparatus. And differed from them necessarily, otherwise Gathmann would have had no purpose in submitting a proposition to the Bureau. The difference was in the method-amount of vapor, means 'provided,' to quote the patent, 'to produce a vapor-laden atmosphere in the drying chamber' and 'so as to maintain,' and to quote the patent further, 'a substantially vapor-saturated atmosphere in the drying chamber nearly to the end of the operation of drying. ...' In other ords, the vapor from the moisture of the materials was added to 'by admitting vapor as steam.'\n Considering the methods, their illustrations, and the letters exchanged by Gathmann to the Bureau of Ordnance, the conclusion of the Court of Claims was that a contract was not created. 'At most,' the conclusion was, 'a mere option was granted by Gathmann to the government to use his method if found suitable after making \n\n[260 U.S. 667, 675]\n\u00a0\n a test of certain apparatus furnished by him, which he continued to improve or change.' And again:\n'There was never any agreement between the parties to use Gathmann's method, and all we have is, as has been stated, an option granted, declined and terminated.'\n\n This conclusion appellant resists, and insists here, as she insisted in the Court of Claims, that a contract was created with its comprehensive and determining effect, it having continued, is the contention, after the date of the letters. That a contract existed or continued we cannot concede to appellant. But whether option or contract, we think it was terminated. There was an election given to the government to be exercised by it according to the judgment of its officers of a test of the 'experimental apparatus' submitted by Gathmann. The test was made, judgment was exercised and its effect notified to Gathmann in the letter of October 14, 1904. Gathmann's letter gave 'the option of using' his 'method of drying materials, if they [Navy Department] find it to their advantage, by paying to' him, his heirs or legal representatives '$0.01 ( one cent) for each pound of material dried by' his 'method.'\n Clearly, therefore, there was a conditional proposal, and an acceptance upon the condition that the apparatus, after test, should work 'satisfactorily to the Bureau.' It did not so work, and the Bureau so declared to Gathmann.\n It is true that there was no response by Gathmann to the letter of the Bureau. His silence, however, was tantamount to acquiescence. It does not appear when that silence was broken. The original petition was filed in this case April 17, 1915; that is, more than ten years after the Bureau's action in declining the proposal. We think that he could not keep the government in obligation, uncertainty and restraint all that time, or even until April, 1909, the first date alleged of the use by the \n\n[260 U.S. 667, 676]\n\u00a0\n government of his apparatus. He, therefore, must be considered as having accepted the decision of the Bureau and the termination of the relation created by the letters whether it was obligation or option, 'right' or 'privilege.' Responding, therefore, to the contention of appellant that a contract (license, to use appellant's word) can 'not be renounced or ended in any manner except by mutual consent or the fault of Gathmann,' we think there was such consent-that which must be considered as tantamount to consent.\n We do not think it is necessary to review the claims of the patents and wherein either of them is an advance upon the uses and knowledge of the world, and, necessarily, including the methods of the government. The Court of Claims has done this, and, we think, so satisfactorily, that we content ourselves by referring to its opinion. We need only to say that Gathmann emphasized the distinction of his patents from all that preceded them as using a 'vaporous or vaporladen atmosphere,' and that such necessarily existed or will occur in the methods used by the government.\n It is counsel's contention that it is 'inevitable that vaporous and vapor-laden atmosphere would be created the instant the heated air came in contact with the green powder, and would continue vaporous and vapor-laden until all of the alcohol and ether were extracted from the powder or the powder be removed from the drier.' And of this, it is asserted, this court takes judicial notice as 'the law of physics,' and the further assertion is that:\n'Of course this contact of the heated air with the alcohol and ether caused the air to become vapor laden whether the defendant wished it or not. \n\n The assertions prove too much. They leave the patents without basis, and the distinction they express and dwell on as merely verbal. If the asserted result was inevitable in the method of the patents, it was inevitable in the method \n\n[260 U.S. 667, 677]\n\u00a0\n in use prior to the patents, and, we repeat, the patents are left without justification.\n The conclusion, therefore, must be that if the methods of the patents are different from the prior art by reason of the 'initial vapor-laden atmosphere by admitting vapor as steam' the government does not use it; if that be not its distinction, and the methods of the prior art inveitably have it, the patents are no advance upon that art and are invalid.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","83":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFOX FILM CORPORATION v.

Y., for respondents.\n\n\n[261 U.S. 326, 328]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are bills in equity brought by the petitioner to restrain dramatic performances based upon two poems, 'Over the Hills to the Poor House' and 'Over the Hills from the Poor House,' and for an account and damages. The author of the poems, Will Carlton, held a renewed copyright for them which ex ired on or about February 21, 1915. He died on December 18, 1912, testate, leaving all his property to Norman E. Goodrich and appointing him sole executor. On January 21, 1915, the executor applied for and obtained a renewal of the copyright to February 21, 1929. Later the exclusive right to dramatize the poems was assigned to the plaintiff. The only defense relied upon here is that the statutes did not give the executor a right of renewal and that therefore the copyright has expired. The bills were dismissed upon this ground by the District Court, (No. 310) 274 Fed. 731; (No. 311) 275 Fed. 582; and the decrees were affirmed on the authority of Silverman v. Sunrise Pictures Corporation, 273 Fed. 909, 19 A. L. R. 289, by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 279 Fed. 1018\n\n\n This copyright was subsisting when the Copyright Act of March 4, 1909, c. 320, 35 Stat. 1075 (Comp. St.  9517 et seq.), went into effect. By section 24 of that statute (Comp. St.  9545) copyrights so subsisting 'may, at the expiration of the term provided for under existing law, be renewed and extended by the author of such work if still living, or the widow, widower, or children of the author, if the author be not living, or if such author, widow, widower, or children be not living, then by the author's executors, or in the absence of a will, his next of kin, for a further period such that the entire term shall be equal to that secured by this Act, including the \n\n[261 U.S. 326, 329]\n\u00a0\n renewal period: ... Provided, that application for such renewal and extension shall be made to the copyright office and duly registered therein within one year prior to the expiration of the existing term.' The argument on which the statute was held not to apply to the present case was that the renewal creates a new estate, White-Smith Music Pub. Co. v. Goff, 187 Fed. 247, 109 C. C. A. 187; that the estate is purely statutory, and does not exist until within one year prior to the expiring of the existing term; that therefore Carlton dying more than a year before that moment had nothing to bequeath; and that the statute gave nothing to the executor except when the testator had the right to renew at the moment of his decease. It is argued that the executor is mentioned only to provide for the case of the testator's dying within the year without having exercised his right to renew, and thus having a right that the statute allowed him to transmit.\n All of these propositions may be admitted, (for the purposes of the present argument only,) except the last. But we see no sufficient reason for thus limiting the right of the executor. The section read as a whole would express to the ordinary reader a general intent to secure the continuance of the copyright after the author's death, and none the less so if the actual continuance was effected by creating a new estate, or if the beneficiaries in certain cases are pointed out. No one doubts that if Carlton had died leaving a widow she could have applied as the executor did, and executors are mentioned alongside of the widow with no suggestion in the statute that when executors are the proper persons, if anyone, to make the claim, they cannot make it whenever a widow might have made it. The next of kin come after the executors. Surely they again have the same rights that the widow would have had. The limitation is derived from a theory that the statute cannot have intended the executor to take \n\n[261 U.S. 326, 330]\n\u00a0\n unless he took what the testator already had. We should not have derived that notion from the section, which seems to us to have the broad intent that we have expressed, and the words specially applicable seem to us plainly to import that if there is no widow or child the executor may exercise the power that the testator might have exercised if he had been alive. The executor represents the person of his testator, Littleton,  237, and it is no novelty for him to be given rights that the testator could not have exercised while he lived. Green v. Ekins, 2 Atk. 473, 476. A familiar illustration is to be found in the Employers' Liability Act ( Comp.

Roberts, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action in Missouri under the federal Employers' Liability Act (Comp. St.  8657-8665) for the death of the plaintiff's ( petitioner's) intestate caused by a collision in Illinois between engines of the defendant and the Wabash Railroad Company at a grade crossing. The deceased, Frese, was the engineer in charge of the defendant's engine. A statute of Illinois required that--\n'All trains running on any railroad in this state, when approaching a crossing with another railroad upon the same level, or when approaching a swing or drawbridge, in use as such, shall be brought to a full stop before reaching the same, and within eight hundred ( 800) feet therefrom, and the engineer or other person in charge of the engine attached to the train shall positively ascertain that the way is clear and that the train can safely resume its course before proceeding to pass the bridge or crossing.' Hurd's Rev. St. Ill. 1921, c. 114,  75.\n\n See Southern Ry. Co. v. King, \n217 U.S. 524\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 594.\n Frese brought his train to a stop somewhat over two hundred feet from the crossing and the Wabash train stopped at about three hundred feet from it. But the view of the \n\n[263 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n Wabash track from the Burlington was obstructed intermittently until the Wabash track was reached. The two trains did not discover each other, but started on again and collided, killing Frese. The Supreme Court of Missouri held that as the engine was under the control of the engineer who was killed, the statute of Illinois imposed upon him the imperative duty positively to ascertain that the way was clear before entering upon the crossing; that if he had done so he would not have been killed, and that the plaintiff could not recover. Judgment was ordered for the defendant. 290 Mo. 501, 235 S. W. 97.\n The plaintiff contends that there was evidence of contributory negligence on the part of the fireman, Savage, and therefore that even if Frese was negligent that would not be a bar to this action under the Employers' Liability Act. But the only evidence as to the fireman came from a man who was standing on the ground as the engine passed him. He says that it looked to him that the fireman then was looking through the front window at that time and that he continued in that position up to say fifty or sixty feet from the crossing of the tracks. The fireman was on the left on the side of the other approaching train, the engineer on the right where he could not see so well. But of course the witness could not testify which way the fireman turned his eyes after he saw only his back, and it is a mere speculation to argue that Savage did not do all that he could. Moreover the statute makes it the personal duty of the engineer positively to asscertain that the train can safely resume its course. Whatever may have been the practice he could not escape this duty, and it would be a perversion of the Employers' Liability Act (April 22, 1908, c. 149,  3; 35 Stat. 65, 66 [Comp. St.  8659]) to hold that he could recover for an injury primarily due to his failure to act as required, on the ground that possibly the injury might have been prevented if his subordinate had done more.

Frick is a citizen of the United States and of California. Satow was born in Japan, of Japanese parents, and is a subject of the Emperor of Japan. Frick is the owner of 28 shares of the capital stock of the Merced Farm Company, a corporation organized under the laws of California, that owns 2,200 acres of farm land in that state. Frick desires to sell the shares to Satow, and Satow desires to buy them. By the complaint it is alleged in substance that the appellees have threatened to and will enforce the act against appellants if Frick sells such stock to Satow, and will institute proceedings to escheat such shares to the state as provided in the act; that, but for the provisions of the act and such threats, Frick would sell and Satow would buy the stock. And it is averred that the act is so drastic and the penalties attached to its violation are so great that appellees are deterred from carrying out the sale, and that, unless the court shall determine its validity in this suit, appellants will be compelled to submit to it whether valid or invalid.\n Appellants applied for an interlocutory injunction to restrain appellees during the pendency of the suit from instituting any proceeding to enforce the act against appellants. The application was heard by three judges, as provided in section 266 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243). The motion was denied, and the case is here on appeal from that order. \n\n[263 U.S. 326, 333]\n\u00a0\n In Porterfield v. Webb, \n263 U.S. 225\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 21, 68 L. Ed. --, and Webb v. O'Brien, \n263 U.S. 313\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 112, 68 L. Ed. --, decided this day, we held that the act does not conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment or with the treaty between the United States and Japan (37 Stat. 1504). In the case first mentioned, we held that the act prohibits the leasing of agricultural land by citizens of the United States to a Japanese alien, and in the latter that it prohibits the making of a cropping contract between a citizen and a Japanese alien.\n The treaty does not grant permission to the citizens of subjects of either of the parties in the territories of the other to own, lease, use, or have the benefit of lands for agricultural purposes, and, when read in the light of the circumstances and negotiations leading up to its consummation, the language shows that the parties respectively intended to withhold a treaty grant of that privilege. Terrace v. Thompson, supra; Id. ( D. C.) 274 Fed. 841, 844, 845. The applicable provision of section 3 of the act (St. 1921, p. lxxxiii) is:\n Hereafter all ineligible aliens 'may ... acquire shares of stock in any ... corporation that is or may be authorized to acquire, possess, enjoy or convey agricultural land, in the manner and to the extent and for the purposes prescribed by any treaty ... and not otherwise.'\n The provisions of the act were framed and intended for general application and to limit the privileges of all ineligible aliens in respect of agricultural lands to those prescribed by treaty between the United States and the nation or country of which such alien is a citizen or subject. The state has power, and the act evidences its purpose, to deny to ineligible aliens permission to own, lease, use, or have the benefit of lands within its boarders for agricultural purposes. Webb v. O'Brien, supra.\n'As the state has the power ... to prohibit, it may adopt such measures as are reasonably appropriate or needful to render exercise of that power effective.' Crane v. Campbell, \n245 \nU.S. 304, 307\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 98, and \n\n[263 U.S. 326, 334]\n\u00a0\n cases cited; Hebe Co. v. Shaw, \n248 \nU.S. 297, 303\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 125.\n\n It may forbid indirect as well as direct ownership and control of agricultural land by ineligible aliens. The right 'to carry on trade' given by the treaty does not give the privilege to acquire the stock above described. To read the treaty to permit ineligible aliens to acquire such stock would be inconsistent with the intention and purpose of the parties. We hold that the provision of section 3 above referred to does not conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment or with the treaty.\n The order appealed from is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS think there is no justiciable question involved and that the case should have been dismissed on that ground.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The substance of the portions of the act which are material in this case is printed in the margin of Webb v.

CITY OF GALVESTON(1923)\nNo. 19\nArgued: December 7, 1922Decided: January 2, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 473, 474]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. W. Terry, of Galveston, Tex., for appellants.\n Mr. Frank S. Anderson, of Galveston, Tex., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a decree of the District Court dismissing a bill in equity for want of jurisdiction, on the ground that the bill states no federal question. The ground appears by the decree and also by the certificate of the Judge. Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231 (the Judicial Code)  238, 36 Stat. 1087, 1157, amended by Act of January 28, 1915, c. 22,  2, 38 Stat. 803, 804 (Comp. St.  1215).\n The bill alleges a contract embodied by consent in a decree of April 1, 1869, that compromised a suit brought by the city against the present plaintiff, the Galveston Wharf Company, plaintiff in error, concerning flats in Galveston Bay. It is enough to state the general features of the arrangement. The title of the Wharf Company to certain lands was established, but it was provided that the City should become owner of one- third of the Wharf Company's stock, which was to be increased to that end, and of an undivided one-third of the Wharf Company's property, in trust for the present and future inhabitants of Galveston-all to be inalienable except by a four-fifths vote of all the qualified voters. This was confirmed by the Legislature in 1870. There was a later contract of March 9, 1905, not now material except that it again confirmed the decree of 1869, and has been performed up to the date of the bill.\n But in May, 1920, the City, which is self-governing, amended its charter by giving itself power to purchase, \n\n[260 U.S. 473, 475]\n\u00a0\n condemn and operate the various means and instrumentalities of public service such as gas and electric lighting plants, dock and wharf railway terminals, docks, wharves, and other things named, including the property jointly owned by the Galveston Wharf Company and the City, for the purpose of owning and operating any such public service and distributing it, with provision as to the mode of exercising eminent domain. By another amendment details were arranged in case the City should acquire the joint property by purchase or condemnation and by still another the City was authorized to compel a partition of the same property when authorized by a majority of its qualified voters, and to that end to prosecute a suit. It is alleged that end purpose of a partition would be a sale of one-third of the property upon a majority vote of the citizens, whereas the contract required a vote of four-fifths; and that a condemnation equally would impair the obligation of contracts and would deprive the plaintiff of its property without due process of law, contrary to the Constitution of the United States. The plaintiff further shows large expenditures to improve the property at its own cost and points out other property that it says can be taken more fairly if the City wishes to start municipal wharves.\n Without going into greater detail we will assume that the alleged contract was made and bound the City, and that its terms will be departed from if the City should exercise the new power. The bill alleges that the proper officers will declare the amendments adopted, and that unless restrained the City 'will attempt to partition said property or condemn the same, or both,' and prays for an injunction against attempting to enforce the amendments in any manner so far as the above mentioned property is concerned. The case was heard upon the pleadings and documentary evidence but it is unnecessary to state them further since the decree went upon the ground \n\n[260 U.S. 473, 476]\n\u00a0\n that the bill did not state a case within the jurisdiction of the Court.\n We are of opinion that the decree was right. If the bill can be taken to allege sufficiently any threat and intent of the defendant it does not show that the City will go beyond an exercise of the right of eminent domain. The allegation is, will attempt to partition or condemn. If questions can be raised about the constitutionality of the ordinance authorizing partition, the City may confine itself to condemnation, and will, so far as appears. But there is nothing to prevent the exercise of eminent domain by the legislative power. West River Bridge Co. v. Dix, 6 How. 507; Long Island Water Supply Co. v. Brooklyn, \n166 U.S. 685\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 718; Pennsylvania Hospital v. Philadelphia, \n245 U.S. 20\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 35.

Chicago Title & Trust Co \n261 U.S. 453\n (1923) ]\n\n\n[261 U.S. 453, 455]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case arises in the matter of O'Gara Coal Company, bankrupt, upon a petition for a set-off presented by the trustee of the bankrupt estate. The respondent is the receiver of the La Salle Street Trust & Savings Bank. When the Coal Company became bankrupt in 1913, the Bank held its note for $ 15,000, with security. Between November 11, 1913, and June 11, 1914, the trustees of the Coal Company in bankruptcy deposited in the Bank, an authorized depositary, and were credited as such trustees with funds of their estate, which amounted to nearly $20,000 on June 12, 1914, when the Bank suspended business, insolvent. A receiver was appointed by a State Court a few days later. The trustees of the Coal Company filed a claim for the amount of their deposit in 1916, and in 1916 and again in 1918 received dividends upon it. On the other side the receiver of the bank filed a proof of the bank's claim as unsecured in 1914 but amended it to proof of a secured claim in 1917. The petition \n\n[261 U.S. 453, 456]\n\u00a0\n before us seeks to set off the claim of the petitioner for the deposit in the Bank, less the dividends received, against the claim of the Bank upon the note. The Circuit Court of Appeals denied the set-off and ordered the petition to be dismissed. Chicago Title & Trust Co. v. Gardner, 278 Fed. 509.\n We assume that when money is deposited in a designated bank under  61 of the Bankruptcy Law of July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 562 (Comp. St.  9645), it is deposited as other money is, and becomes the property of the bank, leaving the bank a debtor for the amount. But when this money was deposited with this Bank it seems that the Bank had notice that it was part of a fund appropriated to paying the Coal Company's debts, of which the note held by the Bank was one. We think that it would be inequitable to allow the Bank to proceed to diminish that fund without accounting for the portion that it had received. When the Bank accepted deposits from a fund against which it had a credit it must be taken to have known that it could not profit by the fact at the expense of other claimants. The Bank knew the whole situation. There is nothing to show that the Trustees of the Coal Company when they made their deposits knew that the Bank held the Coal Company's note. If they had known this fact it would be going far to say that they altered or could alter the position of their cestuis que trust for the worse. On the other hand the creditors of the Bank can stand no better than the Bank.\n The Bankruptcy Court may allow the Bank's claim for such sum only as may seem to the Court to be owing above the value of the security,  57e ( Comp. St.  9641), and may withhold dividends upon that sum until the debt due to the trustee has been paid. Western Tie & Timber Co. v. Brown, \n196 \nU.S. 502, 511\n, 25 S. Sup.

Colquitt, of Atlanta, Ga., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Geo. P. Whitman, of Atlanta, Ga., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The facts in this case and the contentions to be considered, with some exceptions presently to be stated, are essentially the same as those involved in Georgia Railway & Power Co. et al. v. Town of Decatur (No. 463) \n262 U.S. 432\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 613, 67 L. Ed. --, just decided. From their inception in the state courts the two cases \n\n[262 U.S. 441, 442]\n\u00a0\n have been considered together and in each of the three decisions referred to in the Decatur Case the state Supreme Court has disposed of them in a single opinion.\n The contract here involved was made in 1905. It granted to the electric company the right to convert its single track within the limits of the municipality into a double track line of electric railway and provided:\n'That no greater fare than that of five cents for each passenger be charged for passage from the southern limits of said city of College Park to some central point in the city of Atlanta.'\n\n The contract, however, unlike the Decatur one, contains no provision on the subject of transfers. Subsequently, by an act of the Legislature, the limits of College Park were extended so as to take in a portion of the College Park line theretofore outside the municipality. Upon the authority of the Decatur Case, we hold that the application of the five-cent fare to the annexed territory impairs the obligation of the contract. In addition to that, the order of the commission requiring the issuance of free transfers to College Park patrons, was erroneous.\n The state courts, in effect, construed the contract as obliging defendant to carry passengers in both directions between College Park and Atlanta at the stipulated rate, and with this construction we agree. It cannot be supposed to have been within the intention of the contracting parties that one rate of fare should be charged for passage in one direction and a different rate in the opposite direction, for the same distance, over the same line, under the same conditions and entailing the same service. Such a construction of the clause would subvert the plain purpose of the ordinance, which was to fix a five-cent fare between the two cities. We construe the phrase 'from ... College Park to ... Atlanta' as though it read 'between College Park and Atlanta.' See State v. Stone, 20 R. I. 269, 38 Atl. 654.

RAILROAD COMMISSION OF GEORGIA(1923)\nNo. 298\nArgued: November 29, 1922Decided: June 11, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. L. Z. Rosser, of Atlanta, Ga., Robert G. Dodge, of Boston, Mass., and W. T. Colquitt, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellants.[ Georgia Ry. & Power Co. v. Railroad Commission of Georgia \n262 U.S. 625\n (1923) ]\n\n\n[262 U.S. 625, 628]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. J. Reagan, of McDonough, Ga., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The gas supply of Atlanta is furnished by the Georgia Railway & Power Company. Authority to fix public utility rates is vested by law in the Railroad Commission. On September 20, 1921, the commission called upon the Georgia Company to show cause why the then maximum rate, $1.65 per 1,000 cubic feet, should not be reduced, and hearings were duly had. The company insisted that under the proposed rate the net income would be less than 3 per cent. on what it claimed to be the fair value of the property. The commission concluded that the net income under the proposed rate would be about 8 per cent. on the value found by it. This difference in their views as to the percentage of probable return arose mainly from their difference as to the value of the property. The \n\n[262 U.S. 625, 629]\n\u00a0\n company claimed that it was at least $9,500,000. The commission found that it was $5,250,000. On December 30, 1921, it ordered that the price of gas be reduced to $1.55.\n The Georgia Company and the Atlanta Gaslight Company, its lessor, then brought, in the federal court for the Northern district of Georgia, this suit to enjoin enforcement of the order, claiming that the rate prescribed is confiscatory. The case was heard upon applica ion for an interlocutory injunction by three judges under section 266 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243). The court did not approve in all respects the views expressed by the commission; but it found that, 'even were there considerable error in fixing values by the commission, the rate would not appear to be clearly confiscatory,' and that enforcement of the order ought not be enjoined until the reduced rate had been tried. It therefore refused the interlocutory injunction, and the case is here on appeal under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215).\n First. The objections mainly urged relate to the rate base, and one of them is of fundamental importance. The companies assert that the rule to be applied in valuing the physical property of a utility is reproduction cost at the time of the inquiry less depreciation. The 1921 construction costs were about 70 per cent. higher than those of 1914 and earlier dates, when most of the plant was installed. So much of it as was in existence January 1, 1914, was valued at an amount which was substantially its actual cost or its reproduction cost as of that date. The companies claim that it should have been valued at its replacement cost in November, 1921, the time of the rate inquiry, and that the great increase in construction costs was ignored in determining the rate base.\n The case is unlike Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission (No. 158) \n262 U.S. 276\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 544, 67 L. Ed. --, decided May 21, 1923. Here the commission gave careful consideration \n\n[262 U.S. 625, 630]\n\u00a0\n to the cost of reproduction; but it refused to adopt reproduction cost as the measure of value. It declared that the exercise of a reasonable judgment as to the present 'fair value' required some consideration of reproduction costs as well as of original costs, but that 'present fair value' is not synonymous with 'present replacement cost,' particularly under abnormal conditions. That part of the rule which declares the utility entitled to the benefit of increases in the value of property was, however, specifically applied in the allowance of $125,000 made by the commission to represent the appreciation in the value of the land owned. The lower court recognized that it must exercise an independent judgment in passing upon the evidence, and it gave careful consideration to replacement cost. But it likewise held that there was no rule which required that in valuing the physical property there must be 'slavish adherence to cost of reproduction less depreciation.' It discussed the fact that since 1914 large sums had been expended annually on the plant; that part of this additional construction had been done at prices higher than those which prevailed at the time of the rate hearing; and it concluded that 'averaging results and remembering that values are ... matters of opinion ... no constitutional wrong clearly appears.'\n The refusal of the commission and of the lower court to hold that, for rate-making purposes, the physical properties of a utility must be valued at the replacement cost less depreciation was clearly correct. As was said in Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 434\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 729, 754 ( 57 L. Ed. 1511, 48 L. R. A. [N. S.] 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18):\n'The ascertainment of that value is not controlled by artificial rules. It is not a matter of formulas, but there must be a reasonable judgment having its basis in a proper consideration of all relevant facts.'\n\n What these relevant facts are had been stated in Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 546\n, 547 S., 18 Sup. Ct. 418, 434. \n\n[262 U.S. 625, 631]\n\u00a0\n '... () The original cost of construction, the amount expended in permanent improvements, the amount and market value of its bonds and stock, the present as compared with the original cost of construction, the probable earning capacity of the property under particular rates prescribed by statute, and the sum required to meet operating expenses, are all matters for consideration, and are to be given such weight as may be just and right in each case. We do not say that there may not be other matters to be regarded in estimating the value of the property. What the company is entitled to ask is a fair return upon the value of that which it employs for the public convenience. On the other hand, what the public is entitled to demand is that no more be exacted from it for the use of a public highway than the services rendered by it are reasonably worth.'\n And in Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n212 \nU.S. 19, 52\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 192, 200 (53 L. Ed. 382, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034, 48 L. R. A. [N. S.] 1134), it had been made clear--\n'that the value of the property is to be determined as of the time when the inquiry is made regarding the rates. If the property, which legally enters into the consideration of the question of rates, has increased in value since it was acquired, the company is entitled to the benefit of such increase.'\n\n The rule laid down in these cases was expressly recognized as controlling, both by the commission and by the lower court. Evidence bearing on most of the facts there declared to be relevant facts was before them. The court states, and the record establishes, that--\n'The opinion of the ... commission ... evinces a full and conscientious consideration of the evidence.'\n\n The opinion of the court shows that it also made careful examination of the evidence submitted and that it recognized the applicable rules of law. While it differed from the commission in some matter of detail, it sustained the latter's finding that the value was $5,250,000. The question on which this court divided in the Southwestern Bell Telephone Case, supra, is not involved here. \n\n[262 U.S. 625, 632]\n\u00a0\n Second. Two objections to the valuation relate to the exclusion of items from the rate base, namely, the franchise to do business in Atlanta, said to be worth $1,000,000, and so-called losses from operations during recent years, alleged to aggregate $1,000,000. These items were properly excluded. The franchise in question is not a monopoly. It is merely a perpetual permit, granted by the Legislature in 1856, to maintain gas mains in the streets, alleys and public places of Atlanta without the necessity of securing the consent of the municipality. That such franchises are to be excluded in fixing the rate base was settled by Cedar Rapids Gas Co. v. Cedar Rapids, \n223 \nU.S. 655, 669\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 389, Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, \n238 \nU.S. 153, 169\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 811, and Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, \n258 U.S. 388\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 351. The allowance for the franchise made in Willcox v. Consolidated Gas. Co., \n212 \nU.S. 19, 43\n, 44 S., 48, 29 Sup. Ct. 192, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1134, was rested on special grounds which do not exist in this case. That past losses are not to be capitalized as property on which the fair return is based was held in Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., \n212 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 148; Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, \n258 U.S. 388\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 351. Here this conclusion seems even clearer than it was in those cases. The losses under consideration in the case at bar were obviously not a part of development cost. They were due to insufficiency of previous rates.\n Third. Two further objections to the rate base relate to items of property included in it, which are alleged to have been undervalued. The companies contend that the working capital required was $420,000, whereas only $266,677 was allowed. They also contend that the 'going concern' value is at least $750,000, whereas only $441,629 was allowed. These are findings of fact made by the commission and approved by the lower court. We are not satisfied that either finding is erroneous.\n Fourth. The companies contend that there was error, also, in estimating the amount of the probable net income. \n\n[262 U.S. 625, 633]\n\u00a0\n One objection relates to the federal corporate income tax (10 per cent.) assumed to be $45,3 4. The commission treated the tax as a proper operating charge. The court disallowed it, and thus increased its estimate of probable net income. In this the court erred. Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, \n258 U.S. 388\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 351. Its estimate of '$ 424,150 as the probable income per year under the new rate, with no allowance made for increased consumption or reduced cost of production that seem quite probable,' should therefore be reduced to about $380,000. This is the amount indicated by the commission's findings.\n The other objections relate to the amount of the depreciation charge. The companies say the rate should be 2 1\/2 per cent. The commission and the court allowed only 2 per cent. This question is one of fact, and we are not convinced that it was wrongly decided below. The amount of the depreciation charge is also objected to on the ground that the percentage should have been figured on a larger value. This objection depends upon the value to be placed upon the physical property which has already been discussed.\n Fifth. The probable return based on the value and the probable income found by the commission would be nearly 7 1\/4 per cent. It must be borne in mind, as pointed out in Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, supra, that, since dividends from the corporation are not included in the income on which the normal federal tax is payable by stockholders, the tax exemption is, in effect, an additional return on the investment. A return of 7 1\/4 per cent.-in addition to this tax exemption-cannot be deemed confiscatory. The solicitude of the commission to secure to the companies a fair return is shown by its treatment of them during the three years preceding the order here in question. Long prior to 1918, the gas rate had been fixed \n\n[262 U.S. 625, 634]\n\u00a0\n by the utility at $1. Operating and construction costs having risen owing to the World War, the commission raised the rate to $1.15, effective September 1, 1918; to $1.35, effective October 1, 1920; to $1.90, effective March 1, 1921. After costs had fallen materially, the rate was reduced to $1.65 June 1, 1921, and the order to reduce it to $1.55 was entered, effective January 1, 1922. In making each of these changes the commission fixed a rate which it estimated would permit the company to earn a return of about 8 per cent. on the fair value of the property. Each change of rate was made upon careful consideration. If there was error, it was error in prophecy or error of judgment in passing upon the evidence. We cannot say that the evidence compelled a conviction that the rate would prove inadequate. Compare San Diego Land & Town Co. v. National City, \n174 \nU.S. 739, 754\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 804; San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, \n189 U.S. 439\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 571; Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., \n212 \nU.S. 1, 17\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 148; Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, \n258 \nU.S. 388, 401\n, 402 S., 42 Sup. Ct. 351. Moreover, the decree is merely interlocutory.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, dissenting.\n I am constrained to dissent on the authority of Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission of Missouri et al., \n262 U.S. 276\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 544, 67 L. Ed. --, decided May 21, 1923, and Bluefield Waterworks & Improvement Co. v. Public Service Commission of West Virginia, \n262 U.S. 679\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 675, 67 L. Ed. --, decided to- day.\n These two cases follow other cases which they cited, including that of Smyth v. Ames, decided a quarter of a century ago, declaring the rule of regulation to be that, in order to fix a rate for the use of property devoted to the public service, the property must be estimated \"at the time it is being used for the public,\" and again, \"that the value of the property is to be determined as of the time when the inquiry is made regarding rates.\" \n\n[262 U.S. 625, 635]\n\u00a0\n The commission in the present case conceded the rule, and violated it, and upon a unique justification. It said:\n'The human race is only recovering from an experience the like of which the world never before endured-a world was-a world upheaval-an economic cataclysm. There are no stable measures of value to-day.'\n\n Upon this the commission departed from the values which then prevailed, and from those that the rule of law prescribed, that is, the values prevailing at the time the property was being used for the public, and reverted to the values which obtained January 1, 1914-values that had not existed for over seven years, and no prophecy could say when, if ever, they would exist again. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n To separate the company from the conditions which existed at the time of regulation was arbitrary, and condemned it, the company, to accept an inadequate return upon the value of its property, not only for the then time, but for an indefinite future time. Similar action was condemned in the Telephone Case-no 'economic cataclysm' repelling. Similar action was condemned in the Bluefield case-no 'economic cataclysm' repelling. \n2\n May I ask what had become of the 'cataclysm'? Had it settled in Georgia in conscious indulgence to life and \n\n[262 U.S. 625, 636]\n\u00a0\n business in other parts of the country from its bewildering influence?\n The contrariety of decision cannot be reconciled. To anticipate a possible criticism, however, I should say a distinction is attempted to be made between this case and the Telephone Case, a distinction, I think, not sustained by the record. It is said that the present case is unlike the Telephone Case, in that 'here the commission gave careful consideration to the cost of reproduction; but it refused to adopt reproduction cost as the measure to value.' The omission was the commission's error; it was in disregard to the rule of the cases-disregard of the value of the utility at the time of its regulation-the time it was being used by the public and such value was available. The problem was direct and simple, with no baffling element in it. It was only to find the reproduction cost of the utility, and this, necessarily, was constituted of the cost of its materials, and the cost of their fabrication, less an estimate of depreciation from the new; these costs and depreciations representing its value at the moment of time it was being regulated and being used by the public, such moment being the time prescribed by the law for the determination of its value-the determination of that upon which the rate for its use was to be based.\n There was nothing obscure or puzzling about it. The cost of the materials and of their fabrication was as much a measure of the value of the utility when reproduced as the cost of materials and their fabrication were a measure of the value of the utility when it was produced-a measure of value of reproduction and production. A measure, it is true, of different degree, which it was the duty of the commission to regard, and because the commission did not regard it-that is, because it did not consider the values at the time it was acting-its action was condemned. There are words in the \n\n[262 U.S. 625, 637]\n\u00a0\n Telephone Case that are pertinent here. Here, as there, a com ission undertook to value the property of a utility without according any weight to the greatly enhanced costs of material, labor, supplies, etc., over those prevailing at a prior time. And it may be said here, as it was said there, 'as a matter of common knowledge these increases were large.'\n The error in this case being of like kind as that which was committed by the commission in that case, it should be visited by the same treatment; that is, a reversal of its action.\n It is supposed that this case and the Telephone Case cannot coexist as declarations of law, without explanation. No attempt, however, is made to justify this case and the Bluefield Case. It seems to be taken for granted that they can coexist in the books in harmonious association. Can they?\n For answer, it is worth one's while to inquire what the Bluefield Case decides. It is said in the opinion that--\n'The record [in the case] clearly shows that the commission [whose action is reviewed] in arriving at its final figure did not accord proper, if any, weight to the greatly enhanced costs of construction in 1920 over those prevailing about 1915 and before the war, as established by uncontradicted evidence, and the company's detailed estimated cost of reproduction new, less depreciation, at 1920 prices, appears to have been wholly disregarded. This was erroneous'-citing the Telephone Case as well as other cases.\n\n From this error, all of the other errors in the case followed, and it and they constituted the mistake of the Supreme Court of West Virginia in sustaining the action of the commission, and the ground of reversal of the Supreme Court.\n The cases, this and the Bluefield Case, are identical in errors. In this case the values that existed at the time \n\n[262 U.S. 625, 638]\n\u00a0\n of regulation were wholly disregarded, and those of seven years before, those which existed in 1914-that is, before the war-were deliberately selected. This action was affirmed, as I have pointed out, by the District Court, from whose decree this appeal was taken. The decree is affirmed, which is the affirmance of the action of the commission.\n In the Bluefield Case the values of the utility at the time of regulation 'appears,' according to the declaration of the court, 'to have been wholly disregarded.'\n The Supreme Court of West Virginia affirmed the action of the commission. This court in its opinion of to-day reverses that judgment, which is a reversal of the action of the commission.\n It will be observed the commissions did exactly the same thing, and yet the action of one is affirmed, and the action of the other reversed. This contrariety of decision I cannot reconcile. There should be reversal of both, or the affirmance of both, if their identities are to be observed. I, therefore must dissent from one or the other of the cases, and, as the Bluefield Case has the support of the Telephone Case, I dissent from the present case; there being a majority against it, and those cases, besides, expressing my view of the law.\n It may be said that, if I get rid of the commission's action, I must take account of the District Court's judgment of it upon an independent consideration of the record. I realize that the challenge has serious strength, but, as the court's opinion is very long, I can only meet the challenge by what I consider the error of the opinion. The court disregarded, as the commission did, the rule of law that the value of the company's utility should be at the time it was being regulated; that is, at the time it was being used. The court, however, did not entirely agree with the commission. It said:\n'In ascertaining the present values of physical properties, though correct \n\n[262 U.S. 625, 639]\n\u00a0\n rules were announced by the commission, we do not think they were exactly followed.'\n\n And again:\n'The commission did not allow the appreciation claimed on the investment since 1914, nor did it deduct from the investments of 1919 and 1920 and 1921, which were nearly a million dollars over their admitted reproduction loss, but i did allow the appreciation in market price of real estate.'\n\n The last observation I do not pass upon, as it has no consequential bearing on the question in the case. And I proceed to say that I have the impression that the court's decision of the commission's action was influenced by the court's constitutional views. The court said that 'a rate established as reasonable, whether by the company or by the commission, is not guaranteed by the commission or by the public. Whether it will actually yield more or less than a fair return during its continuance is a risk of the business' to which the company had devoted its property.\n If this is an intimation that the court was of the view that, even if the action of the commission resulted in a return to the utility of less than that which would be fair and reasonable, it would not encounter the opposition of the Constitution, such view was error, and, laboring under the error, I can understand that the court was not anxiously concerned to investigate the grounds of the commission's action-not concerned with the 'risk of the business.'\n There are questions upon other elements of value upon which I do not consider it necessary to pass.\n I think the order denying the preliminary injunction should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] An expert witness of the commission testified as follows: 'I do not incline to the extreme high value of the war-time period, but believe that when business does resume prices will again stablize at figures considerably lower than the peak of 1920, but far above any pre-war level.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The lower federal courts have not felt the bewildering effect- impotent effect, I might say-that the commission discovered in the post- war conditions.

TOWN OF DECATUR(1923)\nNo. 463\nArgued: Decided: June 4, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 432, 433]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Walter T. Colquitt, of Atlanta, Ga., for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. J. Howell Green, of Decatur, Ga., and Frank Harwell, of Atlanta, Ga., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The defendant in error, plaintiff below, brought suit against the power and electric companies, defendants below, to enjoin them from increasing the rate of fare on a line of street railway between Decatur and the city of Atlanta. Hackman and others intervened, asserting that they resided near Atlanta and used certain car lines of defendant going to and from Atlanta, upon which a seven-cent fare was exacted, and that the contract, hereinafter referred to, giving residents of Decatur a lower rate of fare, constituted an illegal discrimination against them and against the localities where they lived. They did not allege that the seven-cent fare was unreasonable, nor did they seek any change in that rate, but merely joined with defendants in praying that the contract be held void and of no effect.\n The electric company was the owner and the power company the lessee of the lines involved. About the year 1902 the electric company owned three lines between \n\n[262 U.S. 432, 434]\n\u00a0\n Atlanta and Decatur. Desiring to abandon the most northerly of these lines, the company began to tear it up. Thereupon suit was brought for an injunction. The controversy was adjusted by an agreement between the company and the town of Decatur, by which the company was allowed to remove its line and an ordinance was enacted, carrying the agreement into effect. This ordinance, which was formally accepted, bound the company 'to never charge more than five cents for one fare upon its main Decatur line ... for one passenger and one trip upon its regular cars from the terminus of said line in the city of Atlanta to the terminus of the same in the t wn of Decatur, or from the terminus of said line in the town of Decatur to the terminus of the same in the city of Atlanta, ...' and 'to grant one transfer ticket upon the payment of one full fare for the purpose of giving one continuous ride from any point within the town of Decatur ... to any point within the city of Atlanta on any of its lines in said city and vice versa.' In pursuance of this agreement the company tore up, removed, and abandoned the northerly line and has never since restored it.\n The company maintained a five-cent fare until October, 1920, at which time it gave notice that the fare would be increased to seven cents. Prior thereto an application of the company to the Railroad Commission of Georgia for permission to make this increase had been denied, on the ground that, because of the contract, the commission was without jurisdiction. The company then sought by mandamus to compel the commission to assume jurisdiction of the question; but the application was denied by the trial court, whose ruling was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state, in so far as it related to the line covered by the contract. The present suit against the defendants was predicated upon the foregoing facts. The contentions of the defendants were that the execution of the contract \n\n[262 U.S. 432, 435]\n\u00a0\n was beyond the powers of the town; that permission to remove and abandon the northerly line furnished no consideration for it; that it constituted an attempt to fix fares outside the corporate limits of the town; that, since it was entered into, these limits had been twice extended so as to include a portion of the main line, outside the corporate limits when the contract was entered into; and that the contract could not be applied to this additional territory without impairing its obligation, in violation of the Constitution of the United States. They further contended that, in any event, the five-cent fare should be limited to passengers entering cars at the termini of the line in Atlanta and Decatur and not to those entering at intermediate points, and that, because of changed conditions since the contract was made, the five-cent fare was confiscatory. Upon an application made by the defendants, after the disposition of the mandamus proceeding, the Railroad Commission had fixed a seven-cent fare on lines not covered by the contract and required the defendants to furnish, during rush hour periods, additional seating capacity, and, on the main Decatur and College Park routes, to operate trailers during such rush hours. The commission had also ordered that no change should be made in the existing rules and practices of the company as to transfers.\n The trial court made an interlocutory order, granting a preliminary injunction, which was affirmed on writ of error by the state Supreme Court. 152 Ga. 143, 108 S. E. 615. Thereafter, the case having been remanded, defendants were allowed to amend their answer and cross-bill in several particulars. A general demurrer to these amended pleadings was sustained in part; and a jury, impaneled to try the remaining issues, found for the plaintiff by direction of the court, upon which a final decree was entered. A second writ of error from the state Supreme Court followed. That court held that its judgment upon the first \n\n[262 U.S. 432, 436]\n\u00a0\n writ of error became the law of the case and was res judicata and therefore precluded a further review and the decree of the trial court was affirmed. 153 Ga. 329, 111 S. E. 911. Deprivation of rights under the federal Constitution was duly and properly asserted. The case is here on writ of error. From motives of caution defendants also filed a petition praying the issuance of a writ of certiorari, consideration of which was postponed to await the hearing on the writ of error.\n Preliminarily, defendant in error insists that the decision of the state Supreme Court on the first writ of error affirming the interlocutory order of the trial court, was a final adjudication from which a writ of error from this court might ave been sued out, and, hence, that we are precluded from considering the present writ of error. Rio Grande Railway v. Stringham, \n239 U.S. 44\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 5, is cited and relied upon; but that case furnishes no support to the contention. There the trial court had adjudged the title to a piece of land to be in the defendant. Upon appeal the state Supreme Court reversed this judgment and remanded the case with directions to enter judgment awarding plaintiff title to a right of way over the land. The trial court followed this direction. Plaintiff again appealed, insisting, as it had done before, that it had title in fee simple; but the appellate court declined to consider the question, holding that the former decision concluded the court as well as the parties. This court held that as the judgment on the first appeal disposed of the whole case on the merits and directed that judgment should be entered, it left nothing to the judicial discretion of the trial court and was therefore final. Here the first writ of error was not from a final judgment, but from an interlocutory order granting a temporary injunction. That it did not finally dispose of the case is clear, since the trial court thereafter allowed amendments, ruled on a demurrer, impaneled a jury, directed a verdict and entered a \n\n[262 U.S. 432, 437]\n\u00a0\n final decree, and it was upon this decree that the second writ of error was brought. We are not unmindful of the ruling of the appellate court to the effect that the issues were, in fact, disposed of on the first writ of error and its powers brought to an end; but whatever may be the view of that court in respect of its own power to again consider the issues, the judgment now under review is the only one this court can consider as final, for the purpose of exercising its appellate jurisdiction. Great Western Telegraph Co. v. Burnham, \n162 \nU.S. 339, 343\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 850; United States v. Denver & Rio Grande R. R. Co., \n191 \nU.S. 84, 93\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 33; Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. McCabe, \n213 \nU.S. 207, 214\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 430; Zeckendorf v. Steinfeld, \n225 \nU.S. 445, 454\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 728. While prior decisions on the subject of what constitutes a final judgment are not entirely harmonious, the rule is established that in order to give this court appellate jurisdiction the judgment or decree 'must terminate the litigation between the parties on the merits of the case, so that if there should be an affirmance here, the court below would have nothing to do but to execute the judgment or decree it had ... rendered.' Bostwick v. Brinkerhoff, \n106 U.S. 3\n, 1 Sup. Ct. 15 and cases cited.\n We hold, therefore, that the writ of error was properly brought and come to a consideration of the substantive matters presented.\n\n 1. \nThe principal question, and the one to which the briefs and arguments are mainly directed, is, whether the agreement between the plaintiff and the electric company was within the powers of the town and is now valid and subsisting. This contract has been before the Supreme Court of Georgia in the course of the litigation on three distinct occasions: 149 Ga. 1, 98 S. E. 696, 5 A. L. R. 1; 152 Ga. 143, 108 S. E. 615; and (the instant case) 153 Ga. 329, 111 S. E. 911. That court, in carefully considered and well-reasoned opinions, sustained the authority of the municipality and upheld the contract as valid and subsisting. Defendants contend that the authority \n\n[262 U.S. 432, 438]\n\u00a0\n to fix rates devolved by the state Constitution upon the General Assembly, and therefore that the town of Decatur was without power to enter into a contract on that subject. When the contract was made the General Assembly had never exercised this authority and the state Supreme Court held that there was nothing in the Constitution of the state which precluded the municipality from contracting as to fares, and that, while the matter was one falling within the police power, whose exercise could not be abridged by contract, it was competent for the municipality to enter into such a contract where the state had not exercised and was not seeking to exercise its police power over the subject, and that this contract would remain effective until there should be conflicting legislative action. See Milwaukee Elec. Ry. v. Wisconsin R. R. Comm., \n238 \nU.S. 174, 183\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 820. This conclusion, involving, as it does, a construction of the state Constitution and laws and powers of state municipalities, is controlling upon this court, as it has decided many times. See for example, Old Colony Trust Co. v. Omaha, \n230 \nU.S. 100, 116\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 967; Claiborne County v. Brooks, \n111 \nU.S. 400, 410\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 489; City of Richmond v. Smith, 15 Wall. 429, 438.\n On the other hand, in deciding the constitutional questions presented, this court will determine for itself whether there is, in fact, a contract and, if so, the extent of its binding obligations, but will lean to an agreement with the state court. Tampa Water Works v. Tampa, \n199 U.S. 241\n, 242-243, 26 Sup. Ct. 23, and cases cited; Freeport Water Co. v. Freeport City, \n180 \nU.S. 587, 595\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 493; Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' St. Ry. Co., \n184 \nU.S. 368, 386\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 410; Milwaukee Electric Ry. v. Wisconsin R. R. Commission, supra. And considering the question in this light we see no reason to differ contract fixing electric railway fares held impaired and binding quality of the contract. The contract being valid we are not concerned with the question whether the stipulated rates are confiscatory. Southern \n\n[262 U.S. 432, 439]\n\u00a0\n Iowa Co. v. Chariton, \n255 \nU.S. 539, 542\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 400; Paducah v. Paducah R. Co., \n261 U.S. 267\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 335, 67 L. Ed. --, decided February 19, 1923\n\n\n 2. Treating the contract as valid, it is insisted that its obligation is impaired by the statutory extension of the limits of the town and the action of the court in holding the five-cent fare applicable in the added territory. While the statute does not refer to the contract or in terms make the rates applicable in the annexed territory, the necessary result of the decision of the state courts is to give it that effect, and in that way the statute, in the respect complained of, does substantially impair the obligation of the contract by adding to its burdens. Detroit United Railway v. Michigan, \n242 \nU.S. 238, 247\n, 248 S., 37 Sup. Ct. 87; Columbia C. and A. at the stipulated rate, especially Carolina, \n261 U.S. 236\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 306, 67 L. Ed. --, decided February 19, 1923.\n\n 3. \nThe state statute of August 23, 1907 (Civil Code,  2662), extends the power of the Railroad Commission to street railroad companies, but contains a proviso to the effect that it shall not be construed 'to impair any valid, subsisting contract now in existence between any municipality and any such company.' It is insisted that this proviso brings about an arbitrary classification, in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because it subjects future contracts to the power of the Commission while exempting existing contracts therefrom. But it is not shown that the classification in fact is unreasonable and arbitrary and, under the decisions of this court, we cannot say that it is obnoxious to the constitutional provision. Arkansas Natural Gas Co. v. Arkansas Railroad Commission et al., \n261 U.S. 379\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 387, 67 L. Ed. --, decided March 19, 1923, and cases cited.\n\n 4. \nWe cannot agree with the contention of defendants that the order of the commission, directing that no change be made in the matter of the issuance of free transfers is open to constitutional objection. The order of the commission \n\n[262 U.S. 432, 440]\n\u00a0\n went no further than to direct a continuance of a practice which, so far as the record discloses, was not beyond the terms of the contract providing specifically for such transfers.\n Neither are we able to say that the order of the commiss on, directing the defendants to provide additional seating capacity on some of its lines and trailers upon the line covered by the contract, was beyond its ordinary power to require adequate service. There is nothing in the contract with which the order conflicts, and such service naturally would seem to be implied, in the absence of a provision to the contrary.\n\n 5. \nOther contentions advanced by defendants we find so clearly lacking in merit that we dismiss them without special consideration.\n It results from the foregoing that the judgment below, in so far as it makes applicable the contract rates within the annexed territory cannot be sustained. The contract rates apply only to the town of Decatur, as it existed when the contract was made. To apply them to additional territory is to impose a burden upon defendants outside the contract. We find no other error; but, upon the ground stated under paragraph 2, the decree of the state Supreme Court is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Writ of certiorari denied. \n\n\n\n","91":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGORHAM MFG CO. v. WENDELL(1923)\nNo. 196\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[261 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert C. Beatty and George Carlton Comstock, both of New York City, for appellant.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On December 11, 1922, appellant made a motion to substitute the State Tax Commission of the state of New York as appellee in place of James A. Wendell, former Comptroller of the state of New York, deceased. This was consented to by Charles D. Newton, then Attorney General of New York, the other appellee. On January 1st, Charles D. Newton ceased to be Attorney General, and was succeeded in office by Carl Sherman. A second motion is made to substitute the State Tax Commission for Wendell, and Sherman, Attorney General, for Newton. The State Tax Commission and Attorney General Sherman consent to the granting of this motion; indeed, they ask that they be admitted as substituted parties. On consideration of the first motion, a rule was issued against appellant to show cause why the case as to the Comptroller should not be dismissed in view of Irwin v. Wright, \n258 U.S. 219\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 293, and United States v. Butterworth, \n169 U.S. 600\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 441. The case comes on now for disposition of the two motions.\n The suit here is a bill in equity filed by a corporation of Rhode Island in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, to enjoin the Comptroller and Attorney General of New York from collecting a corporation tax imposed on the complainant amounting to $13, 582.56, under article 9-A of the Tax Law of the \n\n[261 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n state of New York, as amended by chapters 90 and 443 of the Laws of New York of 1921. The ground alleged for the right to relief is that these chapters of the Tax Laws of New York as applied to the complainant violate its rights under the Constitution of the United States. The bill was dismissed by the District Court, and this is a direct appeal from that decree under section 238 of the Judicial Code, as amended January 28, 1915, c. 22,  2, 38 Stat. 803 (Comp. St.  1215).\n The question raised by the rule was considered by this court in Irwin v. Wright, \n258 \nU.S. 219, 222\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 293, and the existing state of the law on the substitution of public officers in suits against their predecessors in this and other federal courts was stated. A suit to enjoin a public officer from enforcing a statute or to compel him to act by mandamus is personal, and, in the absence of statutory provision for continuing it against his his successor, abates upon his death or retirement from office. In United States v. Butterworth, \n169 U.S. 600\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 441, the suit was to compel Butterworth, the Commissioner of Patents, by mandamus to issue a patent. Butterworth died pending the suit, and this court refused to allow the plaintiff in error to substitute his successor, although that successor consented to the substitution. In compliance with a suggestion from this court, Congress enacted a statute under which successors of United States officers going out of office pending litigation may now be substituted for them. Act Feb. 8, 1899, c. 121, 30 Stat. 822 (Comp. St.  1594). But the statute is not an enabling act in the case of state officers. Reference is made to Long Sault Development Co. v. Call, \n242 U.S. 272\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 79, to show from the record that in the state Supreme Court a New York State Treasurer was substituted for his predecessor in office and no objection was made here. That can hardly be regarded as an authority in this court on the point, for it passed here without notice. The same may be said of Saranac Land & Timber Co. v. Roberts, \n177 U.S. 318\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 642, also cited. There is a plain inti mation \n\n[261 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n in Irwin v. Wright, supra, however, that the federal courts can avail themselves of any state provision for substitution, for retiring state or county officers, of their successors in office in suits to enjoin them from action under color of their offices, alleged to be unauthorized of unconstitutional. This intimation is confirmed in City of Boston v. Jackson, Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, \n260 U.S. 309\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 129, 67 L. Ed. --, decided by this court December 4, 1922\n\n\n It appears from chapters 90 and 443 of Laws of New York, 1921, that the powers and duties vested in the Comptroller have been transferred to the Tax Commission; but this does not, of itself, justify the substitution of the Commission for the Comptroller in a suit which is in its essence a personal suit to prevent his personal violation of law and the rights of the complainant. Had the original suit been brought against the Tax Commission, and if the Commission is a continuous body, the retirement or death of members would not effect the abatement of the suit and successors could be substituted as parties. Irwin v. Wright, supra, \n258 U.S. 224\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 293; Marshall v. Dye, \n231 U.S. 250\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 92; Richardson v. MaChesney, \n218 \nU.S. 487, 492\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 43; Murphy v. Utter, \n186 U.S. 95\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 776. But that principle is not helpful here because the inherent difficulty in all these cases is not in the liability and suability of the successor in a new suit. It is in the shifting from the personal liability of the first officer for threatened wrong or abuse of his office to the personal liability of his successor when there is no privity between them, as there is not if the officer sued is injuring or is threatening to injure the complainant without lawful official authority. There is no legal relation between the wrong committed or about to be committed by the one, and that by the other. Of course, practically, the question usually presented in such cases is not really a personal one at all. It is the question whether a mode of enforcement of tax laws favorable to the state or county is lawfully justified, or whether the state law is warranted by the fundamental law of the state or nation. In such \n\n[261 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n cases it is, of course, of importance to the state or county that the question at issue be promptly disposed of, and that the incumbent officers charged with the defense of the state or county's interests maintain and continue that defense whether they were in office at the beginning of the litigation or not. For this reason, where such officers on behalf of state or county consent to the substitution, the federal courts need not be astute to enforce the abatement of the suit if any basis at all can be found in state law or the practice of the state courts for substitution of the successors in office.\n In the case before us, counsel have cited the new Civil Practice Act of New York, that took effect October 1, 1921, which indicates a broad policy of joining of all parties to any controversy who are necessary to, or proper for, a determination thereof at any stage of the cause and as the ends of justice may require. Sections 192, 193, and 211 are cited. Undoubtedly these sections are very liberal but it may be doubted whether they meet the requirement here or were intended to do so. We need not decide this question, however, for we find ourselves able to reach the right conclusion by accepting the declaration of the Court of Appeals of New York in People ex rel. Broderick v. Morton, 156 N. Y. 136, 50 N. E. 791, 41 L. R. A. 231, 66 Am. St. Rep. 547. In that case a point was raised ( though it must be admitted its disposition was not necessary to the ultimate conclusion of the court), as to whether an incoming state officer could be substituted as defendant in a mandamus suit brought against his predecessor. The law did provide for such substitutions in suits against county and municipal officers. Upon this point the Court of Appeals, at page 148 of 156 N. Y., at page 795 of 50 N. E. (41 L. R. A. 231, 66 Am. St. Rep. 547), said:\n'But there is no apparent reason why the provisions of the Code controlling actions and special proceedings against county, town and municipal officers, should not apply as well to state officers. The practice therein provided for is simple and affords ample protection to all \n\n[261 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n parties. Section 1930 provides: 'In such an action or special proceeding, the court must, in a proper case, substitute a successor in office, in place of a person made a party in his official capacity, who has died or ceased to hold office; but such a successor shall not be substituted as a defendant, without his consent, unless at least fourteen days' notice of the application for the substitution, has been personally served upon him.'\n\n We infer from this and from the substitution, already referred to, made by the Supreme Court of New York in Long Sault Co. v. Homer D. Call, Treasurer of New York, \n242 U.S. 272\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 79; Matter of Long Sault Development Co., 212 N. Y. 1, 105 N. E. 849, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 56, that such substitutions are a matter of state practice and law, and as already said, this enables us to avail ourselves in such a case as this of that practice. City of Boston v. Jackson, supra.\n The motions for substitution of the State Tax Commission of New York for Wendell, Comptroller, and of Sherman, Attorney General, for Newton, Attorney General, will be granted. \n\n\n\n","92":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGRAHAM v. DU PONT(1923)\nNo. 846\nArgued: April 30, 1923Decided: May 21, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 234, 235]\n\u00a0\n This is a proceeding by certiorari to review the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit in affirming on appeal a temporary injunction granted by the District Court of Delaware restraining the then Collector of Internal Revenue for the District of Delaware from levying a distraint against the property of the complainant, Alfred I. Dupont, to collect the sum of $1,576,015.06 assessed against him by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n In a reorganization of a Dupont Powder Company of New Jersey and the organization of a new Dupont Powder Company of Delaware to take over many of the assets of the old company, the complainant in the year 1915 received 75,534 shares of the common stock of the Delaware company of the par value of $100 each. The transaction was the subject of consideration by this court in United States v. Phellis, \n257 U.S. 156\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 63, where it was determined that shares in the Delaware company received by stockholders of the New Jersey company, as the complainant received his, at the rate of two in the Delaware company in exchange for one in the New Jersey company, was a separation of past accumulation of profits from the capital of the New Jersey company and a distribution to the stockholders, and thus constituted taxable income under the Income Tax Law of 1913 (38 Stat. 114).\n The complainant filed a return and an amended return \n\n[262 U.S. 234, 336]\n\u00a0\n in March, 1916, of his income for the year 1915, in which he did not include these shares. In November, 1917, the department began an investigation into the liability of the complainant to pay an income tax on his shares of stock in the Delaware company and finally ordered an assessment of $1,576,015.06. The complainant was notified of this assessment made December 31, 1919. He replied the next day that as his return for 1915 was filed before March 15, 1916, and as the law required any assessment for additional amount to be made within three years, and that period had expired, the assessment and demand for payment were illegal. On February 2, 1920, a hearing was granted to counsel for complainant by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n On March 8, 1920, complainant filed a claim for the abatement of the assessment of $1,576,051.06 as void, because made after the limitation of three years had expired, and because the tax was on something that was not income under the law.\n Thereafter by agreement between the stockholders similarly situated, one stockholder, Phellis, paid the tax due under a similar assessment and brought suit in the Court of Claims to recover it. Counsel for the complainant herein took part in the argument of that case. The Court of Claims gave judgment against the United States, but on appeal the judgment was reversed. The opinion of the court was handed down November 21, 1921. All claims for abatement had been held and not decided by the Commissioner under an agreement with the counsel in the Phellis Case. Thereafter the Commissioner rejected complainant's claim for abatement. The bill of complainant was filed January 30, 1922. The District Court granted the temporary injunction. The Circuit Court of Appeals on appeal affirmed the temporary injunction for the reasons stated in the opinion of the District Court. \n\n[262 U.S. 234, 237]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n\n\n[262 U.S. 234, 241]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. A. Glasgow, Jr., of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n\n[262 U.S. 234, 254]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Section 3224, Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  5947), provides that 'no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court.' In Cheatham v. United States, \n92 U.S. 85\n, 88; State Railroad Taxes, \n\n[262 U.S. 234, 255]\n\u00a0\n \n92 U.S. 575\n, 613, and in Snyder v. Marks, \n109 \nU.S. 189, 193\n, 3 S. Sup. Ct. 157, it was said that the system prescribed by the United States in regard to both customs duties and internal revenue taxes, of stringent measures not judicial, to collect them, with appeals to specified tribunals and suits to recover back moneys illegally exacted, was a system of corrective justice intended to be complete, and enacted under the right belonging to the government to prescribe the conditions on which it would subject itself to the judgment of the courts in the collection of its revenues. In the exercise of that right, it declares by paragraph 3224 that its officers shall not be enjoined from collecting a tax claimed to have been unjustly assessed, when those officers, in the course of general jurisdiction over the subject-matter in question, have made the assessment and claim that it is valid. This view has been approved in Shelton v. Plate, \n139 U.S. 591\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 646, in Pittsburg Ry. v. Board of Public Works, \n172 U.S. 32\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 90, in Pacific Whaling Co. v. United States, \n187 \nU.S. 447, 451\n, 452 S., 23 Sup. Ct. 154, in Dodge v. Osborn, \n240 \nU.S. 118, 121\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 275, and in Bailey, Collector, v. George, \n259 U.S. 16\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 419.\n The District Court recognized the sweep of these decisions in respect of the contention of the complainant that the assessment of this tax and the threatened distraint to collect it were barred by limitations under the statute, and was of opinion that as a rule such attacks upon the validity of the tax could only be heard and considered after the tax had been paid in a suit to recover it back. In this view we fully concur.\n The District Court, however, thought that an exception to the operation of section 3224 must arise when it appeared, as it held it did appear here, that no provision of law existed by which if the taxpayer when he filed his bill for an injunction had paid the tax assessed, he could bring a suit to recover it back because it would be barred by the statutory limitation of time in which such a suit could be brought. \n\n[262 U.S. 234, 256]\n\u00a0\n The court based its conclusion on section 252 of the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1085, c. 18 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 uu]), re- enacted in the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. pt. 1, p. 268, c. 136), which reads as follows:\n'If upon examination of any return of income made pursuant to ... the Act of October 3, 1913, ... it appears that an amount of income ... tax has been paid in excess of that properly due, then, notwithstanding the provisions of section 3228, R. S., the amount of the excess shall be credited against any income ... taxes, or installments thereof, then due from the tax payer under any other return, and any balance of such excess shall be immediately refunded to the tax payer: Provided, that no such credit or refund shall be allowed or made after five years from the date when the return was due unless before the expiration of such five years a claim therefor is filed by the tax payer.'\n\n The return was due March 15, 1916. The assessment was made December 31, 1919. The complainant might then have paid the tax and would have had two years in which to make his claim, and, if rejected, to sue to recover it back if, as he now submits, section 252 limited his right to pay and sue to recover. Under such a construction and application of section 252, suit must have been brought on or before March 15, 1921. This is what Phellis did (United States v. Phellis, \n257 U.S. 156\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 63), and there was no question raised as to his right to bring the suit in the Court of Claims to recover back the tax paid by him, if it had proved to be illegally assessed and collected. Certainly complainant could not, by delaying his payment until his right to sue to recover it back expired, make a case so extraordinary and entirely exceptional as to render section 3224, Revised Statutes, inapplicable.\n If it be said that he was waiting for the Commissioner to act on his claim for abatement of the assessment, it is enough to say tha the Commissioner's delay until after the decision of the Phellis Case in November, 1921, was \n\n[262 U.S. 234, 257]\n\u00a0\n due to agreement by the parties. Nor was he prevented from paying the assessment by his claim for abatement.\n The cases complainant's counsel rely on do not apply. The cases of Lipke v. Lederer, \n259 U.S. 557\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 549, and Regal Drug Corporation v. Wardell, \n260 U.S. 386\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 152, 67 L. Ed. --, decided December 11, 1922, were not cases of enjoining taxes at all. They were illegal penalties in the nature of punishment for a criminal offense. Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 U.S. 429\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 673, and Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n240 U.S. 1\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 236, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713, L. R. A. 1917D, 414, were suits by stockholders against corporations to restrain the corporations from paying taxes alleged to be unconstitutional. Hill v. Wallace, \n259 U.S. 44\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 453, was in part a suit like the foregoing. It was a bill filed by members of the Chicago Board of Trade to prevent the governing board from applying to the Secretary of Agriculture to have the Board of Trade designated as a 'contract market' under the Future Trading Act (42 Stat. 187), on the ground that the act was unconstitutional and its operation would impair the value of the board to its members. Without such designation, no member could have sold grain for future delivery without paying a prohibitive tax, and if he sold without paying the tax, he was subjected to heavy criminal penalties. To pay such a tax on each of the many thousands of transactions on the board, and to sue to recover them back, would have been utterly impracticable. it would have blocked the entire future grain business of the country and would have seriously injured, not only the members of the board, but also the producing and consuming public. This phase of the situation was so clear that the government in effect consented to the temporary injunction. See Hill v. Wallace, \n257 U.S. 310\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 168, Id., \n257 U.S. 615\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 96. Under these extraordinary and most exceptional circumstances, it was held that section 3224 was not applicable to prevent an injunction against collection of such a prohibitive tax imposed for the purpose of regulating the future grain \n\n[262 U.S. 234, 258]\n\u00a0\n business with all the unnecessary and disastrous consequences its enforcement would entail if the act was unconstitutional. Hill v. Wallace should, in fact, be classed with Lipke v. Lederer, \n259 U.S. 557\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 549, as a penalty in the form of a tax. Certainly we have no such case here.\n This conclusion renders it unnecessary for us to consider whether section 252 of the Revenue Act of 1921, in connection with section 3226, Revised Statutes, as amended by the same Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 314 ,  1318), barred complainant's right to pay the tax and sue to recover it back at the time of filing his bill, as held by the District Court. It is certain that by the amendments to section 252 and section 3226, Revised Statutes, by the Act of March 4, 1923 (Public No. 527), the complainant is given the right now to pay the tax, and sue to recover it back, and in such a suit to raise the questions as to the value of the stock and the amount of the resulting tax and also as to the bar of time against the assessment which he attempted to raise in the bill.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court, with directions to dissolve the temporary injunction and to dismiss the bill. \n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGREAT LAKES DREDGE & DOCK CO. v.

D. That company claims the tract under a grant of station grounds made by the United States to the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railway Company, and the defendants claim the same under a patent from the United States to Philander Pollock. The defendants prevailed in the trial court and in the Supreme Court of the state. 183 N. W. 1013. A writ of certiorari brings the case here. \n257 U.S. 629\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 92.\n At a time when the lands in that vicinity were public lands, the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railway Company, being duly qualified so to do, sought and secured \n\n[261 U.S. 119, 121]\n\u00a0\n a right of way through the same under the Act of March 3, 1875, c. 152, 18 Stat. 482 (Comp. St.  4921-4926), and constructed its road within and along such right of way. At the same time and in the same way it sought and secured certain lands two miles east of the present site of Springbrook for station grounds. Afterwards it changed its station to a point adjacent to such site, and proceeded to give up the original station grounds and to select others, including the tract in controversy, in their stead. It made the requisite survey of the new grounds, prepared a map thereof and on January 12, 1900, filed the map in the local land office, whence it was to be transmitted to the General Land Office and laid before the Secretary of the Interior. The map was returned to the company for amendment in particulars not shown in the record, was amended accordingly, and on July 18, 1900, was refiled in the local land office. The local officers then transmitted it to the General Land Office, and on October 18, 1900, the Secretary of the Interior approved it, 'subject to all valid existing rights.' On being advised of the Secretary's approval, the local officers should have noted the disposal on the townshi plat and tract book in their office, but this was not done. The approved map and all papers relating thereto were preserved in the General Land Office in the usual way, and a certified copy of the map and of some of the papers was produced in evidence at the trial.\n On January 12, 1900, when the map was first filed in the local land office, the tract in question was public land and free from any claim; but before July 18, 1900, when the map was refiled, the tract was included, with other land, in a preliminary homestead entry made by John Welo. That entry remained intact until May 13, 1901, and was then relinquished by Welo and canceled. On August 19, 1902, the tract was included, with other land, in a preliminary homestead entry made by Philander Pollock, and on June 1, 1903, he released the 40-acre subdivision containing \n\n[261 U.S. 119, 122]\n\u00a0\n this tract from that entry, and made another and unrelated entry of the same subdivision. Under the latter entry a patent for the full subdivision was issued to him on February 28, 1906\n\n\n Pollock and others, whom he interested in the project, platted the greater part of the 40-acre subdivision, including the tract in question, as a town site. The defendants purchased from them some of the lots, which, as platted, cover part of this tract.\n The station grounds shown on the map approved by the Secretary of the Interior consist of a long strip of land 100 feet wide extending along one side of the right of way at Springbrook. The tract in question is part of that strip and is in close proximity to the tracks and depot.\n The rights of the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railway Company in the road, right of way, station grounds, etc., passed to the plaintiff, the Great Northern Railway Company, in 1907.\n The Supreme Court of the state, in rejecting the plaintiff's claim under the grant of station grounds and sustaining the defendants' claim under the patent to Pollock, put its decision on two independent grounds. One was that, when the map was refiled in the local land office, and when it was approved by the Secretary of the Interior, the tract in question was included in Welo's preliminary homestead entry, and therefore was not subject to disposal under the act of 1875, and that the Secretary excluded it from his approval by making the latter 'subject to all valid existing rights.' The other was that thereafter the land officers permitted Pollock to make an entry of the 40-acre subdivision containing this tract, issued to him a certificate of final entry making no reference to the railroad company's claim, and gave him a patent purporting to cover the entire subdivision, and that the defendants purchased from Pollock in good faith, relying on the final certificate and patent so issued to him. \n\n[261 U.S. 119, 123]\n\u00a0\n The pertinent provisions of the act of 1875 are as follows:\n'Section 1. That the right of way through the public lands of the United States is hereby granted to any railroad company duly organized under the laws of any state or territory, except the District of Columbia, or by the Congress of the United States, which shall have filed with the Secretary of the Interior a copy of its articles of incorporation, and due proofs of its organization under the same, to the extent of one hundred feet on each side of the central line of said road; and also the right to take, from the public lands adjacent to the line of said road, material, earth, stone, and timber necessary for the construction of said railroad; also ground adjacent to such right of way for station buildings, depots, machine shops, side tracks, turnouts, and water stations, not to exceed in amount twenty acres for each station, to the extent of one station for each ten miles of its road.'\n\n'Sec. 3. That the Legislature of the proper territory may provide for the manner in which private lands and possessory claims on the public lands of the United States may be condemned; and where such provision shall not have been made, such condemnation may be made in accordance with  ction three of the act entitled [an act to amend an act entitled] 'An act to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri river to the Pacific Ocean, and to secure to the government the use of the same for postal, military, and other purposes, approved July first, eighteen hundred and sixty- two,' approved July second, eighteen hundred and sixty-four.\n\n'Sec. 4. That any railroad company desiring to secure the benefits of this act, shall, within twelve months after the location of any section of twenty miles of its road, if the same be upon surveyed lands, and, if upon unsurveyed lands, within twelve months after the survey thereof by \n\n[261 U.S. 119, 124]\n\u00a0\n the United States, file with the register of the land office for the district where such land is located a profile of its road; and upon approval thereof by the Secretary of the Interior the same shall be noted upon the plats of said office; and thereafter all such lands over which such right of way shall pass shall be disposed of subject to such right of way: Provided, that if any section of said road shall not be completed within five years after the location of said section, the rights herein granted shall be forfeited as to any such uncompleted section of said road.\n\n'Sec. 5. That this act shall not apply to any lands within the limits of any military, park, or Indian reservation, or other lands especially reserved from sale, unless such right of way shall be provided for by treaty-stipulation or by act of Congress heretofore passed.'\n\n Comp. St.  4921, 4923-4925.\n As with other public land laws, the Secretary of the Interior was empowered to prescribe regulations for carrying the act into effect. Such regulations were prescribed. Those in force at the times to which the controversy relates were promulgated November 4, 1898. 27 L. D. 663.\n In some respects the act was loosely drafted, but through a long course of administration in the land department and many adjudications in the courts its meaning and effect have come to be pretty well settled. Its purpose was to enhance the value and hasten the settlement of the public lands by inviting and encouraging the construction and operation of needed and convenient lines of railroad through them. Nothing was granted for private use or disposal, nor beyond what Congress deemed reasonably essential, presently or prospectively, for the quasi public used indicated. Because of this, the act has been regarded as requiring a more liberal construction than is accorded to private grants or to the extensive land grants formerly made to some of the railroads. United States v. Denver & Rio Grande Ry. Co., \n150 U.S. 1\n, 8, \n\n[261 U.S. 119, 125]\n\u00a0\n 14, 14 Sup. Ct. 11; And see Kindred v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n225 \nU.S. 582, 596\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 780; Nadeau v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 442, 444\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 570. There is no provision in the act for the issue of a patent, but this does not detract from the efficacy of the grant. The approved map is intended to be the equivalent of a patent defining the grant conformably to the intendment of the act (Noble v. Union River Logging R. Co., \n147 U.S. 165\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 271), and to relate back, as against intervening claims, to the date when the map was filed in the local land office for transmission through the General Land Office to the Secretary of the Interior (Stalker v. Oregon Short Line R. R. Co., \n225 U.S. 142\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 636).\n In the state court the defendants sought to make the point that when the company secured the station grounds two miles east of the present site of Springbrook it exhausted its right under the act and therefore could not select or take the new grounds. But the point is without merit. The company did not try to hold the original grounds and also to secure the new ones. As shown by the map, it surrendered the former and sought the latter in their stead. By approving the map the Secretary of the Interior assented to the change-presumably ecause it appeared to be one which would subserve the interests of the public as well as those of the company. It was the practice of the land department to permit such changes. As the United States found no ground for objecting, others who had no interest in the premises at the time are not in a position to complain. Washington & Idaho R. R. Co. v. Coeur d'Alene Ry. Co., \n160 \nU.S. 77, 97\n, 98 S., 16 Sup. Ct. 231.\n The railway company contends that its rights under the approved map relate back to the time when the map was first filed in the local land office rather than to the time of the refiling; and, in furtherance of the contention, the company asks that we take judicial notice of the files in the General Land Office, which it says will show that that \n\n[261 U.S. 119, 126]\n\u00a0\n the amendments made in the map between the filing and refiling were so unsubstantial that there was no real alteration. But we think the files in such a proceeding are not within the range of judicial notice and that if there was any purpose to rely on them in this connection they, or a certified copy of them, should have been produced in evidence at the trial. It cannot be merely assumed that the amendments were immaterial, and, in the absence of any proof of their nature and extent, the date of refiling, which was after they were made, must be taken as the time to which rights under the approved map relate.\n We have seen that when the map was refiled, and when it was approved, the tract in question was included in Welo's preliminary homestead entry. The Supreme Court of the state thought this prevented any right in the tract from passing to the company under the approved map, and that the words, 'subject to all valid existing rights,' were inserted in the approval to show the tract was excluded. We reach a different conclusion.\n The words quoted were not peculiar to this map, but were commonly inserted in the approvals of that period. Their office was not to show that any of the land designated on the map was excluded from the grant, but to direct attention to what under the act would be true without them- namely, that the grant was to be effective as against the United States, but was not to impair valid existing claims of settlers or others, and that to make the grant effective against such claimants their rights should be extinguished through private negotiations or, if need be, through condemnation proceedings. See section 3 before quoted and section 2288, Rev. Stats. (Comp. St.  4535).\n That Welo had a valid existing right in virtue of his preliminary entry must be conceded. But it was only an inchoate right to acquire the title by residing on the land and otherwise complying with the homestead law for a \n\n[261 U.S. 119, 127]\n\u00a0\n prescribed period. The title and real ownership were in the United States. Welo was under no obligation to perfect his claim. He could abandon it or relinquish it, but could not transfer it to another. Subject only to his claim the approved map vested in the company a complete right to the tract for station purposes. He voluntarily relinquished his entry and thus put an end to his claim. Nothing then stood in the way of the company's right. It was as if Welo's claim never had existed.\n Unlike the lands grants considered in cases like Kansas Pacific Ry. Co. v. Dunmeyer, \n113 \nU.S. 629, 639\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 566, and Hastings & Dakota R. Co. v. Whitney, \n132 \nU.S. 357, 361\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 112, the act of 1875 contains no provision whereby lands covered by homestead or similar claims when the grant attaches are excluded from it. On the contrary, a survey of all that the act does contain shows that the grant is intended to include lands of that class, but with the qualification, plainly implied in the third section, that due compensation must be made to the claimants for their inchoate or possessory rights to make the grant operative against them. Washington & Idaho R. R. Co. v. Osborn, \n160 \nU.S. 103, 109\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 219. An abandonment f the claims relieves the grant of the qualification. On this question the decisions have been very plain. It was before the Supreme Court of North Dakota in Jamestown & Northern R. R. Co. v. Jones, 7 N. D. 619, 76 N. W. 227, which related to a right of way over which the railroad was constructed in advance of the filing and approval of the map. The part in controversy was included in an existing pre-emption claim when the road was constructed and also when the map was filed and approved. Afterwards the pre-emption claim was abandoned. Thereupon another claimant, who had settled on the land after the construction of the road and before the filing or approval of the map, made an entry of the same tract and received a patent-the entry papers and patent containing no exception of the right of \n\n[261 U.S. 119, 128]\n\u00a0\n way. Two points were involved. One was whether the grant of the right of way attached as of the date when the road was constructed or as of the time when the map was filed or approved; and the other was whether the pre- emption claim which was in existence at all of these times operated to except the land from the grant. The decision on the latter point is shown in the following excerpt from the opinion:\n'When the act of 1875 is construed as a whole, we believe that, as against the United States, the right of way is transferred, even when the land the been entered at the time the map is approved, and that, if such entry is subsequently abandoned or set aside, the grantee will enjoy an absolute easement in the land. The rights of the railroad company will be subject to all rights which have attached to the land before the filing and approval of the map of definite location. But, as against the United States, the grant is as effective in cases where the land has been entered as where it has not. Under any other view of the statute, the railroad company might be compelled to condemn successive rights of settlers, only to find that all its proceedings were futile, because in each case the settler's rights were, by cancellation or abandonment, destroyed. We think that it was the purpose of Congress to make the grant operative as against the government, subject only to existing rights of settlers, and that the question whether a particular piece of land was within the terms of the grant, so far as the government was concerned, was not to depend upon the freedom of that land from settlement at the time the map was approved. Under this view of the statute, a railroad company could never be required to condemn any other than existing rights.'\n\n Other courts in the public land States have decided the question in the same way. Hamilton v. Spokane & Palouse R. R. Co., 3 Idaho, 164, 28 Pac. 408; Bonner v. Rio Grande \n\n[261 U.S. 119, 129]\n\u00a0\n Southern R. Co. 31 Colo. 446, 72 Pac. 1065; Alexander v. Kansas City, Ft. Scott & Memphis R. Co., 138 Mo. 464, 40 S. W. 104.\n The case of Jamestown & Northern R. R. Co. v. Jones was brought here on writ of error and the railroad company's claim to the right of way was upheld-the decision of the Supreme Court of North Dakota being disapproved as respects the time as of which the grant attached and sustained as respects the effect of the pre-emption claim which was in existence at that time and afterwards abandoned. \n177 U.S. 125\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 568. The opinion in the present case does not refer to that case, and we assume it was overlooked. Otherwise it doubtless would have been followed, as it should have been.\n We come, then, to the ruling that the defendants purchased from Pollock in good faith relying on the ceftificate and patent issued to him, and so are entitled to prevail.\n The claim on which Pollock received the certificate and patent was initiated more than two years after the new station grounds passed to the company under the approved map. True, the local land officers neglected to note that disposal on the township plat and tract book in their office; but this did not prejudice or affect the company's title. The noting was required y way of continuing a practice, which had long prevailed, of making the township plats and tract books in the land office of each district a fair and helpful index of all public land transactions in the district. Of course, a faithful adherence to the practice serves to prevent plural and conflicting disposals of the same lands, while a neglect of duty in that regard by the local officers sometimes, as here, results in confusing disposals. But the land department always has ruled that such a neglect of duty affords no justification for subordinating a senior to a junior claim or for making a second disposal in disregard of a prior one. Edward R. Chase, 1 Land Dec. 81; Goist v. Bottum, 5 Land Dec. 643; Edward Young, \n\n[261 U.S. 119, 130]\n\u00a0\n 9 Land Dec. 32; Baird v. Chapman's Heirs, 10 Land Dec. 210; Linville v. Clearwaters, 11 Land Dec. 356. In reason the point could not be ruled otherwise, for this would mean that a patent or its equivalent, although issued after full examination of the claim by the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the Secretary of the Interior, could be thwarted or made of no avail by a subsequent omission on the part of the local land officers, notwithstanding this court has adjudged that such a conveyance, when regularly issued and recorded in the General Land Office, passes the title and cannot be recalled or canceled by even the Secretary of the Interior. United States v. Schurz, \n102 U.S. 378\n. The effect of such omissions often has been considered by this court and always has been determined along the lines just indicated. It will suffice to refer to two of the cases. In Van Wyck v. Knevals, \n106 U.S. 360\n, 1 Sup. Ct. 336, one party claimed under a land grant to a railroad company and the other under a patent issued on a cash entry. The grant was to attach when the route of the road was definitely fixed, and the Secretary of the Interior was then to withdraw from market all lands falling within the grant. A map definitely fixing the route was filed by the company with the Secretary and was accepted by him, but the intended withdrawal was not sent to the local land office for a half month or more. During that interval the cash entry was allowed and a patent certificate issued thereon. This court sustained the claim under the grant as being first in time, and, in defining the rights which the company acquired through the filing and acceptance of the map, said (106 U. S. at page 367, 1 Sup. Ct. 339 [27 L. Ed. 201]):\n'No further action is required of the company to establish the route. It then becomes the duty of the Secretary to withdraw the lands granted from market. But if he should neglect this duty, the neglect would not impair the rights of the company, however prejudicial it might prove to others.'\n\n In Stalker v. Oregon Short Line R. Co., \n225 U.S. 142\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 636, the railroad \n\n[261 U.S. 119, 131]\n\u00a0\n company was relying on a grant of station grounds under the act of 1875, which the local land officers neglected to note on their records, and the other party was claiming under a patent issued on a pre-emption claim. The Supreme Court of Idaho had sustained the claim of the railroad company because the map of the station grounds was filed in the local land office before the pre-emption claim was initiated (14 Idaho, 371, 94 Pac. 59), and that decision was affirmed by this court on the following grounds (225 U. S. at page 153, 32 Sup. Ct. 640 [56 L. Ed. 1027]):\n'First, if we are right in holding that the grant vested in the company when the plat was approved, as of the date when filed, the failure of the officer in the district land office to properly mark the [township] plat could not operate to defeat the grant; and, secondly, the railroad company having done everything which it was required by law to do, should not be affected by the negligence of the register in not doing a duty upon which the vesting of title as against the United States did not depend.'\n\n And also (225 U. S. at page 154, 32 Sup. Ct. 64 [56 L. Ed. 1027]):\n'We therefore conclude that the subsequent issue of a patent to the land entered by Reed [the pre-emptor] was subject to the rights of the railroad company theretofore acquired by approval of its station ground map. The patent is not an adjudication concluding the paramount right of the company, but, in so far as it included lands validly acquired theretofore, was in violation of law, and inoperative to pass title.'\n\n When Pollock initiated his claim to the 40-acre subdivision, which includes the tract in question, the railroad was constructed and being operated across that subdivision, and this was true when the defendants purchased from him. Besides, the defendants understood, as did the community in general, that the company was not claiming under Pollock and that its rights, whatever they were, were older than his. These circumstances should have put the defendants on inquiry respecting the nature and extent of the company's claim and should have prompted \n\n[261 U.S. 119, 132]\n\u00a0\n them to make the inquiry with particular regard to the situation before Pollock's claim was initiated-when the subdivision was public land. So far as appears they made no inquiry, but relied on the absence of any excepting clause in Pollock's certificate and patent, neither of which could bind the company or affect its prior rights. Among other sources of information they could have interrogated the company or its agent who was close at hand, but this was not done. In short they neglected the warning which inhered in the circumstances we have recited. The act of 1875 was a public statute applicable to public lands in that region and some notice should have been taken of it. We have seen that it made provision for acquiring a general right of way of a uniform width and for securing additional grounds for various station purposes; such grounds being in the nature of local extensions of the general right of way. A complete record of the company's proceedings under that act was kept in the usual way in the General Land Office, and it is reasonably certain that the defendants would have learned of those proceedings had they heeded the promptings of the situation in which they purchased. They therefore were chargeable with notice of those proceedings. Brush v. Ware, 15 Pet. 93, 111.\n The defendants interposed the defense of laches and also a local statute of limitations, but the Supreme Court of the state did not rule on either. Neither was applicable to the case. The tract in question was not granted for private use or disposal, but only for the quasi public uses named in the act. In other words, the company received the tract on the implied condition that it be devoted to those uses. A breach of the condition subjects the grant to a forfeiture by the United States; but neither laches on the part of the company nor any local statute of limitations can invest individuals with any interest in the tract, or with a right to use it for private purposes, \n\n[261 U.S. 119, 133]\n\u00a0\n without the sanction of the United States. Northern Pacific R. Co v. Smith, \n171 \nU.S. 260, 275\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 794; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Townsend, \n190 U.S. 267\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 671; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v.

U S(1923)\nNo. 31\nArgued: November 17, 1922Decided: January 2, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 512, 513]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. M. Hampton Todd, of Philadelphia, Pa., and Percy L. Housel, of Riverhead, L. I., N. Y., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Ottinger, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Greenport Company had, in 1917, an invested capital of $215,615. 55. Its net income was $76,361.20 in the taxable year ending October 31, 1917. Its pre-war annual net income, calculated on a 7 per cent. basis, was $15,093.08, and the fixed statutory deduction $3,000. The company was thus subject (for five-sixths of the year) to the excess profits tax imposed by the Revenue Act of October 3, 1917, c. 63,  201, 203, 40 Stat. 300, 303, 304, being Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 3\/8 b, 6336 3\/8 d).1 The government, following Treasury Regulation No. 41, articles 16, 17, and form 1103, assessed the tax at $16,837.76. The company insisted that the correct amount was $12,417.36; paid the tax as assessed, under protest; and brought this suit for the difference, $4,420. 40, in the \n\n[260 U.S. 512, 514]\n\u00a0\n federal court for the Eastern District of New York, under the Tucker Act ( Judicial Code,  24, par. 20 [Comp. St.  991]). That court sustained a demurrer to the petition and entered judgment for defendant. 269 Fed. 58. The case is brought here by both writ of error and appeal. It is properly here on writ of error, Chase v. United States, \n155 U.S. 489\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 174; J. Homer Fritch, Inc., v. United States, \n248 U.S. 458\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 158. The sole question presented for decision is whether the method of calculating the taxes adopted by the Treasury is in harmony with the provisions of the Revenue Act.\n The rate of exaction imposed by the excess profits tax grows, in stages, with the increase in the percentage earned on the capital. In the first stage-net income up to 15 per cent. on capital-the rate of exaction is four-twentieths. In the second stage-net income from 15 to 20 per cent.- the rate is five-twentieths. In the third stage-net income from 20 to 25 per cent.-the rate is seven-twentieths. In the fourth stage-net income from 25 to 33 per cent.-the rate is nine-twentieths. In the last stage-net income over 33 per cent.-the rate is twelve-two methods of calculation are shown in the twentieths. What the net income is to which the respective rates of exaction apply is the question for decision. The company contends, in effect, that net in \n\n[260 U.S. 512, 515]\n\u00a0\n come as used concerning each stage, means not the whole net income-but the balance remaining after deducting from the net income the allowance for pre-war profits and the fixed deduction. Under this contention the base to which the exactions should be applied would be, not $76,261.20, but that sum less $18,093.08, or $58,268.12. The government insists that the exaction should be applied to the whole net income, except that from the net income prescribed for the first stage the allowances specifically provided for are to be deducted. \n2\n The differences in detail resulting from the margin. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[515-Continued]\n 3 Methods of Computation.

EUREKA PIPE LINE CO(1923)\nNo. 569\nArgued: Decided: April 9, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[261 U.S. 393, 394]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. S. B. Avis, Fred O. Blue, Wm. G. Mathews, and E. T. England, all of Charleston, W. Va., for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Frank L. Crawford, of New York City, and James M. Beck, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an effort by writ of error, and if that is inappropriate for the purpose, by an application for a writ of certiorari, to review the action of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia in the judgment which it entered in avowed and attempted compliance with the judgment of this court in the case on writ of error sub nomine Eureka Pipe Line Co. v. Hallanan et al., \n257 U.S. 265\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 101. It is contended by the state authorities seeking review here that the Supreme Court of Appeals did not enter the judgment required by our mandate and that we should in some appropriate way direct that court specifically what judgment it should enter.\n A summary of the litigation must needs be made in order that the controversy may be understood and decided.\n The pipe line company filed a bill against the state tax commissioner and other state authorities to enjoin them from enforcing a statute of the state which forbade any one to engage in the business of transporting petroleum in pipe lines without the payment of a tax of two cents for each barrel of oil transported. The pipe line company owned a system of pipe lines by which it transported 22,000,000 of barrels in the year ending June 30, \n\n[261 U.S. 393, 395]\n\u00a0\n 1919. Of this, it was admitted that 1,239,000 barrels had their origin in West Virginia and their destination there, and that the privilege of transporting that amount might be taxed; but it was insisted that the remainder was a stream of interstate commerce, the privilege of conducting which could not be taxed under the commerce clause of the federal Constitution. The circuit court, in which the bill was filed and the causes heard, held that the remainder was interstate commerce and no privilege tax could be imposed on a pipe line company engaging in it. It conceded that it would be competent for the Legislature to collect a privilege tax for the purely intrastate transportation of the 1,239,000 barrels already mentioned, but it inquired whether the state had done this by the act in question, and said:\n'If it can be contended that the tax affects this particular oil it is only incidental to the like tax imposed upon the whole body of oil transported. It is plain the Legislature did not mean to distinguish as between the two classes of oil, for the act makes no attempt at a division. We are not able to say from an inspection of the act whether or not the Legislature would have imposed the tax upon the privilege of handling this intrastate oil alone, had it been exempting the balance of the oil when framing the law, as we think it should have done. Whether it would have made the tax applicable to the West Virginia oil alone, no one can say; and this we understand to be the test of whether or not the act is divisible. Eckhart v. State, 5 W. Va. 515; Robertson v. Preston, 97 Va. 296, 33 S. E. 618; Trimble v. Com., 96 Va. 818, 32 S. E. 786.'\n\n Accordingly the circuit court held the whole act bad and granted an injunction against enforcing it against the pipe line 'in any respect.'\n On appeal the Supreme Court of Appeals held that the act was to be construed as applying to pipe lines only so far as they were engaged in intrastate commerce and that \n\n[261 U.S. 393, 396]\n\u00a0\n it did not apply to transport of oil in interstate commerce. It held, however, that oil originating in West Virginia, a large part of which was ultimately carried out of the state, but the destination of which was undetermined, because its owners might withdraw it from the line at any point within the state, was intrastate commerce and was a proper basis for the privilege tax under the law. Accordingly, in so far as the decree of the circuit court enjoined collection of a privilege tax measured by intrastate commerce in oil as thus determined, it was reversed. In this court it was held that oil produced in West Virginia and constituting in fact a stream of oil flowing out of the state was interstate commerce, even though those who delivered the oil to the company for transportation might have diverted it from the interstate commerce stream, and though in comparatively small quantities some oil was thus diverted.\n Accordingly the decree of the Supreme Court of Appeals was reversed, and the cause was remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of this court. That court then entered the following decree entitled in the cause:\n'Upon an appeal from a decree of the circuit court of Kanawha county pronounced on the 8th day of September, 1920\n\n\n\n'The court, having maturely considered the mandate of the Supreme Court of the United States filed and entered of record in this cause and the record of the decree aforesaid, is of opinion that there is no error in said decree. It is therefore adjudged, ordered, and decreed that the d cree of the circuit court of Kanawha county, pronounced in this cause on the 8th day of September, 1920, be and the same is hereby affirmed.'\n\n It is now objected by the representatives of the state that this action of the Supreme Court of Appeals was not in accord with the mandate because it was inconsistent \n\n[261 U.S. 393, 397]\n\u00a0\n with the opinion of this court. In the course of that opinion, in stating the facts, it was said (\n257 U.S. 270\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 102 [66 L. Ed. 227]):\n'But all the oil of the same grade was mixed, regardless of source, and of the Pennsylvania grade only 1,239,099.55 barrels were used in West Virginia. It is admitted that the tax may be levied in respect of the last item, but the question before us is whether the tax can be laid upon the whole product of the state upon which was imposed the gathering charge.'\n\n It is said that this language imposed the duty upon the Supreme Court of Appeals of so shaping its decree under our mandate as to enable the state to collect a privilege tax from the pipe line company upon the number of barrels above mentioned. We cannot agree with this. The statement quoted from the opinion was part of a review of the facts and a classification of the oil according to its interstate and intrastate character. Both the West Virginia courts and the counsel for both parties agreed that this amount of oil was intrastate commerce and subject to such a privilege tax. But the language quoted was not used to indicate the form of the decree to be entered below. This court gave no consideration to the question whether the invalidity of part of the tax rendered the whole law void because indivisible, as the circuit court had held it to be. That was peculiarly a state question, and when we reversed the case for the reason that oil in transport which the Supreme Court of Appeals held to be intrastate, and so taxable was interstate and immune, and remanded the case for further proceedings, it was entirely within the power and duty of that court to decide what under the state law would be the effect of the invalidity of part of the tax levied by the law as adjudged by this court upon the validity of the whole tax law. The Supreme Court of Appeals evidently reached the conclusion that the circuit court had been right in deciding that, if so much of the tax was invalid, it could \n\n[261 U.S. 393, 398]\n\u00a0\n not infer that the Legislature would have enacted the law at all. Accordingly it affirmed the decree of that court. as it had full power to do.\n The application for the writ of certiorari is denied, and the writ of error is dismissed. \n\n\n\n","97":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHART v. B F KEITH VAUDEVILLE EXCH(1923)\nNo. 763\nArgued: Decided: May 21, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 271, 272]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Martin W. Littleton and L. B. Eppstein, both of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. Geo. W. Wharton Pepper, of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by one whose business is getting contracts for vaudeville performers to perform in theatres all over the United States and acting as their manager and personal representative. It is brought against a combination of corporations engaged in similar business, and the owners of a large number of theatres known as the Keith Circuit, the owners of others known as the Orpheum Circuit, and some other persons not needing special mention here, who it is alleged are ruining the plaintiff's business by a conspiracy forbidden by the Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209 (Comp. St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830). An injunction and enormous damages are asked. The bill was dismissed for want of jurisdiction by the District Court on the ground that it did not state a cause of action arising under the Constitution or laws of the United Sta es.\n The bill sets out at superfluous length a combination of the defendants to exclude actors from the theatres controlled by them, being practically all the theatres in the United States and in Canada in which high class vaudeville entertainments are produced, and to exclude the managers and personal representatives of actors from the defendants' booking exchange in New York and from business, unless they respectively comply with the defendants' requirements, including the payment of considerable sums. It is alleged that a part of the defendants' business is making contracts that call on performers to travel between the States and from abroad and in connection \n\n[262 U.S. 271, 273]\n\u00a0\n therewith require the transportation of large quantities of scenery, costumes and animals. Some or many of these contracts are for the transportation of vaudeville acts, including performers, scenery, music, costumes and whatever constitutes the act, so that it is said that there is a constant stream of this so-called commerce from State to State. The defendants contend and the judge below was of opinion that the dominant object of all the arrangements was the personal performance of the actors, all transportation being merely incidental to that, and therefore that the case is governed by Federal Baseball Club v. National League, \n259 U.S. 200\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 465. On the other hand it is argued that in the transportation of vaudeville acts the apparatus sometimes is more important than the performers and that the defendants' conduct is within the statute to that extent at least.\n The jurisdiction of the District Court is the only matter to be considered on this appeal. That is determined by the allegations of the bill, and usually if the bill or declaration makes a claim that if well founded is within the jurisdiction of the Court it is within that jurisdiction whether well founded or not.

Templeton, \n185 \nU.S. 487, 493\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 783, to the effect that when a suit is brought in a federal court and the very matter of the controversy is federal it cannot be dismissed for want of jurisdiction 'however wanting in merit' may be the averments intended to \n\n[262 U.S. 271, 274]\n\u00a0\n establish a federal right. See also St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. McWhirter, \n229 \nU.S. 265, 275\n, 276 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 858. It is not necessary to draw the line between the foregoing and other cases brought in Courts of the United States to assert a claim under the Constitution that have been ordered to be dismissed below because 'absolutely devoid of merit,' Newburyport Water Co. v. Newburyport, \n193 \nU.S. 561, 576\n, 579 S., 24 Sup. Ct. 553, beyond confining the latter to those that are very plain. It is enough that we are not prepared to say that nothing can be extracted from this bill that falls under the act of Congress, or at least that the claim is wholly frivolous. The bill was brought before the decision of the Baseball Club Case, and it may be that what in general is incidental, in some instances may rise to a magnitude that requires it to be considered independently. The logic of the general rule as to jurisdiction is obvious and the case should be decided upon the merits unless the want of jurisdiction is entirely clear. What relief, if any, could be given and how far it could go it i not yet time to discuss.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","98":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHARTFORD LIFE INS. CO. v. DOUDS(1923)\nNo. 265\nArgued: Decided: April 9, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[261 U.S. 476, 477]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. B. Arnold, of Columbus, Ohio, and James C. Jones, Frank H. Sullivan, and James C. Jones, Jr., all of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioners.\n Mr. Smith W. Bennett, of Columbus, Ohio, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are separate causes, but the facts are similar and both present the same essential question. A statement based upon record No. 271 will suffice.\n Petitioner is a Connecticut corporation with home office at Hartford. For many years it has carried on the business of insurance upon the assessment or mutual plan within the state of Ohio. May 4, 1882, it issued to respondent Langdale, aged 40, a certificate of membership, Safety Fund Department, for $3,000. This recites that in consideration of representations, etc., and 'the further payment in accordance with the conditions hereof of all mortuary assessments' the company agrees (among other things) to assess holders of certificates 'according to the table of graduated assessment rates given hereon, as determined by their respective ages and the number of such certificates in force,' and pay the amount so collected to the assured's legal representatives.\n The 'Table of Graduated Assessment Rates for Death Losses for Every $ 1,000 of a Total Indemnity of $1,000,000' is printed upon the certificate and shows increasing rates for ages from 15 to 60. The highest specified rate \n\n[261 U.S. 476, 478]\n\u00a0\n is at 60-$2.68. Immediately after the table this statement appears:\n'These rates decrease in proportion as the total indemnity in force increases above one million dollars in amount, and are calculated so as to cover the usual expense for collecting.'\n\n During the years 1903 to 1914 the company made and the insured paid assessments on account of death losses at rates varying from $2.86 to $4 per thousand. To recover all above $2.68 per thousand so paid, with interest, respondent brought suit in the common pleas court, Franklin county, Ohio. The company appeared, demurred, and later answered, saving at all times the question of jurisdiction. A judgment against it was affirmed by the Supreme Court. 103 Ohio St. 398, 136 N. E. 274; 103 Ohio St. 433, 138 N. E. 96.\n Petitioner now insists that the trial court lacked jurisdiction of the subject-matter; that the suit involved the management of its internal affairs and the validity of action relative to the Safety Fund Department; that the courts of Connecticut have exclusive jurisdiction over such matters; and that enforcement of the Ohio judgment will deprive it of property without due process of law.\n The court below confined its ruling concerning jurisdiction to the trial court's power to render the above-mentioned money judgment, and it held that to determine the issue did not require exercise of visitorial power over the foreign corporation; that the judgment did not interfere with the discretion of petitioner's officers or the management of its internal affairs. This conclusion, we think, is plainly right.\n By a written contract petitioner had agreed that no mortuary assessment should exceed $2.68 per thousand. It de anded and received more, and respondent sued to recover the excess. All parties came before the court; the necessary facts were established; and he obtained judgment for a definite sum of money. This cannot interfere with the management of the company's internal affairs. \n\n[261 U.S. 476, 479]\n\u00a0\n In the recent cause of Frick v. Hartford Life Insurance Co.

W. 247) against petitioner based upon facts essentially like those here disclosed, the Supreme Court of Connecticut considered the precise point now urged upon us. In harmony with Dresser v. Hartford Life Insurance Co., 80 Conn. 681, 709, 70 Atl. 39, it held that the membership certificate constituted a contract not to demand of the assured more than $2.68 per thousand for any mortuary assessment, and also that the jurisdiction of the Iowa court to render judgment for excess payments was clear.\n Hartford Life Insurance Co. v. Ibs, \n237 U.S. 662\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 692, L. R. A. 1916A, 765, is not in point. That controversy related to the effect of the decree in Dresser v.

In addition to the constitutionality of the Prohibition Act (41 Stat. 305), the assignments of error raised many questions as to the admissions of evidence and the charge of the court.

This conclusion made it impossible for us to consider the other errors assigned.\n The plaintiffs in error now invite our attention to an act of Congress approved September 14, 1922, which provides that--\n'If an appeal or writ of error has been or shall be taken to, or issued out of, the Supreme Court in a case wherein such appeal or writ of error should have been taken to, or issued out of, a Circuit Court of Appeals, such appeal or writ of error shall not for such reason be dismissed, but shall be transferred to the proper court, which shall thereupon be possessed of the same and shall proceed to the determination thereof, with the same force \n\n[260 U.S. 438, 440]\n\u00a0\n and effect as if such appeal or writ of error had been duly taken to, or issued out of, the court to which it is so transferred.'\n\n This is a remedial statute, and should be construed liberally to carry out the evident purpose of Congress. The fact that the opportunity therein given to litigants in the Circuit Courts of Appeals, where they have mistakenly sought a review in this court, may at times be abused, and unduly prolong the litigation, and delay the successful party below, is no reason why when the case comes clearly within the language of the statute the transfer should not be made. The successful party below may avoid undue delay by a prompt motion to dismiss in this court in such cases.\n The cases before us are clearly within the remedy of the statute. Based on the assumption of the presence of a real constitutional question in the case, plaintiffs in error sought review here, not only of that question, but of the numerous other errors assigned in the record. Williamson v. United States, \n207 \nU.S. 425, 432\n, 434 S., 28 Sup. Ct. 163; Goldman v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 474, 476\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 166. We find that there is no constitutional question of sufficient substance to give us jurisdiction to consider these other errors. In other words, we find that, to have such alleged errors considered and reviewed, the writ of error herein should have issued out of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the proper circuit. Accordingly we hold that these several cases should be transferred to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit at the costs of the respective plaintiffs in error, that that court be thereupon possessed of the jurisdiction of the same and proceed to the determination of said writs of error as if such writs had issued out of such court.\n And it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","100":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHEYER v. DUPLICATOR MFG CO(1923)\nNo. 75\nArgued: Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n Samuel W. Banning, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n George L. Wilkinson, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court. \n\n[263 U.S. 100, 101]\n\u00a0\n This is a bill in equity brought by the respondent against the petitioner alleging the infringement of a patent. The District Court dismissed the bill, but the Circuit Court of Appeals gave the respondent a decree, one Judge dissenting upon the main point. Duplicator Mfg. Co. v. Heyer, 284 Fed. 242. The respondent owns a patent for improvements in multiple copying machines, one element of which is a band of gelatine to which is transferred the print to be multiplied and which yields copies up to about a hundred. This band is attached to spool or spindle which fits into the machine. \n1\n Any one may make and sell the gelatine composition but the ground of recovery was that the defendant made and sold bands of sizes fitted for use in the plaintiff's machines and attached them to spindles, with intent that they should be so used. The main question in whether purchasers of these machines have a right to replace the gelatine bands from any source that they choose. If they have that right the defendant in selling to them does no wrong. It is assumed for the purposes of argument that the claim is valid and covers the band when used in this combination, since otherwise there would be nothing to discuss.\n Since Wilson v. Simpson, 9 How. 109, 123, it has been the established law that a patentee had not 'a more equitable right to force the disuse of the machine entirely, on account of the inoperativeness of a part of it, than the purchaser has to repair, who has, in the whole of it, a right of use.' The owner when he bought one of these machines had a right to suppose that he was free to maintain \n\n[263 U.S. 100, 102]\n\u00a0\n it is use, without the further consent of the seller, for more than the sixty days in which the present gelatine might be used up. The machine lasts indefinitely, the bands are exhausted after a limited use and manifestly must be replaced. 9 How. 126. The machine is costly, the bands are a cheap and common article of commerce. In Wilson v. Simpson, the purchaser was held free to replace the cutter knives that were the ultimate tool of the invention. The present case seems to us stronger in favor of the defendant. The gelatine probably has to be replaced at least as frequently as the cutter knives and would seem to be less distinctively appropriated to the machine. In Leeds & Catlin Co. v. Victor Talking Machine Co. (No. 2) \n213 U.S. 325\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 503, the question was not of a right to substitute worn out parts but of a right to use new discs in a talking machine. The authority of Wilson v. Simpson and the cases that have followed it was fully recognized and must be recognized here. We have only to establish the construction of a bargain on principles of common sense applied to the specific facts. We cannot doubt what the fair interpretation is and it would not be affected even if every purchaser knew that the vendor was prepared to furnish new bands.\n Inasmuch as after the present bill had been dismissed it was reinstated on condition that the plaintiff be limited for recovery of profits or damages to the period after the reinstatement and as the evidence is that the only spools used since that date came from the plaintiff we think it unnecessary to make any order touching the spools.\n Decree reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The claim relied upon is: '42. In a multiple copying machine, the combination with a machine frame having on one side thereof a journal bearing and on the opposite side a chuck, of a duplicating band, and a spool on which said duplicating band is would, said spool having at each end a squared chuck engaging member and a cylindrical bearing member, whereby said spool is interchangeable end for end between said chuck and sournal bearing, substantially as described.' \n\n\n\n\n","101":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHIGHTOWER v. AMERICAN NAT. BANK OF MACON, GA.(1923)\nNo. 25\nArgued: January 25, 1923Decided: December 3, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 351, 352]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John E. Hall, Charles Akerman, and Augustus O. B. Sparks, all of Macon, Ga., for appellants.\n Messrs. Orville A. Park and George S. Jones, both of Macon, Ga., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in equity, in the nature of a creditor's bill, against a national bank and its shareholders, to enforce the liability of the shareholders for the bank's debts. The plaintiff is another national bank, and sues on behalf of all creditors, although insisting it is the only one. The District Court dismissed the bill as not stating a cause of action ( 246 Fed. 721 and 248 Fed. 187); but the Circuit Court of Appeals thought the bill good and reversed that decree (254 Fed. 249, 165 C. C. A. 537). The defendants answered; the evidence was taken before a master and reported with advisory findings, and a decree was entered by the District Court establishing the plaintiff's claim as a debt-the only unsettled obligation-of the defendant bank, and awarding recoveries from the several shareholders in sums conforming to their holdings. That decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (276 Fed. 371), and the defendants appealed to this\n The record is a large one, and shows that the parties brought out everything of an evidential character bearing on the issues. On all questions of fact the master and the two courts below were in full accord, and there was ample evidence to sustain their findings. \n\n[263 U.S. 351, 353]\n\u00a0\n Both banks were located at Macon, Ga., the plaintiff being known as the American National, and the other as the Commercial National. In the summer of 1914 they entered into a contract looking to a winding up of the affairs of the Commercial National, and providing for a transfer of its assets to the American National, and the assumption and payment of its liabilities by the latter. When the suit was brought, all that was to be done under the contract was practically completed, save that the obligation, if there was such, to reimburse the American National for advancing moneys to pay the Commercial National's liabilities had not been fulfilled.\n The questions presented to us for decision turn largely on the construction and legal effect of the contract, and are, first, whether the transfer of the Commercial National's assets was made by way of an outright sale, or by way of giving security for the repayment of the moneys advanced by the American National under the contract, and secondly, if repayment was required, whether that is a debt or engagement for which the Commercial National's shareholders are liable.\n The statutes in connection with which the contract and these questions must be examined are as follows:\n'The shareholders of every national banking association shall be held individually responsible, equally and ratably, and not one for another, for all contracts, debts, and engagements of such association, to the extent of the amount of their stock therein, at the par value thereof, in addition to the amount invested in such shares.' Rev. Stst.  5151; Act Dec. 23, 1913, c. 6,  23, 38 Stat. 273 (Comp. St.  9689).\n\n'Any [national banking] association may go into liquidation and be closed by the vote of its shareholders owning two-thirds of its stock.' Rev. Stat.  5220 (Comp. St.  9806).\n\n'When any national banking association shall have gone into liquidation under the provisions of section \n\n[263 U.S. 351, 354]\n\u00a0\n 5220, ... the individual liability of the shareholders provided for by section 5151 ... may be enforced by any creditor of such association, by bill in equity, in the nature of a creditor's bill,' etc. Act June 30, 1876, c. 156,  2, 19 Stat. 63 (Comp. St.  9807).\n\n The contract was made in pursuance of resolutions passed by the directors of both banks, and was ratified and approved by a resolution of the Commercial National's shareholders. These resolutions and the contract are all set forth at length in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals delivered on the first appeal to that court (254 Fed. 249, 165 C. C. A. 537), and need not be reproduced here.\n The primary purpose in what was done was to relieve the Commercial National from an existing embarrassment, to conserve its assets, and to subserve the interests of its creditors and stockholders. That bank, although having assets thought at the time to be in excess of its liabilities, was in need of very substantial assistance. It had made excessive and improvident loans, had borrowed beyond an admissible limit, had permitted its available cash to fall below a reasonable minimum, had been criticized by the Comptroller for these departures, had become the subject of disturbing rumors and was not in condition to withstand a run by depositors. It had sought assistance from the American National, and the latter had manifested a disposition to help within prudent limits. Various courses had been informally suggested without receiving definite approval, among them being a voluntary liquidation of the Commercial National under the statute before cited, a consolidation of the two banks, an outright sale of the Commercial National's assets to the American National at an agreed or fixed valuation, and a transfer of the assets, or a large part of them, to the American National as collateral to secure repayment to it of moneys to be advanced by it to meet the Commercial \n\n[263 U.S. 351, 355]\n\u00a0\n National's needs. All of these proceeded on the theory that the depositors and other creditors of that bank should be paid as and when payment was demanded, that money in large amounts would be required for the purpose, and that the money should be provided or obtained in a way which would permit an orderly and advantageous realization on the Commerical National's assets and not involve any sacrifice of their real value.\n The resolution of the directors of the Commercial National, as also that of the directors of the American National, was passed August 1, 1914; the contract was signed August 11, and the ratifying resolution of the Commercial National's shareholders was passed September 30.\n The resolution of the Commercial National's directors left the questions of voluntary liquidation and consolidation to the consideration and action of the shareholders, but expressly authorized the bank's officers to transfer all of its assets to the American National 'as cash' ( meaning at an agreed or fixed cash valuation) or 'as collateral' to secure that bank for moneys 'advanced' to pay liabilities of the Commercial National; 'the details' being committed 'to the discretion' of such officers and they being empowered to enter into any necessary or appropriate contract. The resolution of the American National's directors said nothing about consolidation and only incidentally referred to voluntary liquidation, but expressly assented to the assumption and payment by that bank of the liabilities of the Commercial National 'upon condition' that the latter transfer to the American National 'as cash or collateral' sufficient assets to afford it full and satisfacory protection. This resolution, like the other, committed the adjustment of details to the discretion of the bank's officers.\n Immediately following the adoption of these directors' resolutions the Commercial National's assets were delivered \n\n[263 U.S. 351, 356]\n\u00a0\n into the custody or keeping of the American National, but were not delivered 'as cash' or at an agreed or fixed valuation. Thereupon, and on the faith of such delivery, the American National began advancing moneys with which to pay depositors and other creditors of the Commercial National.\n The contract, signed 10 days later, recites the substance of the directors' resolutions, but refers to them as authorizing a transfer of the assets 'as security,' instead of 'as cash or security.' It further recites that 'the assets of the Commercial National have been delivered to the American National' and then in six numbered paragraphs proceeds to state the terms and details of the engagement. The first paragraph purports to transfer all the assets in present terms, contains no qualifying words, and, when taken alone, appears to pass the title absolutely and without reservation. The second and third paragraphs declare that the officers and directors of the Commercial National will call a meeting of its shareholders and procure from them resolutions (a) providing for the liquidation of that bank under the statute; (b) authorizing the consolidation of the two banks 'by the purchase of the assets of the Commercial National by the American National,' but without the issue of stock in the latter to the shareholders of the former; (c) ratifying and confirming the action of the Commercial National's directors before recited and 'this contract'; and (d) designating the American National as liquidating agent to conduct the liquidation of the Commercial National according to the statute and under the supervision of the Commercial National's directors. The fourth paragraph provides that the Commercial National shall maintain its corporate existence until the completion of its liquidation. The fifth paragraph declares without qualification that the American National assumes and promises to pay, as and when payment is demanded, all \n\n[263 U.S. 351, 357]\n\u00a0\n the liabilities of the Commercial National, including the redemption of its circulating notes. The sixth paragraph, which obviously is explanatory of some of the others, particularly of the first and fifth, reads as follows:\n'VI. That said American National Bank will accept the appointment as liquidating agent of said Commercial National Bank, and will proceed with all due and reasonable diligence to liquidate said association and to collect and reduce to cash all the assets of said association, all of said assets to be held as security by said American National Bank for all advances made by it in paying the depositors and other liabilities of said Commercial National Bank and the actual expenses incurred by said American National Bank in realizing on said assets, and that after deducting from the proceeds of said assets the actual expenses incurred by said American National Bank in liquidating said association and acting as liquidating agent and in collecting said assets and realizing upon the same, it will apply said proceeds, first, in repaying to itself all amounts advanced by it hereunder, with interest thereon at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum; next, in discharging the liabilities of said Commercial National Bank which shall not have been paid by advances made by said American National Bank, and that when all of said liabilities have been fully discharged it will account to the shareholders of said Commercial National Bank and from time to time pay over to said shareholders pro rata the surplus remaining in its hands from the proceeds of said assets, said American National Bank to act as such liquidating agent without compensation for its own services.\n\n'It being distinctly agreed and understood that, in the event the said liquidation should be interrupted or discontinued for any reason beyond the control of said American National Bank, then and in that event said American National Bank shall and does hold all of the \n\n[263 U.S. 351, 358]\n\u00a0\n assets of said Commercial National Bank as security for the advances which may have been made by it, up to the time such liquidation may be so discontinued.\n\n'And it being further distinctly agreed and understood that neither the resolutions of said boards of directors of said associations nor this contract shall relieve the shareholders of the Commercial National Bank from their legal liability as shareholders to respond, in the event it may be necessary to have recourse upon such shareholders' liability, for any deficit which may remain after exhausting the other assets of said association in the payment of its liabilities.'\n\n The appellants lay some emphasis on what it said in the second and third paragraphs about procuring from the shareholders a resolution authorizing a consolidation of the two banks by one purchasing the assets of the other. But we think it is of no importance here. In itself it could have no force, save as a solicitation of action by the shareholders. They did not respond to it. No such resolution was adopted, and the tentative proposal failed. The reason is apparent. The shareholders' meeting was had 50 days after the contract was signed. In the meantime the Commercial National's affairs had been subjected to close examination and found to be such that a consolidation was not at all feasible. At that meeting, however, the shareholders did, by a vote representing two-thirds of all the shares, ratify and confirm the contract, put the bank into voluntary liquidation under the statute, designate the American National as liquidating agent and appoint a committee of five shareholders to advise with and assist the liquidating agent and directors throughout the course of the liquidation.\n The chief contention of the appellants is that the transaction between the two banks was not a pledging or hypothecation of the assets as security for the repayment of advances to pay liabilities, but an outright sale of the \n\n[263 U.S. 351, 359]\n\u00a0\n assets in consideration of an unqualified assumption of the liabilities. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals in thinking the assets were not sold but pledged as security.\n It is quite true that the first and fifth paragraphs of the contract, if separated from the others, make for the view that the transfer of assets and the assumption of liabilities were without qualification or reservation-each as the full consideration for the other. But the contract consists of much more than those paragraphs and must be examined as a whole to determine the nature of the transaction of which it is a memorial. In the sixth paragraph the parties definitely explain the purpose with which the assets were transferred and the nature of the engagement by which payment of the liabilities was assumed. That paragraph cannot be disregarded. To do so would be much like determining the nature and effect of a mortgage deed without considering the defeasance clause. The paragraph shows that the American National was to hold the assets 'as security' for 'all advances' made by it to pay liabilities and expenses; that it was to reduce the assets to cash with reasonable diligence and apply the proceeds in 'repaying' 'all amounts advanced' by it 'with interest' added; and that if, for any reason beyond its control, the liquidation should be discontinued, it should hold the assets 'as security' for its 'advances' up to that time. The paragraph also recognizes that in the end there might be either a surplus or deficiency of proceeds from the assets, and deals with both contingencies with a possible surplus by directing that the same be paid to the Commercial National's shareholders pro rata, and with a possible deficiency by declaring that neither the directors' resolutions nor the contract 'shall relieve the shareholders' from their 'legal liability as shareholders to respond.' The rational and necessary conclusion from these provisions is that the \n\n[263 U.S. 351, 360]\n\u00a0\n moneys advanced were loaned and were to be repaid with interest, that the assets were transferred as security for such repayment and that the resulting relations between the banks were those of debtor and creditor and pledgor and pledgee.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals fortified its conclusion in this regard by showing that throughout the period in which the contract was in process of execution the officers of the two banks, their directors and the shareholders' committee of the Commercial National put a like construction on it. We agree that this is so, but extended comment on that course of action would serve no purpose, because, in our opinion, the contract as a whole does not admit of any other construction.\n The remaining contention is that the debt sought to be enforced was created during the process of liquidation, and therefore is not one for which the shareholders are liable. The premise is faulty. The debt arose from the contract and represents moneys advanced in excess of what was realized from the assets. When the contract was made the bank was in active operation, and it remained so for a short period thereafter. It was cashing checks, receiving deposits, clearing checks through the clearing house, checking on its deposits in other banks and otherwise conducting a banking business. True, its business was conducted in quarters assigned to it in the banking house of the American National, but it was acting through its own officers, tellers and employes. It had not been pronounced insolvent, nor was it then thought to be so. The process of liquidation under the statute began fifty days after the contract was made. There was power to make the contract. The purpose was not to obtain money to engage in new business, but simply to change from many creditors to one. Nor was the contract made in derogation of the rights of the shareholders. One of its purposes was to subserve their interests, and this \n\n[263 U.S. 351, 361]\n\u00a0\n was recognized when they ratified and confirmed it. United prior decisions the contention must fail. Wyman v. Wallace, \n201 U.S. 230\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 495; Poppleton v. Wallace, \n201 U.S. 245\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 498.\n The amount of the debt is not questioned.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","102":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHILL v. SMITH(1923)\nNo. 164\nArgued: January 3, 1923Decided: January 15, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 592, 593]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Geo. S. Fuller and Edward E. Blodgett, both of Boston, Mass., for petitioners.\n Mr. Edward F. McClennen, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit upon a judgment. The defendant, Warren H. Hill, pleaded a discharge in bankruptcy. Subsequently he died and his executors, the petitioners, took his place. There was a trial before a judge without a jury. The plaintiff introduced proof that the judgment was unsatisfied and rested. The defendants proved the discharge and rested. In rebuttal the plaintiff introduced the schedules of creditors in bankruptcy of Hill in which schedules the plaintiff's name did not appear. The defendants asked for rulings that the burden was upon the plaintiff to show that he was not notified of the defendant's bankruptcy and that he had no knowledge of it. \n\n[260 U.S. 592, 594]\n\u00a0\n These were refused subject to exceptions and the Court found for the plaintiff. The exceptions were overruled by the Supreme Judicial Court and judgment was entered upon the finding. Smith v. Hill, 232 Mass. 188, 122 N. E. 310, 2 A. L. R. 1667. A writ of certiorari was allowed by this Court.\n It is argued for the respondent that there is no jurisdiction in this Court because the attention of the trial judge was not called specifically to the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9585-9656) as a ground for the rulings asked, and because, even if it had been, it is said, the burden of proof is to be determined by the practice of the State. As we are of opinion that the judgment was right we shall not discuss these objections at length. We deem it enough to say, as to the first, that the appellate court treated the question as open and decided it; and as to the second that here as in Central Vermont Railway Co. v. White, \n238 U.S. 507\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 865, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 252, though perhaps in a somewhat less intimate and obvious way, the burden of proof is so connected with the substantive rights given to the respective parties by the statute-indeed so flows from the words of the statute-that the ruling upon it may be reviewed here.\n The merits were fully and adequately discussed by the Supreme Judicial Court. In order to dispose of them it will not be necessary to repeat the distinction, familiar in Massachusetts since the time of Chief Justice Shaw, Powers v. Russell, 13 Pick. 69, and elaborated in the opinion below, between the burden of proof and the necessity of producing evidence to meet that already produced. The distinction is now very generally accepted, although often blurred by careless speech. Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence, c. 9. The Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541,  17a(3), 30 Stat. 550, amended by Act of February 5, 1903, c. 487 ,  5, 32 Stat. 798 (Comp. St.  9601), provides that a discharge 'shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts, except such as ... (3) have not been duly scheduled in time for proof and \n\n[260 U.S. 592, 595]\n\u00a0\n allowance, with the name of the creditor if known to the bankrupt, unless such creditor had notice or actual knowledge of the proceedings in bankruptcy.' (The Amendment of March 2, 1917, c. 153, 39 Stat. 999 [Comp. St.  9601], does not change this language, and was adopted after the discharge.) By the very form of the law the debtor is discharged subject to an exception, and one who would bring himself within the exception must offer evidence to do so. Kreitlein v. Ferger, \n238 \nU.S. 21, 26\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 685; McKelvey v. United States, \n260 U.S. 353\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 132, 67 L. Ed. --, Dec. 4, 1922. But there is an exception to the exception, 'unless the creditor had notice,' etc., and, by the same principle if the debtor would get the benefit of that he must offer evidence to show his right. We agree with the Court below that justice and the purpose of the section justify the technical rule that if the debtor would avoid the effect of his omission of a creditor's name from his schedules he must prove the facts upon which he relies.\n The petitioners urge two further objections. They say that it did not appear that the debtor knew the name of his creditor. The trial judge was warranted in inferring that when a judgment had been recovered against him in Boston, where he lived, he knew the name of the man who recovered it and who lived hard by. Again, they say that the debt may have been scheduled under some other name. The judge had t e schedule before him and for all that appears well may have inferred that it was not.\n But we cannot treat these questions as open. The Supreme Judicial Court stated that the questions presented related wholly to the burden of proof and it was said at the argument and not denied that in their brief before that Court the petitioners asserted that the sole issue was on the refusal to give the requests stated above. That is all that is before us now, although we have been unwilling to let the petitioners suppose that were it otherwise they would be better off.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHODGES v.

The ground of the motion to dismiss is that there is want of jurisdiction because the writ is not directed to the Supreme Court of the State. It was sued out to review a final judgment of that court reversing, on appeal, an order of the Circuit Court, and remanding the cause with direction to vacate the same. Under the local practice the original papers, that had been transmitted to the Supreme Court as the record on the appeal, were remitted to the Circuit Court, with copies of the judgment and opinion of the Supreme Court (Rev. Code S. D. 1919,  3170); no copy of such record being retained by the Supreme Court. The rule of practice has been long established that in such case, in order to bring up the record which is essential to a review of the judgment of the appellate court, the writ of error is properly directed to the lower court in which the record is then found.

Hence the motion to dismiss is denied.\n\n 2. \nThe ground of the alternative motion to affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court is that the writ was taken for delay only and presents no substantial question for review. It should be granted if the questions on which the decision depends are so wanting in substance as not to need further argument. Rule 6,  5 (32 Sup. Ct. v); Missouri Pacific Railway v.

Ed. --, decided by this Court December 4, 1922\n\n\n A single question is presented, which arises as follows: The plaintiffs in error, as resident taxpayers, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court challenging the validity of a consolidated school district which had been organized by \n\n[261 U.S. 600, 602]\n\u00a0\n the merger of several smaller districts, and praying that the defendants in error, as its officers, be enjoined from further maintaining schools or erecting school buildings therein, or issuing bonds thereof. The Supreme Court, on an appeal from the Circuit Court, held that the attempted organization of the consolidated district 'was not authorized by any law then in force ... and was wholly futile' (43 S. D. 166, 176, 178 N. W. 575), and entered judgment remanding the cause for further proceedings in accordance with its decision. The legislature thereupon passed a curative act legalizing and validating all proceedings relating to the organization of any consolidated school district attempted to be made as this had been, as of the date when such district was organized (Laws S. D. 2d Sp. Sess. 1920, c. 47). Before this curative act went into effect the Circuit Court, in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court, entered judgment adjudging the invalidity of the consolidation, permanently enjoining the defendants from conducting the consolidated district, as prayed in the complaint, and awarding costs to the plaintiffs. At a later day of the term, after the curative act had gone into effect, a motion by the defendants to set aside this injunction was denied. Thereafter, on a second appeal, the Supreme Court held that the curative act had validated the defective organization of the consolidated district (186 N. W. 867), and entered the judgment now sought to be reviewed, reversing the order of the Circuit Court granting the permanent injunction and remanding the cause with direction to vacate so much of its judgment as awarded such injunction; but not reversing its judgment as to costs.\n The plaintiffs in error concede that the legislature, in the general exercise of its inherent power to create and alter the boundaries of school districts, may create new districts by the consolidation of others. Stephens v. Jones, 24 S. D. 97, 100, 123 N. W. 705. And they likewise recognize that, since the legislature had the power to ratify that \n\n[261 U.S. 600, 603]\n\u00a0\n which it might have originally authorized, there would have been no violation of due process if the curative act had been enacted and become effective before any adjudication had been made in the pending litigation as to the invalidity of the consolidated district. United States v. Heinszen & Co., \n206 \nU.S. 370, 386\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 742, 11 Ann. Cas. 688; Rafferty v. Smith, Bell & Co., \n257 \nU.S. 226, 232\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 71; Charlotte Harbor Railway v. Wells, \n260 U.S. 8\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 3, 67 L. Ed. --, decided by this Court October 16, 1922. And see, generally as to giving effect to acts passed pendente lite but before the hearing, Stockdale v. Insurance Co., 20 Wall. 323, 331; Mills v. Green, \n159 \nU.S. 651, 656\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 132; and Duplex Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 43, 464\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 172, 16 A. L. R. 196.\n Their sole contention is that as the curative act was not enacted until after the Supreme Court had decided, on the first appeal, that the consolidated district was invalid, and did not go into effect until after the Circuit Court had entered judgment adjudging its invalidity and enjoining the defendants from further conducting its affairs, it deprived them, as applied by the Supreme Court, without due process, of the private property rights which had been vested in them under these adjudications.\n It is true that, as they contend, the private right of parties which have been vested by the judgment of a court cannot be taken away by subsequent legislation, but must be thereafter enforced by the court regardless of such legislation. State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling Bridge Co., 18 How. 421, 429; The Clinton Bridge, 10 Wall. 454, 463; United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128, 146; McCullough v. Virginia, \n172 \nU.S. 102, 124\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 134 (in which the repealing act was passed after judgment by the trial court).\n This rule, however, as held in the Wheeling Bridge Case, does not apply to a suit brought for the enforcement of a public right, which, even after it has been established by the judgment of the court, may be annulled by subsequent legislation and should not be thereafter enforced; although, in so far as a private right has been incidentally \n\n[261 U.S. 600, 604]\n\u00a0\n established by such judgment, as for special damages to the plaintiff or for his costs, it may not be thus taken away. State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling Bridge Co., 18 How. 431, 439. This case has been cited with approval in The Clinton Bridge, 10 Wall. 463 ( likewise involving a public, as distinguished from a private, right of action); United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 146; Stockdale v. Insurance Co. 20 Wall. 332; Mills v. Green, \n159 U.S. 655\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 132. And so a judgment for the restitution of taxes collected under the ostensible authority of a general statute will be reversed when, after the rendition of such judgment, a statute has been passed legalizing and ratifying such taxation. Rafferty v. Smith, Bell & Co., \n257 U.S. 232\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 71.\n In the Wheeling Bridge Case, as in the Clinton Bridge Case, the public right involved was that of abating an obstruction to the navigation of a river. The right involved in the present suit, of enjoining the maintenance of an illegal school district and the issuance of its bonds, is likewise a public right shared by the plaintiffs with all other resident taxpayers. And while in the Wheeling Bridge Case the bill was filed by the State, although partly in its proprietary capacity as the owner of certain canals and railways (9 How. 647, 648), the doctrine that a judgment declaring a public right may be annulled by subsequent legislation, applies with like force in the present suit, although brought by individuals primarily for their own benefit; the right involved and adjudged, in the one case as in the other, being public, and not private.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court in this case affected merely the public right involved-the plaintiffs' judgment for costs not being impaired-and was clearly in accordance with the doctrine of the Wheeling Bridge Case. And since the question does not require further argument, the alternative motion of the defendants in error is granted and the judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","104":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOUSTON COAL CO. v.

Judicial Code,  238 ( Comp. St.  1215). Did the District Court have authority to hear and determine the issues tendered by plaintiff in error? The point is not free from difficulty; but, after considering the contending views, the conclude there was jurisdiction and that the judgment to the contrary must be reversed.\n Purporting to proceed under authority granted by section 101 of the Lever Act, approved August 10, 1917 (40 Stat. 276, c. 53, [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8ii]), the President, acting through the Secretary of the Navy, requisitioned coal belonging to the plaintiff in error and paid therefor $4 per ton, just compensation as ascertained by him. Alleging that this was received under protest, because of duress, and with express reservation \n\n[262 U.S. 361, 365]\n\u00a0\n of the right to demand more, the Coal Company instituted the original action to recover the difference between the amount received and what it claimed to be just compensation. The court held that section 10 did not grant permission to sue the United States therein to one who has received the amount determined by the President for requisitioned articles, and that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the issues which the petition presented.\n The Lever Act was passed in view of the constitutional provision inhibiting the taking of private property for public use without just compensation. It vested the President with extraordinary powers over the property of individuals which might be exercised through an agent at any place within the confines of the Union with many consequent hardships. As heretofore pointed out, United States v. Pfitsch, \n256 U.S. 547\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 569, by deliberate purpose the diffe ent sections of the act provide varying remedies for owners-some in the District Courts and some in the Court of Claims.\n It reasonably may be assumed that Congress intended the remedy provided by each section should be adequate fairly to meet the exigencies consequent upon contemplated action thereunder and thus afford complete protection to the rights of owners. Considering this purpose and the attending circumstances, we think section 10 should be so construed as to give the District Courts jurisdiction of those controversies which arise directly out of requisitions authorized by that section.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 10. That the President is authorized, from time to time, to requisition foods, feeds, fuels, and other supplies necessary to the support of the army or the maintenance of the navy, or any other public use connected with the common defense, and to requisition, or otherwise provide, storage facilities for such supplies; and he shall ascertain and pay a just compensation therefor. If the compensation so determined be not satisfactory to the person entitled to receive the same, such person shall be paid seventy-five per centum of the amount so determined by the President, and shall be entitled to sue the United States to recover such further sum as, added to said seventy-five per centum will make up such amount as will be just compensation for such necessaries or storage space, and jurisdiction is hereby conferred on the United States District Courts to hear and determine all such controversies: Provided, that nothing in this section, or in the section that follows, shall be construed to require any natural person to furnish to the government any necessaries held by him and reasonably required for consumption or use by himself and dependents, nor shall any person, firm, corporation, or association be required to furnish to the government any seed necessary to the seeding of land owned, leased, or cultivated by them. \n\n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE DAVIS(1923)\nNo. 27\nArgued: Decided: May 21, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 274, 275]\n\u00a0\n Mr. T.

Smythe, all of New York City, for appellee.\n Mr. John Caldwell Myers, of New York City, for Joab H. Banton, as amicus curiae. \n\n[262 U.S. 91, 92]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On June 26, 1922, a petition in involuntary bankruptcy was filed against Fuller and McGee, individually and as partners, in the name of E. M. Fuller & Co., in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. Thereafter Strasbourger was appointed receiver and at once demanded of the bankrupts the books of accounts, records, and documents, both of themselves individually and of the firm. The bankrupts claim that the books would tend to incriminate them and refused to turn them over, unless the receiver agreed that they were to be used in connection with the civil administration of bankrupts' estate only. A stipulation of this kind was made between the receiver and the attorneys for the bankrupts, with the further specific agreement that the books and records would not be turned over to any district attorney or used before any grand or petit jury. The district attorney, county of New York, then attempted to bring the books and records into the state court by serving a subpoena upon the receiver. Judge Augustus Hand, at the petition of the bankrupts, enjoined the receiver from turning the books over.\n On April 6, 1923, the attorneys for the bankrupts demanded of the receiver that he return the books and papers to them because his receivership had terminated by the appointment of a trustee in bankruptcy. The referee in bankruptcy directed the receiver to turn the books and papers over to the trustee without condition or restriction. On review, this order was affirmed by Circuit Judge Mack sitting in bankruptcy. April 21st last, all the books and papers were then delivered over to the trustee, except certain books and papers which had been redelivered by the receiver to the attorneys for the bankrupts on their receipts, which were turned over to \n\n[262 U.S. 91, 93]\n\u00a0\n the trustee. The bankrupts objected to turning over the books and papers thus receipted for by their attorneys to the trustee. Thereupon on April 24, 1923, Judge Mack made a second order directing the attorneys for the bankrupts and the bankrupts to turn over these records and papers so withheld by them to the trustee. n April 21st the district attorney of New York county had subpoenaed the trustee to produce the books and papers of the bankrupts he them had in his custody and on the 24th of April offered them in evidence in the Court of General Sessions of New York as evidence against E. M. Fuller under an indictment arising out of the business of the bankrupts. On the 25th of April Judge Mack granted an application for a stay pending proceedings for appeal to this court and an application for a stay here, and Judge Nott, presiding in the state court, adjourned the trial there until April 30th.\n Proceedings for appeal to this court have now been begun under the authority of Perlman v. United States, \n247 U.S. 7\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 417, and the application for a stay of Judge Mack's two orders has now been made.\n A man who becomes a bankrupt, or who is brought into a bankruptcy court, has no right to delay the legal transfer of the possession and title of any of his property to the officers appointed by law for its custody or for its disposition, on the ground that the transfer of such property will carry with it incriminating evidence against him. His property and its possession pass from him by operation and due proceedings of law, and when control and possession have passed from him, he has no constitutional right to prevent its use for any legitimate purpose. His privilege secured to him by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution is that of refusing himself to produce, as incriminating evidence against him, anything which he owns or has in his possession and control; but his privilege in respect to what was his and in his custody \n\n[262 U.S. 91, 94]\n\u00a0\n ceases on a transfer of the control and possession which takes place by legal proceedings and in pursuance of the rights of others, even though such transfer may bring the property into the ownership or control of one properly subject to subpoena duces tecum. These conclusions follow from the principles announced by this court in the Matter of Harris, \n221 U.S. 274\n. 279, 31 Sup. Ct. 557, and Johnson v. United States, \n228 U.S. 457\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 572, 47 L. R. A. (N. S.) 263.\n In considering the correctness of Judge Mack's orders, it is wholly immaterial what stipulation had been entered into between the receiver and the bankrupts in regard to the use to be made pending the receivership of the books and papers or what sanction Judge Hand's action had given the stipulations. With the appointment of the trustee both the title and the right to possession of such books and papers passed to him and Judge Mack's orders properly confirmed this result. The receiver, the bankrupts, and their attorney must yield possession and title to the trustee. Neither can accompany the delivery he is bound by law to make with any effective conditions restricting use of the books, papers, or other property of the bankrupts' estate as evidence against them.\n The application is denied. \n\n\n\n","107":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTERNATIONAL LIFE INS. CO. v. SHERMAN(1923)\nNo. 295\nArgued: March 15, 1923Decided: May 21, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles G. Revelle, of St. Louis, Mo., and A. L. Cooper, of Kansas City, Mo., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Oscar S. Hill, of Kansas City, Mo., for defendant in error. [ International Life v. Sherman \n262 U.S. 346\n (1923) ]\n\n[262 U.S. 346, 347]\n\u00a0\n\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought by the defendant in error in the circuit court of Jackson county, Mo., for money paid by his assignors for annuity certificates issued by the Great Western Life Insurance Company, the predecessor of plaintiff in error. Judgment for $47,463.90, with interest and costs, was affirmed in the state Supreme Court. That court allowed writ of error bringing the case here. A petition for writ of certiorari also has been presented. The federal question asserted is that the state court, in violation of the Constitution and acts of Congress defining the jurisdiction of federal courts, failed to give full faith and credit to certain provisions of a decree of the United States Circuit (now District) Court for the Western District of Missouri, set up in the answer, purporting to cancel and annul the annuity certificates. The defendant in error moves to dismiss the writ of error and opposes the granting of certiorari on the grounds, among others, that the United States court was without jurisdiction to decree the cancellation of the certificates assigned to defendant in error, and that the provisions of the decree relied on by plaintiff in error are void. We are of opinion that the asserted federal right is so obviously devoid of merit and frivolous that the writ of error must be dismissed and certiorari denied. \n1\n In 1906 the Great Western Agency Company was incorporated under the laws of Colorado. In 1907 those \n\n[262 U.S. 346, 348]\n\u00a0\n in control of that company caused the Great Western Life Insurance Company to be organized under the laws of Missouri, having a capital of $100,000-1, 000 shares. Eight shares were held in the names of the incorporators, and the remaining 992 were held by them as trustees for the agency company. Desiring to raise more funds, the company issued so-called annuity certificates, which were sold at $150 per 'share.' Each share obligated the company to pay an annuity, to be arrived at by dividing 500 into a sum based on 25 cents on each $1,000 of insurance-with certain exceptions not necessary here to be set forth-written by the company during 50 years from its incorporation. In May, 1908, certain stockholders of the agency company filed a bill in the United States court against that company, the insurance company, and individuals controlling them, alleging mismanagement and improper use of the insurance company's property in fraud of their rights. It prayed that a receiver be appointed to take charge of and administer the assets of both companies for the benefit of those entitled thereto. A receiver was appointed and directed to sell the property of the insurance company. When the application of the receiver for confirmation of his acceptance of an offer came before the court, certain stockholders of the agency company and certificate holders appeared and asked a postponement. It was shown that some of the stockholders and certificate holders had undertaken to raise funds for the rehabilitation of the insurance company, that some money for this purpose had been contributed, and that there was assurance that enough would be raised to pay off the debts. Postponement was granted by an order which stated:\n'F. M. Pearl and other stockholders of the Great Western Agency Company and other annuity certificate holders of the Great Western Life Insurance Company who are similarly situated, appearing by B. P. Waggoner and James W. Orr, ...' etc. \n\n[262 U.S. 346, 349]\n\u00a0\n The matter again came before the court, and its order recited:\n\n'Now, on this 27th day of August, 1908, ... came on further to be heard the objections and exceptions of F. M. Pearl and other stockholders of the Great Western Agency Company and annuity certificate holders of the Great Western Life Insurance Company to the confirmation of the sale of the assets. ... A. F. Sherman appearing for himself, and certain other annuity certificate holders , ... and all parties being before the court and being heard, and the court being fully nformed and advised, it is considered, ordered, and decreed.'\n\n The decree approved the reorganization plan presented, and directed the return of all property to the company, immediate payment of approved death claims, and the giving of a bond to indemnify the receiver from such claims as might be presented and approved. The plan of rehabilitation was that annuity certificate holders should pay $37.50 on each certificate, surrender the same for cancellation, and then receive stock of the insurance company of par value equal to one-half of the payment, and gave those who had not availed themselves of this privilege 20 days within which to do so, and declared those failing to make such payment and surrender their annuity certificates for cancellation--\n'barred and estopped from making any claim of any kind whatsoever against said life insurance company or officers or stockholder thereof, or against any assets of said company, and such annuity certificates will then and thereby be fully canceled in law and in equity, and such annuity certificate holders will have no further rights, claims, or demands against said company, its officers, stockholders, assets, or property on account thereof.'\n\n The decree directed the sale by the receiver of the agency company of the 992 shares of stock of the insurance company to a trustee for those so contributing to \n\n[262 U.S. 346, 350]\n\u00a0\n the rehabilitation of the insurance company; it fixed compensation of the receiver and his solicitors and provided for the payment thereof; it stated that the insurance company had deposited funds for carrying out the provisions of the decree and directed the same to be so used; bids submitted for the assets were rejected, and the decree continued:\n'... That the jurisdiction of this court is fully retained, extended, and continued from time to time until this cause is finally concluded over all subjects-matter covered by any pleading now on file or that later on may be filed, and over all parties whose names are now on the record and such other party or parties as may later on be brought into court, or who may come into court by any pleading. And all such parties now to the record, including the said the Great Western Life Insurance Company, and all parties who may later on be made parties herein, shall be bound by such further orders and decrees as to the court may seem necessary and proper.'\n\n No further proceedings were had, and on November 29, 1912, an order was filed relinquishing jurisdiction and discontinuing the case.\n The insurance company resumed business and continued until its merger with the plaintiff in error, December 7, 1912. By the articles of consolidation, the latter agreed to pay all debts, liabilities, and obligations of the former. The claims of the certificate holders were specifically referred to, and the plaintiff in error agreed to pay the annuities provided for in such certificates or refund the amounts paid for them, if they should be held by the Supreme Court of Missouri to be valid obligations of the Great Western Company at the time of the merger. The state court found that the certificate holders who assigned to defendant in error were not original parties to the suit, that they did not subsequently intervene or appear in person or by sounsel, that no relief was sought \n\n[262 U.S. 346, 351]\n\u00a0\n against them by any party to the suit, and that the only relief sought by stockholders and annuity certificate holders, who proposed and supported the plan of rehabilitation, was to have the property returned to the insurance company upon payment of its debts. These findings are sustained by the evidence. The stockholders and certificate holders who did appear in that suit for the purpose of reorganizing the company had no authority or power to represent certificate holders who did not appear. There is nothing in the record to support the jurisdiction of the court of deal with or cancel the annuity certificates assigned to defendant in error. The assignors were denied a hearing upon the matters decre d against them.\n The provisions of the decree, attempting to bar and estop certificate holders from making any claim against the insurance company, its officers, stockholders, or assets, and attempting to cancel their certificates and determine that they had no further rights, claims, or demands unless within the specified 20 days, they should pay in $37.50 per share, and, upon surrender of their certificates take stock in the insurance company of par value of one-half the amount so paid, were without jurisdiction. The company could not thus be relieved of its obligations to non- consenting annuity certificate holders and have its property returned to it exempt from their claims. Their rights could not be so disposed of. As to them the decree was not a judicial determination, and the courts of Missouri were right in holding it to be a nullity. See Hovey v.

Klein, of New York City, for Jeems Bayou Fishing & Hunting Club. \n\n[260 U.S. 561, 562]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Riter, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States brought suit in equity in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Louisiana, against the defendants (appellants and cross-appellees here), to have its title to 85. 22 acres of land in the parish of Caddo, La., confirmed, possession restored, assertion of claims thereto by defendants enjoined, and an accounting had for the value of o l removed therefrom by the defendants, or any of them.\n That court, upon the report of a master, entered a decree for the plaintiff and awarded damages for the value of the oil removed, after deducting the cost of drilling and operating the wells by means of which the oil was recovered.\n The case is here by appeal from the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming that of the District Court. 274 Fed. 18.\n The Fishing & Hunting Club claimed title through mesne conveyances from one Stephen D. Pitts, to whom a patent had been issued in 1860 for the southwest fractional quarter of section 10, in township 20 north, range 16 west, 'according to the official plat of the survey of said lands, returned to the General Land Office by the Surveyor General.' The other defendants depend upon a lease from the Fishing & Hunting Club to the Producers' Oil Company. The official plat referred to in the Pitts patent was the plat of a survey made by A. W. Warren, in 1839, and approved and filed in the General Land Office the same year. The fractional quarter section described contained about 48 acres, though the patent erroneously gave it as 23 acres. The land in question lies \n\n[260 U.S. 561, 563]\n\u00a0\n west and south and immediately adjoining, but other lands still intervene between it and the permanent lake shore. According to the plat, the land so patented to Pitts borders upon Ferry Lake, or Jeems Bayou, a navigable body of water, and is shown on the plat as a small peninsula extending into the water and connected by a narrow neck with the mainland. The evidence which is voluminous and substantially uncontroverted, makes it very clear that no such peninsula exists or existed at the time of the survey in 1839. On the contrary, a later survey, called an extension survey, made in 1916-17 shows that a large compact body of upland, more than 500 acres in extent, which is, and in 1839 was, well timbered with a growth of pine, oak and other trees lies between this supposititious peninsula and the shore line of the lake in every direction, except for a short distance along the east boundary as delineated upon the plat. This body of land extends beyond the boundaries of section 10 into the adjoining sections 9, 15, and 16. Across the lands in controversy, which are included in the larger body just mentioned, the actual shore line of the lake is, and was in 1839, from a few hundred feet to three-quarters of a mile distant from the outside boundaries of the land patented to Pitts, as shown on the Warren plat.\n The Warren field notes describe the peninsular-shaped tract of land, not by lines purporting to meander the margin of any body of water, but by courses and distances. There is nothing in the field notes to indicate a water boundary, unless as a matter of mere inference, which the most casual inspection of the locality would instantly dissipate. The inaccuracy of the plat is plainly apparent upon a like inspection. Why Warren made the survey and returned the plat as he did is a matter of speculation, but the facts demonstrated that no survey of the large, compact body of land, which includes the tract in controversy, was ever made. The circumstances, as well as the \n\n[260 U.S. 561, 564]\n\u00a0\n extent and character of the lands, necessitate the conclusion that the omission was of deliberate purpose, or the result of such gross and palpable error as to constitute in effect a fraud upon the government.\n The defendants rely upon the rule that where lands are patented according to an official plat of survey, showing meander lines along or near the margin of a body of water, the plat is to be treated as a part of the conveyance and the water itself constitutes the boundary. The rule is familiar and has received the approval of this court many times. Producers' Oil Co. v. Hanzen, \n238 \nU.S. 325, 338\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 755, and cases cited. But it is not absolute, as this court has also frequently decided. It will not be applied where, as here, the facts conclusively show that no body of water existed or exis  at or near the place indicated on the plat or where, as here, there never was, in fact, an attempt to survey the land in controversy. Security Land & Exploration Co. v. Burns, \n193 U.S. 167\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 425; Lee Wilson & Co. v. United States, \n245 U.S. 24\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 21; Producers' Oil Co. v. Hanzen, supra; Horne v. Smith, \n159 U.S. 40\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 988; French-Glenn Live Stock Co. v. Springer, \n185 U.S. 47\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 563; Chapman & Dewey Lumber Co. v. St. Francis Levee District, \n232 U.S. 186\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 297.\n But it is asserted that plaintiff is estopped from claiming title to the land because of certain correspondence with the Commissioner of the General Land Office, in 1897, wherein that officer said that there were no unsurveyed lands in the locality in question and because of an official letter from the Director of the Geological Survey to the same effect. It is clear, however, that the United States cannot be so estopped. Lee Wilson & Co. v. United States, supra; Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 389, 408\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 387.\n We think the measure of damages adopted by the courts below was correct. The defendants were in possession of the land and extracted the oil therefrom in good faith. \n\n[260 U.S. 561, 565]\n\u00a0\n The land had been for many years treated by the officials of the government as having been conveyed by the Pitts patent. The defendants were innocent trespassers within the rule laid down by this court in United States v. St. Anthony Railroad Co., \n192 \nU.S. 524, 542\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 333. Moreover, the case is governed in this respect by the more liberal rule of the Louisiana Civil Code (article 501), as interpreted by the decisions of the highest court of that state. Mason et al. v. United States, \n260 U.S. 545\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 200, 67 L.

CITY OF PROVIDENCE(1923)\nNo. 219\nArgued: Decided: June 11, 1923\n\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 668, 669]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. McCarter, of Newark, N. J., and Francis I. McCanna and Alfred G. Chaffee, both of Providence, R. I., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Albert H. McCarter, for defendants in error. \n\n[262 U.S. 668, 670]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are suits in equity brought by the several plaintiffs in error in the superior court of Rhode Island, to enjoin the defendants in error from taking possession of or interfering with their property. The proceedings complained of, were taken under an act of the state Legislature, purporting to authorize the city of Providence to obtain a supply of pure water. Public Laws, chapter 1278, approved April 21, 1915. The water supply board, whose members are made parties defendant, is directed by the act to investigate and determine whether a part of the north branch of the Pawtuxet river and the tributary watershed would be the most available and desirable source of water supply for the city of Providence and for any territories now supplied or hereafter supplied, under the provisions of the act by means of the waterworks of said city. The board, if it approve the source, is to make a plan, location storage reservoirs and an aqueduct to carry water therefrom to the city waterworks. Section 3.\n Thereupon the board is authorized to purchase for and in the name of the city such lands and interests and water rights as may be necessary, when the city council shall have made provision for the necessary funds. Section 4.\n The city is authorized to acquire by condemnation any lands and interests included within a definitely limited area, which the city council shall deem necessary for the purposes stated in he act. Section 5.\n The city if further authorized by condemnation to acquire the waters or any part thereof, included within the area, and any water or flowage rights or privileges appurtenant thereto. Section 6.\n The owner of any mill upon land taken, may surrender the machinery therein to the city within six months after the taking, whereupon the city shall become liable to pay its fair value at the time of delivery as part of the damages \n\n[262 U.S. 668, 671]\n\u00a0\n for such taking; or such special damages as may be suffered as a result of a compulsory removal before the expiration of a reasonable time. If the machinery be not surrendered, the reasonable cost of removing it to a new location within the New England States and setting it up is to be paid by the city as part of t e damages. Section 12.\n The city is also required to pay the fair market value of furniture and building equipment, contained in any building belonging to the town of Scituate, which may be surrendered (section 11); the cost of additional police protection in any town or city in consequence of carrying on construction work (section 14); damages for decrease in value of lands not taken but contiguous to lands which are taken section 15); and limited damages in certain cases for loss of employment due to the taking of the manufacturing establishment in which claimant is employed (section 17).\n The owner of any business, on lands within certain localities, established prior to the passage of the act is given the right to recover for injury thereto. Section 16.\n Certain municipalities and districts within the drainage areas described, when necessary are allowed to take and receive water from the city waterworks for domestic and municipal purposes upon payment therefor at fair wholesale rates or charges, which, in case of disagreement, are to be determined by arbitration. The city is also authorized, under specified limitations, to furnish water to any incorporated water company, for use in any territory included within the drainage areas where there is no public water supply. Section 18.\n In case any lands purchased or condemned are not required for waterworks purposes, but are held to protect and preserve the waters from pollution, the city is authorized to lease them under specified restrictions. Section 21.\n Whenever the city council shall resolve to condemn any property it is required to have filed, in the office of the clerk of the town or city where any of the lands lie, a \n\n[262 U.S. 668, 672]\n\u00a0\n statement giving a description of the property taken. Thereupon the title shall vest in the city in fee simple, except where a less estate is specified. The city is authorized to take possession, but not to do so without the consent of the owner, until after the expiration of a year from the date of filing such statement. Payment for the property taken is to be made forthwith if the city and the owner agree upon the price. If not, the owner is authorized within one year after notice of the taking, or, if not notified, within two years from the date of filing the statement, to have an assessment of damages by a jury, or at his option, by a commission, upon petition to the superior court. Upon the entry of judgment the owner may have execution issued against the city. Section 23.\n Buildings or improvements on lands actually taken may be sold, disposed of or removed when necessary to prevent obstruction to the work. Section 25.\n The city is given power to borrow all money necessary to secure such water supply, including lands, etc., either by purchase or condemnation and to issue bonds and notes therefor. Section 26.\n The plaintiff in error in No. 219 has a number of cotton mills and other property interests within the area sought to be condemned, and is taxpayer in the city of Providence. The plaintiff in error in No. 220 has, within the same area, water powers and privileges, and numerous parcels of land, upon which are power plants, transmission lines, fixtures, and machinery, used in the business of generating and distributing electricity for light, heat, and power. Plaintiff in error in No. 221 has a residence and numerous buildings and improvements, together with water rights and privileges connected therewith, situated in the same area, and is a taxpayer in the city of Providence.\n The water supply board, acting under this statute, prepared a description and plat of the lands proposed to \n\n[262 U.S. 668, 673]\n\u00a0\n be taken, which was submitted to the city council for action. The council adopted a resolution asserting a taking of lands and interests within the defined area, including property of the plaintiffs in error, the title so taken, so far as material here, being in fee simple.\n Plaintiffs in error having challenged the constitutionality of the act the superior court certified he three cases to the state Supreme Court for a determination of the questions, in accordance with the provisions of the state statute. General Laws, c. 298,  1. The Supreme Court decided that the statute was not in conflict with the Constitution of the United States, and thereupon the record, with its decision certified thereon, was sent back to the superior court for further proceedings. The last-named court dismissed the bills, and from its decree the case comes here on writ of error.\n The legislation is assailed as contravening the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution.\n First. It is contended that the statute imposes a burden upon the taxpayers of the city of Providence by authorizing an expenditure, which in part is for the benefit of other municipalities or of companies outside the city, that are either not required to contribute to such expenditure or whose contributions do not constitute just compensation. The basis of this complaint, in so far as it relates to other municipalities and districts is that they are giving the right to take water upon payment of fair wholesale rates therefor, and that these rates need bear no relation to the additional cost incident to the contingency of their coming in.\n That the taxpayers of one municipality may not be taxed arbitrarily for the benefit of another may be assumed; but that is not the case here presented. The communities to be supplied are those within the drainage area of the waters authorized to be taken. These waters \n\n[262 U.S. 668, 674]\n\u00a0\n are under the primary control of the state and in allowing the city of Providence to appropriate them, it was entirely just and proper for the Legislature to safeguard the necessities of other communities who might be dependent thereon, and to that end to impose upon the city of Providence such reasonable conditions as might be necessary and appropriate. Municipalities are political subdivisions of the state, and are subject to the will of the Legislature (Trenton v. New Jersey, \n262 U.S. 182\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 534, 67 L. Ed. --, May 7, 1923), and may be compelled not only to recognize their legal obligations but to discharge obligations of an equitable and moral nature as well (Guthrie National Bank v. Guthrie, \n173 \nU.S. 528, 537\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 513). The requirement here in question is one well within the rule. Specifically, it is objected that the act does not require these other communities to bear a proportionate part of the cost of acquisition, construction and maintenance. The special facts which led the Legislature to direct payment at wholesale rates, instead of upon the basis of sharing in the cost of the enterprise, or of some other, we need not consider. It may have been, as suggested, that there were inherent difficulties in the way of making such an apportionment. But it is enough to say that the method selected is one within the scope of legislative discretion and not obnoxious to the federal Constitution. See County of Mobile v. Kimball, \n102 U.S. 691\n, 703- 704; Williams v. Eggleston, \n170 U.S. 304\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 617; Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 U.S. 97\n, 106. The Legislature is not precluded from putting a burden upon one municipality because it may result in an incidental benefit to another. County of Mobile v. Kimball, supra, 102 U. S. at pages 703, 704. Moreover, we cannot assume that the fair wholesale rates to be paid by these outside communities will be less than just compensation for what they get.\n The provision in respect of furnishing water to water companies within the area defined is not compulsory, but \n\n[262 U.S. 668, 675]\n\u00a0\n permissive, and leaves the city free to fix terms and conditions. It simply gives the city an opportunity to dispose of water, which for the time being it may not need, for compensation; something that is purely incidental to the main purposes of the legislation. No constitutional objection to it is now perceived. Kaukauna v. Green Bay, etc., Canal, \n14 \nU.S. 254, 273\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 173; United States v. Chandler- Dunbar Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53, 72\n, 73 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 667; City of Rochester et al. v. Briggs, 50 N. Y. 553, 563. In any event, it is a separable provision and it will be time enough to consider the question of its constitutionality when some attempt is made to carry it into effect.\n Second. The act, it is asserted, denies the equal protection of the laws, among other things, by permitting the owner of a business established prior to the passage of the act to recover for injury thereto while withholding such compensation from one whose business has been established since, and by allowing a mill owner to recover the cost of removing his machinery to a new location within the New England States, while denying a similar right to one desiring to move to a location elsewhere. It is further asserted by plaintiffs in error, in their capacity as taxpayers, that the effect of allowing these and other consequential damages is to deprive them of their property without due process of law.\n Injury to a business carried on upon lands taken for public use, it is generally held, does not constitute an element of just compensation ( Cox v. Philadelphia, etc., R. R. Co., 215 Pa. 506, 64 Atl. 729, 114 Am. St. Rep. 979; 2 Lewis on Eminent Domain [3d Ed.]  727), in the absence of a statute expressly allowing it (Whiting v. Commonwealth, 196 Mass. 468, 82 N. E. 670; Oakland v. Pacific Coast Lumber Co., 171 Cal. 392, 398, 153 Pac. 705). This statute therefore does not deny a right; it grants one, and limits it to a business already established. We cannot say that such a classification is unreasonable or \n\n[262 U.S. 668, 676]\n\u00a0\n arbitrary-and certainly, it is not clearly so. The law-making body legislated with reference to an existing situation. One who came after the enactment and established a business did so with notice that the extra- constitutional compensation provided for would not apply to him. In the difference between an owner who had established a business without notice that his property would be required for public use and one who proceeds in the face of such notice, the Legislature evidently found a sufficient and proper basis for classification, and we are not prepared to say that its conclusion was so palpably arbitrary as to fall within the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Arkansas Natural Gas Co. v. Arkansas Railroad Commission, \n261 U.S. 379\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 387, 67 L. Ed. --, March 19, 1923, and cases cited.\n If the geographical limitation upon the liability to pay for the removal of machinery could be said to bring about a classification, the principles just discussed would control; but, in fact, there is no classification. The right is extended to all millowners, who choose to avail themselves of it, to recover the cost of removal within the defined territory. Ordinarily, the cost of removing personal property from land taken is not a proper element of damage unless made so by express statute ( 2 Lewis on Eminent Domain [3d Ed.]  728), and it was not an unconstitutional exercise of power for the Legislature, in creating the right, to define its extent. Other provisions of the statute alleged to be discriminatory cannot be differentiated in principle from those just discussed.\n In respect of the contention that the statute extends the right to recover compensation, so as to include these and other forms of consequential damages, and thus deprives plaintiffs in error, as taxpayers of the city, of their property without due process of law, we need say no more than that, while the Legislature was powerless to diminish the constitutional measure of just compensation, we are aware of no rule which stands in the way of an extension \n\n[262 U.S. 668, 677]\n\u00a0\n of it, within the limits of equity and justice, so as to include rights otherwise excluded. As stated by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in Earle v. Commonwealth, 180 Mass. 579, 583, 63 N. E. 10 ( 57 L. R. A. 292, 91 Am. St. Rep. 326), speaking through Mr. Justice Hol es, who was then a member of that court:\n'Very likely the ... rights were of a kind that might have been damaged if not destroyed without the constitutional necessity of compensation. But some latitude is allowed to the Legislature. It is not forbidden to be just in some cases where it is not required to be by the letter of paramount law.'\n\n Third. We next consider the contention that the act permits the taking of property and grants the power to lease, sell, or dispose of it without an offer to pay compensation therefor or a determination of it in advance. It has long been settled that the taking of property for public use by a state or one of its municipalities need not be accompanied or preceded by payment, but that the requirement of just compensation is satisfied when the public faith and credit are pledged to a reasonably prompt ascertainment and payment, and there is adequate provision for enforcing the pledge. Sweet v. Rechel, \n159 \nU.S. 380, 400\n, 404 S., 407, 16 Sup. Ct. 43; Williams v. Parker, \n188 \nU.S. 491, 502\n, 503 S., 23 Sup. Ct. 440; Crozier v. Krupp, \n224 \nU.S. 290, 306\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 488; Bragg v. Weaver, \n251 \nU.S. 57, 62\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 62; Hays v. Port of Seattle, \n251 \nU.S. 233, 238\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 125; Adirondack Railway v. New York State, \n176 \nU.S. 335, 349\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 460. Under the provisions of section 23 of the statute, if the owner and the city agree upon the amount, payment is to be made forthwith. If they do not agree, the owner at any time within a year after notice of the taking, or, if not notified, at any time within two years after the public filing of the statement thereof, may proceed in the superior court by petition to have the compensation assessed by a jury, or, at his option, by a commission. For a year in the meantime, he may not be deprived of possession without his consent. As an additional guaranty \n\n[262 U.S. 668, 678]\n\u00a0\n that the judgment obtained will be paid-and paid promptly-the owner under the statute may have execution issued against the city. These provisions adequately fulfill the requirement in respect of the ascertainment and payment of just compensation, within the principles established by the decisions of this Court last above cited.\n Nor is there anything in the complaint that the city, after taking but before payment, is authorized to lease, sell or dispose of any lands taken and held to protect the purity of the water supply, and to remove buildings or improvements which interfere with the progress of the work. That these are simply incidents in the administration of the statute and in the management of property, title to which has passed to the city, which are of no concern to plaintiffs in error and which in no manner affect the validity of the act, is too clear to require anything beyond statement. See Sweet v. Rechel, supra, 159 U. S. pp. 404, 407, 16 Sup. Ct. 43.\n Fourth. Finally, the validity of the act is challenged as denying due process of law, on the ground that the question of the necessity for taking the property has not been determined by the Legislature itself, but is relegated to the city to decide ex parte, without appeal or opportunity for hearing and decision by an impartial tribunal. That the necessity and expediency of taking property for public use is a legislative and not a judicial question is not open to discussion. Adirondack Railway v. New York City, supra, 176 U. S. at p. 349, 20 Sup. Ct. 460; Shoemaker v. United States, \n147 \nU.S. 282, 298\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 361; United States v. Gettysburg Electric Railway, \n160 \nU.S. 668, 685\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 427; Boom Company v. Patterson, \n98 U.S. 403\n, 406. Neither is it any longer open to question in this court that the Legislature may confer upon a municipality the authority to determine such necessity for itself. Bragg v. Weaver, supra, 251, U. S. at page 58, 40 Sup. Ct. 62; Sears v. City of Akron, \n246 \nU.S. 42, 251\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 245.\n The question is purely political, does not require a hearing, and is not the subject of judicial inquiry. The \n\n[262 U.S. 668, 679]\n\u00a0\n Legislature here, while investing the city with the authority to determine it, in each instance, has carefully circumscribed the power by limiting its exercise within a definitely restricted area. The city may take less than this area, but cannot take more.\n The decree of the state court is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKANSAS CITY SOUTHERN R. CO. v. VAN ZANT(1923)\nNo. 142\nArgued: December 4, 1922Decided: January 2, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 459, 460]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Samuel W. Moore, of New York City, and Cyrus Crane, of Kansas City, Mo., for petitioner.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 459, 464]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles H. Montgomery, of Joplin, Mo., for respondent.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 459, 466]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case presents the effect of a condition in a free pass issued by petitioner to respondent and used by her in transportation in interstate commerce-whether determined by the provisions of section 1 of the Hepburn Act (34 Stat. 584 [Comp. St.  8563]) or by the laws of Kansas and Missouri.\n There is practically no dispute about the facts. The pass was authoritatively and gratuitously issued and she sustained injuries in Missouri while using it in an interstate journey. This injury she alleged and prayed judgment against the railway company in the sum of $25,000.\n The railway company opposed the pass to the action. It contained the following condition:\n'The person accepting and using it, thereby assumes all risk of accident and damage to person and baggage.'\n\n The company averred that it was an interstate carrier by rail and issued the pass under article 5 of the federal law, known as the Interstate Commerce Act (24 Stat. 379), and it was to be 'interpreted and controlled in its effect and operation by decisions of the federal courts' construing the act.\n To the defense respondent replied that at the time of receiving the pass she resided in Kansas, and that in accepting it 'she did not and could not assume the risk of accident or damage to her person and baggage, caused by the negligence' of the company, and that the condition upon the pass expressing such effect was void under the provisions of article 3, c. 98, of the General Statutes of \n\n[260 U.S. 459, 467]\n\u00a0\n the State of Kansas of 1915, relating to railroads and other carriers, and that under the statutes and the common law of Kansas the condition was against public policy.\n She further pleaded that under the laws of Missouri the condition was also against public policy and void, and that the action was not, and is not, brought 'upon any federal statute or under any federal law, but upon the common-law liability in force in Missouri, and that the action was, and is, brought in the circuit court of Jasper county, Mo., under the laws of the state of Missouri,' and that the company's liability to her was to be determined by the laws of that state.\n The trial court took that view of the determining law, took and expressed the view that the condition upon the pass was void under the laws and public policy of both states, and ruled that the condition upon it constituted no defense to the action and excluded it from the case. Declarations of law recognizing the relevancy and controlling effect of the condition were refused.\n The court thereupon found for respondent (plaintiff) and fixed her damages at $8,000-that amount having been stipulated as representing her injury. Judgment was entered for that amount, and was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state.\n The Supreme Court discussed at some length the Hepburn Act, the extent of its regulation, and what it permitted to state powers or excluded from them, and said, adopting the language of the railroad commissioner of the state:\n'Our conclusion is that Congress has not legislated on the subject of the rights and liabilities of the parties in cases of interstate carriage of passengers under free passes, not coming within the prohibition of the Hepburn Act, or respecting the validity of stipulations or conditions annexed to such passes exempting the carrier from liability, and that therefore these matters remain the subject of regulation by the several states.' \n\n[260 U.S. 459, 468]\n\u00a0\n The comment concedes the supremacy of federal control, and leaves only the inquiry: Has control been exerted in the Hepburn Act?\n\n The act was passed June 29, 1906, and was an amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887. It was, as the act it amended was, a regulation of carriers in interstate commerce, and it provided that no common carrier subject to its provisions 'shall, after January 1, 1907, directly or indirectly, issue or give any interstate free ticket, free pass, or free transportation for passengers, except to its employees and their families. ...' And a carrier violating the act is subject to a penalty, and any person not of those excepted, who uses the pass, is also subject to a penalty.\n The provision for passes, with its sanction in penalties, is a regulation of interstate commerce, to the completion of which the determination of the effect of the passes is necessary. We think, therefore, free passes in their entirety are taken charge of, not only their permission and use, but the limitations and conditions upon their use; or to put it another way, and to specialize, the relation of their users to the railroad which issued them, the fact and measure of responsibility the railroad incurs by their issue, and the extent of the right the person to whom issued acquires, are taken charge of. And that responsibility and those rights, this court has decided, the railroad company can control by conditions in the passes. Antecedently to the passage of the Hepburn Act, we decided that a passenger who accepts a free pass may exempt a carrier from responsibility for negligence, and no public policy is violated thereby. Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Adams, \n192 U.S. 440\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 408; Boering v. Chesapeake Beach Railway Co., \n193 U.S. 442\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 515.\n Those cases were considered and applied as giving validity to the stipulations of passes issued under the act \n\n[260 U.S. 459, 469]\n\u00a0\n in Charleston & Western Carolina Railway Co. v. Thompson, \n234 U.S. 576\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 964, according thereby freedom of transportation to the possessor of a pass, and giving assurance to the railroad company that its gratuity will not be given the consequences of compensated right and its incident obligations, and be a means of exacting from the company indefinite damages. In this case the prayer was for $25, 000; the recovery was for $8,000. Circumstances might have made it the larger sum; and this, it is the contention and decision, is the determination of state laws which could neither permit nor forbid the gift. We cannot assent. The pass proceeded from the federal act; it is controlled necessarily in its incidents and consequences by the federal act, to the exclusion of state laws and state policies, and such is the effect of the cited cases.\n Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","111":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKANSAS CITY SOUTHERN R. CO. v. WOLF(1923)\nNo. 194\nArgued: January 9, 1923Decided: February 19, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. F. H. Moore, of Kansas City, Mo., S. W. Moore, of New York City, and A. F. Smith, Cyrus Crane, and G. H. Muckley, all of Kansas City, Mo., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Charles M. Blackmar, of Kansas City, Mo., for defendants in error.[ Kansas City Southern R Co v. Wolf \n261 U.S. 133\n (1923) ]\n\n\n[261 U.S. 133, 137]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The original action was begun in the United States District Court, Western District of Missouri, May 12, 1915, to recover charges in excess of the published tariff rates collected by the plaintiff in error upon sundry interstate shipments of strawberries. All the shipments and payments were made prior to June 1, 1912. The company demurred:\n'Because each of said counts shows upon its face that the pretended claim which is made the basis of such count accrued more than two years prior to the institution of this action.'\n\n The trial court overruled the demurr r, and this was approved by the Circuit Court of Appeals (272 Fed. 681), which said:\n'The controlling question in the case is whether the claims for repayment of the overcharges might be the subject of an original in court, or, on the other hand, should first have been submitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission. ... The former procedure was adopted in this case. If the latter should have been followed, the claims were barred by the limitation provided in section 16. We think it quite plain that there was nothing about the tariffs, rules, or claims for overcharge calling for any administrative action of the Commission as a prerequisite to an action in court. There was no attack upon the tariffs or the rules.'\n\n From 1906 to 1920 the Interstate Commerce Act (24 Stat. 379, 382; 34 Stat. 584, 590 [Comp. St.  8573, 8584]), provided:\n Sec. 9. That any person or persons claiming to be damaged by any common carrier subject to the provisions \n\n[261 U.S. 133, 138]\n\u00a0\n of this act may either make complaint to the Commission as hereinafter provided for, or may bring suit in his or their own behalf for the recovery of the damages for which such common carrier may be liable under the provisions of this act, in any District or Circuit Court of the United States of competent jurisdiction; but such person or persons shall not have the right to pursue both of said remedies, and must in each case elect which one of the two methods of procedure herein provided for he or they will adopt.\n Sec. 16. ... All complaints for the recovery of damages shall be filed with the Commission within two years from the time the cause of action accrues, and not after, and a petition for the enforcement of an order for the payment of money shall be filed in the circuit court ... Within one year from the date of the order, and not after. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n In Phillips v. Grand Trunk Western Railway Co., \n236 \nU.S. 662, 667\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 444, 446 (59 L. Ed. 774), an action begun in the United States Circuit \n\n[261 U.S. 133, 139]\n\u00a0\n Court, the plaintiff alleged that the Interstate Commerce Commission had declared the published tariff rate unreasonable and sought to recover overcharges paid more than four years prior thereto. Referring especially to section 16, supra, this court declared:\n'Under such a statute the lapse of time not only bars the remedy, but destroys the liability (Finn v. United States, \n123 U.S. 227\n, 232), whether complaint is filed with the Commission or suit is brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. This will more distinctly appear by considering the requirements of uniformity which, in this as in so many other instances must be borne in mind in construing the Commerce Act. ... To have one period of limitation where the complaint is filed before the Commission and the varying periods of limitation of the different states, where a suit was brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, or to permit a railroad company to plead the statute of limitations as against some and to waive it as against others, would be to prefer some and discriminate against others, in violation of the terms of the Commerce Act, which forbids all devices by which such results may be accomplished. ... The railroad company therefore was bound to claim the benefit of the statute here and could do so here by general demurrer; for when it appeared that the complaint had not been filed within the time required by the statute it was evidence, as matter of law, that the plaintiff had no cause of action. The carrier not being liable to the plaintiff for overcharges collected more than four years prior to the bringing of this suit, it was proper to dismiss the action.'\n\n True it is that the claim of Phillips & Co. was based upon schedule tariff charges theretofore declared to be unreasonable by the Interstate Commerce Commission, while here the payments demanded are said to exceed the published rates when properly applied. But the doctrine of the Phillips Case and the reasoning advanced to sup port \n\n[261 U.S. 133, 140]\n\u00a0\n it, we think, ar applicable to the circumstances of the instant cause. The lapse of time had destroyed any liability by the carrier to the shipper or his assignee for the alleged overcharges, and the demurror should have been sustained.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Transportation Act, February 28, 1920, 41 Stat. 456, 492, amended the pertinent portion of section 16 so that it now reads--\n'Sec. 16. ... (3) All actions at law by carriers subject to this act for recovery of their charges, or any part thereof, shall be begun within three years from the time the cause of action accrues, and not after. All complaints for the recovery of damages shall be filed with the Commission within two years from the time the cause of action accrues, and not after, unless the carrier, after the expiration of such two years or within ninety days before such expiration, begins an action for recovery of charges in respect of the same service, in which case such period of two years shall be extended to and including ninety days from the time such action by the carrier is begun. In either case the cause of action in respect of a shipment of property shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to accrue upon delivery or tender of delivery thereof by the carrier, and not after. A petition for the enforcement of an order for the payment of money shall be filed in the Distict Court or state court within one year from the date of the order, and not after.'\n\n Section 9 was not changed by the Transportation Act of 1920. \n\n\n\n\n","112":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKELLER v. POTOMAC ELECTRIC POWER CO.(1923)\nNo. 260\nArgued: Decided: April 9, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[261 U.S. 428, 429]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank H. Stephens, of Chicago, Ill., and Conrad H. Syme, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n\n\n[261 U.S. 428, 431]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John A. Garver, of New York City, for appellee.\n\n\n[261 U.S. 428, 436]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. It is an appeal provided for in paragraph 64 of the law creating the Public Utilities Commission of the District. The law is section 8 of an act approved March 4, 1913, making appropriations for the District for the year ending June 30, 1914 (37 Stat. 938, 974). Paragraph 7 requires the commission created thereby to value the property of every public utility within the District actually used and useful for the convenience of the public at the fair value thereof at the \n\n[261 U.S. 428, 437]\n\u00a0\n time of the valuation. The commission, after a public hearing, fixed the value of the Potomac Electric Power Company at $11,231,170.43. The company then filed a bill in equity in the Supreme Court of the District against the commission, seeking to enjoin the order as unlawful, unreasonable and inadequate under paragraph 64 of the law. It made a party defendant to the bill the Washington Railway & Electric Company, because it is the sole stockholder of the Power Company.\n The Supreme Court of the District upheld the findings of the commission in every particular and dismissed the bill. From this decree the company appealed to the Court of Appeals of the District, on the ground that the commission and the Supreme Court had found the value as of July 1, 1914, whereas the time of the valuation was December 31, 1916, and between the two dates there had been a sharp rise in values, for which the company was not made any allowance in the valuation, and also because under the circumstances of the case, and the challenge by the company that the valuation was arbitrary, the court should disregard the prima facie effect given by the statute to the findings of the commission, and exercise its own independent judgment as to both law and facts, so far as it was necessary to determine whether the use of such valuation as a basis of rate making would result in confiscation. The Court of Appeals sustained the appeal on these grounds, and remanded the cause for further proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion.\n When this appeal was opened by counsel at the bar we declined to hear the merits, and postponed the case to give both sides an opportunity to prepare to discuss the questions, first whether Congress had the constitutional power to vest the District Courts and this court with jurisdiction to review the proceedings of the commission, and, second, whether if the power existed, the appeal to this court was only intended to apply to a final decree, \n\n[261 U.S. 428, 438]\n\u00a0\n and finally whether this was such a decree. Briefs have accordingly b en filed and we have had an oral argument upon these questions.\n The Public Utilities Law is a very comprehensive one. It applies to all public utilities in the District, except steam rilways and steamboat lines. It creates a commission to supervise and regulate them in the matter of rates, tolls, charges, service, joint rates, and other matters of interest to the public. It directs investigation into the financial history and affairs of each utility and its valuation at a fair value as of the time of valuation. It requires a public hearing on this subject. It also provides that while the utility may fix a schedule of rates, not exceeding the lawful rates at the passage of the act, which it must publish, the commission may of its own initiative, or upon the complaint of another, or indeed of the utility itself, investigate the reasonableness, lawfulness, and adequacy of the rate or service and may change the same. The utility must then adopt the change and publish its schedules accordingly. The law further provides that, in such proceedings, the utility shall have notice and a hearing, that a stenographic record of the proceedings shall be kept and produced by the commission in any court proceeding thereafter instituted to question the validity, reasonableness, or adequacy of the action of the commission.\n The relevant part of paragraph 64 is given in full in the margin. \n1\n In short, it enables the commission by action \n\n[261 U.S. 428, 439]\n\u00a0\n in equity to invoke the advice of the District Supreme Court upon the elements in value to be by it considered in arriving at a true valuation of the property of a utility. It further grants to any utility or any person or corporate interest dessatisfied with any valuation, rate or rates, or regulation, or requirement, act, service, or other thing fixed by the commission the right to begin a proceeding in equity in the Supreme Court, to vacate, set aside, or modify the order on the ground that the valuation, rate, regulation, or requirement is unlawful, inadequate, or unreasonable. Paragraph 65 limits the time within which such a proceeding to vacate, set aside, or amend the order of \n\n[261 U.S. 428, 440]\n\u00a0\n the commission may be begun to 120 days, and thereafter the right to appeal or of recourse to the courts shall terminate absolutely. Paragraph 67 provides that, if new evidence is introduced by the plaintiff different from that offered in the hearing before the commission, unless the parties otherwise agree, the new evidence shall be sent to the commission to enable it to change its order if it sees fit, and then the court shall proceed to consider the appeal either on the original order or the changed order as the case may be. Paragraph 69 provides that in such proceedings the burden of proof is upon the party adverse to the commission to show by clear and satisfactory evidence that the determination, requirement, direction, or order of the commission complained of is inadequate, unreasonable, or unlawful as the case may be.\n What is the nature of the power thus conferred on the District Supreme Court. Is it judicial or is it legislative? Is the court to pass solely on questions of law, and look to the facts only to decide what are the questions of law really arising, or to consider whether there was any showing of facts before the commission upon which, as a matter of law, its finding can be justified? Or has it the power, in this equitable proceeding, to review the exercise of discretion by the commission and itself raise or lower valuations, rates, or restrict or expand orders as to service? Has it the power to make the order the commission should have made? If it has, then the court is to exercise legislative power, in that it will be laying down new rules, to change present conditions and to guide future action, and is not confined to definition and protection of existing rights. In Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line, \n211 \nU.S. 210, 226\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 67, 69 (53 L. Ed. 150) we said:\n'A judicial inquiry investigates, declares, and enforces liabil ties as they stand on present or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist. That is its purpose and end. Legislation, on the other hand, looks to the future \n\n[261 U.S. 428, 441]\n\u00a0\n and changes existing conditions by making a new rule to be applied thereafter to all or some part of those subject to its power. The establishment of a rate is the making of a rule for the future, and therefore is an act legislative not judicial in kind. ...'\n\n Under the law, the proceeding in the District Supreme Court is of a very special character. The court may by called in to advise the commission as to the elements of value to be by it considered, at any stage of the hearing before the commission. To modify of amend a valuation, or a rate, or a regulation of the commission as inadequate, as the court is authorized to do, seems to us necessarily to import the power to increase the valuation, or rate, or to make a regulation more comprehensive, and to consider the evidence before it for this purpose. In other words, the proceeding in court is an appeal from the action of the commission in the chancery sense. In the briefs of counsel for the commission it is so termed. The form which the bill filed is given by the electric company is that of a series of exceptions to the rulings of the court on the evidence and at every stage of the hearing and finally to the conclusions of fact as against the weight of the evidence. Paragraph 69 is significant in its indication that issues of fact as to inadequacy of the action by the commission are to be passed on by the court.\n Counsel seek to establish an analogy between the jurisdiction of the District Supreme Court to review the action of the commission, and that conferred on, and exercised by, the federal District Courts in respect of the orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission. We think, however, that the analogy fails. The act for the creation of the Commerce Court provided ( Judicial Code,  207 [Comp. St.  993]) that is should have the jurisdiction of the then Circuit Courts of all cases brought to enjoin, set aside or annul or suspend in whole or in part any order of the commission. When the Commerce Court was abolished by the \n\n[261 U.S. 428, 442]\n\u00a0\n Act of October 22, 1913 (38 Stat. 219 [Comp. St.  992]), this jurisdiction was conferred on the several District Courts of the United States. This permits these courts to consider all relevant questions of contitutional power or right and all pertinent questions whether the administrative order is within the statutory authority, or is an attempted exercise or it so unreasonable as not to be within it; but these are questions of law only. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., \n215 \nU.S. 452, 470\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 155. Of course the consideration and decision of questions of law may involve a consideration of controverted facts to determine what the question of law is, but it is settled that any finding of fact by the commission, if supported by evidence, is final and conclusive on the courts. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R. R., \n222 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 108. A similar distinction exists between the jurisdiction here conferred and that vested in circuit courts of appeals in reference to proceedings before the Trade Commission. Act Sept. 26, 1914, c. 311,  5, 38 Stat. 719 (Comp. St.  8836e). The language of the act under discussion is much wider than that of the Interstate Commerce Act or of the Federal Trade Commission provisions. It brings the court much more intimately into the legislative machinery for fixing rates than does the Interstate Commerce Act. We cannot escape the conclusion that Congress intended that the court shall revise the legislative discretion of the commission by considering the evidence and full record of the case and entering the order it deems the commission ought to have made.\n Can the Congress vest such jurisdiction in the courts of the District of Columbia? By the Constitution (clause 17, section 8, article 1) Congress is giv n power 'to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over' the District of Columbia. This means that as to the District Congress possesses, not only the power which belongs to it in respect of territory within a state, but the power of \n\n[261 U.S. 428, 443]\n\u00a0\n the state as well. In other words, it possesses a dual authority over the District, and may clothe the courts of the District, not only with the jurisdiction and powers of federal courts in the several states, but with such authority as a state may confer on her courts. Kendall v. United States, 12 Pet. 524, 619. Instances in which congressional enactments have been sustained which conferred powers and placed duties on the courts of the District of an exceptional and advisory character are found in Butterworth v. Hoe, \n112 \nU.S. 50, 60\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 25, United States v. Duell, \n172 U.S. 576\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 286, and Baldwin Co. v. R. S. Howard Co., \n256 U.S. 35\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 405. Subject to the guaranties of personal liberty in the amendments and in the original Constitution, Congress has as much power to vest courts of the District with a variety of jurisdiction and powers as a state Legislature has in conferring jurisdiction on its courts. In Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line, supra, we held that, when 'a state Constitution sees fit to unite legislative and judicial powers in a single hand, there is nothing to hinder so far as the Constitution of the United States is concerned.' \n211 U.S. 225\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 67, 69 (53 L. Ed. 150); Dreyer v. Illinois, \n187 \nU.S. 71, 83\n, 84 S., 23 Sup. Ct. 28.\n It follows that the provisions in the law for a review of the Commission's proceedings by the Supreme Court of the District and for an appeal to the District Court of Appeals are valid. A different question arises, however, when we come to consider the validity of the provision for appeal to this court. It is contained in the following sentence in paragraph 64:\n'Any party, including said commission, may appeal from the order or decree of said court to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, and therefrom to the Supreme Court of the United States, which shall thereupon have and take jurisdiction in every such appeal.'\n\n The court proceedings to review the orders of the commission authorized by paragraph 64 are expressly required \n\n[261 U.S. 428, 444]\n\u00a0\n to conform to equity procedure. In that procedure, an appeal brings up the whole record and the appellate court is authorized to review the evidence and make such order or decree as the court of first instance ought to have made, giving proper weight to the findings on disputed issues of fact which should be accorded to a tribunal which heard the witnesses. This court is therefore given jurisdiction to review the entire record, and to make the order or decree which the commission and the District Courts should have made.\n Such legislative or administrative jurisdiction, it is well settled cannot be conferred on this court either directly or by appeal. The latest and fullest authority upon this point is to be found in the opinion of Mr. Justice Day, speaking for the court in Muskrat v. United States, \n219 U.S. 346\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 250. The principle there recognized and enforced on reason and authority is that the jurisdiction of this court and of the inferior courts of the United States ordained and established by Congress under and by virtue of the third article of the Constitution is limited to cases and controversies in such form that the judicial power is capable of acting on them and does not extend to an issue of constitutional law framed by Congress for the purpose of invoking the advice of this court without real parties or a real case, or to administrative or legislative issues or controversies. Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 410, note (1 L. Ed. 436); United States v. Ferreira, 13 How. 40, 52; Ex parte Siebold, \n100 U.S. 371\n, 398; Gordon v. United States, \n117 U.S. 697\n, appen ix; Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n215 U.S. 216\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 86.\n The fact that the appeal to this court is invalid does not, however, render paragraph 64 invalid as a whole. Paragraph 92 of the law declares each paragraph to be independent and directs that the holding of any paragraph or any part of it invalid shall not affect the validity of the rest. Moreover, we think Congress would have \n\n[261 U.S. 428, 445]\n\u00a0\n given the appeals to the courts of the District, even if it had known that the appeal to this court could not stand.\n Some question has been made as to the validity of paragraph 65, which forbids all recourse to courts to set aside, vacate and amend the orders of the commission after 120 days, and of paragraph 69, which puts the burden upon the party adverse to the commission to show by clear and satisfactory evidence the inadequacy, unreasonableness, or unlawfulness of the order complained of. It is suggested that this deprives the public utility of its constitutional right to have the independent judgment of a court on the question of the confiscatory character of an order, and so brings the whole law within the inhibition of the case of Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, \n253 U.S. 287\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 527. It is enough to say that, even if paragraphs 65 and 69 were invalid, the whole act would not fail, in view of paragraph 92 already referred to. It will be time enough to consider the validity of those sections, when it is sought to apply them to bar or limit an independent judicial proceeding raising the question whether a rate or other requirement of the commission is confiscatory. Our conclusion that the provision for appeal to this court in paragraph 64 is invalid makes it unnecessary to decide whether the appeal must be from a final decree, or whether the decree of the Court of Appeals was final.\n Appeal dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Par. 64.

PARAMOUNT AUTO EXCH. CORP.(1923)\nNo. 17\nArgued: October 5, 1922Decided: June 11, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 544, 545]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Albert K. Stebbins and Jackson B. Kemper, both of Milwaukee, Wis., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Walter H. Bender, of Milwaukee, Wis., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiff in error, a Kentucky corporation, brought an action of replevin in a state court at Milwaukee, Wis., against the defendant in error, a Wisconsin corporation, to recover an automobile; the right of recovery asserted in the complaint being put on the ground that the plaintiff was the owner and entitled to the possession of the automobile, that one Allen had unlawfully taken it from the plaintiff's possession at Louisville, Ky., had fraudulently removed it to Milwaukee and had there wrongfully delivered it to the defendant and that the defendant was unjustly withholding it from the plaintiff under some groundless claim derived from Allen. The defendant appeared and obtained from the court an order requiring the plaintiff's secretary, who resided at Louisville and was in the plaintiff's service there, to appear in Milwaukee at a fixed time before a designated court commissioner, to bring with him all papers, files, and records of the plaintiff which were under his control and relevant \n\n[262 U.S. 544, 546]\n\u00a0\n to the controversy, and then and there to submit to an examination by the defendant. The order was sought and granted on the ground that the examination would better enable the defendant to plead to the complaint, which as yet it had not done. The plaintiff was not engaged in any business in Wisconsin, nor had it complied with the law of that state prescribing conditions on which it might do so. It had no property in the state other than the automobile, and it had gone into the state only for the purpose of instituting and prosecuting the action to repossess itself of that vehicle. Its secretary was not within the state; nor did it have any representative there, other than the attorneys who were prosecuting the action in its behalf. For itself and its secretary it consented that such an examination as was sought might be had at Louisville, at any time and before any officer the court might designate, but it objected to any order requiring that the examination be had in Milwaukee. The objection was overruled, and the court put in the order a direction that the defendant tender to the plaintiff for its secretary the railroad fare from the southern boundary of Wisconsin to Milwaukee and return, being $4.74, and one day's witness fee, being $1.50. The tender was made and declined, and the secretary, with the plaintiff's approval, refused to comply with the order. Becuase of this the court, on the defendant's motion and over the plaintiff's objection, made a further order striking the plaintiff's complaint from the files and dismissing its cause of action, with costs. On appeal to the Supreme Court of the state, both orders were sustained over the plaintiff's contention that they and the statute under which they were made violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. 171 Wis. 586, 178 N. W. 9. To obtain a review of the judgment of the Supreme Court the case was brought here on writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214). \n\n[262 U.S. 544, 547]\n\u00a0\n Th statutory provisions whose validity is questioned are parts of a procedural measure, embodied in the 1917 edition1 of the Wisconsin Statutes, abrogating prior modes of obtaining a discovery under oath and providing for an adversary examination of a 'party, his or its assignor, officer, agent or employe, or of the person who was such officer, agent or employe at the time of the occurrence' involved-the examination to be had at any time after the case is begun and to take the form of a deposition 'upon oral interrogatories' and be transmitted to the court like other depositions. The provisions in question are subdivision 7 of section 4096 and subdivision 2 of section 4097, which read as follows:\n'In case a foreign corporation is a party, the examination of its president, secretary, other principal officer, assignor or agent or employe, or the person who was such, or either of them, at the time of the occurrence of the facts made the subject of the examination, may be had under the provisions of this section in any county of this state. The court may also, upon motion and such terms as may be just, fix a time and place in this state for such examination of any of said persons. Such persons so sought to be examined as aforesaid shall attend at such time and place and submit to the examination, and then and there have with him all papers, books, files, records, things, and matters in the possession of such person by reason of his relation to such corporation, relevant to the controversy. Such person sought to be examined as aforesaid shall attend at such time and place and submit to the examination, and, if required, attend for the purpose of reading and signing such deposition, without service of subpoena.' \n\n[262 U.S. 544, 548]\n\u00a0\n 'If any officer, agent or employe, or any person who was such officer, agent, or employe of a foreign corporation, at the time of the occurrence of the facts made the subject of the examination, be lawfully required to appear and testify, as provided in this chapter, either within or without the state , ... shall refuse and neglect to have with him any papers, books, files, records, things, and matters in the possession of such party relevant to the controversy, such party may be punished as for a contempt and in the discretion of the court, the pleading of such foreign corporation stricken out, and judgment given against it as upon default or failure of proof.'\n\n When the order for the examination was made, other parts of the statute, applicable to all suitors other than foreign corporation, provided, notably subdivisions 3 and 6 of section 4096, that where the party against whom the examination was sought was a resident of the state the examination could be had only in the county of his residence, and where the party was a nonresident the examination could be had in the state only if he could be personally served therein with notice and subpoena, and then only in the county where such service was had. In George v. Bode, 170 Wis. 411, 175 N. W. 939, the Supreme Court of the state held that an examination within the state could not be ordered against a party, other than a foreign corporation, residing outside and on whom personal service could not be had therein, the court saying in that connection:\n'The examination may be taken in this state if he can be personally served with notice and subpoena; the inevitable inference is that it is only if he can be served that he can be so examined. If the provisions of subdivision 3 mean that the court might fix a time and place for his examination within this state regardless of the personal service of notice and subpoena, then the provisions \n\n[262 U.S. 544, 549]\n\u00a0\n of subdivision 6 regarding nonresidence would be wholly unnecessary. These considerations move us to construe the statute as not empowering the court to order the examination of a nonre ident to take place within this state when he cannot be personally served with notice and subpoena.'\n\n By subdivision 7 of section 4096, before quoted, an exception was made as to foreign corporations whereby examinations within the state might be ordered and compelled against them regardless of their nonresidence and of any inability to obtain service on them in the state. Thus they were subjected to a rule much more onerous than that applicable to nonresident individuals in like situations and also more onerous than that applicable to resident suitors, whether individuals or corporations. The Supreme Court justified this difference in legislative treatment and also the order for an examination in this case on the ground that they amounted to no more than a reasonable exercise of the authority of the state over a nonresident corporation coming voluntarily into the state to seek a remedy in her courts against a resident defendant.\n We take a different view of the matter. According to the sworn complaint, to the allegations of which due regard must be had, the automobile belonged to the plaintiff. It had been unlawfully taken from the plaintiff's possession in Kentucky and put in the defendant's possession in Wisconsin. It did not get into the latter state through any act of the plaintiff; nor did the acts by which it got there make it any the less the plaintiff's property. Only by going into that state and there instituting an action of replevin against the wrongful possessor could the plaintiff repossess itself of its property. Unless it took that course, its property would be lost. The state court whose aid it invoked was one whose jurisdiction was general and adequate for the purpose. In the circumstances, \n\n[262 U.S. 544, 550]\n\u00a0\n the right to bring the action was plain. See Charter Oak Life Insurance Co. v. Sawyer, 44 Wis. 387; Chicago Title & Trust Co. v. Bashford, 120 Wis. 281, 97 N. W. 940; Sioux Remedy Co. v. Cope, \n235 U.S. 197\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 57. To have denied that right would in effect have deprived the plaintiff of its property and have been an intolerable injustice. That the plaintiff owed its corporate existence to Kentucky did not enable Wisconsin to treat its plight with indifference. It was a 'person' within the meaning of both the due process clause and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific R. R. Co., \n118 \nU.S. 394, 396\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 1132; Covington & Lexington Turnpike Co. v. Sandford, \n164 \nU.S. 578, 592\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 198; Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 522\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 418; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Vosburg, \n238 U.S. 56\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 675, L. R. A. 1915E, 953. The latter clause declares that no state shall 'deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,' meaning, of course, the protection of laws applying equally to all in the same situation. The words 'within its jurisdiction' are comprehensive, but we have no need for attempting a full definition of them here. It is enough to say that, when the plaintiff went into Wisconsin, as it did, for the obviously lawful purpose of repossessing itself, by a permissible action in her courts, of specific personal property unlawfully taken out of its possession elsewhere and fraudulently carried into that state, it was, in our opinion, within her jurisdiction for all the purposes of that undertaking. See Southern Ry. Co. v. Greene, \n216 U.S. 400\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 287, 17 Ann. Cas. 1247; Blake v. McClung, \n172 U.S. 239\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 165. And we think there is no tenable ground for regarding it as any less entitled to the equal protection of the laws in that state than an individual would have been in the same circumstances; for, as was held in Gulf, Colorado, & Sante Fe Ry. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 U.S. 154\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 256 'a state has no more power to deny to corporations the equal protection of the law than it has to individual c tizens.' \n\n[262 U.S. 544, 551]\n\u00a0\n No doubt a corporation of one state seeking relief in the courts of another must conform to the prevailing modes of proceeding in those courts and submit to reasonable rules respecting the payment of costs or giving security therefor and the like (see Canadian Northern Ry. Co. v. Eggen, \n252 \nU.S. 553, 561\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 402); but it cannot be subjected, merely because it is such a corporation, to onerous requirements having no reasonable support in that fact and not laid on other suitors in like situations. Here the statute authorized the imposition, and there was imposed, on the plaintiff a highly burdensome requirement because of its corporate origin-a requirement which under the statute could not be laid on an individual suitor in the same situation. The discrimination was essentially arbitrary. There could be no reason for requiring a corporate resident of Louisville to send its secretary, papers, files, and books to Milwaukee for the purposes of an adversary examination that would not apply equally to an individual resident of Louisville in a like case. The discrimination is further illustrated by the provision that as to all residents of Wisconsin, individual and corporate, the examination should be had in the county of their residence, no matter what its distance from the place of suit.\n We hold that the statute as it was applied in this case was invalid, and the orders made under it were erroneous, as denying to the plaintiff the equal protection of the laws. This conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider the contention made under the due process clause.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, dissenting, with whom Mr. Justice HOLMES concurs.\n To sustain the contention that the statute violates the due process clause, it would be necessary to hold that under no conceivable circumstances could the trial court \n\n[262 U.S. 544, 552]\n\u00a0\n have reasonably required the nonresident plaintiff who invoked its process to submit within the state to examination as a witness and to an inspection of relevant books and papers. If the order for examination was legal, it was proper to dismiss the suit in case the order was disobeyed. That there may be cases in which oral examination of a plaintiff in the presence of defendant and by counsel familiar with the matter in issue is essential to an adequate presentation of the facts cannot be doubted. If so, it is within the power of a state to require that a plaintiff shall submit to such preliminary examination some-where. Whether this was a case requiring such examination could be determined properly only upon hearing the parties; and for such hearing opportunity was given by the judge of the trial court. If this was a case in which oral examination and inspection of the documents was essential to an adequate presentation of the matter in controversy, it was necessary, in order to secure it, that either the plaintiff's secretary should go to Milwaukee for examination, or that defendant and counsel should go to Louisville. Whether, under such circumstances, the plaintiff should in fairness be required to come to the place where he instituted suit, or the defendants be obliged to go with counsel to the plaintiff's place of residence, was, likewise, a matter which could properly be determined only upon hearing the parties; and this opportunity was given by the judge of the trial court. It cannot be that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment deprives a state of the power to authorize its courts to so mould their process as to secure, in this way, the adequate presentation of a case.\n To sustain the contention that the statute denies to plaintiff equal protection of the laws would seem to require the court to overrule Blake v. McClung, \n172 \nU.S. 239, 260\n, 261 S., 19 Sup. Ct. 165, and many other cases. The plaintiff, a foreign corporation, not doing business within the state \n\n[262 U.S. 544, 553]\n\u00a0\n of Wisconsin, was not a person 'within its jurisdiction.' Moreover, the statutory provision complained of put nonresidents substantially upon an equality with residents. Compare Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160, 167\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 30. No question of interstate commerce is involved. In my opinion the equal protection clause does not prevent Wisconsin from moulding, in the case of foreign corporations, the details of its judicial procedure to accord with the requirements of justice. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] After the proceedings in the Milwaukee court some changes were made in this procedural measure, but the changes do not affect the orders in question. \n\n\n\n\n","114":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKING COUNTY, WASH. v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1(1923)\nNo. 30\nArgued: April 13, 1923Decided: December 3, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 361, 362]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Howard A. Hanson and Malcolm Douglas, both of Seattle, Wash., for appellant.\n Mr. Henry W. Pennock, of Seattle, Wash., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Act of Congress of May 23, 1908 (35 Stat. 260 [Comp. St.  5149]), 1 directs that 25 per cent. of all money received from each forest reserve during any fiscal year shall be paid at the end thereof by the Secretary of the Treasury to the state in which the reserve is situated, 'to be expended as the state ... Legislature may prescribe for the benefit of the public schools and public roads of the county or counties in which the forest reserve is situated,' and it is provided that, when any forest reserve is in more than one state or territory or county, the distributive share to each from the proceeds of said reserve shall be proportional to its area therein. A statute of Washington (Laws 1907, c. 185, p. 406) directs the state treasurer to turn over to the county treasurers the amounts of such money belonging to the respective counties, and provides that 'county commissioners of the respective counties to which the money is distributed are hereby authorized and directed to expend said money for the benefit of the public schools and public roads thereof, and not otherwise.'\n The Secretary of the Treasury paid over to the state the proper amounts for the years from 1908 to 1918, inclusive. A part of the Snoqualmie Forest Reserve is in King county, and the proportionate amounts for these \n\n[263 U.S. 361, 363]\n\u00a0\n years, aggregating $20,106.07, were turned over by the state to the county treasurer. For each of the years 1908, 1916, 1917, and 1918, the county commissioners directed that one-half of the amount be apportioned to the county school fund and one-half to the road and bridge fund, and for each of the years from 1909 to 1915, inclusive, directed that all be assigned to the road and bridge fund. The county treasurer made the distributions as directed. Out of the total amount above mentioned there was assigned $ 18,481.43 to the road and bridge fund and $1,624.64 to the county school fund. The latter is $8,428.40 less than one-half the total received by the county. The appellee is one of the school districts of the county, and claims to be entitled to such proportion of one-half the amount received in each year by the county as the annual school attendance in the district bore to the total attendance in all the districts of the county. The amounts so claimed make a total of $6,789.22.\n This suit was brought by the appellee, Seattle School District No. 1, to have King county and its treasurer declared to be trustees, to require them to account, and to recover the sum so claimed. The complaint set forth the facts substantially as above stated. The county moved to dismiss on the grounds that the court was without jurisdiction and that the complaint failed to state a cause of action. The motion was denied, and, the appellant declining to plead further, a decree was entered in favor of the appellee as prayed; this was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Section 24 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  991) provides that the District Courts shall have original jurisdiction where the matter in controversy arises under the laws of the United States. In this case the right and title set up by the appellee depends upon the act of Congress. There is involved the question whether that act permits the money so received by the county to be expended by the county \n\n[263 U.S. 361, 364]\n\u00a0\n commissioners as directed by state legislation, or requires an equal distribution annually for the benefit of public schools and public roads of the county. Appellee contended for the latter construction, and the courts below sustained its claim. If this is not a correct construction of the act, appellee has no cause of action. See Northern Pacific Railway v. Soderberg, \n188 \nU.S. 526, 528\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 365; Shulthis v. McDougal, \n225 \nU.S. 561, 569\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 704. The District Court had jurisdiction.\n When turned over to the state, the money belongs to it absolutely. There is no limitation upon the power of the Legislature to prescribe how the expenditures shall be made for the purposes stated, though, by the act of Congress, 'there is a sacred obligation imposed on its public faith.' Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173, 182 (15 L. Ed. 338); Alabama v. Schmidt, \n232 \nU.S. 168, 173\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 301; Mills County v. Railway Companies, \n107 \nU.S. 557, 566\n, 2 S. Sup. Ct. 654; Hagar v. Reclamation District, \n111 \nU.S. 701, 713\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 663. No trust for the benefit of appellee is created by the grant. But, assuming the moneys paid over to the state are charged with a trust that there shall be expended annually one-half for schools and one-half for roads, the appellee had no right to enforce the trust. Congress alone can inquire into the manner of its execution by the state. United States v. Louisiana, \n127 U.S. 182\n, 185-192, 8 Sup. Ct. 1047; Mills County v. Railway Companies, supra; Emigrant Co. v. County of Adams, \n100 U.S. 61\n, 69; Barrett v. Brooks, 21 Iowa. 144, 148. See, also, Stearns v. Minnesota, \n179 \nU.S. 223, 231\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 73. The act does not direct any division of the money between schools and roads. Its language above quoted indicates an intention on the part of Congress that the state in its discretion may prescribe by legislation how the money is to be expended. No distribution to the appellee or any other school district is required. The public schools and public roads are provided and maintained by the state or its subdivisions, and the moneys granted by \n\n[263 U.S. 361, 365]\n\u00a0\n the United States are assets in the hands of the state to be used for the specified purposes as it deems best. See State v. Callvert, 34 Wash. 58, 61, 74 Pac. 1018\n\n\n The rule that, where a grant to two or more persons does not state the interest of each, their estates are presumed to be equal,2 does not apply. Under the act of Congress, it was competent for the Legislature of Washington to authorize county commissioners to expend the money for public schools and public roads. Equal division annually between the two purposes is not required or contemplated by the act. The appellee has no standing to object to the distributions made by the county commissioners.\n The decree appealed from is reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Act March 4, 1907 3j Stat. 1270 (Comp.

U S(1923)\nNo. 78\nArgued: Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 188, 189]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Daniel C. Donoghue, of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellants.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Ottinger, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellants, plaintiffs below, were the owners of a traction steam shovel, which they leased to the Bates & Rogers Construction Company for $ 25 per day. At the time of the lease and prior thereto the construction company was engaged, under contract, in certain work for the United States for which the shovel was procured and used. Article II, paragraph (c), of the contract under which the work was done provided that the construction company should be reimbursed for rentals actually paid for steam shovels, at rates which were named, the company being required to file with the contracting officer of the government a schedule setting forth the fair valuation of each part of the construction plant at the time of its arrival at the site of the work. This valuation was made final except upon a contingency which is not material here. The paragraph further provided that when the total \n\n[263 U.S. 188, 190]\n\u00a0\n rental paid by the government for any such part should equal its valuation, no further rental should be paid and title thereto should vest in the United States. At the completion of the work the contracting officer was by the contract given the option to purchase for the United States any part of the plant then owned by the construction company by paying the difference between the valuation thereof and the total amount of rentals theretofore paid.\n A written instrument leasing the steam shovel to the construction company was executed by the plaintiffs and the construction company, which, among other things, recited that plaintiffs had made themselves acquainted with the provisions of article II of the contract between the construction company and the United States, which plaintiffs agreed should 'apply to and be enforceable against the said equipment furnished and leased hereunder, to the end that the United States government may have and exercise as to and against said equipment all rights provided for in said paragraph (c) in respect of plant or parts thereof owned and furnished by the party of the second part' (the construction company); the plaintiffs 'to be entitled as owner to receive any purchase price payments which upon any appropriation of said equipment by the United States government under said article II may be coming from said government.' The valuation of the shovel stated in the lease was $5,000. Basing his action expressly upon the provisions of the lease incorporating paragraph (c), and after $4,225 in rentals had been paid upon the shovel, the contracting officer, properly authorized to do so, exercised the option of the government and took over the steam shovel as its property. This was done a short time before the completion of the work. The plaintiffs were notified, but insisted that the lease did not authorize this action. The record shows that the government has been ready and willing at all times to pay the difference ($775) \n\n[263 U.S. 188, 191]\n\u00a0\n BETWEEN THE VALUATION OF THE SHOVEL AND The amount of rentals paid.\n Plaintiffs insisted that the United States was not privy to the leasing contract and brought suit to recover the value of the shovel, viz. $ 5,000, upon the theory that it had been taken by the government for public use and that thereby an implied obligation arose on the part of the government to pay just compensation therefor. The court below, one judge dissenting, found that the property was taken under the express contract, creating a liability for $775 only, and, therefore, no implication of a promise could be indulged. JUDGMENT FOR PLAINTIFFS FOR THIS AMOUNT wAs rendered.\n In United States v. North American Co., \n253 \nU.S. 330, 335\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 518, 520 (64 L. Ed. 935), this court said:\n'The right to bring this suit against the United States in the Court of Claims is not founded upon the Fifth Amendment, Schillinger v. United States, \n155 U.S. 163\n, 168; Basso v. United States, \n239 U.S. 602\n; but upon the existence of an implied contract entered into by the United States, Langford v. United States, \n101 U.S. 341\n; Bigby v. United States, \n188 U.S. 400\n; Tempel v. United States, \n248 U.S. 121\n, 129; United States v. Great Falls Manufacturing Co., \n112 U.S. 645\n, supra, United States v. Lynah, \n188 \nU.S. 445, 462\n, 465 S., supra.'\n\n But the circumstances may be such as to clearly rebut the existence of an implied Contract, Ball Engineering Co. v. White & Co., \n250 \nU.S. 46, 57\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 393; Horstmann Co. v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 138, 146\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 58, as here, where possession of the property was taken under an asserted claim of right to do so by virtue of an express contract. It is said that the claim is not well founded, but that is not material. In Tempel v. United State, \n248 \nU.S. 121, 130\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 56. 59 (63 L. Ed. 162), this court said:\n'It is unnecessary to determine whether this claim of the government is well founded. The mere fact that the government then claimed and now claims title in itself and that it denies title in the plaintiffs prevents the \n\n[263 U.S. 188, 192]\n\u00a0\n court from assuming jurisdiction of the controversy. The law cannot imply a promise by the government to pay for a right over, or interest in, land, which right or interest the government claimed and claims it possessed before it utilized the same. If the government's claim is unfounded, a property right of plaintiff was violated; but the cause of action therefor, if any, is one sounding in tort; and for such, the Tucker Act affords no remedy.'\n\n The parties here stipulated and the Court of Claims found that the property 'was appropriated by the government as its property under the purchase privilege clause of the contract between plaintiffs and the Bates & Rogers Construction Company.' A contract implied in fact is one inferred from the circumstances or acts of the parties; but an express contract speaks for itself and leaves no place for implications. See King v. Kilbride, 58 Conn. 109, 117, 19 Atl. 519; Brown v. Fales, 139 Mass. 21, 28, 29 N. E. 211. To sustain the contention that the express contract is not binding or enforceable in favor of the government and consequently that its claim here is not well founded would not help the plaintiffs, since then the resulting cause of action would be one sounding in tort and not within the purview of the Tucker Act (24 Stat. 505). Tempel v. United States, supra. In this view of the matter it becomes unnecessary to consider whether the privilege of purchase was prematurely exercised.\n The Court of Claims did not dismiss the petition but rendered judgment in accordance with the terms of the express contract. Whether this action was proper under the pleadings we do not stop to inquire since the government has not appealed therefrom and its liability under the express contract is admitted. The judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","116":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nL VOGELSTEIN & CO. v. U S(1923)\nNo. 269\nArgued: Decided: May 21, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. A. G. Reeves, of New York City, F. D. M. McKenney, of Washington, D. C., and Russell H. Robbins, of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Between September 28, 1917, and February 1, 1918, the United States obtained from appellant 12,542,857 pounds of copper and paid 23 1\/2 cents per pound therefor. By \n\n[262 U.S. 337, 338]\n\u00a0\n its petition, appellant asks judgment for $424,196.54, being 3.381977 cents per pound, in addition to the price paid. The Court of Claims made findings of fact, and as a conclusion of law held that appellant was not entitled to recover, and dismissed the petition. From that judgment this appeal is taken.\n The Court of Claims found that the market price of copper was 23 1\/2 cents per pound. The United States insists that payment of the market price was just compensation. The appellant claims that there was no express contract of sale, that the copper was taken pursuant to mandatory orders, and that it did not waive its right to just compensation. It submits that the finding of the Court of Claims that after September 20, 1917, the market price of copper was 23 1\/2 cents per pound, must be read as referring to a mere fiat price fixed by the United States, and that it does not mean the market price as fixed by supply and demand and other elements in normal trading in copper. It asserts that the necessary costs of the copper to it was 26.881977 cents per pound, and demands that price.\n It appears from the findings that appellant purchased ores, minerals, and metals, had them smelted and refined, and sold the refined products. It was not a mine owner, operator, producer, or refiner. On September 20, 1917, at close of business, it had on hand 43,851,042 pounds of copper. It had purchased 34,687,579 pounds as unrefined copper under long-term contracts, and 9,163,463 pounds as refined copper in the open market. The average cost to appellant was 26.881977 cents per pound. Out of the stock then on hand, it had sold 31,308,183 pounds at 26.34389 cents per pound. There remained 12,542,857 pounds.\n It further appears that, some time before September 21, 1917, an agreement was made by the War Industries Board with copper producers, fixing a price of 23 1\/2 cents \n\n[262 U.S. 337, 339]\n\u00a0\n per pound for copper, and this agreement was approved by the President on that date. September 28, 1917, Vogelstein, who controlled appellant, attended a meeting of copp r producers and government representatives, and placed in nomination the persons who were chosen at that meeting as members of a committee to act for the copper producers in carrying out the agreement of September 21st, and to co-operate with government representatives in securing performance of the agreement and to take the necessary measures to that end. The United Metals Selling Company was the sales agent for copper producers, and the plan adopted for obtaining the copper for the United States was for the War and Navy Departments to send orders and shipping directions to the Selling Company. The orders were sent to the producers' committee, which returned them to the Selling Company with the name of the producer or dealer on whom the orders should be made. Thereupon the Selling Company placed its own order with the producer or dealer named, requesting the shipment to be made, and stating the price to be paid as 23 1\/2 cents per pound. The Selling Company from time to time, beginning April 6, 1917, made a number of contracts for the furnishing of copper to the United States. The first two, respectively dated April 6 and April 21, covered 45,100,000 pounds at 16.6739 cents per pound. Later contracts covered 297,826,734 pounds at 23 1\/2 cents per pound. Between September 28, 1917, and February 1, 1918, the period in which appellant's copper here involved was obtained, about 283,000,000 pounds were furnished the United States under these contracts. In appellant's petition it is stated that since September 21, 1917, it sold and delivered to the United States at least 25,000,000 pounds of copper, which cost it substantially 23 1\/2 cents per pound, the price it received from the United States. Appellant's contention that there was no market price other than that fixed by the fiat of \n\n[262 U.S. 337, 340]\n\u00a0\n the United States is without support. The price so found uniformly prevailed during the period in question. Appellant co-operated with others having copper to sell in putting into effect and maintaining that price. The finding of the Court of Claims is plain and cannot be read as referring to a mere fiat price. It is not impaired, but is supported and confirmed, by other findings. The appellant is bound by it.\n It contends that when the price was fixed at 23 1\/2 cents per pound, it unavoidably had on hand the 12,542,857 pounds of copper in question; that this copper was requisitioned and taken upon mandatory orders pursuant to sections 120 and 123 of an Act approved June 3, 1916 (39 Stat. 213, 215 [Comp. St.  3115g, 3110a]), and that it protested against the price. It moves to remand the case with directions to find facts with reference to these claims. Assuming all these matters of fact in favor of appellant and considering the case as if they had been so found by the Court of Claims, the United States' contention that appellant has received just compensation must be sustained. The market price was paid. The market value of the copper taken at the time it was taken measures the owner's compensation. Seaboard Air Line Railway Co. v. United States, \n261 U.S. 299\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 354, 67 L. Ed. --, decided March 5, 1923; United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53, 80\n, 81 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 667; Boom Co. v. Patterson, \n98 U.S. 403\n, 407; United States v. New River Collieries Co. (C. C. A.) 276 Fed. 690, affirmed this day \n262 U.S. 341\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 565, 67 L. Ed. --. The higher prices, if any, paid by appellant for the copper it was compelled to take on longtime purchase contracts, is not evidence of the value of the copper at the time it was obtained by the United States. The United States is under no obligation to make good the loss. Appellant would be entitled to the gain, if it had purchased at less than the market price at the time of taking.\n The motion to remand is denied, and the judgment appealed from is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","117":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLAYNE & BOWLER CORPORATION v. WESTERN WELL WORKS(1923)\nNo. 278\nArgued: March 5, 1923Decided: April 9, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[261 U.S. 387, 388]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frederick S. Lyon, of Los Angeles, Cal., and William K. White, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Mr. C. E. Townsend, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondents.\n Mr. David P. Wolhaupter, of Washington, D. C. (Messrs. Charles C. Montgomery and Raymond Ives Blakeslee, both of Los Angeles, Cal., of counsel), amici curiae.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an ordinary patent case. There was no reason for granting the application for a writ of certiorari except upon the ground that the Circuit Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and the Ninth Circuits had differed in respect to the validity and scope of the patent and that uniformity required a decision from this court. The arguments and the briefs have aroused further inquiry in the minds of the court as to whether there was in fact any conflict between the decisions of the two Circuit Courts of Appeals, and whether the writ of certiorari was not improvidently granted.\n The Layne patent, now owned by the Layne & Bowler Corporation, the petitioner, was for apparatus for drawing water from deep wells, driven or artesian, and especially for adjusting a pump in them. In such wells it is essential that the adjustment, the alignment and the lubrication should be effected from the top because the bore of the well is so small that the operator can not descend to the pump. The Layne patent covered many \n\n[261 U.S. 387, 389]\n\u00a0\n different devices for assembling the various parts at the top, so that they could be thrust down the well hole and be adjusted in place at the bottom, so that the shaft of the rotary pump should be held in proper alignment as it rotated, so that it should not be clogged with sand and water as the pumping went on, and so that the shaft and the bearings in which it moved placed at intervals from top to bottom should be lubricated. To effect these objects the inventor used a casing or cylinder surrounding the shaft, divided them both into sections, united one section to another by a sleeve or screw thread, and in these sections pushed the apparatus down the well hole. There was a bearing at each end of each section of the casing in which the shaft was to revolve. Layne assembled, with this shaft and casing, wedges and spiders to hold the two in place ag inst the sides of the well hole. The rotary pump was held suspended in alignment by the weight of the casing and was closed from the casing by a packed bushing in which the shaft revolved and which prevented water and sand and other detritus from clogging the shaft and its bearings. The water from the pump was carried to the top by a separate pipe. The lubrication was effected by pouring the oil in at the top of the casing, and allowing it to leak through each bearing to the bottom of the casing whence it was drawn at intervals out of the casing by forcing air through an air vent at the top of the casing. The pump with the rotary shaft was old, the use of sections was old generally though it does not seem to have been applied in this particular field before, and the closed casing or cylinder surrounding the shaft was old. In a prior patent to Crannell for a pump in wells large enough to permit a man to go to the bottom, a rotary shaft with a cylindrical casing closed against the pump is shown.\n In practice, Layne did not use packing and bushing, but relied on a long sleeve to keep water and sand out of the \n\n[261 U.S. 387, 390]\n\u00a0\n casing. Nor did he ever use the wedges and spiders for alignment.\n The three claims sued on in this case were Nos. 9, 13, and 20, as follows:\n\n 9. \nIn a well mechanism, the combination with a pump casing of a rotary pump of a jointed pump shaft and a closed casing surrounding the pump shaft from the pump to the top of the well.\n 13. The combination with a pump and its actuating shaft of a sectional casing therefor, provided at each end of each section with a fixed block with bearings for the shaft, the casing being closed at the top and provided with an air vent.\n 20. The combination of a well casing, a rotary pump therein, and a line shaft for the pump entirely closed off from the water in the well.\n In 1912, in an infringement suit the validity of this patent and of claim No. 13 was considered by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit and sustained. Infringement by defendant of that claim was found and a decree for damages entered. El Campo Mach. Co. v. Layne, 195 Fed. 83, 115 C. C. A. 115. The decision is a per curiam and there is no discussion and no description of the defendant's device in the report.\n In 1914, the same Circuit Court of Appeals had to consider the patent again in Van Ness v. Layne, 213 Fed. 804, 130 C. C. A. 462. The claims relied on were the fourth, the ninth, the thirteenth, and the twentieth. The fourth was found not to be infringed, and as we are not concerned with it here, we can disregard it. The court found that Van Ness, the alleged infringer, did not use an air vent to force his oil out of the casing as we are informed by this opinion the infringer El Campo had done in the previous case. So it was held that Van Ness did not infringe claim No. 13. The court held that the jointed feature of the shaft made part of claim 9 added nothing to the novelty or patentability of \n\n[261 U.S. 387, 391]\n\u00a0\n the device and that claims No. 20 and No. 9 really covered the same ground. The court held, however, that the use of the entirely closed casing to exclude water and detritus from the shaft and its bearing, to secure lubrication of the bearings from the top and to align the bearings and shaft so as to prevent lateral displacement in the well and keep the shaft in a vertical position was a novelty and did supply a want in the field of deep pumps. As to infringement the court held that the casing of Van Ness' apparatus, although not so completely as the patented device, did keep the water and detritus from all the bearings but one on the shaft; that the lubrication was effected in practically the same way and, though this was very doubtful in the mind of the court, the alignment was preserved by the downward thrust of the suspended casing and bearings. Accordingly it was held that the twentieth claim was infringed.\n In Getty v. Layne, 262 Fed. 141, the same court considered the patent a third time. In its opinion, it said (page 143):\n'The Layne patent too nearly resembles the Crannell patent to be called a pioneer patent, though it did accomplish a revolution in the well- drilling industry. Its merit was in adapting the Crannell type of pump to a narrow and deep well hole, in a way that has been held by us to exhibit novelty. While the substitution of mere mechanical equivalents for the means adopted by Layne could not avoid infringement of his patent, it is also true that the range of equivalents can not be enlarged upon the idea that his patent was a pioneer one in the pump art. Its advance over Crannell prevented Crannell from being considered by us an anticipation, and was enough to show novelty, but it stops there. The Layne patent must rest, not upon the idea of closure, which would not be patentable apart from the method by which it was accomplished, but upon the means of its accomplishment, as disclosed by the specifications of his patent.' \n\n[261 U.S. 387, 392]\n\u00a0\n The court then held that alignment in the alleged infringement was secured by resting on the bottom of the well and not by suspension from the top and the downward thrust of the weight. It further held that Layne effected his lubrication by stagnant oil removed by forced air at intervals, whereas the alleged infringer had a circulatory system by which the oil after leaking through the bearings escaped from the bottom into the water around the pump, and that finally the closure of the casing against water and detritus was effected not by a bushing or packing but by the downward flow of the oil. This led to a dismissal of the bill.\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit in this case, instead of differing from that of the Fifth Circuit, seems, on a careful examination of the opinions and the infringing devices under consideration in the different cases, to have followed the opinions in the Fifth Circuit. It sustained the validity of the ninth, thirteenth, and twentieth claims. It do not greatly consider the thirteenth claim because it was as clearly not infringed by the respondent here, as it was not infringed by the Van Ness device in the Fifth Circuit case. The Ninth Circuit Court held, as the Fifth Circuit Court had held in the Getty Case, that the scope of the Layne patent claims was much restricted by the prior art and that a circulatory system of lubrication was not the same as a closed stagnant system. The entirely closed casing as an element of the twentieth claim furnishing a stagnant lubrication did not, therefore, find its equivalent in the casing of the respondent which was open at the bottom to permit a circulatory lubrication.\n It is manifest from this review of the conclusions in the two circuits as to the validity of the Layne patent and the proper construction to be put upon the ninth, thirteenth, and twentieth claims, that they were really in harmony and not in conflict and that there was no ground for our allowing the writ of certiorari to add to an already burdened \n\n[261 U.S. 387, 393]\n\u00a0\n docket. If it be suggested that as much effort and time as we have given to the consideration of the alleged conflict would have enabled us to dispose of the case before us on the merits, the answer is that it is very important that we be consistent in not granting the writ of certiorari except in cases involving principles the settlement of which is of importance to the public, as distinguished from that of the parties, and in cases where there is a real and embarrassing conflict of opinion and authority between the Circuit Courts of Appeals. The present case certainly comes under neither head.\n Precedents for dismissing a writ of certiorari improvidently granted are found in Furness, Withy & Co. v. Yang-Tsze Ins. Ass'n, \n242 U.S. 430\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 141, and in United States v. Rimer, \n220 U.S. 547\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 596.\n Writ of certiorari dismissed. \n\n\n\n","118":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEE v. CHESAPEAKE & O. R. CO.(1923)\nNo. 422\nArgued: January 5, 1923Decided: January 22, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. Allan D. Cole, of Maysville, Ky., for plaintiff in error. \n\n[260 U.S. 653, 654]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. L. Worthington, of Maysville, Ky., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action to recover damages in the sum of $10,000 for personal injuries alleged to have been sustained by the plaintiff while entering one of the defendant's passenger trains in Kentucky for an intrastate trip. The plaintiff was a citizen and resident of Texas and the defendant a corporate citizen and resident of Virginia. The action was begun in a state court in Bracken county, Ky., and, because of the diverse citizenship of the parties, was removed, at the defendant's instance, into the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Kentucky, which includes Bracken county. When the transcript reached the District Court, the plaintiff moved that the cause be remanded to the state court on the ground that the District Court was without jurisdiction in that neither party was a resident of that district. The motion was overruled, the plaintiff elected to stand on the motion, and judgment was given for the defendant. The plaintiff then brought the case here on a direct writ of error (Judicial Code,  238 [Comp. St.  1215]), to obtain a review of the ruling on his motion to remand.\n Under the Constitution, art. 3,  2, the judicial power extends, among other cases, to such as arise under the Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States, and to such as are between citizens of different states.\n Section 24 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  991) defines the general jurisdiction of the District Courts, the pertinent provision being as follows:\n'The District Courts shall have original jurisdiction ... of all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity, ... where the matter in controversy exceeds, \n\n[260 U.S. 653, 655]\n\u00a0\n exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of three thousand dollars, and (a) arises under the Constitution or laws of the United States, or treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority, or (b) is between citizens of different states. ...'\n\n This grant of jurisdiction covers two distinct classes of suits. In one the citizenship of the parties is not an element, while in the other it is the distinctive feature. As to the suit before us it is very clear that the diverse citizenship of the parties and the sum inv lved bring it within the latter class, and therefore within the general jurisdiction of the District Courts.\n Section 51 of the Code (Comp. St.  1033) relates to the venue of suits originally begun in those courts, and provides, subject to exceptions not material here, that--\n'... No civil suit shall be brought in any district court against any person by any original process or proceeding in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant; but where the jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the action is between citizens of different states, suit shall be brought only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.'\n\n It is a necessary conclusion from repeated decisions, going back to the original Judiciary Act of 1789 (1 Stat. 73) that this provision does not limit the general jurisdiction of the District Courts or withdraw any suit therefrom, but merely confers a personal privilege on the defendant, which he may assert, or may waive, at his election, and does waive if, when sued in some other district, he enters an appearance without claiming his privilege.

Ct. 106, 67 L. Ed. --. The following excerpt from Interior Construction Co. v. Gibney, at page 219 of 160 U. S., at page 273 of 16 Sup. Ct. (40 L. Ed. 401), is particularly apposite:\n'The Circuit Courts of the United States are thus vested with general jurisdiction of civil actions, involving the requisite pecuniary value, between citizens of different states. Diversity of citizenship is a condition of jurisdiction, and, when that does not appear upon the record, the court, of its own motion, will order the action to be dismissed. But the provision as to the particular district in which the action shall be brought does not touch the general jurisdiction of the court over such a cause between such parties, but affects only the proceedings taken to bring the defendant within such jurisdiction, and is a matter of personal privilege, which the defendant may insist upon, or may waive, at his election; and the defendant's right to object that an action, within the general jurisdiction of the court, is brought in the wrong district, is waived by entering a general appearance, without taking the objection.'\n\n Section 28 of the Code (Comp. St.  1010) deals with the jurisdiction of the District Courts on removals from the state courts, saying, so far as is material here:\n'Any suit of a civil nature, at law or in equity, arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, or treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority, of which the District Courts of the United States are given original jurisdiction by this title, which may now be pending or which may hereafter be brought, in any state court, may be removed by the defendant or defendants therein to the District Court of the United States for the proper district. Any other suit of a civil nature, at law or in equity, of which the District Courts of the United States are given jurisdiction by this title, and which are now pending or which may hereafter be brought, in any state court, may be removed into the District \n\n[260 U.S. 653, 657]\n\u00a0\n Court of the United States for the proper district by the defendant or defendants therein, being nonresidents of that state.'\n\n Section 29 (section 1011) deals, among other things, with the venue on removals and shows that in every instance the removal must be into the District Court 'in the district where such suit is pending'; and this requirement is emphasized by section 53, which directs that, where the district is composed of two or more distinct divisions, the removal shall be into the District Court 'in the division in which the county is situated from which the removal is made.' Thus the words 'for the proper district,' in section 28, find exact definition in sections 29 and 53; and that definition conforms to what has appeared in all removal statutes beginning with the original Judiciary Act of 1789.1\n The several provisions of the Code before quoted were considered in the recent case of General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Ry. Co., supra, where their meaning and their relation one to another were summed up as follows:\n'Section 24 contains a typical grant of original jurisdiction to the District Courts in general of 'all suits' in the classes falling within its descriptive terms, save certain suits by assignees of particular choses in action. Section 51 does not withdraw and suit from that grant, but merely regulates the place of suit, its purpose being to save defendants from inconveniences to which they might be subjected if they could be compelled to answer in any district, or wherever found. Like similar state statutes, it accords to defendants a privilege which they may, and not infrequently do, waive. \n\n[260 U.S. 653, 658]\n\u00a0\n 'Coming to the removal section (28), it is apparent that the clause, 'of which the District Courts of the United States are given original jurisdiction,' refers to the jurisdiction conferred on the District Courts in general, for it speaks of them in the plural. That it does not refer to the venue provision in section 51 is apparent, first, because that provision does not except or take any suit from the general jurisdiction conferred by section 24; next, because there could be no purpose in extending to removals the personal privilege accorded to defendants by section 51, since removals are had only at the instance of defendants; and, lastly, because the venue on removal is specially dealt with and fixed by section 29.'\n\n It will be perceived that the right of removal under section 28 arises whenever a suit within the general jurisdiction of the District Courts is begun in 'any' state court, and also that the party to whom the right is given is designated in direct and unequivocal terms. Where the suit arises under the Constitution, or a law or treaty, of the United States, the right is given to 'the defendant or defendants' without any qualification; and as to 'any other suit' it is given to 'the defendant or defendants,' if he or they be 'nonresidents of that state.' In neither instance is the plaintiff's assent essential in any sense to the exercise of the right. Nor is it admissible for him to urge that the removal be into the District Court for some other district, for it is his act in bringing the suit in a state court within the particular district which fixes the venue on removal.\n Applying these views to the present case, we hold that it was removable, that it was duly removed into the District Court for the proper district, and that the motion to remand was rightly denied-in short, that the District Court had jurisdiction to proceed to a determination of the cause.\n The plaintiff's contention to the contrary is predicated largely on a decision by this court in Ex parte Wisner, \n\n[260 U.S. 653, 659]\n\u00a0\n \n203 U.S. 449\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 150, which, it must be conceded, is not in accord with the views expressed in this opinion. In that case the facts were like those here and the same statutory provisions were involved. These provisions were then part of the Act of August 13, 1888, c. 866, 25 Stat. 433, but, as respects the matter now under consideration, their meaning has not been changed by their inclusion in the Judicial Code. In that case it was ruled that the provision, now embodied in section 51, respecting the venue of actions originally begun in the Circuit (now District) Courts was strictly jurisdicti nal, could not be overcome even by the consent of both parties, and affected removals accordingly. The ruling proceeded on the theory that this was a right, if not a necessary, conclusion, inasmuch as the general purpose of Congress in adopting the act of 1888 was to contract the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts. The decision was given in 1906 and was a departure from what had been said of the same provisions in prior cases, notably Mexican National R. R. Co. v. Davidson, \n157 \nU.S. 201, 208\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 563, and Sweeney v. Carter Oil Co., \n199 \nU.S. 252, 259\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 55. Much that was said in the opinion was soon disapproved in Re Moore, \n209 U.S. 490\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 706, 14 Ann. Cas. 1164, where the court returned to its former rulings respecting the essential distinction between the provision defining the general jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts and the one relating to the venue of suits originally begun in those courts. But as the decision was not fully and expressly overruled, it has been a source of embarrassment and confusion in other courts. \n2\n We had occasion to criticize \n\n[260 U.S. 653, 660]\n\u00a0\n it in General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Ry. Co., supra, and now on further consideration we feel constrained to pronounce it essentially unsound and definitely to overrule it.\n In this connection it should be observed that the opinion in Re Moore is open to the criticism that it seemingly assumes that, where neither party is a resident of the district, the removal, to be effective, needs the plaintiff's assent. We find no support for such an assumption in the provisions we are considering. Under them, as before indicated, the exercise of the right of removal rests entirely with the defendant and is in no sense dependent on the will or acquiescence of the plaintiff. The opinion in Re Moore is qualified accordingly.\n We recognize that one purpose of the act of 1888 was to contract the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts and that due regard should be had for this in interpreting indefinite or ambiguous provisions; but we think it affords no basis for subtracting anything from provisions which are definite and free from ambiguity. A comparison of the removal provisions in the act of 1888 with those in the act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, 18 Stat. 470, which it displaced, will bring out very clearly the changes intended. The act of 1875 not only permitted the removal of all suits between citizens of different states where the amount in controversy exceeded $500, but declared without qualification that the removal might by by 'either party.' The act of 1888 confined the removal of such suits to instances where the amount in controversy exceeded $2,000, withheld the right of removal from the plaintiff, who always has a choice of forums, and gave the right to the defendant only where he was a nonresident of the state in which the suit was brought. Thus, while the comparison shows that Congress intended to contract materially the jurisdiction on removal, it also shows how the contraction was to be \n\n[260 U.S. 653, 661]\n\u00a0\n effected. Certainly there is nothing in this which suggests that the plain terms in the act os 1888-by which it declared that any suit 'between citizens of different states,' brought in any state court and involving the requisite amount, 'may be removed by the defendant or defendants' where they are 'nonresidents of that state'-should be taken otherwise than according to their natural or ordinary signification.\n That provision, although much narrower than the provision in the act of 1875, is obviously broader than the one in the original Judiciary Act of 1789, which permitted any suit brought in any state court by a citizen of that state against a citizen of another state, and involving a stated amount, to be removed by the defendant into the Circuit Court of the United States for that district. This early provision remained in force for a long period, and there can be no doubt that to return to it now would material y relieve that overburdened dockets of the District Court and at the same time maintain the constitutional principle involved; but of course a return can be effected only through legislative channels.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Acts September 24, 1789, c. 20,  12, 1 Stat. 79; February 13, 1801, c. 4,  13, 2 Stat. 92; February 4, 1815, c. 31,  8, 3 Stat. 198; March 3, 1815, c. 94,  6, 3 Stat. 233; March 3, 1863, c. 81,  5, 12 Stat. 756; March 2, 1867, c. 196, 14 Stat. 558; March 3, 1875, c. 137,  3, 18 Stat. 471; March 3, 1887, c. 373, 24 Stat. 552; August 13, 1888, c. 866, 25 Stat. 433; Judicial Code,  30, 31, 33 (Comp.

STATE BOARD OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTANCY(1923)\nNo. 170\nArgued: Decided: December 10, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 394, 395]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Erle Pettus, of Birmingham, Ala., for plaintiff in error, in opposition to the motion.\n Mr. J. J. Mayfield, of Montgomery, Ala., for defendants in error, in support of the motion.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By a statute of the state (Acts Ala. 1919, p. 124 et seq.) a board denominated the 'Board of Public Accountancy' was created. The board has authority to examine applicants for certificates or licenses to practice the business or calling of public accountant and to issue certificates to those whom the board deems qualified.\n The board is given power to cancel the certificate granted 'for any unprofessional conduct of the holder of such certificate, or for other sufficient cause' upon written notice of 20 days and a hearing thereon. The defendants in error Alvidge, Edson, and Rosson constitute the board.\n Complaint was made against plaintiff in error by the other defendants in error who are public accountants and a day set for hearing, and notice thereof given to plaintiff in error as required by the statute.\n He appeared at the time appointed, but subsequently brought this suit, praying that the board and its members be enjoined and restrained from hearing the charges preferred against him, or from making or entering any order revoking or attempting to revoke the certificate issued to him, or from interfering in any way with the practice of his profession as such certified public accountant. It was also prayed that the other defendants in error be enjoined from prosecuting the charges that they had preferred.\n A temporary restraining order was issued and an order to show cause why it should not be made permanent.\n The bill was dismissed on demurrer for want of equity, and on appeal to the Supreme Court the decree was \n\n[263 U.S. 394, 396]\n\u00a0\n affirmed. The Chief Justice of the court then granted this writ of error.\n The ground of it and the reliance here is expressed in several ways, that the statute of the state is in conflict with the Constitution of the state, and also in conflict with the Constitution of the United States, the latter in that it (the statute) deprives plaintiff in error of his property without due process of law and subjects him to an ex post facto law\n The bill is very long. Its important facts are as follows: Plaintiff in error had 'by experience and assiduous attention to his duties built up a large and lucrative business.' Upon the appointment of the board he applied for and was issued a certificate after standing the tests and examinations prescribed, and since that time he has been practicing his profession as a certified public accountant\n The board has never adopted any code or promulgated any rules or definition of what is or is not professional conduct, or what is sufficient cause for the revocation of a certificate.\n He appeared before the board at the day appointed for the hearing of the charges against him, and was informed by the board that there were no rules in effect to govern or control the hearing, and evidence would be received with some liberality. The hearing was continued until January 26, 1922, and plaintiff in error notified to be back on that day for the purpose of being tried.\n It is nowhere averred in the charges against him that anything that he had done was wrongful or unlawful; the only allegation being that the alleged acts complained of were surreptitious.\n The acts are enumerated, and it is expressly denied that he was guilty of anything wrongful, surreptitious, or unlawful.\n It is further averred that the board has prejudged his acts, and that the determination by the board as to \n\n[263 U.S. 394, 397]\n\u00a0\n whether his certificate should be revoked rests wholly within the arbitrary, uncontrolled, and unappealable judgment of the board.\n The unconstitutionality of the act is averred both under the state and federal Constitutions.\n The contention that the statute and the powers it confers upon the board and the manner of their exercise are in derogation of the Constitution of the state is decisively decided against by the opinion of the Supreme Court of the state, and we may say that there is persuasion in the reasoning of the court against the contention that the statute is in conflict with the Constitution of the United States; that is, that the statute is in effect an ex post facto law, or, if enforced against him, will deprive him of his property without due process of law.\n The opinion of the court sustained the board, its powers and the manner of executing them, but refrained from expressing an opinion of the right or remedy of plaintiff in error. It said:\n'It is not necessary or proper for this court to now decide what remedy, if any, would be available to the appellant [plaintiff in error], if his certificate or license should be improperly or illegally revoked or canceled.'\n\n In other words, the court declined to anticipate the action of the board; it decided only that, if the state had the power to confer a certificate on the plaintiff in error through the board, it had the power, through the board, to take it away, or to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which it might be forfeited. And the court further said that the appeal was without equity, since neither the trial court nor it could know in advance of the hearing that the board would sustain the charge\n The reasoning is conclusive. The procurement of a certificate was deemed of value by plaintiff in error. It was the confirmation of his reputation, giving to it the \n\n[263 U.S. 394, 398]\n\u00a0\n sanction of an official investigation and judgment. He knew the condition of its issue-knew that the conduct that secured it was a condition of its retention; that for inconstancy of merit it could be forfeited and forfeited if it had been improvidently granted or procured by concealment or deception, and necessarily so, or the certificate would be a means of pretense.\n Plaintiff in error puts some stress upon the absence of rules by the board, urging that the statute is in conflict with the Constitution of the United States, because it purports to authorize the revocation of a certificate 'without defining or determining in advance what grounds or facts or acts shall be sufficient cause for such revocation.' Such absence permits, it is asserted, arbitrary action. We cannot yield to that assertion or assume that the board will be impelled to action by other than a sense of duty or render judgment, except upon convincing evidence introduced in a regular way with opportunity of rebuttal. We certainly cannot restrain the board upon the possibility of contrary action. Official bodies would be of no use as instruments of government, if they could be prevented from action by the supposition of wrongful action.\n This court and other courts have decided that a license or certificate may be required of a physician surgeon, dentist, lawyer, or school-teacher Douglas v. Noble, \n261 U.S. 165\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 303, has pertinent comment upon the power of the Legislature in that regard. The Supreme Court in the present case construed the statute as not so exacting of public accountants. In other words, it was decided that the indicated professions require a license or certificate, but that a public accountant requires none; and it was decided that a public accountant gets no right of business from the grant of a certificate-he loses no right of business by its cancellation.\n The statute is not, nor are the proceedings before the board, such as plaintiff in error conceives them. The \n\n[263 U.S. 394, 399]\n\u00a0\n cases he cites are therefore not pertinent and need no review. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The motion to affirm must be granted.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Hill v.

DAVIS(1923)\nNo. 246\nArgued: Decided: January 29, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 682, 683]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edgar Watkins, of Atlanta, Ga., for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 682, 687]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. T. Colquitt, of Atlanta, Ga., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit upon two bills of lading for failure to deliver the full amount of cotton covered by them. The plaintiffs allege that they purchased the bills at a rate determined by the number of pounds specified in the bills but that on delivery it turned out that the weight of 100 bales covered by one of the bills was 15,312 \n\n[260 U.S. 682, 688]\n\u00a0\n pounds short, and that of 200 bales covered by the other was 11,527 pounds short. The 200 bales were delivered to the carrier on March 25, 1918, and the 100 on March 26, 1918, when the railroads were under federal control. A claim for this loss was made to the Atlanta, Birmingham & Atlantic Railroad, the road over which the cotton was sent, on April 25, 1918, and denied by the road on July 28, 1918. This suit was begun on January 29, 1921, more than two years and a day after the short delivery. The bills of lading which were in the same general form provided that:\n'Suits for loss, damage or delay shall be instituted only within two years and one day after delivery of the property, or in case of failure to make delivery, then within two years and one day after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed.'\n\n They also stated the weight 'subject to correction.' The District Court after careful consideration dismissed the petition upon demurrer, on the ground that the suit was too late under the quoted words of the contract, and also on the merits. 274 Fed. 443. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment, adopting the opinion below as to the time within which the suit must be brought. 276 Fed. 400.\n We find it unnecessary to consider other defences besides the contract limitation, as we agree with the Courts below that that disposes of the case. The main objection urged is that the contract is overridden by section 206(a) of the Transportation Act Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 461, giving actions in cases like this against an agent designated by the President, and providing that they may be brought within the periods of limitation now prescribed by State or Federal statutes, but not later than two years from the date of the passage of the Act. The contention is supported with some ingenuity but we think it enough to observe that the general purpose was to limit not to extend rights of action and that we \n\n[260 U.S. 682, 689]\n\u00a0\n cannot suppose that it was intended to invalidate existing contracts good when made. New York Central R. R. Co. v. Lazarus (C. C. A.) 278 Fed. 900; William F. Mosser Co. v. Payne, Director General (W. Va.) 114 S. E. 365; Northern Milling Co. v. Davis, Agent (Wis.) 190 N. W. 351. In our opinion this contract was good when made. The time allowed was reasonable. Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Harriman, \n227 \nU.S. 657, 672\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 397; Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Leatherwood, \n250 \nU.S. 478, 481\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 517. We agree with the District Court that ecker & Sons v. Director General, 55 I. C. C. 453, should not be understood or allowed to contravene our conclusion, upon the facts here. The statutes of the States where the goods were shipped and the suit was brought do not affect the contract, and the reasonableness of the limitation is a matter of law; Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Harriman, \n227 \nU.S. 657, 672\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 397, so that the bringing of a previous suit, alleged in the declaration, does not save the case. Riddlesbarger v. Hartford Insurance Co., 7 Wall. 386.\n The only other argument that seems to us to need notice is that the claim is not within the words of the limitation. But it is of the kind that the clause 'suits for loss, damage or delay' manifestly intended to limit and we see no reason why it should not be included under the head of loss.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","121":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLION BONDING & SUR. CO. v. KARATZ(1923)\nNo. 467\nArgued: March 2, 1923Decided: April 23, 1923\n\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 77, 79]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Halleck F. Rose and Arthur R. Wells, both of Omaha, Neb., for petitioner.\n Mr. Bruce W. Sanborn, of St. Paul, Minn., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two cases arise out of the insolvency of the Lion Bonding & Surety Company, a Nebraska insurance corporation. They are here on writs of certiorari to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. In the Karatz Case, it affirmed a decree of the federal court for Minnesota which appointed receivers in a suit brought by an unsecured simple contract creditor. See 280 Fed. 532. In the Hertz Case, it reversed a decree of the federal court for Nebraska, which dismissed a suit brought by those receivers for possession of the company's property. 280 Fed. 540. At the date of each decree the property of the company in Nebraska was held by the department of trade and commerce of that state, with the usual powers of a receiver, under a decree of a state court. The Circuit Court of Appeals directed, in the Hertz Case, that the lower court enjoin the department from doing any act in relation to the property, except to hold custody thereof subject to the further order of the federal court for Minnesota. Petitioners ask that the judgments of the appellate court be reversed and that the bills in the \n\n[262 U.S. 77, 80]\n\u00a0\n federal District Courts be dismissed. The grounds on which jurisdiction was asserted by the federal courts make necessary a fuller statement of the facts.\n The Lion Bonding & Surety Company had for some years prior to 1921 been licensed to conduct the business of insurance in Nebraska, and was doing business and had property also in 18 other states. A statute of Nebraska commits to its department of trade and commerce the supervision of insurance companies and control thereof in case of insolvency and otherwise. Compiled Statutes Nebraska 1922,  7745-7748; Laws Nebraska 1919, c. 190, tit. 5, art. 3, pp. 576-579. Paragraph 1 of section 4 of that act provides:\n'Whenever any domestic company is insolvent, ... or is found, after an examination, to be in such condition that its further transaction of business would be hazardous to its policy holders, or to its creditors, or to its stockholders, or to the public; ... the department ... may apply to the district court, ... in the county ... in which the principal office of such company is located, for an order directing such company to show cause why the department ... should not take possession of its property, records and effects and conduct or close its business, and for such other relief as the nature of the case and the interest of its policy holders, creditors, stockholders or the public may require.'\n\n On April 12, 1921, the department applied to the district court of Douglas county, Nebraska, for an order directing it to take possession of the property and to conduct the business of the company, under paragraph 2 of secti n 4, which provides:\n'On such application, or at any time thereafter, such court or judge may, in his discretion, issue an order restraining such company from the transaction of its business, or disposition of its property, records, and effects until the further order of the court. On the return of such order to show cause, and after a full hearing, the \n\n[262 U.S. 77, 81]\n\u00a0\n court shall either deny the application or direct the department ... forthwith to take possession of the property, records and effects, and conduct the business of such company, and retain such possession ... until on the application of the department ... or of such company, it shall, after a like hearing, appear to the court that the cause of such order directing the department ... to take possession has been removed, and that the company can properly resume possession of its property, records and effects, and the conduct of the business.'\n\n The petition prayed also for an order restraining the company from the transaction of its business or from disposing of any of its property, and for other and further relief. The company immediately filed an answer, by which it admitted the material allegations of the petition, and joined in the prayer thereof. On the same day the state court entered a decree in accordance with the prayer; the department entered upon the duties prescribed by the decree; it immediately took possession of all the property of the company in Nebraska, has since held possession thereof subject to the orders of the state court, and has also obtained like possession of property of the company in other states. On May 28, 1921, the department filed, in the court, a supplemental petition, in which it prayed for an order directing it to liquidate the business under paragraph 3 of section 4, which provides:\n'If, on a like application and order to show cause, and after a full hearing, the court shall order the liquidation of the business of such company, such liquidation shall be made by and under the direction of the department, ... which may deal with the property, records, effects and business of such company in the name of the department ..., or in the name of the company, as the court may direct and it shall be vested by operation of law with title to all the property effects, contracts and \n\n[262 U.S. 77, 82]\n\u00a0\n rights of action of such company as of the date of the order so directing it to liquidate. ...'\n\n The supplemental petition prayed, among other things, that the orders theretofore made, so far as applicable, and necessary to further the liquidation, remain in full force. The company filed an answer by which it admitted the material allegations contained in the supplemental petition and joined in the prayer thereof. On the same day that court entered an order in accordance with the prayer of the supplemental petition, all action of the department being made subject to the direction of the court.\n On May 2, 1921, while the decree of the Nebraska court entered April 12, 1921, was in full force and the department was in actual possession thereunder of the property in that state, Karatz, a citizen of Minnesota, purporting to sue also on behalf of others similarly situated, filed a bill in equity against the company in the federal court for the district of Minnesota, Fourth division. No disclosure was made of the proceedings taken against the company in the state court of Nebraska, nor that under its decree the department was in possession of all the company property in that state, and, at least, of some of its property elsewhere. The bill alleged that the company had been admitted to do business in Minnesota; that through its operation there plaintiff had become an unsecured simple contract creditor to the amount of $2,100; that the company had ceased to do business and was insolvent; that it had assets within that district valued at $20,000; and that there was danger that the property of the company would be wasted. The bill prayed that the amount due plaintiff be ascertained and decl red a first lien upon all the assets of the company in Minnesota; that, for the purpose of protecting the general public, creditors, and stockholders, receivers be appointed to collect all its assets, wherever situated, and to realize upon and distribute the same; that the company be directed to deliver possession to them of all the \n\n[262 U.S. 77, 83]\n\u00a0\n property wherever situated; that the company and its officers be restrained from interfering in any way with such receivers; and for general relief. On the filing of this bill the federal court, acting ex parte, appointed Hertz and Levin receivers of all the property of the company wheresoever situated, and authorized them to apply to any other District Court of the United States in aid of the order so entered. The company (which was served on May 5 by process upon the insurance commissioner of Minnesota) moved, on May 14, 1921, to dismiss the Karatz bill for want of federal jurisdiction and for want of equity. A motion was also made to discharge the receivers and to restore the property to the company or to the department of trade and commerce. Both motions were denied on May 30, 1921\n\n\n The Minnesota receivers secured the appointment of themselves as ancillary receivers by the federal courts for 12 other districts, but not for the Nebraska district. On May 11 and May 12, 1921, they filed, in purported compliance with section 56 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1038), certified copies of the bill and of the order of appointment with the clerks of the federal District Courts for Nebraska and other states in the Eighth circuit. On May 14, 1921, the company moved the Circuit Court of Appeals under that section for an order of disapproval of the appointment of receivers, so far as it may be operative outside the district of Minnesota. This motion was denied on May 31, 1921.1\n On September 6, 1921, the Minnesota receivers filed in the federal court for the district of Nebraska, Omaha \n\n[262 U.S. 77, 84]\n\u00a0\n division, a bill in equity (called the Hertz suit) against the company, the department of trade and commerce and others. It charged that there was a conflict of authority between the federal court for Minnesota and the Nebraska state court concerning the administration of the company's property; that the department threatened to liquidate the company under the order of the state court entered May 28, 1921; that its rights were limited to the temporary possession and listing of the property authorized by the order of April 12, 1921; and that it had no longer any right to the possession or control of the property either for the administration of the affairs of the company under direction of the state court or otherwise. The bill prayed that defendants be restrained from interfering with the Minnesota receiver's possession and control; that they be directed to surrender possession to plaintiffs; and for other relief. A motion of defendants to dismiss the bill for want of jurisdiction and for want of equity was granted, and the receivers appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Meanwhile the Karatz Case had proceeded to final hearing. On August 11, 1921, a decree was entered adjudicating Karatz's claim for $2,100, making permanent the appointment of the receivers and continuing their powers to administer the property of the company, and perpetually enjoining it from interfering with the receiver's control. The company appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court then heard together appeals in the two cases. On April 28, 1922, it rendered the opinions, 280 Fed. 532, 540, by which, in the Minnesota case, it affirmed the order appointing receivers,2 \n\n[262 U.S. 77, 85]\n\u00a0\n and, in the Nebraska case, reversed the decree dismissing the bill. The decree in the latter was later enlarged by directing the District Court to reinstate the bill, and to restrain the department, the company and their employees--\n'from removing, secreting, or disposing of the moneys, books, papers, records, assets, property, accounts, or choses in action of or derived from the Lion Bonding & Surety Company, and from doing any other act in relation thereto, except to hold the custody thereof subject to the further order of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, Fourth Division.'3\n\n The decrees of the Circuit Court of Appeals in both cases must be reversed.\n First. In the Karatz Case the motion to dismiss the bill should have been granted. There was want of equity, for it was brought by an unsecured simple contract creditor. Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, \n261 U.S. 491\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 454, 67 L. Ed. --, No. 431, decided April 9, 1923. But there was also the fundamental objection that the District Court was without jurisdiction as a federal court.\n The only ground of jurisdiction alleged is diversity of citizenship. The facts specifically stated show that the amount in controversy was less than $3,000. Plaintiff's claim against the company was $2,100. He prayed that this debt be declared a first lien on the assets within the state. His only interest was to have that debt paid. The amount of the corporation's assets, either within or without the state, is of no legal significance in this connection. Nor is the amount of its debts to others. The case is not of that class where the amount in controversy \n\n[262 U.S. 77, 86]\n\u00a0\n is measured by the value of the property involved in the litigation. Hunt v. New York Cotton Exchange, \n205 \nU.S. 322, 335\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 529; Western & Atlantic R. R. v. Railroad Commission of Georgia, \n261 U.S. 264\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 252, 67 L. Ed. --, No. 195, decided February 19, 1923. Nor is it like those cases in which several plaintiffs, having a common undivided interest, unite to enforce a single title or right, and in which it is enough that their interests collectively equal the jurisdictional amount. Troy Bank v. G. A. Whitehead & Co., Inc., \n222 \nU.S. 39, 41\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 9. In the case at bar, if several creditors of the company, each with a debt less than $3,000, had joined as plaintiffs, the demands could not have been aggregated in order to confer jurisdiction. Rogers v. Hennepin County, \n239 U.S. 621\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 217; Scott v. Frazier, \n253 U.S. 243\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 503. Nor can Karatz's allegation that he sued on behalf of others similarly situated help him. Compare Title Guaranty Co. v. Allen, \n240 U.S. 136\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 345; Eberhard v. Northwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co., 241 Fed. 353, 356, 154 C. C. A. 233.4 Since the bill in this case discloses that the amount in controversy was less than the jurisdictional amount, the general allegation that it exceeds this amount is, therefore, of no avail. Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co. (No. 2) \n170 U.S. 468\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 645.\n As the bill should have been dismissed on motion, there is no occasion to consider whether the provisions of the Nebraska statute and the proceedings taken thereunder in the courts of that state, which the defendant set up, constituted a bar to the Karatz suit. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[262 U.S. 77, 87]\n\u00a0\n Second. In the Hertz Case, also, the motion to dismiss the bill should have been granted. Being dependent upon the decree in the Karatz suit appointing the receivers, the Hertz suit must necessarily fall with the dismissal of that bill. But there are other insuperable obstacles to the maintenance of the Hertz suit.\n Hertz and Levin were not appointed ancillary receivers for Nebraska. They sue in the Nebraska district as Minnesota receivers, relying upon section 56 of the Judicial Code. That section, by its terms, applies only where, in a suit 'in which a receiver shall be appointed the land or other property of a fixed character, the subject of the suit, lies within different states in the same judicial circuit.' It relates to those cases where the fixed property is a unit, extending into several states, like interstate railroads and pipe lines. \n6\n See Public Utilities Commission v. Landon, \n249 \nU.S. 236, 243\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 268. It cannot be a umed that the assets of an insurance company are of that character. Those of this company, within the Minnesota district, specifically described in the Karatz bill, were alleged to consist of money and credits. The description of the property in Nebraska, given in the Hertz bill, is 'cash, mortgages and other securities, bills receivable, real estate, stocks, and bonds.' The provisions of section 56 extending the operation of a receivership to other districts of the same judicial circuit were therefore inapplicable to this case. The motion made, under that section, for disapproval of the order, so far as it may be operative outside the district of Minnesota, should have been granted. As Minnesota receivers merely, Hertz and Levin had no rights whatever in Nebraska. The general rule that a receiver cannot \n\n[262 U.S. 77, 88]\n\u00a0\n sue in a foreign jurisdiction applied. Great Western Mining Co. v. Harris, \n198 U.S. 561\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 770. The express authorization ( contained in the order of appointment) to apply for aid to other courts could not aid them in this respect. Sterrett v. Second National Bank, \n248 U.S. 73\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 27.\n Moreover, even if the federal court for Minnesota would have had jurisdiction to appoint the receivers, and these receivers had secured ancillary appointment in the Nebraska district, the Hertz bill should still have been dismissed, because the property was then in the possession of the state court. What the federal court undertook to do was not to adjudicate rights in personam (as the state court did in Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 U.S. 226\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 79, 67 L. Ed. --, No. 81, decided November 20, 1922), but to take the res out of the possession and control of the state court, and to enjoin all action on its part, except as directed by the federal court for Minnesota. It sought to do this, although the state court alone had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject-matter, at the time when the proceeding before it was begun, at the time its decree directing the department to take possession was entered, and at the time possession was taken thereunder. Moreover, the proceeding in the state court was confessedly an appropriate one, the possession taken was actual, and it has been continuous. All this occurred before any suit was begun in any federal court. The federal court did not seek to gain possession and control of the Nebraska property until three months after entry of the decree of the state court directing the department (which had possession of the res) to proceed with the liquidation. The case is thus free of those features which sometimes create difficulty in determining conflicts between courts of concurrent jurisdiction.\n Where a court of competent jurisdiction has, by appropriate proceedings, taken property into its possession through its officers, the property is thereby withdrawn \n\n[262 U.S. 77, 89]\n\u00a0\n from the jurisdiction of all other courts. Wabash Railroad v. Adelbert College, \n208 \nU.S. 38, 54\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 182. Compare Oklahoma v. Texas, \n258 \nU.S. 574, 581\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 406. Possession of the res disables other courts of co-ordinate jurisdiction from exercising any power over it. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Lake Street Elevated R. R. Co., \n177 \nU.S. 51, 61\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 564. The court which first acquired jurisdiction through possession of the property is vested, while it holds possession, with the power to hear and determine all controversies relating thereto. It has the right, while continuing to exercise its prior jurisdiction, to determine for itself how far it will permit any other court to interfere with such possession and jurisdiction. Palmer v. Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 118, 126\n, 129 S., 29 Sup. St. 230.\n The assertion of control by the federal courts over property in the possession of the state court, is sought to be justified on the following ground: The possession taken by the department under the state court's decree of April 12, 1921, was only for a temporary purpo e, namely, to conduct the business until the company could properly resume the conduct thereof. True, the supplemental decree entered by the state court on May 28, 1921, directed the department to liquidate the business as provided in the statute. But meanwhile, on May 2, 1921, suit had been brought by Karatz in the federal court for Minnesota, and it had obtained jurisdiction over the company's assets by its appointment ex parte of receivers. So, the court says (280 Fed. 542):\n'Its right to the possession by its receivers is superior to that of the state court. It follows that the receivers appointed by it are entitled to the possession of the company's records and assets as against the department of trade and commerce.'\n\n This contention is opposed to the settled principles which govern the relations of courts of concurrent jurisdiction. It is inconsistent, also, with section 265 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1242) which prohibits courts of the United States from \n\n[262 U.S. 77, 90]\n\u00a0\n staying proceedings in courts of a state. Essanay Film Manufacturing Co. v. Kane, \n258 U.S. 358\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 318. The Nebraska court was confessedly a court of competent jurisdiction. While it was in possession of the res, it entered a supplemental decree directing the department to liquidate the company. The statute of the state expressly provides for such liquidation. The original petition of April 12, 1921, clearly contemplated it and contained a prayer for general relief. The claim is that the application for liquidation is a new and independent proceeding, and that jurisdiction over the res had terminated before entry of the supplemental decree, although the court's possession of the res continued. The claim is groundless. But, if the legality of the state court's action was to be questioned, it could be done only by laying the proper foundation through appropriate proceedings in that court. Covell v. Heyman, \n111 \nU.S. 176, 179\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 355; Byers v. McAuley, \n149 \nU.S. 608, 614\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 906; Compare Laing v. Rigney, \n160 U.S. 531\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 366; Metcalf v.

If such action had been taken and relief had been denied there, resort could then have been had to appellate proceedings. Wiswall v. Sampson, 14 How. 52. But the judgment of the state court, which had possession of the res, could not be set aside by a collateral attack in the federal courts. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association v. Phelps, \n190 \nU.S. 147, 159\n, 160 S., 23 Sup. Ct. 707. Nor could it be ignored. Shields v. Coleman, \n157 U.S. 168\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 570.

From the decree of the District Court the department appealed directly to this court, on the ground that the District Court was without jurisdicti n as a federal court. The appeal was dismissed on October 16, 1922, for lack of jurisdiction in this court. \n260 U.S. 713\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 90, 67 L.

Sanborn, of St. Paul, Minn., for the motion.\n Messrs. O. S. Spillman, of Pierce, Neb., and John F. Stout, Halleck F. Rose, Arthur R. Wells and Paul L. Martin, all of Omaha, Neb., opposed.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The decision in these cases rendered April 23, 1923, reversed the decrees with costs and directed that the bills be dismissed. Before the mandate issued Hertz and \n\n[262 U.S. 640, 641]\n\u00a0\n Levin, the receivers appointed by the federal court for Minnesota, applied for modification of the decrees. They ask approval of the disbursements for expenses of the receivership paid by them out of moneys realized from assets of the Lion Bonding & Surety Company. They ask approval of charges made by counsel employed in certain ancillary proceedings which these counsel propose to deduct from funds collected in another district. They ask that payment be directed of other additional expenses incurred in connection with the original receivership and the ancillary receiverships, aggregating $3,384.55. They also ask that they and their general counsel be paid compensation for services rendered during the two years which have elapsed since their appointment as receivers. The amounts involved in these several requests aggregate nearly $30,000. There are still some assets of the corporation within the district of Minnesota and in two other districts in which Hertz and Levin were appointed ancillary receivers. The aggregate value of these assets appears to be less than the aggregate amount now claimed. The receivers pray for a general direction that payment be made out of funds of the insolvent estate now being administered by the state court.\n The receivers also call attention to the fact that the time allowed creditors for filing claims under the decree of the Nebraska court elapsed May 1, 1922; that many creditors filed their claims only in the federal court; that these claims will be barred from sharing in the distribution to be made, unless an order is entered allowing such claims to be filed in the state court; and they ask that this court direct the Department of Trade and Commerce of Nebraska to take such proceedings in the state court as may be necessary to secure to such creditors the right to share in the assets of the corporation.\n This court is without power to grant any part of the relief sought. The District Court was without jurisdiction \n\n[262 U.S. 640, 642]\n\u00a0\n as a federal court to appoint receivers in, or otherwise to entertain, the Karatz suit. For this reason, among others, the Hertz suit, a dependent bill, was dismissed. As the lower federal courts lacked jurisdiction, they are necessarily without power to make any charge upon, or disposition of, the assets within their respective districts. \n1\n Even where the court which appoints a receiver had jurisdiction at the time, but loses it, as upon supervening bankruptcy, the first court cannot thereafter make an allowance for his expenses and compensation. He must apply to the bankruptcy court. \n2\n Where a case is dismissed for want of jurisdiction as a federal court, there is not even power to award costs against the defeated party. \n3\n The case at bar is unlike Palmer v. Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 118, 132\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 230, upon which the receivers rely. In that case the costs and expenses of a receiver erroneously appointed by the federal court were directed to be paid out of funds realized in that court. There the Circuit Court had jurisdiction as a federal court; but the decree appointing the receiver was reversed, because it was erroneous. \n\n[262 U.S. 640, 643]\n\u00a0\n Obviously, this court has no power to direct the Department of Trade and Commerce of Nebraska to apply to the state court for the order allowing creditors to prove their claims in that court. Our jurisdiction is limited in this proceeding to the correction of the errors committed by the lower federal courts in taking jurisdiction and in granting relief. The only course open to the creditors, as to the receivers and their counsel, is to apply to the state court.\n Motion denied. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare Missouri v.

Y., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The venue of suits for infringement of copyright is not determined by the general provision governing suits in the federal district courts. Judicial Code,  51 (Comp. St.  1033). The Copyright Act provides that suits 'may be instituted in the district of which the defendant or his agent is an inhabitant, or in which he may be found.' Act March 4, 1909, c. 320,  35, 35 Stat. 1075, 1084 (Comp. St  9556). Whether under this section a valid service was made upon defendant is the only question for decision.\n New York is divided into four federal judicial districts. Judicial Code,  97 (Comp. St.  1084). Lumiere, a citizen and resident of New York City, in the Southern district, brought, in the federal court for that district, this suit to enjoin the infringement of a copyright by publications in that city. The defendant, Mae Edna Wilder, Inc., is a New York corporation, with its place of business in Rochester, in the Western district. It was not an inhabitant of the Southern district. It had no place of business there. It had no agent or employee there authorized to carry on business on its behalf. It transacted no business there. The only service of process made was by delivering to Mr. Adkin, who was its president, a copy of the summons while he was temporarily in New York City. He was not an inhabitant of the Southern district, and it was not shown that he was there on business of the company. The defendant, appearing especially for the purpose of objecting to the jurisdiction of he court, moved to quash the service on the ground that it was not amenable to process. The motion was granted; and the case is here on appeal \n\n[261 U.S. 174, 177]\n\u00a0\n under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), the question of jurisdiction having been duly certified.\n That jurisdiction over a corporation cannot be acquired in a district in which it has no place of business and is not found, merely by serving process upon an executive officer temporarily therein, even if he is there on business of the company, has been settled. Philadelphia & Reading Ry. Co. v. McKibbin, \n243 U.S. 264\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 280; Rosenberg Bros. & Co., Inc., v. Curtis Brown Co. (No. 102, decided January 2, 1923) \n260 U.S. 516\n, 43 Sup.

The contention here, is that jurisdiction was obtained over the defendant because its president is an agent within the meaning of the statute and was personally found in New York City. If such facts are sufficient to give jurisdiction, a suit upon a copyright may be brought in any district of the United States in which one who is an officer or an agent of a defendant is served with process, although neither plaintiff nor defendant has his residence or a place of business there, and although the copyright was not infringed there. It is not to be lightly assumed that Congress intended such a thing. Compare In re Keasbey & Mattison Co., \n160 U.S. 221\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 273; Macon Grocery Co. v. Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co., \n215 U.S. 501\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 184; Ladew v. Tennessee Copper Co., \n218 U.S. 357\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 81\n\n\n Ordinarily a civil suit to enforce a personal liability under a federal statute can be brought only in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant. Judicial Code,  51. In a few classes of cases, a carefully limited right to sue elsewhere has been given. In patent cases it is the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant or in which acts of infringement have been committed and the defendant has a regular and established place of business. Judicial Code,  48 (Comp. St.  1030); W. S. Tyler Co. v. Ludlow-Saylor Wire Co., \n236 U.S. 723\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 458. In cases under the anti-trust laws, it is where the defendant 'resides or is found or has an agent' (Act. Oct. 15, 1914, c. 323,  4, 38 Stat. \n\n[261 U.S. 174, 178]\n\u00a0\n 730, 731; Comp. St.  8835d), and, in the case of corporations, the 'district whereof it is an inhabitant' or 'any district wherein it may be found or transacts business.' Section 12, p. 736 (Comp. St.  8835k). It is not reasonable to conclude that Congress intended in copyright cases to give a right far greater than these. 'Agent' is a word used in the law in many senses. What it means in a statute is to be determined from the context and the subject-matter. The president of a business corporation is, commonly, authorized to represent it for many purposes, and it may often be said properly that he is acting as its agent. But induction into office does not impress upon a person the status of agent of the corporation, so that he must be deemed its agent in every jurisdiction which he happens to enter, although the corporation transacts no business there and he is not there in any way representing it. The service of process made upon Mr. Adkin was, clearly, not service upon an agent of the corporation within the meaning of the Copyright Act (U. S. Comp. St.  9517 et seq.).\n As there is in this case only one defendant, the provision concerning suits in states which contain more than one federal judicial district can have no application. See Judicial Code,  52 (Comp. St.  1034); Comp v. Gress, \n250 \nU.S. 308, 314\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 478. Whether, under the Copyright Act, service upon an agent would be effective as upon one 'found,' if it appeared that the agent when served was transacting some business for defendant wi hin the jurisdiction, but was there only temporarily, and had his residence and place of business elsewhere, is a question which we need not decide in this case.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMADERA SUGAR PINE CO. v.

Pillsbury, both of San Francisco, Cal., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two cases were heard together. They involve a single question as to the constitutionality of the Workmen's Compensation Act of California.\n This is a compulsory compensation act establishing in all except certain employments, an exclusive system governing compensation for injuries to employees resulting in disability or death. By its terms liability exists against an employer for the compensation therein providend, \n\n[262 U.S. 499, 500]\n\u00a0\n in lieu of any other liability whatsoever to any person, and 'without regard to negligence,' for any injury sustained by his employees, including aliens, arising out of and in the course of the employment, not caused by their intoxication or intentionally self-inflicted; such compensation being recoverable by the employees, according to a prescribed scale gauged by their previous wages and the extent of their disability, or, if the injuries cause death, by those dependent upon them for support, according to prescribed death benefits gauged by the previous wages and the extent of the dependency of the beneficiaries. Laws Cal. 1917, c. 586; Amendment, Laws 1919, c. 471. See Western Indemnity Co. v. Pillsbury, 170 Cal. 686, 695, 151 Pac. 398, and North Alaska Salmon Co. v. Pillsbury, 174 Cal. 1, 162 Pac. 93, L. R. A. 1917E, 642. Non-resident alien dependents are included within its provisions as to death benefits. See Western Supply Co. v. Pillsbury, 172 Cal. 407, 416, 156 Pac. 491, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 390.\n In the present cases, two laborers employed by the Madera Sugar Pine Company in California, having sustained, without negligence of the Company, fatal injuries, arising out of and in the course of their employment, their partially dependent mother and sisters, respectively, being aliens residing in Mexico, were awarded by the Industrial Accident Commission, in appropriate proceedings under the Act, death benefits against the Company as therein prescribed.\n Petitions for writs to review these awards in accordance with the State practice were denied by the Supreme Court of California; and thereupon, on the application of the Company, these writs of error, with supersedeas, were allowed by the Chief Justice of that court. See Napa Valley Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n251 \nU.S. 366, 372\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 174.\n The sole contention of the Company here is that the act, as construed and applied in these cases, requiring it to make compensation for the death of employees, occurring without fault, to their non-resident alien dependents, \n\n[262 U.S. 499, 501]\n\u00a0\n operates to deprive it of property without due process and in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The argument is, in substance, that while an employer may lawfully be compelled to make compensation to the resident dependents of employees whose death was caused by no legal wrong, on the ground that the State is interested in preventing such dependents from becoming public charges, this justification does not extent to the case of foreign dependents, who would not become public charges of the State; and, therefore, that an act requiring compensation to be made to such foreign dependents in the absence of legal wrong, is not a reasonable exercise of the police power of the State. This argument, however, erroneously assumes that in a compensation act of this character the benefits is to be separately determined, independently benefits is to be separately determined, independetly of the general scope of the act, and solely with reference to the relation of the beneficiaries to the employers and to the State.\n Provision is universally made in workmen's compensation acts for compensation not only to disabled employees but to the dependents of those whose injuries are fatal. And the two kinds of payment are 'always regarded as component parts of a single system of rights and liabilities arising out of' the relation of employer and employee. Western Metal Supply Co. v. Pillsbury, 172 Cal. 407, 414, 156 Pac. 491, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 390. The object of such acts 'is single-to provide for the liability of the employer to make compensation for injuries received by an employee,' whether to the employee himself or to those who suffer pecuniary loss by reason of his death. Huyett v. Pennsylvania Railroad, 86 N. J. Law, 683, 684, 92 Atl. 58.\n This Court has in several cases sustained the constitutionality of workmen's compensation acts, from which the California Act in its constitutional aspects is not distinguishable, establishing exclusive systems governing the \n\n[262 U.S. 499, 502]\n\u00a0\n liabilities of employers in hazardous occupations in respect to compensation for industrial accidents to employees resulting in disability or death, and requiring compensation t be paid to a disabled employee or to his surviving dependents in accordance with prescribed scales gauged upon the previous wage and the extent of the disability or dependency. New York Central Railroad v. White, \n243 U.S. 188\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 U.S. 219\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 260, Ann.

These acts were sustained, in their entirety, without any separate reference to the status of the dependents-although in the White Case the right of a widow to compensation was directly involved- upon the broad ground that the State, by reason of its public interest in the safety and lives of employees engaged in such occupations, may provide, in the just and reasonable exercise of its police power, that the loss of earning power sustained by an employee through an industrial accident resulting in his disability or death, constituting a loss arising out of the business and an expense of its operation, shall, in effect, be charged against the industry after the manner of casualty insurance, and to that end require the employer to make such compensation as may reasonably be prescribed for the loss thus incurred in the common enterprise, irrespective of the question of negligence, to the injured employee or to his surviving dependents. New York Central Railroad v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 203, 207\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 U.S. 243\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642; Ward v. Krinsky, \n259 U.S. 512\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 529. That is to say, as shown by these decisions, the compensation to dependents is merely a part of the general scheme of compensation provided by these acts for the loss resulting from the impairment or destruction of the earning power of an employee caused by an industrial accident, which in case of his death is paid to those whom he had supported by his earnings and \n\n[262 U.S. 499, 503]\n\u00a0\n who have suffered direct loss through the destruction of his earning power. And it is clear that the underlying reason of these decisions applies alike to all dependents who by his death have been deprived of their support, whether they be residents or non-residents of the State.\n If an employment be such as to fall within the State's law-making jurisdiction and the Legislature determines that the employment of labor therein entails upon the employer certain responsibilities toward the persons performing the labor and those dependent on them, there is no constitutional provision requiring that the benefits of such legislative scheme be limited to citizens or residents of the State. Western Metal Supply Co. v. Pillsbury, supra, 172 Cal. 416, 156 Pac. 491, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 390. Just as accident insurance goes to the beneficiary regardless of his residence, so the quasi-insurance of a workmen's compensation act goes to those to whom the employee would naturally have made such insurance payable: to himself, although an alien, if he be disabled; and to those dependent upon his earnings for support, if he be killed. Derinza's Case, 229 Mass. 435, 441, 118 N. E. 942.\n A strong argument in support of the view that as part of a system of compulsory compensation established by a State to protect employees from loss through industrial accidents, the death benefits may properly be extended to alien dependents, is also found, by analogy, in the reason stated in various decisions holding that employers' liability acts authorizing recovery for the death of employees caused by negligence, inure to the benefit of alien as well as resident beneficiaries. Thus, as the Federal Employers' Liability Act (Comp. St.  8657-8665), in order to protect the life of the employee gives compensation to those who had relation to it, it makes no difference where they may re ide; it being 'the fact of their relation to the life destroyed that is the circumstance to be considered, whether we \n\n[262 U.S. 499, 504]\n\u00a0\n consider the injury received by them or the influence of that relation upon the life destroyed.' McGovern v. Philadelphia Railroad, \n235 \nU.S. 389, 400\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 127. Such employers' liability statutes are designed to benefit all employees. Vetaloro v. Perkins (C. C.) 101 Fed. 393, 397. They have the interest of the employees in mind and are primarily for the protection of their lives; the action is given to the beneficiaries on their account and they are not intended to be less protected if their beneficiaries happen to live abroad.

The statute not only benefits the survivors, but protects the laboring man. ... The laborer, leaving wife and children behind him and coming here from abroad, has a right to enter into the contract of employment, fully relying upon the statute.' Alfson v. Bush Co., 182 N.

COTY(1923)\nNo. 978\nArgued: Decided: May 7, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 159, 160]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles H. Tuttle, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. Asher Blum, of New York City, for respondent Coty.\n Mr. Geo. S. Hornblower, of New York City, for respondent Houbigant, Inc.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n All these cases involved the question how far the purchasers of perfumes made by manufacturers whose perfumes have gained a high reputation with the public may use the name and trade-mark of such manufacturers in rebottling or repacking and selling them, when as claimed by the manufacturers and owners of the trade-mark, the process of rebottling and repacking injures the perfumes and impairs the value of the trade-mark and the reputation of the manufacturers. In a case presenting a similar question, to wit, Prestonettes, Inc., v. Coty, No. 793, \n260 U.S. 720\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 250, 67 L. Ed. --, October Term, 1922, January 22, 1923, this court granted a writ of certiorari, and applications in the above entitled cases are now pending. They are also before us on petitions praying that this court issue orders suspending the operation of the decrees of the Circuit Court of Appeals and that, pending the applications for certiorari in this court, we restore the temporary injunctions of the District Court which the Circuit Court of Appeals enlarged.\n The District Court found that the defendants in all these cases were infringing the rights of the complainants in their trademarks and the use of their trade-names, \n\n[262 U.S. 159, 161]\n\u00a0\n but thought it sufficient to permit the defendants to continue their rebottling and repacking of complainants' perfumes and powders if, in the form in which resold, the bottles or boxes bore a legend reciting all the facts and not giving any more prominence to the fact that these were complainants' perfumes or powders than to the fact that they had been rebottledand repacked by defendants. The Circuit Court of Appeals found that such rebottling and repacking as done by defendants so impaired the delicate odors and qualities of the perfumes and powders that it unlawfully injured the right of the complainants in their trade-marks and business, that such rebottling and repacking and resale with the use of the original manufacturer's trade-mark and name were a violation of a criminal statute of the state of New York, that the proposed inspection of defendants' rebottling and rep cking with a view to preserving the excellence of the perfumes and powders would entail such expense and burden upon complainants as to be impracticable, and that the only complete and satisfactory remedy to which complainants were entitled was an injunction against the use of the complainants' trade-marks or names upon the rebottled or repacked articles for sale, and the temporary injunctions granted by the District Court were accordingly modified and the case was remanded to the District Court for final hearing. Applications were then made to the Circuit Court of Appeals to stay the mandate and to grant an application upon proper bond to suspend its modification of the District Court's orders until applications for certiorari and motions for a suspending order could be made to this court. After full consideration, these motions were denied by the Circuit Court of Appeals, its mandate has gone down and the injunctions as enlarged by it are now in force. Meantime these applications for certiorari have been made here, and in advance \n\n[262 U.S. 159, 162]\n\u00a0\n of our consideration of them in due course, motions for the suspension of the orders of the Circuit Court of Appeals have been presented to us on affidavits and heard, and are now to be decided.\n It is objected for Houbigant, one of the respondents in these petitions for certiorari, that this court has no jurisdiction to suspend the operation of the order or decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals pending a petition for certiorari and before it is granted. The cases of In re Massachusetts, \n197 U.S. 482\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 512, In re Glaser, \n198 U.S. 171\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 653, and McIntire v. Wood, 7 Cranch, 504, are cited to this point. They are wholly without application. The first two were cases pending in inferior courts which, under the Constitution and the statutes of the United States could never, by any possibility, come within the jurisdiction of this court. The third case was one of an application to a Circuit Court for the issuing of a mandamus to the register of the land office to compel him to issue a final certificate of purchase of land to the relator. This court found that under the statute, the Circuit Court was not given original power to issue a mandamus in such a case when not necessary or ancillary to the exercise of its jurisdiction otherwise conferred.\n Under section 262 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1239) this court is given power to issue all writs not specifically provided for by statute which may be necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction, and agreeable to the usages and principles of law. Here the jurisdiction of this court to grant the application for certiorari already made and pending is conferred by section 240 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1217). That section provides that in any case, civil or criminal, in which the judgment or decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is made final, it shall be competent for this court by certiorari upon the petition of a party thereto to bring the case here for review as if it had come by error or appeal. By section 128 of the Judicial Code as amended by the Act of \n\n[262 U.S. 159, 163]\n\u00a0\n Jan. 28, 1915, c. 22,  2, 38 Stat. 803 (Comp. St.  1120), the judgment or decree of the Circuit Courts of Appeals is made final in trade-mark cases. Hence if, in its discretion, this court conceives that upon the showing made it should order the suspension or modification of a judgment or decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, interlocutory or final, to preserve or secure a status of the case for the full and satisfactory exercise of its reviewing power over it, it may make the necessary order of suspension or modification upon such terms as seem equitable upon the filing of the petition for certiorari and pending its disposition. So much on the question of the power.\n The question how the court should exercise this power next arises. The jurisdiction to bring up cases by certiorari from the Circuit Courts of Appeals was given for two purposes, first to secure u iformity of decision between those courts in the nine circuits, and second, to bring up cases involving questions of importance which it is in the public interest to have decided by this court of last resort. The jurisdiction was not conferred upon this court merely to give the defeated party in the Circuit Court of Appeals another hearing. Our experience shows that 80 per cent. of those who petition for certiorari do not appreciate these necessary limitations upon our issue of the writ. When, therefore, after the petition is filed and before its submission, an application is made for a suspension of the judgment or decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, a heavy burden rests on the applicant.\n The petition should, in the first instance, be made to the Circuit Court of Appeals which with its complete knowledge of the cases may with full consideration promptly pass on it. That court is in a position to judge first whether the case is one likely under our practice to be taken up by us one certiorari, and second, whether the balance of convenience requires a suspension of its decree and a withholding of its mandate. It involves no dis respect \n\n[262 U.S. 159, 164]\n\u00a0\n to this court for the Circuit Court of Appeals to refuse to withhold its mandate or to suspend the operation of its judgment or decree pending application for certiorari to us. If it thinks a question involved should be ruled upon by this court, it may certify it. If it does not certify, it may still consider that the case is one in which a certiorari may properly issue, and may in its discretion facilitate the application by withholding the mandate or suspending its decree. This is a matter however wholly within its discretion. If it refuses, this court requires an extraordinary showing, before it will grant a stay of the decree below pending the application for a certiorari, and even after it has granted a certiorari, it requires a clear case and a decided balance of convenience before it will grant such stay. These remarks, of course, apply also to applications for certiorari to review judgments and decrees of the highest courts of states.\n Coming now to the circumstances presented on the inquiry before us, we find nothing to justify our granting the motion. It is clear that the Circuit Court of Appeals gave full consideration to a similar motion and with a much fuller knowledge than we can have, denied it. As we have said, we require very cogent reasons before we will disregard the deliberate action of that court in such a matter. We have read the affidavits and we do not find that the petitioners have, in the light of what we have said, made a case for the suspension of the order. On the contrary, the weight of the evidence is clearly with the respondents.\n The petitions are denied. \n\n\n\n","126":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMASON v. U S(1923)\nNo. 117\nArgued: Decided: January 2, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 545, 546]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. R. L. Batts, of Pittsburgh, Pa., and S. L. Herold and Hampden Story, both of Shreveport, La., for appellants.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 545, 547]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Riter, and Mr. Solicitor General Beck were on the brief, for the United States.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 545, 551]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases, involving the same questions, were consolidated for trial in the District Court, as well as for hearing \n\n[260 U.S. 545, 552]\n\u00a0\n on appeal in the Circuit Court of Appeals, and argued together here.\n The United States, as plaintiff, brought separate suits in equity in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana against the several groups of appellants (defendants in the bills) to have its title to various parcels of land confirmed, possession thereof restored, and defendants enjoined from setting up claims thereto, extracting oil or other minerals therefrom, or going upon or in any manner using the same. There was in addition a prayer for an accounting in respect of the oil and gas removed from the lands by the defendants. The cases were referred to a master, and upon his report the District Court entered decrees in favor of the plaintiff in all the cases, from which appeals were taken by defendants and cross-appeals by plaintiff to the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court affirmed the decrees generally, but reversed the trial court in so far as it had allowed drilling and operating costs as a credit against the value of the oil extracted and converted by the defendants, respectively. 273 Fed. 135, 142. The cases come here by appeal.\n The lands in question were public lands of the United States, and the only claim thereto asserted by the defendants was based upon locations purporting to have been made under the mining laws. The lands were withdrawn on December 15, 1908, by an executive order which reads:\n'To secure the public interests, and, in aid of such legislation as may hereafter be proposed or recommended, the public lands in townships 15 to 23 north and ranges 10 to 16 west, Louisiana meridian, Natchitoches Land Office, Louisiana, are, subject to existing valid claims, withdrawn from settlement and entry, or other form of appropriation.'\n\n After the promulgation of this order, at various times, mining locations were made upon the several parcels of \n\n[260 U.S. 545, 553]\n\u00a0\n land by the respective groups of defendants or persons in privity with them. These locations, it will be assumed for the purposes of the case, complied with the requirements of the laws relating to the acquisition of mining rights. Before the locations were made the question had been submitted by some of the defendants to counsel learned in the law, who advised that the President was without authority to make the withdrawal, and that the order, in any event, did not include appropriations of lands valuable for their deposits of mineral substances. All the locations, it is claimed, were made by the defendants in the honest belief that the order not only was made without authority, but that it did not purport to preclude appropriations under the mining laws.\n Whatever legitimate doubts existed at the time of the locations respecting the validity of the executive order were resolved by the subsequent decision of this Court in United States v. Midwest Oil Co., \n236 U.S. 459\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 309, where it was held that a similar order, issued in 1909, was within the power of the executive. Upon the authority of that case the order here in question must be held valid.\n Passing this, it is insisted that the order do  not apply to the cases here presented. The point sought to be made rests upon the rule of statutory construction that words may be so associated as to qualify the meaning which they would have standing apart. Here, it is said, the general words of the order, 'or other form of appropriation,' must be read in connection with the specific words 'settlement and entry' immediately preceding, and that so read they must be restricted to appropriations of a similar kind with those specifically enumerated. The words 'settlement and entry,' it is said, apply only to the act of settling upon the soil and making entry at a land office, as, for example, under the homestead laws; that mining lands are acquired, not by settlement or entry, but by location and development; and that this \n\n[260 U.S. 545, 554]\n\u00a0\n process is not covered by the words 'other form of appropriation,' limited, as they must be, by the associated specific words, to those forms of appropriation which are akin to a settlement and entry. The rule is one well established and frequently invoked, but it is, after all, a rule of construction, to be resorted to only as an aid to the ascertainment of the meaning of doubtful words and phrases, and not to control or limit their meaning contrary to the true intent. It cannot be employed to render general words meaningless, since that would be to disregard the primary rules, that effect should be given to every part of a statute, if legitimately possible, and that the words of a statute or other document are to be taken according to their natural meaning. Here the supposed specific words are sufficiently comprehensive to exhaust the genus and leave nothing essentially similar upon which the general words may operate. See United States v. Mescall, \n215 U.S. 26\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 19; Danciger v. Cooley, \n248 \nU.S. 319, 326\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 119; Higler v. People, 44 Mich. 299, 6 N. W. 664, 38 Am. Rep. 267; United States v. First National Bank (D. C.) 190 Fed. 336, 344. If the appropriation of mineral lands by location and development be not skin to settlement and entry, what other form of appropriation can be so characterized? None has been suggested and we can think of none. A purchase of land or an appropriation for railroad uses or rights of way, if not actually involving settlement and entry, is no more akin to that method than an appropriation for mining purposes. Reasons which, under the rule, would justify the exclusion of one from the operation of the general words would equally justify the exclusion of all. It would therefore result, there being nothing ejusdem generis, that the application of the rule contended for would nullify the general words altogether. Moreover, the circumstances leading up to and accompanying the issuance of the order demonstrate conclusively that its main, if not its only, purpose was to preserve from private appropriation \n\n[260 U.S. 545, 555]\n\u00a0\n the oil and gas which the lands were thought to contain pending investigation and congressional action, and this purpose would have been subverted by appropriations of the nature here involved quite as much as by other forms. We conclude, therefore, that the mining locations here relied upon fell clearly within the withdrawal order and consequently were prohibited by it.\n The trial court so decided, but, following the report of the master, held that these locations were made in moral good faith, and that under the laws of Louisiana, where the lands are situated, the defendants were liable only for the value of the oil after deducting therefrom the cost of drilling, equipping and operating the wells, through and by means of which the oil was extracted. It was to reverse this latter holding that the cross appeals were prosecuted. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court in this particular upon the ground that the defendants' mistake, if any, was one of law, and constituted no excuse, and that the Louisiana law could have no application since the suit was one in equity, to be governed by general principles and not y local laws or rules of decision.\n Whether the defendants were innocent trespassers within the principles of the common law we find it unnecessary to determine. That the measure of damages applied by the District Court was in consonance with the statute law of Louisiana as interpreted by the highest court of that state is clear. The Louisiana Civil Code (article 501), in terms provides that the 'fruits produced by the thing belong to its owner, although they may have been produced by the work and labor of the third person ... on the owner's reimbursing such person his expenses.' This provision is taken substantially from article 548 of the Code Napoleon, respecting which Laurent, a distinguished commentator, says:\n'This is a principle of equity which will not permit the \n\n[260 U.S. 545, 556]\n\u00a0\n owner to enrich himself at the expense of another, even though he be in bad faith. This applies to all the expenses to which the possessor has been subjected.' Martel v. Jennings-Heywood Oil Syndicate, 114 La. 351, 359, 38 South. 253.\n\n The decisions of the Supreme Court of Louisiana have settled the rule that under the provisions of this article of the Louisiana Civil Code in awarding damages to the owner of property from which oil has been extracted the cost of production must be first deducted from the value of the oil produced, even though the defendant went into possession in technical bad faith but in moral good faith. Cooke v. Gulf Refining Co., 135 La. 610, 618, 65 South. 758, and cases cited.\n The defendants here, it is true, took possession of the lands in violation of the withdrawal order, but they did so in the honest, though mistaken, belief that the order was wholly without authority. Some of them had legal advice from competent counsel to that effect. It is common knowledge that the validity of the withdrawal order in question, as well as the later order of 1909, was in grave doubt until the decision of this court in United States v. Midwest Oil Co., supra. Not only was a substantial opinion to be found among members of the profession that the order was invalid, but the decision here was by a divided court. In view of these circumstances, we think it fair to conclude that the mining locations by defendants and the occupation and use of the lands thereunder were in moral good faith, within the meaning of the Louisiana Code and decisions. New Orleans v. Gaines, \n131 \nU.S. 191, 218\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 745. The Circuit Court of Appeals suggested doubts respecting the honesty of defendants' motives in seeking or in acting upon advice of counsel; but we cannot ignore the finding of the master explicitly to the effect that the locators proceeded in 'moral good faith.' His finding was made after hearing and seeing the witnesses and, having support in the evidence, will be accepted here. See Adamson v. Gilliland, \n242 \nU.S. 350, 353\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 169. \n\n[260 U.S. 545, 557]\n\u00a0\n The Norvell Case is sought to be distinguished from the others. It appears that the location covered one hundred and sixty acres and was made by an association of eight persons. The lands were leased to the Gulf Refining Company upon the same day in pursuance of an understanding had prior to the location. But there is nothing in the federal mining laws which renders such a transaction fraudulent, and a careful reading of the evidence discloses nothing in the circumstances which would make the Louisiana statute as to the measure of damages inapplicable.\n Was the lower court right in its conclusion that the Louisiana law was not applicable in an equity suit?\n Subject to certain exceptions, the statutes of a state are binding upon the federal courts sitting within the state, as they are upon the state courts. One of the exceptions is that these statutes may not be permitted to enlarge or diminish the federal equity jurisdiction. Mississippi Mills v. Cohn, \n150 U.S. 202\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 75. That jurisdiction is conferred by the Constitution and laws of the United States and must be he same in all the states. Neves v. Scott, 13 How. 268. But while the power of the courts of the United States to entertain suits in equity and to decide them cannot be abridged by state legislation, the rights involved therein may be the proper subject of such legislation. See Missouri, Kansas, etc., Trust Co. v. Krumseig, \n172 U.S. 351\n, 358 19 Sup. Ct. 179. In Brine v. Insurance Co., \n96 U.S. 627\n, 639 (24 L. Ed. 858), this court said:\n'We are not insensible to the fact that the industry of counsel has been rewarded by finding cases even in this court in which the proposition that the rules of practice of the federal courts in suits in equity cannot be controlled by the laws of the states, is expressed in terms so emphatic and so general as to seem to justify the inference here urged upon us. But we do not find that it has been decided in any case that this principle has been carried so far as to deny to a party in those courts substantial rights \n\n[260 U.S. 545, 558]\n\u00a0\n conferred by the statute of a state, or to add to or to take from a contract that which is made a part of it by the law of the state, except where the law impairs the obligation of a contract previously made.'\n\n See, also, Independent District of Pella v. Beard (C. C.) 83 Fed. 5, 13, where it is said:\n'It is undoubtedly true that the United States courts sitting as courts of equity have a freedom of action in this respect which they do not possess as courts of common law, and that, as a general proposition, the equity jurisdiction of the federal courts cannot be limited or restrained by a state. Green v. Creighton, 23 How. 90; Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 430; Ridings v. Johnson, \n128 U.S. 212\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 72; Mississippi Mills v. Cohn, \n150 U.S. 202\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 75. But these decisions relate to the practice, the impairing of jurisdiction, rather than to the determination of the rights of parties after jurisdiction has been acquired.'\n\n Here, while the suit is one in equity, the statute and decisions relied upon have nothing to do with the general principles of equity or with federal equity jurisdiction, but simply establish a measure of damages applicable alike to actions at law and suits in equity. The case presented by the bills is primarily one involving title to land and seeking an injunction against continuing trespasses. The conversion of the oil, for which damages are sought, is incidental and dependent. The entire cause of action is therefore local (Ellenwood v. Marietta Chair Co., \n158 U.S. 105\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 771), and the matter of damages within the controlling scope of state legislation. See Mullins Lumber Co. v. Williamson & Brown Land & Lumber Co., 255 Fed. 645, 647, 167 C. C. A. 21. The enforcement of such a statute in an equity suit in no manner trammels or impairs the equity jurisdiction of the national courts.\n It was urged upon the argument that section 721 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1538), which provides that the laws of the several states shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law in the courts of the United States, by impli- \n\n[260 U.S. 545, 559]\n\u00a0\n cation excludes such laws as rules of decision in equity suits. The statute, however, is merely declarative of the rule which would exist in the absence of the statute. Bank of Hamilton v. Dudley, 2 Pet. 492, 525; Bergman v. Bly, 66 Fed. 40, 43, 13 C. C. A. 319. And it is not to be narrowed because of an affirmative legislative recognition in terms less broad than the rule. The rule that an affirmative statute, without a negative express or implied, does not take away the common law (Potter's Dwarris, 68; Sedgwick Statutory Construction, 29, 30) affords an analogy. See Bailey v. Commonwealth, 11 Bush (Ky.) 688, 691; Johnston v. Straus (C. C.) 26 Fed. 57, 69.\n There are numerous cases, both in this court and in the lower federal courts, where the rule has been applied in suits in equity, and while section 721 was not mentioned, it is scarcely possible that it was overloo ed. See, for example, Jackson v. Ludeling, \n99 U.S. 513\n, 519 (25 L. Ed. 460), a suit in equity, where this court held that a law of Louisiana based upon the civil law, relating to the measure of damages, was controlling. The law there involved was article 2314 of the Civil Code, which provides:\n'He to whom property is restored must refund to the person who possessed it, even in bad faith, all he had necessarily expended for the preservation of the property.'\n\n The general purpose and principle of that provision and of the provision which is relied upon in the instant case are the same.\n The defendants in some of the cases enumerated in the title complain of the action of the master and the District Court in charging against them various sums paid to codefendants as royalties, notwithstanding the fact that the cost of drilling, equipping and operating the wells exceeded the value of the oil extracted, or that the exaction was in addition to the value after deducting such cost. These royalties arose from and were paid out of proceeds of the oil; but this oil belonged to the plaintiff as owner of the property from which it had been taken. The defendants \n\n[260 U.S. 545, 560]\n\u00a0\n who received the royalties were obviously not entitled to retain them, and having incurred no expense in connection with the mining operations, were liable for the entire amount and the defendants who paid the royalties were jointly liable as cowrongdoers. A joint judgment against all was therefore proper. In the Mason Case, however, the net value of the oil extracted exceeded in amount the royalties paid. The gross value was $67, 732.94, the drilling and operating cost was $34,067.13, which, being deducted, left the net value of $33,665.81. Royalties were paid by the producer, the Gulf Refining Company, to its codefendants, amounting to $11, 294.20. The master found and the District Court held that the Gulf Refining Company was liable for the $33,665.81, and that the recipients of the royalties and the Gulf Refining Company were liable in solido for the additional sum of $11,294.20, making the total judgment $44,960.01. We think this was erroneous. For reasons already stated, plaintiff was entitled to recover the amount of the royalties without deduction in any event, but it was not entitled to recover them twice and this is clearly the effect of the decree, the amount of which should be reduced to $33,665. 81.\n The District Court reserved the question of the adjustment of equities among the several defendants in respect of the royalties and no doubt an opportunity will be afforded by that court for its presentation and consideration. As to the rights of the respective defendants in that matter, however, we express no opinion.\n The decrees of the Circuit Court of Appeals are reversed and those of the District Court are affirmed in all the cases, except that the decree in the Mason Case is modified by reducing the amount to $33,665.81-$22,371. 61 against the Gulf Refining Company and $11,294.20 against that defendant and the respective royalty recipients in solido-and, as so modified, it is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","127":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCCARTHY v.

The district judge, having 'no doubt that the answers might furnish information which would render him liable to prosecutions in the federal courts for concealment of assets,' denied a motion to punish him for contempt. After his examination, however, Arndstein filed, without objection, sworn schedules of his assets and liabilities, showing on y one item of property, namely, a bank deposit of $18,000. Thereupon, the district judge, being of opinion that Arndstein thus asserted not only that he had this bank deposit but also that he had no other property and had thereby become subject to examination as to his property, ordered him to answer 426 of the former questions. Being recalled for further examination he again refused to answer them, upon the same ground as before. He was then adjudged to be guilty of contempt of court and committed to the custody of the Marshal for confinement in jail so long as he persisted in his refusal to answer.\n He thereupon presented to the District Court a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that he was restrained of his liberty without due process and in violation \n\n[262 U.S. 355, 357]\n\u00a0\n of the Federal Constitution. This petition was held to be insufficient, and the writ was refused. Upon an appeal by Arndstein this court held that as the schedules did not amount to an admission of guilt or furnish clear proof of crime, they did not constitute a waiver of his right to stop short whenever he could fairly claim that to answer might tend to incriminate him; and the order of the District Court was accordingly reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with the opinion. Arndstein v. McCarthy, supra, \n254 \nU.S. 72, 73\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 26. In a supplemental memorandum (\n254 U.S. 379\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 136) it was added that this decision only required the District Court to issue the writ and proceed as usual, and that if proper reasons existed for holding Arndstein not shown by the petition they might be set up in the return for consideration.\n Thereafter the District Court, in accordance with the mandate of this court, vacated its former order and issued the writ of habeas corpus; to which the Marshal made return, exhibiting a transcript of the entire proceedings before the Commissioner. Aside from general denials of the illegality of Arndstein's commitment the only ground set up in the return as a reason for holding him was that, after being notified by the Commissioner of his privilege, he had, before refusing to answer the questions in issue, testified of his own accord, without invoking any privilege, to the very matters with which these questions were concerned, thereby waiving his privilege upon further examination concerning them. Upon a hearing on the petition and return, the District Court was of opinion that, although in certain answers made without objection Arndstein had denied that he had any stocks or bonds in his possession or under his control at any time during the preceding year, the conclusion to be drawn from the decision of this court in reference to the schedules was that his denials or partial disclosures as a witness did not terminate his privilege so as to deprive him of the right to \n\n[262 U.S. 355, 358]\n\u00a0\n refuse to testify further about his property, and that he was at liberty to cease disclosures, even though some had been made, whenever there was just ground to believe the answers might tend to incriminate him; and it accordingly sustained the writ and discharged him from custody. The Marshal, by reason of the constitutional question involved, has appealed directly to this Court. Jud. Code,  208 (Comp. St.  997); Boske v. Comingore, \n177 \nU.S. 459, 465\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 701; Collins v. Miller, \n252 \nU.S. 364, 365\n, 371 S., 40 Sup. Ct. 347; Arndstein v. McCarthy, supra, \n254 U.S. 72\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 26.\n We find no error in the order of the District Court:\n\n 1. \nThe opinion of this court upon the former appeal was not based upon the ground, as the Marshal in effect contends, that schedules filed by a bankrupt are so essentially different from evidence given by him that, whatever their disclosures, they cannot constitute a waiver of his privilege against incrimination when he is called for compulsory examination under the Bankruptcy Act. On the contrary, the sworn schedules were, impliedly a least, assimilated to evidence given by the bankrupt as a witness, the ground upon which they were held not to have waived his privilege against subsequent incrimination being thus stated (\n254 U.S. 72\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 26):\n'The schedules standing alone did not amount to an admission of guilt of furnish clear proof of crime and the mere filing of them did not constitute a waiver of the right to stop short whenever the bankrupt could fairly claim that to answer might tend to incriminate him. See Brown v. Walker, \n161 U.S. 591\n, 597; Foster v. People, 18 Michigan, 266, 274; People v. Forbes, 143 N. Y. 219, 230; Regina v. Garbett, 2 C. & K. 474, 495.'\n\n The four cases thus cited related to testimony given by witnesses and the limit upon their right to stop disclosures. In Brown v. Walker, \n161 U.S. 591\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 644, this court said that 'if the witness himself elects to waive his privilege ... and discloses his criminal connections, he is not permitted to \n\n[262 U.S. 355, 359]\n\u00a0\n stop, but must go on and make a full disclosure'; in Foster v. People, make a full disclosure'; in Foster v. People, witness who has voluntarily admitted his guilt of a criminal offense is not protected from further disclosures on the same subject, said that if he has not actually admitted criminating facts, he 'may unquestionably stop short at any point, and determine that he will go no further in that direction'; in People v. Forbes, 143 N. Y. 219, 38 N. E. 303, it was held that a witness by answering questions exonerating himself in general terms from all connection with a criminal transaction, does not thereby waive his right to remain silent when it is thereafter sought to draw from him circumstances which might form another link in the chain of facts capable of being used to his peril; and in Regina v. Garbett, it was held that it makes no difference in the right of a witness to protection from incriminating himself that he has already answered in part, he 'being entitled to claim the privilege at any stage of the inquiry.'\n In short, it is apparent not only from the language of the former opinion but from its citations that this court applied to the nonincriminating schedules the rule in the cases cited, namely, that where the previous disclosure by an ordinary witness is not an actual admission of guilt or incriminating facts, he is not deprived of the privilege of stopping short in his testimony whenever it may fairly tend to incriminate him. And although there is some conflict of authority as to the application of this rule, we see no reason for departing from its recognition in the former opinion, and think that it is the sound rule which should be applied to the involuntary examination of a bankrupt where he is practically in the position of a witness under cross-examination. And since we find that none of the answers which had been voluntarily given by Arndstein, either by way of denials or partial disclosures, amounted to an admission or showing of guilt, we are of \n\n[262 U.S. 355, 360]\n\u00a0\n opinion that he was entitled to decline to answer further questions when so to do might tend to incriminate him.\n\n 2. \nThe Marshal also contends that in many instances the questions which Arndstein refused to answer were plainly of such a character that the answers could not have incriminated him, and that his whole testimony shows that he was not making his claim of privilege in good faith, but largely in obedience to suggestions of his counsel, who in some instances claimed the privilege for him. It is, however, a sufficient answer to this contention that no such reasons for denying the writ were set up in the Marshal's return, or, so far as it appears, brought to the attention of the District Court or ruled upon by it. And in such case we are not called upon, on appeal, to examine, as with a microscope, the multitudinous questions in issue, involved in an unduly protracted examination, containing many vain and futile repetitions, much of which does not appear to have had any relation to discovery of assets of the bankrupt but was of such character as to suggest that the underlying purpose was the discovery of evidence to support the charge of grand larceny for which Arndstein had been indicted in the State court; or to determine as original questions in this court, matters not in issue under the pleadings in the District Court or determined by that court.\n Furthermore, the district judge, in ruling in the bankruptcy proceedings on the first motion to punish Arndstein for contempt, had, as shown, specifically stated that he had no doubt that answers to these questions might furnish incriminating information. There was clearly no abuse of discretion in this ruling which would justify us in reviewing it under the writ of habeas corpus. And it may be added, that on the first appeal this court also stated that it was 'impossible to say from mere consideration of the questions propounded, in the light of the circumstances disclosed, that they could have been answered \n\n[262 U.S. 355, 361]\n\u00a0\n with entire impunity.' Arndstein v. McCarthy, supra, \n254 U.S. 72\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 26.\n The order of the District Court sustaining the writ and discharging Arndstein from custody is accordingly\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Rehearing granted 263 U.

MORROW(1923)\nNo. 48\nArgued: Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 39, 40]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harry A. Hegarty, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. G. H. Martin, of Ancon, Canal Zone, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Canal Zone by Harvey McConaughey, in behalf of himself and of all other government employees occupying government quarters in the Zone, against the Governor, Auditor, and Paymaster of the Panama Canal, charging that the defendants were about to make a charge against complainants for rent, fuel, electric current, water, and services in connection with their quarters on and after January 1, 1922, and in case of nonpayment to deduct the same from their lawful pay or to oust them from their quarters, all in pursuance of and compliance with an order of the President of December 3, 1921, issued without legal authority and invalid because in conflict with the Constitution and laws of the United States. \n\n[263 U.S. 39, 41]\n\u00a0\n The defendants made a motion to quash the order to show cause which had been issued against them and to dismiss the bill, because the case was one in effect against the United States, and because it sought to control the executive discretion vested by law and the Constitution in the President and his subordinates. The court sustained the motion, filding that the order of December, 3, 1921, was within the legal authority of the President, and under that order the defendants had the discretion to adopt the regulations, enforcement of which it was sought in the bill to enjoin.\n An appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit under section 9 of the Act of Congress of August 24, 1912 (37 Stat. c. 390, pp. 560, 566 [Comp. St.  10045]). A motion to dismiss the appeal was made in the Circuit Court of Appeals, on the ground that it was based solely on a question of jurisdiction and therefore should have come directly to this Court on a certificate of jurisdiction under section 238 of the Judicial Code as amended January 28, 1915 (38 Stat. c. 22, p. 804 [ Comp. St.  1215]). The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the case did not present a question of jurisdiction of the District Court within section 238, that that section applied only to a question of the court's jurisdiction of the parties or subject-matter as a federal court and that no such issue had been raised here.\n We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals in this view. There is no doubt of the general jurisdiction of the District Court of the Canal Zone as a court of general jurisdiction to hear a suit brought by one resident of the Zone against another upon whom personal service can be had, in respect of any property or personal right of the plaintiff. The question here was whether the court could grant an equitable remedy against an officer of the Canal, when, as asserted, it would in effect be an injunction against the United States. This was not a question of jurisdiction appealable direct to this court. As was said \n\n[263 U.S. 39, 42]\n\u00a0\n in Fore River Shipbuilding Co. v. Hagg, \n219 \nU.S. 175, 178\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 185, 186 (55 L. Ed. 163):\n'This court has had frequent occasion to determine what is meant in the statute providing for review of cases in which the jurisdiction of the court is in issue, and it has been held that the statute means to give a review, not of the jurisdiction of the court upon general grounds of law or procedure, but of the jurisdiction of the court as a federal court.'\n\n See, also, Louisville Trust Co. v. Knott, \n191 U.S. 225\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 119; Bache v. Hunt, \n193 U.S. 523\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 547.\n By the Act of September 21, 1922 (42 Stat. c. 370,  3, pp. 1004, 1006), amending section 9, it is provided that review by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the judgments and decrees of the District Court of the Canal Zone shall include all questions of jurisdiction, thus making section 238 of the Judicial Code thereafter inapplicable to cases coming up from that court. The amendment, however, by its terms did not affect cases then pending in the Court of Appeals and provided that they were to be disposed of as if it had not been enacted. The present case was pending in this court at the time, and we cannot suppose, in view of the saving clause as to cases which had reached the Circuit Court of Appeals, that the act was intended to have any effect upon cases which had passed through the Circuit Court of Appeals and had been lodged here. We must deal with this case, therefore, as if the amendment of September 21, 1922, had not been passed. Under either statute, however, the whole case is before us on the sufficiency of the complaint presented below by the motion of the defendants to dismiss it.\n The claim of the appellant is that he and those for whom he sues were employees of the government engaged in and about its work in respect to the construction and operation of the Canal, that while the Isthmian Canal Commission was carrying on this task under the President, it had been its policy to furnish government employees \n\n[263 U.S. 39, 43]\n\u00a0\n quarters free of rent, that this policy was finally embodied in a regulation of the Commission effective April 1, 1907, as follows:\n'Whenever practicable and in the best interest of the service, and employee will be provided with such quarters on the Isthmus as may be available from time to time,'\n\n -and that thereafter, by proper orders, free fuel, electric current and other service were allowed to employees in government quarters.\n These orders and regulations were in force when the Panama Canal Act was passed August 24, 1912 (37 Stat. c. 390, p. 560 [Comp. St.  10038]) containing as its second section the following:\n'That all laws, orders, regulations, and ordinances adopted and promulgated in the Canal Zone by order of the President for the governent and sanitation of the Canal Zone and the construction of the Panama Canal are hereby ratified and confirmed as valid and binding until Congress shall otherwise provide.'\n\n Appellant contends that as all the regulations of the Commission were authorized by the President and unless revoked were to be taken as confirmed by him, they were by the section 2 just quoted made into an act of Congress and thereafter could not be revoked or amended save by another act of Congress otherwise providing. Hence, it is claimed that the Commission's regulation of April 1, 1907, with its succeeding orders on the same subject, has all the force of an act of Congress not to be amended by the President, and that by its terms all employees are entitled to free quarters and to the other privileges.\n The force to be given to this claim depends primarily on the proper construction of section 2 of the Panama Canal Act of 1912, and that needs for its reasonable interpretation a short consideration of its legislative history.\n On June 28, 1902 (32 Stat. c. 1302, p. 481), Congress passed a law entitled 'An act to provide for the construction of a canal connecting the waters of the Atlantic \n\n[263 U.S. 39, 44]\n\u00a0\n and Pacific Oceans,' and known as the Spooner Act. It authorized the purchase of the rights of the New Panama Canal Company of France in the uncompleted canal and its holdings of the stock of the Panama Railroad Company and of the right of way from the government of Colombia and enabled and directed the President to build and complete the canal and for this purpose gave him authority to employ such persons as he might deem necessary and to fix their compensation. The act created a commission through whom the President was to do the work, and provided for the issue of bonds to pay for the purchase and construction provided in the act. Thereafter Panama revolted from Colombia and was recognized by the United States, and on February 26, 1904, made a treaty with the United States (33 Stat. p. 2234), granting a right of way and transferring perpetual control of the Canal Zone to the United States for the construction of the Canal, which the United States undertook to build and operate. By Act of April 28, 1904 (33 Stat. c. 1758, p. 429), Congress provided for the payments to be made under the treaty and the contract with the French Panama Canal Company, authorized the President, after such payments, to take possession of the territory conveyed by the treaty for canal purposes, and established the Zone conveyed as 'the Canal Zone.' Section 2 provided as follows:\n'That until the expiration of the Fifty-Eighth Congress, unless provision for the temporary government of the Canal Zone be sooner made by Congress, all the military, civil, and judicial powers as well as the power to make all rules and regulations necessary for the government of the Canal Zone and all the rights, powers, and authority granted by the terms of said treaty to the United States shall be vested in such person or persons and shall be exercised in such manner as the President shall direct for the government of said Zone and maintaining and protecting the inhabitants thereof in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property, and religion.'- \n\n[263 U.S. 39, 45]\n\u00a0\n\n\n Under this act, the President took possession of the Zone and directed that the Canal should be constructed and the Zone governed by him through the Panama Canal Commission under the supervision of the Secretary of War. Letter of President to Secretary of War, May 9, 1904; Executive Order relating to Panama Canal, p. 20; Executive Order dated November 17, 1906, Id. p. 55. A government was organized, a modus vivendi was agreed to with the government of Panama, and the construction of the Canal was carried on. A governor of the Canal was appointed, courts were established and complete rules and regulations having the force of law were duly adopted and enforced. Law and order were thus maintained, persons violating these regulations were prosecuted and convicted, and the construction of the Canal was much aided by the governmental control exercised by the same body that carried on the great work. A volume of Canal laws thus enacted and a volume of Executive Orders relating to the Canal were published by the Canal authorities.\n It will be noted that the second section of the Act of April 28, 1904, by which the President was authorized to establish a government in the Canal Zone and was given legislative power therein was expressly limited in its duration to the expiration of the Fifty-Eighth Congress which occurred on the 4th of March, 1905. On March 6, 1905, the Secretary of War telegraphed the Governor of the Canal Zone:\n'Government of the Canal Zone will be continued to be administered in obedience to the laws of the United States in force in that territory, the executive orders heretofore issued, and the laws of the Canal Zone enacted by the Isthmian Canal Commission during the period it was authorized under Act of Congress approved April 28, 1904, to exercise the power of legislation.' Treaties and Acts of Congress Relating to Panama Canal. Annotated, page 35, note.\n\n Between \n\n[263 U.S. 39, 46]\n\u00a0\n 1905 and 1912, when the Canal Act already cited was passed, there was no express legislation looking to the continuance of the powers of the President under the Act of April 28, 1904. The existence of the government of the Canal Zone after March 4, 1905, was, however, recognized in appropriations for the payment of its employees and other of its expenses for 1906 (34 Stat. 762), for 1907 (34 Stat. 1370), for 1908 (35 Stat. 386), for 1909 (35 Stat. 1026), for 1910 (36 Stat. 772), and for 1911 (36 Stat. 1450). On January 21, 1907, the Secretary of War asked the Attorney General whether the power of the President to make laws in the Zone, conferred in the Act of April 28, 1904, had ceased at the close of the Fifty-Eighth Congress, so that no further legislation could be adopted or existing legislation modified. The answer was that the provision in the law of 1904 was merely declaratory of what would have been the authority and duty of the President growing out of the treaty and the Spooner Act, even if the act of 1904 had not been enacted, that new legislation might be adopted by the President, and that Congress' acquiescence in, and approval of, the Government as carried on could be inferred from its appropriations to pay the Canal Government's expenses. Opinions of Attorneys General, vol. 26, p. 113. So the government of the Zone went on. Nevertheless its legality was from time to time questioned, and on March 19, 1908, the House of Representatives passed a resolution asking the President that it be informed by what authority of law he exercised the functions of government in the Panama Canal Zone since the expiration of the Fifty-Eighth Congress, 42 Congressional Record, 3592. This was answered by the President in a message of April 4, 1908 (42 Congressional Record, 4387), by stating the same grounds as those contained in the opinion of the Attorney General, already referred to. In his annual message of December 21, 1911 (Messages and Papers of the Presidents, vol. XVII, pp. 7681, 7687), \n\n[263 U.S. 39, 47]\n\u00a0\n the President, in announcing the probable completion of the Canal in 1913, said:\n'The fact is that to-day there is no statutory law by authority of which the President is maintaining the government of the Zone. Such authority was given in an amendment to the Spooner Act, which expired by the terms of its own limitation some years ago. Since that time the government has continued, under the advice of the Attorney General that in the absence of action by Congress, there is necessarily an implied authority on the part of the Executive to maintain a government in a territory in which he has to see that the laws are executed. The fact that we have been able thus to get along during the important days of construction without legislation expressly formulating the government of the Zone, or delegating the creation of it to the President, is not a reason for supposing that we may continue the same kind of government after the construction is finished. The implied authority of the President to maintain a civil government in the Zone may be derived from the mandatory direction given him in the original Spooner Act, by which he was commanded to build the Canal; but certainly, now that the Canal is about to be completed and to be put under a permanent management, there ought to be specific statutory authority for its regulation and control and for the government of the Zone, which we hold for the chief and main purpose of operating the Canal.'\n\n From this review of the history of the Canal Zone government, the purpose of Congress in enacting the second section of the Canal Act of 1912 must be apparent. There had been no lack of authority in the President after the Spooner Act to build the Canal and employ those who were to do the work. The defect was in the lack of definite authority to create a government, make laws and enforce them, and this had to be spelled out. Congress \n\n[263 U.S. 39, 48]\n\u00a0\n deemed it wise, therefore, as it certainly was, to ratify and confirm everything two Presidents had done in carrying on government and making and enforcing law in the Zone. It is in the light of this that the second section must be interpreted. The section confirms--\n'all laws, orders, regulations and ordinances adopted and promulgated in the Canal Zone by order of the President for the Government and sanitation of the Canal Zone and the construction of the Panama Canal.'\n\n This means laws needed and enacted to constitute the government, promote sanitation and generally aid the construction of the Canal. It was intended to ratify that as to the validity of which doubt had been expressed. It was only those regulations which rose to the dignity of laws which required ratification. To give the construction to section 2 contended for by appellants would lead to a most absurd result in view of its closing words which ratified and confirmed such laws, rules, regulations and ordinances 'as valid and binding until Congress shall otherwise provide.' This would be to put innumerable administrative orders and rules adopted in the work which were necessarily subject to change from time to time as conditions changed, and the work progressed, into a strait-jacket, entirely inconsistent with the broad authority of the President granted in the Spooner Act and renewed in section 4 of the same Canal Act of 1912 (Comp. St.  10040), as follows:\n'That when in the judgment of the President the construction of the Panama Canal shall be sufficiently advanced toward completion to render the further services of the Isthmian Canal Commission unnecessary the President is authorized by executive order to discontinue the Isthmian Canal Commission, which, together with the present organization, shall then cease to exist; and the President is authorized thereafter to complete, govern, and operate the Panama Canal and govern the Canal Zone, or cause them to be completed, governed, and operated, \n\n[263 U.S. 39, 49]\n\u00a0\n through a Governor of the Panama Canal and such other persons as he may deem competent to discharge the various duties connected with the completion, care, maintenance, sanitation, operation, government, and protection of the Canal and Canal Zone.'\n\n In 1914 the President discontinued the Commission, and appointed a Governor. On January 15, 1915, he issued an executive order announcing that the policy of furnishing quarters, fuel and electric current free to all employees was revocable, conferred no vested right upon employees and its future revocation would not be made the basis for increasing compensation. Ex Order No. 2118, Executive Orders Relating to Panama Canal, Annotated, p. 207. Certainly, after this, the appellant cannot claim that he and those on whose behalf he sues were misled into accepting employment on the faith of the maintenance of these privileges. Six years thereafter the President made the order here complained of, directing that the changes imposed therein upon employees should be deducted from their pay. The right to deduct from their pay debts owing to the government by Panama employees was expressly conferred by the eighth section of the Act of March 4, 1907 (34 Stat. c. 2918, p. 1371). The President's order was therefore valid in all respects.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the so-called regulation of 1907 in its form and language was only a declaration of revocable policy and on its face was not a rule capable of being stiffened into binding legislation under section 2 of the Canal Act. We have, however, preferred to put our conclusion on the broader ground that the subject-matter of the regulation was not covered by the section.\n The motion to dismiss was properly granted by the District Court, and its decree was properly affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","129":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCGREGOR v. HOGAN(1923)\nNo. 58\nArgued: October 9, 1923Decided: October 9, 1923\n\n\nDecided. Nov. 12, 1923.\n\n\n Mr. L. D. McGregor, of Warrenton, Ga., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. E. P. Davis, of Warrenton, Ga., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n McGregor, the plaintiff in error, filed a petition in a Superior Court of Georgia to enjoin the enforcement of \n\n[263 U.S. 234, 235]\n\u00a0\n an execution for taxes assessed against his property, alleging that the Tax Equalization Act (Georgia Laws 1913, p. 123) under which they had been assessed was in conflict with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. After a hearing on pleadings and proof judgment was entered denying the injunction. This was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State. 112 S. E. 471, 153 Ga. 473.\n McGregor's contention here, as it was in the State courts, is that by Section 6 of the Tax Equalization Act the assessment of taxes made by the Board of County Tax Assessors ex parte 'becomes final and conclusive against the taxpayer without any notice or an apportunity to be heard thereon,' thereby depriving him of his property without due process of law.\n This Act was before this Court in Turner v. Wade, \n254 U.S. 64\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 27. Section 61 requires the Board of County Tax Assessors to examine the returns of the taxpayers of the county; and if, in its opinion, any taxpayer has failed to return any of his property at a just and fair valuation, the Board shall correct such return and assess such valuation. The Board shall immediately give notice to any taxpayer of any change made in his return; and if any taxpayer is dissatisfied with its action he may, within a specified time, give notice to the Board that he demands an arbitration; giving the name of his arbitrator. The Board shall then name its arbitrator and these two shall select a third, a majority of whom shall fix the assessment on the property; and their decision shall be final. \n2\n The arbitrators shall take an official oath 'before entering upon a hearing'; and they shall render their decision \n\n[263 U.S. 234, 236]\n\u00a0\n within ten days from the naming of the arbitrator by the Board, else the decision of the Board shall stand affirmed and be bidnign in the premises.\n McGregor returned his property for taxation at the value of $12,500. The Board, without notice or hearing, raised this valuation to $23,256. It duly notified McGregor of such increase. He did not, however, demand an arbitration-being advised by his counsel, it is stated, that in Turner v. Wade, supra, this Court had held the arbitration clause of the Act to be unconstitutional. Thereafter, the time allowed by the Act in which he might demand an arbitration having expired, execution was issued for the taxes at the valuation assessed by the Board.\n The Act, it is true, as recognized by the Supreme Court of Georgia in the present case, does not require the Board of Assessors to give any notice to the taxpayer or grant him a hearing before assessing the value of the property. Turner v. Wade, supra, \n254 U.S. 70\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 27. It does not, however, make this assessment by the Board final and conclusive against the taxpayer. On the contrary, it requires notice to him of any change made from the valuation at which he returned his property, and gives him the right to a hearing before arbitrators, who, acting under oath, shall finally determine and fix the valuation at which the property is to be assessed. That the taxpayer's right to an arbitration includes the right to a hearing before the arbitrators, is not only apparent from the specific reference to 'a hearing,' but is the construction given by the Supreme Court of the State in Ogletree v. Woodward, 150 Ga. 696, 105 S. E. 243, and Wade v. Turner, 146 Ga. 600, 91 S. E. 690, and in the present case. This construction of the Act by the highest court of the State is to be accepted by this Court. Farncomb v. Denver, \n252 \nU.S. 7, 10\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 271. Furthermore, in Turner v. Wade, supra, \n254 U.S. 70\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 27, this Court reached independently the same conclusion and stated that in the event of dissatisfaction of the taxpayer 'the arbitration was to afford a hearing to him.' \n\n[263 U.S. 234, 237]\n\u00a0\n It is not essential to due process of law that the taxpayer be given notice and hearing before the value of his property is originally assessed; it being sufficient if he is granted the right to be heard on the assessment before the valuation is finally determined. Pittsburgh Railway v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 421, 426\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 1114. And see McMillen v. Anderson, \n95 U.S. 37\n, 42, and Turpin v. Lemon, \n187 \nU.S. 51, 58\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 20. The requirement of due process is that after such notice as may be appropriate the taxpayer have opportunity to be heard as to the amount of the tax by giving him the right to appear for that purpose at some stage of the proceedings before the tax becomes irrevocably fixed. Turner v. Wade, supra, \n254 U.S. 67\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 27. And see Londoner v. Denver, \n210 \nU.S. 373, 385\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 708\n\n\n And since this Act, although not providing for notice and hearing before the assessment by the Board of Assessors, grants the taxpayer after due notice the right to a hearing before arbitrators who shall finally assess and fix the valuation of his property, we find in its provisions no want of that notice and hearing which is essential to due process. The decision of this Court in Turner v. Wade, supra, upon which McGregor relies, is not in conflict with this conclusion. There was not in that case any holding that Section 6 of the Act was unconstitutional on its face for want of necessary provisions for notice and hearing-the right to notice of the assessment and hearing before the arbitrators being specifically recognized-but merely a holding (\n254 U.S. 70\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 27) that, since the arbitration had failed because the arbitrators could not agree upon the valuation and no majority award had been made within the specified ten-day period, and the Act had been construed and applied by the Supreme Court of the State as making the original assessment by the Board of Assessors final in such situation, the taxpayer had thus become subject to the assessment made by the Board of Assessors without notice and hearing, without the revisory action by the arbitrators \n\n[263 U.S. 234, 238]\n\u00a0\n provided by the Act, and had, on these facts, and under such construction and application of the Act, been denied the due process of law.\n In short, it was not held that either Section 6 of the Act or the arbitration provisions thereof were in and of themselves unconstitutional, but merely, in effect, that when the arbitration demanded by the taxpayer became inoperative through no default on his part, he could not in consequence by lawfully subjected to the previous assessment made without notice and hearing. Manifestly this decision has no application to the present case, where the provisions for arbitration did not thus become inoperative, but McGregor declined to avail himself of the arbitration to which the Act entitled him, and the assessment that had been made by the Board of Assessors was thus rendered final and conclusive not by the force of the Act itself but by his own deliberate default.\n Having thus failed to avail himself of the hearing granted by the Act he was properly held by the Supreme Court of Georgia to have no just ground of complaint. Where a city charter gives property owners an opportunity to be heard before a board of assessors with respect to the justice and validity of local assessments for proposed public improvements and empowers the board to determine termine such complaints before the assessments are made, parties who do not avail themselves of such opportunity cannot thereafter be heard to complain of such assessments as unconstitutional.

STATE OF NEBRASKA(1923)\nNo. 325\nArgued: February 23, 1923Decided: June 4, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 390, 391]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. F. Mullen, of Omaha, Neb., C. E. Sandall, of York, Neb., and I. L. Albert, of Columbus, Neb., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[262 U.S. 390, 393]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Mason Wheeler, of Lincoln, Neb., and O. S. Spillman, of Pierce, Neb., for the State of Nebraska.\n\n\n[262 U.S. 390, 396]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error was tried and convicted in the district court for Hamilton county, Nebraska, under an information which charged that on May 25, 1920, while an instructor in Zion Parochial School he unlawfully taught the subject of reading in the German language to Raymond Parpart, a child of 10 years, who had not attained \n\n[262 U.S. 390, 397]\n\u00a0\n and successfully passed the eighth grade. The information is based upon 'An act relating to the teaching of foreign languages in the state of Nebraska,' approved April 9, 1919 (Laws 1919, c. 249), which follows:\n'Section 1. No person, individually or as a teacher, shall, in any private, denominational, parochial or public school, teach any subject to any person in any language than the English language.\n\n'Sec. 2. Languages, other than the English language, may be taught as languages only after a pupil shall have attained and successfully passed the eighth grade as evidenced by a certificate of graduation issued by the county superintendent of the county in which the child resides.\n\n'Sec. 3. Any person who violates any of the provisions of this act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction, shall be subject to a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars ($25), nor more than one hundred dollars ($100), or be confined in the county jail for any period not exceeding thirty days for each offense.\n\n'Sec. 4. Whereas, an emergency exists, this act shall be in force from and after its passage and approval.'\n\n The Supreme Court of the state affirmed the judgment of conviction. 107 Neb. 657, 187 N. W. 100. It declared the offense charged and established was 'the direct and intentional teaching of the German language as a distinct subject to a child who had not passed the eighth grade,' in the parochial school maintained by Zion Evangelical Lutheran Congre ation, a collection of Biblical stories being used therefore. And it held that the statute forbidding this did not conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, but was a valid exercise of the police power. The following excerpts from the opinion sufficiently indicate the reasons advanced to support the conclusion:\n'The salutary purpose of the statute is clear. The Legislature had seen the baneful effects of permitting for \n\n[262 U.S. 390, 398]\n\u00a0\n eigners, who had taken residence in this country, to rear and educate their children in the language of their native land. The result of that condition was found to be inimical to our own safety. To allow the children of foreigners, who had emigrated here, to be taught from early childhood the language of the country of their parents was to rear them with that language as their mother tongue. It was to educate them so that they must always think in that language, and, as a consequence, naturally inculcate in them the ideas and sentiments foreign to the best interests of this country. The statute, therefore, was intended not only to require that the education of all children be conducted in the English language, but that, until they had grown into that language and until it had become a part of them, they should not in the schools be taught any other language. The obvious purpose of this statute was that the English language should be and become the mother tongue of all children reared in this state. The enactment of such a statute comes reasonably within the police power of the state. Pohl v. State, 102 Ohio St. 474, 132 N. E. 20; State v. Bartels, 191 Iowa, 1060, 181 N. W. 508.\n\n'It is suggested that the law is an unwarranted restriction, in that it applies to all citizens of the state and arbitrarily interferes with the rights of citizens who are not of foreign ancestry, and prevents them, without reason, from having their children taught foreign languages in school. That argument is not well taken, for it assumes that every citizen finds himself restrained by the statute. The hours which a child is able to devote to study in the confinement of school are limited. It must have ample time for exercise or play. Its daily capacity for learning is comparatively small. A selection of subjects for its education, therefore, from among the many that might be taught, is obviously necessary. The Legislature no doubt had in mind the practical operation of the law. The law affects few citizens, except those of foreign lineage. \n\n[262 U.S. 390, 399]\n\u00a0\n Other citizens, in their selection of studies, except perhaps in rare instances, have never deemed it of importance to teach their children foreign languages before such children have reached the eighth grade. In the legislative mind, the salutary effect of the statute no doubt outweighed the restriction upon the citizens generally, which, it appears, was a restriction of no real consequence.'\n\n The problem for our determination is whether the statute as construed and applied unreasonably infringes the liberty guaranteed to the plaintiff in error by the Fourteenth Amendment:\n'No state ... shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.'\n\n While this court has not attempted to define with exactness the liberty thus guaranteed, the term has received much consideration and some of the included things have been definitely stated. Without doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.

The established doctrine is that this liberty may not be interfered \n\n[262 U.S. 390, 400]\n\u00a0\n with, under the guise of protecting the public interest, by legislative action which is arbitrary or without reasonable relation to some purpose within the competency of the state to effect. Determination by the Legislature of what constitutes proper exercise of police power is not final or conclusive but is subject to supervision by the courts. Lawton v. Steele, \n152 \nU.S. 133, 137\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 499.\n The American people have always regarded education and acquisition of knowledge as matters of supreme importance which should be diligently promoted. The Ordinance of 1787 declares:\n'Religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.'\n\n Corresponding to the right of control, it is the natural duty of the parent to give his children education suitable to their station in life; and nearly all the states, including Nebraska, enforce this obligation by compulsory laws.\n Practically, education of the young is only possible in schools conducted by especially qualified persons who devote themselves thereto. The calling always has been regarded as useful and honorable, essential, indeed, to the public welfare. Mere knowledge of the German language cannot reasonably be regarded as harmful. Heretofore it has been commonly looked upon as helpful and desirable. Plaintiff in error taught this language in school as part of his occupation. His right thus to teach and the right of parents to engage him so to instruct their children, we think, are within the liberty of the amendment.\n The challenged statute forbids the teaching in school of any subject except in English; also the teaching of any other language until the pupil has attained and successfully passed the eighth grade, which is not usually accomplished before the age of twelve. The Supreme Court of the state has held that 'the so-called ancient or dead languages' are not 'within the spirit or the purpose of \n\n[262 U.S. 390, 401]\n\u00a0\n the act.' Nebraska District of Evangelical Lutheran Synod, etc., v. McKelvie et al. (Neb.) 187 N. W. 927 (April 19, 1922). Latin, Greek, Hebrew are not proscribed; but German, French, Spanish, Italian, and every other alien speech are within the ban. Evidently the Legislature has attempted materially to interfere with the calling of modern language teachers, with the opportunities of pupils to acquire knowledge, and with the power of parents to control the education of their own.\n It is said the purpose of the legislation was to promote civic development by inhibiting training and education of the immature in foreign tongues and ideals before they could learn English and acquire American ideals, and 'that the English language should be and become the mother tongue of all children reared in this state.' It is also affirmed that the foreign born population is very large, that certain communities commonly use foreign words, follow foreign leaders, move in a foreign atmosphere, and that the children are thereb hindered from becoming citizens of the most useful type and the public safety is imperiled.\n That the state may do much, go very far, indeed, in order to imporve the quality of its citizens, physically, mentally and morally, is clear; but the individual has certain fundamental rights which must be respected. The protection of the Constitution extends to all, to those who speak other languages as well as to those born with English on the tongue. Perhaps it would be highly advantageous if all had ready understanding of our ordinary speech, but this cannot be coerced by methods which conflict with the Constitution-a desirable and cannot be promoted by prohibited means.\n For the welfare of his Ideal Commonwealth, Plato suggested a law which should provide:\n'That the wives of our guardians are to be common, and their children are to be common, and no parent is to know his own child, \n\n[262 U.S. 390, 402]\n\u00a0\n nor any child his parent. ... The proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to the pen or fold, and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who dwell in a separate quarter; but the offspring of the inferior, or of the better when they chance to be deformed, will be put away in some mysterious, unknown place, as they should be.'\n\n In order to submerge the individual and develop ideal citizens, Sparta assembled the males at seven into barracks and intrusted their subsequent education and training to official guardians. Although such measures have been deliberately approved by men of great genius their ideas touching the relation between individual and state were wholly different from those upon which our institutions rest; and it hardly will be affirmed that any Legislature could impose such restrictions upon the people of a state without doing violence to both letter and spirit of the Constitution.\n The desire of the Legislature to foster a homogeneous people with American ideals prepared readily to understand current discussions of civic matters is easy to appreciate. Unfortunate experiences during the late war and aversion toward every character of truculent adversaries were certainly enough to quicken that aspiration. But the means adopted, we think, exceed the limitations upon the power of the state and conflict with rights assured to plaintiff in error. The interference is plain enough and no adequate reason therefor in time of peace and domestic tranquility has been shown.\n The power of the state to compel attendance at some school and to make reasonable regulations for all schools, including a requirement that they shall give instructions in English, is not questioned. Nor has challenge been made of the state's power to prescribe a curriculum for institutions which it supports. Those matters are not within the present controversy. Our concern is with the prohibition approved by the Supreme Court. Adams v. \n\n[262 U.S. 390, 403]\n\u00a0\n Tanner, \n244 U.S. 594\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 662, L. R. A. 1917F, 1163, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 973, pointed out that mere abuse incident to an occupation ordinarily useful is not enough to justify its abolition, although regulation may be entirely proper. No emergency has arisen which renders knowledge by a child of some language other than English so clearly harmful as to justify its inhibition with the consequent infringement of rights long freely enjoyed. We are constrained to conclude that the statute as applied is arbitrary and without reasonable relation to any end within the competency of the state.\n As the statute undertakes to interfere only with teaching which involves a modern language, leaving complete freedom as to other matters, there seems no adequate foundation for the suggestion that the purpose was to protect the child's health by limiting his mental activities. It is well known that proficiency in a foreign language seldom comes to one not instructed at an early age, and experience shows that this is not injurious to the health, morals or understanding of the ordinary child.\n The judgment of the court belo must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice Sutherland, dissent. \n\n\n\n","131":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMILHEIM v. MOFFAT TUNNEL IMPROVEMENT DIST.(1923)\nNo. 791\nArgued: Decided: June 11, 1923\n\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 710, 711]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edwin H. Park and Barnwell S. Stuart, both of Denver, Colo., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Norton Montgomery, of Denver, Colo., for defendants in error. \n\n[262 U.S. 710, 712]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The defendants in error move to dismiss the writ of error or affirm the judgment.\n This is a suit challenging the constitutionality of an act of the State of Colorado creating a tunnel improvement district (Sess. Laws Ex. Sess. 1922, c. 2, p. 88), and the proceedings thereunder.\n This Act, which is known as the Moffat Tunnel Act, declares that to provide an avenue of communication by a transportation tunnel through the Continental Divide at or near James Peak will reduce the barrier to commercial intercourse between the eastern and western portions of the State, facilitate communication in all seasons, and promote the health, comfort, safety, convenience and welfare of the people of the State, and will be of especial benefit to the property in certain designated boundaries within which such tunnel is to be located. To that end it creates 'The Moffat Tunnel Improvement District,' a body corporate, comprising all of the territory thus designated, and being all or portions of nine counties east and west of the Divide, extending between and including the City and County of Denver on the east and Routt County in the northwestern corner of the State, a total distance of about two hundred and fifty miles. The District is to be managed by a Board, called the 'Moffat Tunnel Commission,' hich is required to construct such a tunnel through the Divide, with its equipment and approaches, at about 9, 200 feet above sea level, in such manner that it may be used for standard gauge railroads, telegraph and telephone lines, the transmission of power, and the transportation of water, automobiles and other vehicles.\n The Commission is authorized to issue District bonds to the amount of $ 6,720,000 to pay for the cost of the tunnel, expenses, and interest on the bonds during its construction; to maintain the tunnel; and to contract \n\n[262 U.S. 710, 713]\n\u00a0\n with persons and corporations for its use for the specified purposes, without monopoly by any use, person or corporation, until its capacity has been reached, at annual rentals apportioned to the respective values of the separate uses, and constituting a fair and just proportion of the total amount required to pay interest on the bonds, provide for their retirement and maintain the tunnel; prior users to be reimbursed by subsequent users in an equitable proportion of the amount previously paid for retirement of the bonds and interest.\n The Commission is authorized to levy special assessments upon all real estate within the District-except governmental property which is exempted-for the purpose provided in the Act, such special assessments to be made in proportion to the benefits to each piece of real estate accruing by reason of the improvements and in accordance with the rules of apportionment adopted by the Commission. It may at any time appraise the benefits which will result to such several parcels of real estate from the organization of the District and the construction of the tunnel, and, after such appraisal of benefits, levy special assessments, to the extent of such benefits upon all such real estate; and may for such purposes adopt rules providing, inter alia, for notice and hearing to all owners affected thereby. And if the revenues from the tunnel are not sufficient to pay interest due on the bonds in any year, provide for their retirement, pay expenses and maintain the tunnel, in order to prevent the occurrence of a deficit, the Commission is required to levy special assessments sufficient in amount, annually if necessary, upon all such real estate, in the manner provided.\n It is expressly declared that the special benefits accruing to the assessable real estate within the District are in excess of the cost of the improvements and of the assessments provided for against such real estate. \n\n[262 U.S. 710, 714]\n\u00a0\n In each year in which an assessment is made the Commission is required to appoint a time and place at which it will hear objections to the assessments, giving prior notice thereof by publication in two issues a week apart in a newspaper of general circulation published in each county. Any real estate owner claiming that his property has been assessed too highly, erroneously or illegally, may before such hearing file written objections to such assessment. At the hearing the Commission shall hear such evidence as may be offered concerning the correctness or legality of such assessments, and may modify or amend the same. Any property owner may appeal from the finding of the Commission as to such assessments to the District Court of the County; but the court shall not disturb the findings of the Commission unless manifestly disproportionate to the assessments imposed upon other property in the District. The findings of the Commission if not appealed from, or the findings of the District Court in case of an appeal, shall be final and conclusive evidence that such assessments have been made in proportion to the benefits conferred upon each tract of real estate by reason of the improvements, and constitute a lien thereon until paid.\n The Commission, having been duly organized under the Act, fixed the definite location of the tunnel, adopted preliminary plans for its construction in such manner as to provide for the various specified uses, estimated its cost, and resolved to issue District bonds in the authorized amount to pay for its construction. Aft r making an investigation and examination of the real estate in the District, and taking the testimony of a great many witnesses from all parts of the District, engaged in various kinds of business, it determined the aggregate value of the real estate within the District subject to assessment to be $298,544,966-mainly in accordance with the assessed valuations for taxes-and further determined, subject \n\n[262 U.S. 710, 715]\n\u00a0\n to correction and confirmation after hearing the property owners affected, that the value of each parcel of such real estate would by reason of the organization of the District and the construction of the tunnel be increased at least to the extent of fifteen per cent. And it thereupon appraised the benefits to the several parcels of such real estate at such percentage of their value, as the basis of special assessments to be thereafter made under the provisions of the Act. It also fixed a time and place at which it would hear objections filed by any property owner to the appraisal of benefits thus made, upon evidence and argument, before confirmation thereof, and gave public notice of such hearing by publication in the manner specified in the Act. This notice recited the proceedings which the Commission had taken, including the appraisal of benefits which it had made as the basis for special assessments, and stated that any appraisal of benefits found upon such hearing to be incorrect or inequitable, would be modified or amended, and that, after making all proper corrections, the appraisals would be confirmed.\n Thereupon, before the date set for such hearing, two of the plaintiffs in error, owning lands within the District, without filing with the Commission any objections to the appraisal of benefits, filed their complaint in a District Court of the State, in behalf of themselves and all similar landowners, against the Improvement District and the Tunnel Commission; alleging, inter alia, that the tunnel was not intended as a public highway for the use of the general public, but for the benefit of the Denver & Salt Lake Railroad, commonly known as the Moffat Road; that the benefits to their real estate and the other real estate in the District had been arbitrarily appraised and that no special benefits would accrue to their property or other property similarly situated; that the Act and the proceedings taken and threatened by the Commission- \n\n[262 U.S. 710, 716]\n\u00a0\n thereunder violated various provisions of the State Constitution and would deprive them of their property without due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; and praying that the defendants be enjoined from proceeding with the enforcement of the Act and that all the proceedings of the Commission be declared null and void. The defendants in their answers denied these allegations. The other plaintiffs in error, also owning lands within the District, who likewise had filed no objections with the Commission, subsequently intervened as plaintiffs in the action.\n The case was heard by the District Court upon the pleadings and proof. The issues, both of fact and law, including those relating to the appraisal of benefits, were found for the defendants; and the complaint was accordingly dismissed.\n Upon writ of error taken, the Supreme Court of Colorado sustained the District Court in all respects and affirmed its judgment. 211 Pac. 649.\n The landowners urge here, as grounds of error, in substance, that the Act and the proceedings taken and permitted thereunder violate the Fourteenth Amendment in that: (a) The purpose of the Act is not public in the sense warranting the exercise of the power of taxation, but is essentially private; (b) the Act authorizes the imposition of the entire taxes upon the lands within the District, without regard to their relation to the tunnel or the benefit to be derived from it, and, there being no special benefits to such lands justifying such taxation, such classification is entirely arbitrary; and (c) the Commission has arbitrarily and unreasonably adopted an ad valorem basis for the appraisal and apportionment of benefits to the several parcels of land within the District, without reference to the actual benefits to each.\n The federal question presented, being one which requires analysis and exposition for its decision, is not frivolous; \n\n[262 U.S. 710, 717]\n\u00a0\n and the motion to dismiss the writ of error is accordingly denied. Louisville Railroad v. Melton, \n218 \nU.S. 36, 39\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 676, 47 L. R. A. (N.

Rule 6,  5 (32 Sup. Ct. vi) Hodges v. Snyder (April 9, 1923) \n261 U.S. 600\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 435, 67 L. Ed . --, and cases therein cited.\n\n 1. \nPublic Purpose. The nature of a use, whether public or private, is ultimately a judicial question. However, the determination of this question is influenced by local conditions; and this court, while enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment, should keep in view the diversity of such conditions and regard with great respect the judgments of state courts upon what should be deemed public uses in any state. Rindge Co. v. County of Los Angeles, \n262 U.S. 700\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 689, 67 L. Ed. --, decided to-day, and cases therein cited. And like respect should be accorded to the declarations of the legislative body of the State. Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley, \n164 \nU.S. 112, 160\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 56. Here the legislature, familiar with the local conditions, has declared that the construction of the tunnel will benefit the people of the State; and both the local court of the State and its Supreme Court have held its construction to be for a public purpose.\n It is urged by the landowners that the tunnel, considered as an isolated transportation unit, will serve no useful public purpose. This is obvious, but not to the point. It is intended to furnish an avenue or highway which shall be leased to public transportation agencies. A structure intended for such use is unquestionably a public improvement for a public use. Thus subway tunnels constructed by municipalities for lease to street railway and rapid transit lines for use as common carriers are public improvements for public purposes, for which the power of taxation may be exercised. Sun Printing Co. v. City of New York, 152 N. Y. 257, 265, 46 N. E. 499, 37 L. R. A. 788; Prince v. \n\n[262 U.S. 710, 718]\n\u00a0\n Crocker, 166 Mass. 347, 361, 44 N. E. 446, 32 L. R. A. 610; Browne v. Turner, 176 Mass. 9, 12, 56 N. E. 969; Larsen v. San Francisco, 182 Cal. 1, 9, 186 Pac. 757. And see, by analogy, as to ship canals, Cook v. Port of Portland, 20 Or. 580, 27 Pac. 263, 13 L. R. A. 533.\n They, however, contend that the tunnel must be deemed for a private, rather than a public purpose, because it is located so as to be practically a part of the line of the Moffat Road, and is intended for its use, the real object of the Act being, as expressed by the Governor, to save this railroad to the people of the State. \n1\n There is virtually no denial of this; and evidently this was the motive which led to the passage of the Act and is the primary purpose for which the tunnel is to be constructed. This, however, is not a private purpose. The use of the tunnel by the Moffat Road will be for a beneficial public purpose. This railroad runs from Denver, on the east of the Continental Divide, to Routt County in the northwestern corner of the State, a distance of 255 miles. It crosses the Divide by a circuitous route above this tunnel, with steep grades and heavy curves. In the winter seasons this portion of its line is almost impassable. Its operations result in heavy losses, and it is now in an embarrassed financial condition and unable to build the tunnel. Without the use of the tunnel, the railroad must, it seems, be abandoned; and this avenue of communication between different portions of the State will be lost. The use of the tunnel will reduce the elevation, grades and curvature of the railroad, shorten its line about \n\n[262 U.S. 710, 719]\n\u00a0\n 23 miles, and save it large amou ts annually. Evidently the preservation of this railroad, a common carrier of persons and property, as a means of communication between the eastern and northwestern portions of the State, is a matter of great public importance; and a tunnel enabling it to provide quicker and cheaper transportation during all seasons of the year will greatly promote the public welfare.\n Even if this Act specifically directed that the tunnel be leased to the Moffat Road for railroad purposes (a just rental based on the cost of constructing and maintaining the tunnel being provided), as the tunnel would be operated by the railroad as a public highway for the carriage of passengers and freight, it would be a public improvement for a public use. The test of the public character of an improvement is the use to which it is to be put, not the person by whom it is to be operated. See Mt. Vernon Cotton Co. v. Power Co., \n240 \nU.S. 30, 32\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 234. A subway tunnel constructed by a city under an act authorizing its construction for the specific purpose of being leased to a designated rapid transit company, is a lawful public improvement for a public use. Browne v. Turner, supra, 176 Mass. 12, 13, 56 N. E. 969. As a railroad is a highway for public use, although owned by a private corporation, a state may impose or authorize a tax in aid of its construction and in furtherance of such public use. Olcott v. Supervisors, 16 Wall. 678, 695, 696; Township of Pine Grove v. Talcott, 19 Wall. 666, 676, 678; Wisconsin Railroad v. Jacobson, \n179 \nU.S. 287, 297\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 115; Donovan v. Pennsylvania Co., \n199 \nU.S. 279, 292\n, 293 S., 26 Sup. Ct. 91.\n'Whether the use of a railroad is a public or a private one depends in no measure upon the question who constructed it or who owns it . ... No matter who is the agent, the function performed is that of the State. Though the ownership is private the use is public. ... If there be any purpose for which taxation would \n\n[262 U.S. 710, 720]\n\u00a0\n seem to be legitimate it is the making and maintenance of highways. They have always been governmental affairs, and it has ever been recognized as one of the most important duties of the State to provide and care for them. ... When, therefore, it is settled that a railroad is a highway for public uses, there can be no substantial reason why the power of the State to tax may not be exerted in its behalf.' Olcott v. Supervisors, 16 Wall. 695, 696 (21 L. Ed. 382).\n\n'Though the corporation was private, its work was public, as much so as if it were to be constructed by the State.' Township of Pine Grove v. Talcott, 19 Wall. 676.\n\n The use of a spur track is none the less public because it is located to reach a private industry whose proprietors contribute to the cost. Hairston v. Danville Railway, \n208 \nU.S. 598, 608\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 331, 13 Ann. Cas. 1008. So here, although this tunnel be designed for lease to the Moffat Road, it will be a highway for public uses, as much so as if it were operated by the State, and a public improvement for public purposes.\n Furthermore, while the saving of the Moffat Road to the people of the State seems to have been the prime motive which induced the passage of the Act, it specifically provides for the use of the tunnel by any and all railroads and other public utilities, to the extent of its capacity, each paying an annual rental apportioned to the respective values of the separate uses, and constituting a fair and just proportion of the total amount required to pay interest on the bonds, provide for their retirement and maintain the tunnel. And the evidence strongly indicates that the tunnel may and will be used, to like advantage, by the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad, extending from Denver to Salt Lake City, with a great shortening and improvement of its line. It will also serve as a means of transporting water from the Fraser River on the west of the Divide to the City of Denver, for telegraph and telephone lines and the transmi sion of power; and for the transportation of automobiles and vehicles, \n\n[262 U.S. 710, 721]\n\u00a0\n which are now unable to cross the Divide during several months of the year. These are all public purposes of much importance.\n We conclude that the purpose for whihc the tunnel is to be constructed is not private, but public, and such as warrants the exercise by the State of the power of taxation.\n\n 2. \nClassification as to Special Benefits. It is contended that no special benefits of a direct and immediate character will accrue from the tunnel to the lands lying within the District, as distinguished from the other lands in the State, and that hence the classification made by the Act in providing for the assessments solely upon the lands within the District, is entirely unreasonable and arbitrary. It is well settled, however, that if a proposed improvement is one which the State has authority to make and pay for by assessments on property benefited, the legislature in the exercise of the taxing power has authority to determine by the statute imposing the tax, what lands may be and are in fact benefited by the improvement; and if it does so, its determination is conclusive upon the owners and the courts and cannot be assailed under the Fourteenth Amendment unless it is wholly unwarranted and a flagrant abuse, and by reason of its arbitrary character is mere confiscation of the particular property. Spencer v. Nerchant, \n125 \nU.S. 345, 356\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 921; Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley, supra, \n164 U.S. 174\n. 17 Sup. Ct. 56 (41 L. Ed. 369); Wagner v. Baltimore, \n239 \nU.S. 207, 218\n, 220 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 66; Houck v. Drainage District, \n239 \nU.S. 254, 262\n, 265 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 58; Branson v. Bush, \n251 \nU.S. 182, 190\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 113.\n The legislature not only provided for the assessment of the lands within the District, but specifically declared that the tunnel would be of especial benefit to such lands and that the special benefits accruing to them are in excess of the cost of the tunnel and of the assessments provided for against them. \n\n[262 U.S. 710, 722]\n\u00a0\n The District consists of the City and County of Denver on the east; a strip of land from six to eight miles in width extending through four counties on both sides of the Moffat Road to the crest of the Divide; and three entire counties and a portion of another county, which are traversed and reached by the Moffat Road and extend to the northwestern corner of the State. In short, the District includes the lands contiguous to the Moffat Road. The lands lying in the strip extending from Denver to the Divide are mainly agricultural lands; those lying to the west of the Divide, while largely devoted to stock raising, have valuable timber, and the two counties lying farthest to the northwest have valuable coal deposits. The testimony in the trial court fairly indicates that the lands within this District, on both sides of the Divide, including those owned by the plaintiffs in error, will, generally speaking, by reason of their proximity to the Moffat Road and the increased facilities of transportation across the Divide by which the western counties may be able to market their products to the east and the eastern counties obtain an outlet to the northwest, receive special benefits from the operation of the tunnel, of a reasonably direct and immediate character, resulting in increased value of the lands, in excess of those received by other lands in the State, and that the legislative classification is, on the whole, substantially just and reasonable.\n The legislature declared that there will be such special benefits. The trial court, familiar with local conditions, after hearing evidence on this question, found that there would be such special benefits and sustained the legislative classification; and the Supreme Court of the State has affirmed its action. To the extent that there may be inequalities in the benefits received by the several parcels of land within the District, they are to be apportioned by the Commission in the mann r provided by the Act, with a right of appeal to the local courts for the correction of errors in such apportionments. \n\n[262 U.S. 710, 723]\n\u00a0\n And certainly, under all the circumstances, and regarding the District as a whole, the evidence does not justify us in setting aside the conclusion reached by the trial court upon the weight of the evidence, or in characterizing the action of the legislature in creating this separate District upon which the assessments should be made, as arbitrary, capricious or confiscatory. The legislative determination and classification must, accordingly, be upheld.\n\n 3. \nAppraisal of Benefits. It is contended that the Commission arbitrarily adopted an ad valorem basis of appraisal for the apportionment of benefits to the several parcels of land within the District, without reference to the actual benefits to each. This argument erroneously assumes that the Commission had finally adopted such an ad valorem basis for its appraisal. This is not the case. It had merely adopted a tentative ad valorem basis, subject to modification and corrections, before final confirmation, after the hearing of objections filed by landowners; of which public notice was given. These landowners did not seek to have the Commission modify or correct this tentative basis of apportionment or file any objections to the appraisal of benefits to their properties. Presumably if the tentative appraisal was made on an erroneous basis it would have been modified upon a proper showing. Having failed to object to the tentative ad valorem basis adopted by the Commission or to appear before it for the purpose of obtaining modifications or corrections as to their lands before the final adoption of such basis, they have here no sufficient ground of complaint. Where a city charter gives property owners an opportunity to be heard before a board respecting the justice and validity of local assessments for proposed public improvements and empowers the board to determine such complaints before the assessments are made, parties who do not avail themselves of such opportunity cannot be heard to complain \n\n[262 U.S. 710, 724]\n\u00a0\n of such assessments as unconstitutional. Farncomb v. Denver, \n252 \nU.S. 7, 11\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 271.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Colorado was plainly right; and as the questions presented do not require further argument, the alternative motion of the defendants in error is granted, and the judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Governor, in his message to the special session of the legislature which passed this Act, in stating the two matters for which he had called the session, said: 'Conditions have arisen which threaten the complete abandonment of a transportation line upon which several counties of the State depend, and your immediate action authorizing the issuance of bonds for the construction of a tunnel through the mountain range is necessary if the Moffat railroad is to be saved to the people of this State.' \n\n\n\n\n","132":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMINNESOTA COMMERCIAL MEN'S ASS'N v.

Tenner, of Minneapolis, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner is a mutual assessment, accident, and health insurance company, incorporated under the laws of Minnesota, with many members scattered throughout the Union. It issued a certificate of membership to Robert J. Benn, of Montana. He died in 1915, and his executrix-respondent here-instituted an action against the association in a Montana court to recover the sum said to be due under the rules. After service of summons and complaint upon the secretary of state and the insurance commissioner, judgment was entered by default. Thereafter she brought an action in Minnesota upon the judgment and prevailed both in the trial and Supreme Court. Benn v. Minnesota Commercial Men's Ass'n, 149 Minn. 497, 182 N. W. 999.\n Defending, the association claimed that it had never done business in Montana or consented to service of process there; that the insurance contract was executed and to be performed in Minnesota; that the Montana \n\n[261 U.S. 140, 142]\n\u00a0\n court was without jurisdiction, the judgment void, and enforcement thereof would deprive petitioner of property without due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The decision here must turn upon the effect of the process served on the secretary of state in Montana. Did the court there acquire jurisdiction to enter judgment?\n The Supreme Court of Minnesota followed Wold v. Minnesota Commercial Men's Association (1917) 136 Minn. 380, 162 N. W. 461, wherein the opinion referred to Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co v. Sprately, \n172 U.S. 602\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 308, and Commercial Mutual Accident Co. v. Davis, \n213 U.S. 245\n, 29 Sup.

And if none of the persons above named can be found in the state of Montana, and an affidavit stating that fact shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the court in which such action is pending, then the clerk of the court shall make an order authorizing the service of summons to be made upon the secretary of state, who shall be and is hereby constituted an agent and attorney in fact to accept service on behalf of such corporation, and service upon said secretary of state shall be deemed personal service upon said corporation.'\n\n Petitioner has never maintained any office except in Minneapolis, Minn.; its business is transacted there; it has never owned property or sought permission to do business in any other state. \n\n[261 U.S. 140, 143]\n\u00a0\n Applications for membership are presented on printed forms, usually by mail. The bylaws provide that no person can secure membership until the board of directors has accepted his application at the home office and certificate has issued. Such certificates are mailed as directed by the applicants.\n Assessments and dues are payable at the Minneapolis office and notices in respect of them are mailed to members at their last known addresses.\n New members are procured by advertisement and through the solicitation of older ones. The latter are urged to furnish lists of prospects and to use their influence to increase the membership; but no member has authority to bind the association. Although not essential, applications frequently bear a member's recommendation. Soliciting members receive no compensation except occasional premiums or prizes. No paid solicitors or agents are employed.\n Losses are settled by checks on Minneapolis banks mailed from the home office. Proofs of loss must be made on the forms provided. In case the attending physician's certificate is inadequate, the association procures additional information through some local physician, but no resident physicians are employed outside of Minnesota. The right to make further investigation is reserved; but there is no evidence to show anything has been done under this reservation in the present case. Losses are adjusted by the directors in Minneapolis.\n The association accepted Robert J. Benn's application for health insurance, solicited and recommended by Harry K. Hartness, a member, November 6, 1908, and a further application for additional protection May 3, 1911. These were sent by mail from Kalispel, Mont., where both individuals resided. Notices were regularly mailed to Benn at his home address, and he paid dues and assessments in the ordinary course. It does not appear that there was anything \n\n[261 U.S. 140, 144]\n\u00a0\n unusual or irregular in the proofs of death or the report of attending physician. Without further investigation and upon unsolicited information received through the mail, the association declined to pay.\n Respondent claims that the facts show petitioner was doing business in Montana and the insurance contract was made and payable there. And it is said this contention is supported by Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Spratley, supra, and Penn Lumbermen's Insurance Co. v. Meyer, \n197 U.S. 407\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 483.\n Considering all the circumstances, it seems sufficiently clear that the agreement incident to membership is a Minnesota contract, there made and to be performed.\n The Montana court was without jurisdiction unless petitioner by doing business in the state impliedly assented that process might be served upon the secretary of state as its agent.\n'If an insurance corporation of another state transacts business in Pennsylvania without complying with its provisions it will be deemed to have assented to any valid terms prescribed by that commonwealth as a condition of its right to do business there; and it will be estopped to say that it had not done what it should have done in order that it might lawfully corporate powers.'

Ed. 345).\n\n The circumstances chiefly relied on to show that petitioner was doing business in Montana are these: The insured was asked to send in his application, upon a form furnished by the association, by Hartness, one of its members and a resident of Montana, who with other members had been requested to procure such applications. The form was filled and signed in Montana and then sent to Minneapolis with the requisite fee. It was accepted and certificate of membership mailed to the applicant. After customary notices from the association, with which blank applications for new members were commonly enclosed, \n\n[261 U.S. 140, 145]\n\u00a0\n the insured sent dues and assessments from his home in Montana to Minneapolis by mail and received receipts-all according to the usual method. Other members of the association resided at Kalispel. The association reserved the right to investigate all claims for sickness, accident or death.\n Considering what this court held in Green v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Ry., \n205 U.S. 531\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 595; Philadelphia & Reading Ry. v. McKibbin, \n243 U.S. 264\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 280; People's Tobacco Co. v.

Ed. --, we think it cannot be said that the association was doing business in Montana merely because one or more members, without authority to obligate it, solicited new members. That is not enough--\n'to warrant the inference that the corporation has subjected itself to the local jurisdiction, and is by its duly authorized officers or agents present within the state or district where service is attempted.' People's Tobacco Co. v. American Tobacco Co., supra, \n246 U.S. 87\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 235, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 537.\n\n It also seems sufficiently clear from Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 U.S. 578\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 427; Hunter v. Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Co., supra, and Provident Savings Society v. Kentucky, supra, that an insurance corporation is not doing business within a state merely because it insures lives of persons living therein, mails notices addressed to beneficiaries at their homes and pays losses by checks from its home office. See, also, Pembleton v. Illinois Commercial Men's Association, 289 Ill. 99, 124 N. E. 355.\n We conclude that the record fails to disclose any evidence sufficient to show that petitioner was doing business in Montana within the proper meaning of those words, and that the court there lacked jurisdiction to award the challenged judgment.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","133":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOORE v. DEMPSEY(1923)\nNo. 199\nArgued: January 9, 1923Decided: February 19, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. U. S. Bratton, of Detroit, Mich., Scipio A. Jones, of Little Rock, Ark., and Moorfield Storey, of Boston, Mass., for appellants. \n\n[261 U.S. 86, 87]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Elbert Godwin, of Melbourne, Ark., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from an order of the District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas dismissing a writ of habeas corpus upon demurrer, the presiding judge certifying that there was probable cause for allowing the appeal. There were two cases originally, but by agreement they were consolidated into one. The appellants are five negroes who were convicted of murder in the first degree and sentenced to death by the Court of the State of Arkansas. The ground of the petition for the writ is that the proceedings in the State Court, although a trial in form, were only a form, and that the appellants were hurried to conviction under the pressure of a mob without any regard for their rights and without according to them due process of law.\n The case stated by the petition is as follows, and it will be understood that while we put it in nerrative form, we are not affirming the facts to be as stated but nly what we must take them to be, as they are admitted by the demurrer: On the night of September 30, 1919, a number of colored people assembled in their church were attacked and fired upon by a body of white men. and in the disturbance that followed a white man was killed. The report of the killing caused great excitement and was followed by the hunting down and shooting of many negroes and also by the killing on October 1 of one Clinton Lee, a white man, for whose murder the petitioners were indicted. They seem to have been arrested with many others on the same day. The petitioners say that Lee must have been killed by other whites, but that we leave on one side as what we have to deal with is not the petitioners' innocence \n\n[261 U.S. 86, 88]\n\u00a0\n or guilt but solely the question whether their constitutional right have been preserved. They say that their meeting was to employ counsel for protection against extortions practiced upon them by the landowners and that the landowners tried to prevent their effort, but that again we pass by as not directly bearing upon the trial. It should be mentioned, however, that O. S. Bratton, a son of the counsel who is said to have been contemplated and who took part in the argument here, arriving for consultation on October 1, is said to have barely escaped being mobbed; that he was arrested and confined during the month on a charge of murder and on October 31 was indicted for barratry, but later in the day was told that he would be discharged but that he must leave secretly by a closed automobile to take the train at West Helena, four miles away, to avoid being mobbed. It is alleged that the judge of the Court in which the petitioners were tried facilitated the departure and went with Bratton to see him safely off.\n A Committee of Seven was appointed by the Governor in regard to what the committee called the 'insurrection' in the county. The newspapers daily published inflammatory articles. On the 7th a statement by one of the committee was made public to the effect that the present trouble was 'a deliberately planned insurrection of the negroes against the whites, directed by an organization known as the 'Progressive Farmers' and 'Household Union of America' established for the purpose of banding negroes together for the killing of white people.' According to the statement the organization was started by a swindler to get money from the blacks.\n Shortly after the arrest of the petitioners a mob marched to the jail for the purpose of lynching them but were prevented by the presence of United States troops and the promise of some of the Committee of Seven and other leading officials that if the mob would refrain, as \n\n[261 U.S. 86, 89]\n\u00a0\n the petition puts it, they would execute those found guilty in the form of law. The Committee's own statement was that the reason that the people refrained from mob violence was 'that this Committee gave our citizens their solemn promise that the law would be carried out.' According to affidavits of two white men and the colored witnesses on whose testimony the petitioners were convicted, produced by the petitioners since the last decision of the Supreme Court hereafter mentioned, the Committee made good their promise by calling colored witnesses and having them whipped and tortured until they would say what was wanted, among them being the two relied on to prove the petitioners' guilt. However this may be, a grand jury of white men was organized on October 27 with one of the Committee of Seven and, it is alleged, with many of a posse organized to fight the blacks, upon it, and on the morning of the 29th the indictment was returned. On November 3 the petitioners were brought into Court, informed that a certain lawyer was appointed their counsel and were placed on trial before a white jury-blacks being systematically excluded from both grand and petit juries. The Court and neighborhood were thronged with an adverse crowd that threatened the most dangerous consequences to anyone interfering with the desired result. The counsel did not venture to demand delay or a change of venue, to challenge a juryman or to ask for separate trials. He had had no preliminary consultation with the accused, called no witnesses for the defence although they could have been produced, and did not put the defendants on the stand. The trial lasted about three-quarters of an hour and in less than five minutes the jury brought in a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree. According to the allegations and affidavits there never was a chance for the petitioners to be acquitted; no juryman could have voted for an acquittal and continued to live Phillips County and if \n\n[261 U.S. 86, 90]\n\u00a0\n any prisoner by any chance had been acquitted by a jury he could not have escaped the mob.\n The averments as to the prejudice by which the trial was environed have some corroboration in appeals to the Governor, about a year later, earnestly urging him not to interfere with the execution of the petitioners. One came from five members of the Committee of Seven, and stated in addition to what has been quoted heretofore that 'all our citizens are of the opinion that the law should take its course.' Another from a part of the American Legion protests against a contemplated commutation of the sentence of four of the petitioners and repeats that a 'solemn promise was given by the leading citizens of the community that it the guilty parties were not lynched, and let the law take its course, that justice would be done and the majesty of the law upheld.' A meeting of the Helena Rotary Club attended by members representing, as it said, seventy- five of the leading industrial and commercial enterprises of Helena, passed a resolution approving and supporting the action of the American Legion post. The Lions Club of Helena at a meeting attended by members said to represent sixty of the leading industrial and commercial enterprises of the city passed a resolution to the same effect. In May of the same year, a trial of six other negroes was coming on and it was represented to the Governor by the white citizens and officials of Phillips County that in all probability those negroes would be lynched. It is alleged that in order to appease the mob spirit and in a measure secure the safety of the six the Governor fixed the date for the execution of the petitioners at June 10, 1921, but that the execution was stayed by proceedings in Court; we presume the proceedings before the Chancellor to which we shall advert.\n In Frank v. Mangum, \n237 \nU.S. 309, 335\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 582, 590 (59 L. Ed. 969), it was recognized of course that if in fact a trial is dominated by a \n\n[261 U.S. 86, 91]\n\u00a0\n mob so that there is an actual interference with the course of justice, there is a departure from due process of law; and that 'if the State, supplying no corrective process, carries into execution a judgment of death or imprisonment based upon a verdict thus produced by mob domination, the State deprives the accused of his life or liberty without due process of law.' We assume in accordance with that case that the corrective process supplied by the State may be so adequate that intereference by habeas corpus ought not to be allowed. It certainly is true that mere mistakes of law in the course of a trial are not to be corrected in that way. But if the case is that the whole proceeding is a mask-that counsel, jury and judge were swept to the fatal end by an irresistible wave of public passion, and that the State Courts failed to correct the wrong, neither perfection in the machinery for correction nor the possibility that the trial court and counsel saw no other way of avoiding an immediate outbreak of the mob can prevent this Court from securing to the petitioners their constitutional rights.\n In this case a motion for a new trial on the ground alleged in this petition was overruled and upon exceptions and appeal to the Supreme Court the judgment was affirmed. The Supreme Court said that the complaint of discrimination against petitioners by the exclusion of colored men from the jury came too l te and by way of answer to the objection that no fair trial could be had in the circumstances, stated that it could not say 'that this must necessarily have been the case'; that eminent counsel was appointed to defend the petitioners, that the trial was had according to law, the jury correctly charged, and the testimony legally sufficient. On June 8, 1921, two days before the date fixed for their execution, a petition for habeas corpus was presented to the Chancellor and he issued the writ and an injunction against the execution of the petitioners; but the Supreme Court of the State \n\n[261 U.S. 86, 92]\n\u00a0\n held that the Chancellor had no jurisdiction under the state law whatever might be the law of the United States. The present petition perhaps was suggested by the language of the Court: 'What the result would be of an application to a Federal Court we need not inquire.' It was presented to the District Court on September 21. We shall not say more concerning the corrective process afforded to the petitioners than that it does not seem to us sufficient to allow a Judge of the United States to escape the duty of examining the facts for himself when if true as alleged they make the trial absolutely void. We have confined the statement to facts admitted by the demurrer. We will not say that they cannot be met, but it appears to us unavoidable that the District Judge should find whether the facts alleged are true and whether they can be explained so far as to leave the state proceedings undisturbed.\n Order reversed. The case to stand for hearing before the District Court.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, dissenting.\n We are asked to overrule the judgment of the District Court discharging a writ of habeas corpus by means of which five negroes sought to escape electrocution for the murder of Clinton Lee. Sec. 753, Rev. Stat . (Comp. St.  1281).1 They were convicted and sentenced in the circuit court of Phillips county, Arkansas, two years before the writ issued. The petition for the writ was supported by affidavits of these five ignorant men whose lives were at stake, the ex parte affidavits of three other negroes who had pleaded guilty \n\n[261 U.S. 86, 93]\n\u00a0\n and were then confined in the penitentiary under sentences for the same murder, and the affidavits of two white men-low villains according to their own admissions. It should be remembered that to narrate the allegations of the petition is but to repeat statements from these sources. Considering all the circumstances-the course of the cause in the state courts and upon application here for certiorari, etc.-the District Court held the alleged facts insufficient prima facie to show nullity of the original judgment.\n The matter is one of gravity. If every man convicted of crime in a state court may thereafter resort to the federal court and by swearing, as advised, that certain allegations of fact tending to impeach his trial are 'true to the best of his knowledge and belief,' and thereby obtain as of right further review, another way has been added to a list already unfortunately long to prevent prompt punishment. The delays incident to enforcement of our criminal laws have become a national scanda and give serious alarm to those who observe. Wrongly to decide the present cause probably will produce very unfortunate consequences.\n In Frank v. Mangum, \n237 \nU.S. 309, 325\n, 326 S., 327, 329, 335, 35 Sup. Ct. 582, after great consideration a majority of this court approved the doctrine which should be applied here. The doctrine is right and wholesome. I can not agree now to put it aside and substitute the views expressed by the minority of the court in that cause.\n Much of the opinion in the Frank Case might be repeated here, if emphasis were necessary. It will suffice \n\n[261 U.S. 86, 94]\n\u00a0\n to quote a few paragraphs; but fully to understand the whole should be read.\n'In dealing with these contentions, we should have in mind the nature and extent of the duty that is imposed upon a federal court on application for the writ of habeas corpus under section 753, Rev. Stat. Under the terms of that section, in order to entitle the present appellant to the relief sought, it must appear that he is held in custody in violation of the Constitution of the United States. Rogers v. Peck, \n199 \nU.S. 425, 434\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 87. Moreover, if he is held in custody by reason of his conviction upon a criminal charge before a court having plenary jurisdiction over the subject-matter or offense, the place where it was committed, and the person of the prisoner, it results from the nature of the writ itself that he cannot have relief on habeas corpus. Mere errors in point of law, however serious, committed by a criminal court in the exercise of its jurisdiction over a case properly subject to its cognizance, cannot be reviewed by habeas corpus. That writ cannot be employed as a substitute for the writ or error. ...\n\n'As to the 'due process of law' that is required by the Fourteenth Amendment, it is perfectly well settled that a criminal prosecution in the courts of a state, based upon a law not in itself repugnant to the federal Constitution, and conducted according to the settled course of judicial proceedings as established by the law of the state, so long as it includes notice, and a hearing, or an opportunity to be heard, before a court of competent jurisdiction, according to established modes of procedure, is 'due process' in the constitutional sense. ...\n\n'It is, therefore, conceded by counsel for appellant that in the present case we may not review irregularities or erroneous rulings upon the trial, however serious, and that the writ of habeas corpus will lie only in case the judgment under which the prisoner is detained is shown to be absolutely \n\n[261 U.S. 86, 95]\n\u00a0\n void for want of jurisdiction in the court that pronounced it, either because such jurisdiction was absent at the beginning or because it was lost in the course of the proceedings. ...\n\n'But it would be clearly erroneous to confine the inquiry to the proceedings and judgment of the trial court. The laws of the state of Georgia (as will appear from decisions elsewhere cited), provide for an appeal in criminal cases to the Supreme Court of that state upon divers grounds, including such as those upon which it is here asserted that the trial court was lacking in jurisdiction. ...\n\n'It follows as a logical consequence that where, as here, a criminal prosecution has proceeded through all the courts of the state, including the appellate as well as the trial court, the result of the appellate review cannot be ignored when afterwards the prisoner applies for his release on the ground of a deprivation of federal rights sufficient to oust the state of its jurisdiction to proceed to judgment and execution against him. This is not a mere matter of comity, as seems to be supposed. The rule stands upon a much higher plane, for it arises out of the very nature and ground of the inquiry into the proceedings of the state tribunals, and touches closely upon the relations between the state and the federal governments. As was declared by this court in Ex parte Royall, \n117 \nU.S. 241, 252\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 734, appl ing in a habeas corpus case what was said in Covell v. Heyman, \n111 \nU.S. 176, 182\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 355, 358 (28 L. Ed. 390), a case of conflict of jurisdiction: 'The forbearance which courts of co-ordinate jurisdiction, administered under a single system, exercise towards each other, whereby conflicts are avoided, by avoiding interference with the process of each other, is a principle of comity, with perhaps no higher sanction than the utility which comes from concord; but between state courts and those of the United States it is something more. It is a principle of right and of law, \n\n[261 U.S. 86, 96]\n\u00a0\n and therefore, of necessity.' And see In re Tyler, Petitioner, \n149 \nU.S. 164, 186\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 785. ...\n\n'We of course agree that if a trial is in fact dominated by a mob, so that the jury is intimidated and the trial judge yields, and so that there is an actual interference with the course from due process of law in the proper sense of that term. And if the state, supplying no corrective that term. And if the state, supplying no corrective process, carries into execution a judgment of death or imprisonment based upon a verdict thus produced by mob domination, the state deprives the accused of his life of liberty without due process of law.\n\n'But the state may supply such corrective process as to it seems proper. Georgia has adopted the familiar procedure of a motion for a new trial followed by an appeal to its Supreme Court, not confined to the mere record of conviction but going at large, and upon evidence adduced outside of that record, into the question whether the processes of justices have been interfered with in the trial court. Repeated instances are reported of verdicts and judgments set aside and new trials granted for disorder or mob violence interfering with the prisoner's right to a fair trial.' Myers v. State, 97 Ga. 76(5), 99, 25 S. E. 252; Collier v. State, 115 Ga. 803, 42 S. E. 226.\n\n Let us consider with some detail what was presented to the court below.\n There was the complete record of the cause in the state courts-trial and Supreme-showing no irregularity. After indictment the defendants were arraigned for trial and eminent counsel appointed to defend them. He cross- examined the witnesses, made exceptions, and evidently was careful to preserve a full and complete transcript of the proceedings. The trial was unusually short but there is nothing in the record to indicate that it was illegally hastened. November 3, 1919, the jury returned a verdict of 'guilty'; November 11th the defendants were sentenced \n\n[261 U.S. 86, 97]\n\u00a0\n to be executed on December 27th; December 20th new counsel chosen by them or their friends moved for a new trial and supported the motion by affidavits of defendants and two other negroes who declared they testified falsely because of torture. This motion questioned the validity of the conviction upon the very grounds now advanced-torture, prejudice, mob domination, failure of counsel to protect interests, etc. It is thus summarized by counsel for appellants:\n'The grounds urged in the motion were the state of public feeling against the defendants, the fact that the defendants and witnesses were frequently subjected to torture for the purpose of extracting from them admissions of guilt and to make them testify against the defendants; that they were given no opportunity to consult with their friends and seek assistance, or informed of the charge against them until after their indictment; that they were carried from jail to the courtroom without having been permitted to see or talk with an attorney or any other person in regard to their defense; that the court appointed counsel for the defendants without consulting them, or giving them an opportunity to employ their own counsel; that the state of public feeling was such that they could not have a fair jury; that the trial proceeded without their consulting with their counsel or any witnesses, or being given an opportunity to obtain witnesses; that they were never in court before and were entirely ignorant of w at they could do to defend themselves; that the from beginning to end occupied three-fourths of an hour and the verdict was returned in from three to six minutes. Four of the defendants say that they never has a copy of the indictment served upon them, one had it only forty- eight hours before the trial.\n\n'Another ground was that under the practice which prevailed in the state only white men were summoned \n\n[261 U.S. 86, 98]\n\u00a0\n to sit on the grand jury or the jury, and that by this discrimination the defendants were deprived of their rights under the Constitution of the United States; that they had no notice or knowledge of what steps they should take to raise this point before the trial; that the verdict is contrary to the law and evidence.\n\n'To this motion are attached two affidavits, one of Alf Banks, Jr., and another of William Wordlaw, who testified to the fact that they were whipped, placed in the electric chair and strangled by something put in their noses to make them testify. These defendants did not suffer from what was done to these witnesses, as they did not testify at their trial, but their affidavits confirm the testimony of the others as to the treatment to which the negroes in confinement were exposed.'\n\n A new trial having been denied, an appeal was granted to the State Supreme Court and 60 days allowed for preparing bill of exceptions; March 22, 1920, this appeal was argued orally and by briefs: March 29th the court announced its opinion, reviewed the proceedings and affirmed the judgment. Hicks v. State, 143 Ark. 158, 220 S. W. 308. A petition for rehearing was presented April 19th and overruled April 26th.\n A petition for certiorari filed in this court May 24, 1920, with the record of proceedings in the state courts, set forth in detail the very grounds of complaint now before us. It was presented October 5, denied October 11, 1920, \n254 U.S. 630\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 6.\n April 29, 1921, the Governor directed execution of the defendants on June 10th. June 8th the chancery court of Pulaski county granted them a writ of habeas corpus; on June 20th the state Supreme Court held that the chancery court lacked jurisdiction and prohibited further proceedings. State v. Martineau, 149 Ark. 237, 232 S. W. 609. August 4th a justice of the court denied writ of error. Thereupon, the Governor fixed September 23d for execution. \n\n[261 U.S. 86, 99]\n\u00a0\n On September 21st the present habeas corpus proceeding began, and since then the matter has been in the courts.\n It appears that during September, 1919, bloody conflicts took place between whites and blacks in Phillips county, Arkansas-'the Elaine riot.' Many negroes and some whites were killed. A committee of seven prominent white men was chosen to direct operations in putting down the so-called insurrection and conduct investigation with a view of discovering and punishing the guilty. This committee published a statement, certainly not intemperate, about October 7th, wherein they stated the 'ignorance and superstition of a race of children' was played upon for gain by a black swindler, and told of an organization to attack the whites. It urged all persons white or black, in possession of information which might assist in discovering those responsible for the insurrection, to confer with it, upon the understanding that such action would be for the public safety and informant's identity carefully safeguarded. I find nothing in this statement which counsels lawlessness or indicates more than an honest effort by upstanding men to meet the grave situation.\n It is true that in October, 1920, almost a year after the trial here under consideration, the American Legion post at Helena-approximately 300 ex-service white men-made protest to the Governor against commutation of the sentences. It is copied in the margin as printed in the record. \n2\n The Helena Rotary Club, November 10, \n\n[261 U.S. 86, 100]\n\u00a0\n 1920, expressed emphatic approval of this protest, and the Lions Club took like action. These resolutions are not violent and certainly do not establish the theory that defendants' conviction in November, 1919-a year before-was an empty form and utterly void; nor, as the\n___ Now, therefore, be it resolved by this post assembled on this the 19th day of October, 1920, that we most earnestly protest against the commutation of any of the sentences of these twelve negroes convicted of murder in the Elaine riot of October 1919, their having received a fair trial and-proven guilty, and the leniency of the court was shown in the balance of the cases tried, these being the ring leaders and guilty murderers, and that law and order will be vindicated and a solemn promise kept.\n Be it further resolved that a committee of four be appointed by the Post Commander. This committee is hereby empowered to represent this post at a conference, or several conferences, with the Governor of Arkansas and to take such steps as they may deem necessary to carry out the wishes of this resolution and leaving nothing undone to have these sentences carried out. This committee to report in full to the next meeting of this post.\n Passed unanimously 8:30 p. m. October 19, 1920, basement of the Episcopal Church, Helena, Arkansas. \n\n[261 U.S. 86, 101]\n\u00a0\n petition recklessly alleges, do they 'further and conclusively show the existence of the mob spirit prevailing among all the white people of Phillips county at the time petitioners and the other defendants were put through the form of trials and show that the only reason the mob stayed its hand, the only reason they were not lynched was that the leading citizens of the community made a solemn promise to the mob that they should be executed in the form of law.'\n The Supreme Court of the state twice reversed the conviction of other negroes charged with committing murder during the disorders of September, 1919. The first opinion came down on the very day upon which the judgment against petitioners was affirmed, and held the verdict so defective that no judgment could be entered upon it. The second directed a reversal because the trial court had refused to hear evidence on the motion to set aside the regular panel of the petit jury. Banks v. State, 143 Ark. 154, 219 S. W. 1015; Ware v. State, 146 Ark. 321, 225 S. W. 626. The Supreme Court, as well as the trial court, considered the claims of petitioners set forth by trusted counsel in the motion for a new trial. This court denied a petition for certiorari wherein the facts and circumstances now relied upon were set out with great detail. Years have passed since they we e convicted of an atrocious crime. Certainly they have not been rushed towards the death chair; on the contrary, there has been long delay and some impatience over the result is not unnatural. The recent execution of assassins in England within 30 days of the crime, affords a striking contrast.\n With all those things before him, I am unable to say that the District Judge, acquainted with local conditions, erred when he held the petition for the writ of habeas corpus insufficient. His duty was to consider the whole case and decide whether there appeared to be substantial reason for further proceedings. \n\n[261 U.S. 86, 102]\n\u00a0\n Under the disclosed circumstances I cannot agree that the solemn adjudications by courts of a great state, which this court has refused to review, can be successfully impeached by the mere ex parte affidavits made upon information and belief of interested convicts joined by two white men- confessedly atrocious criminals. The fact that petitioners are poor and ignorant and black naturally arouses sympathy; but that does not release us from enforcing principles which are essential to the orderly operation of our federal system.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND concurs in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The writ of habeas corpus shall in no case extend to a prisoner in jail, unless where he is in custody under or by color of the authority of the United States, or is committed for trial before some court thereof; or is in custody for an act done or omitted in pursuance of a law of the United States, or of an order, process, or decree of a court or judge thereof; or is in custody in violation of the Constitution or of a law or treaty of the United States; or, being a subject or citizen of a foreign state, and domiciled therein, is in custody for an act done or omitted under any alleged right, title, authority, privilege, protection, or exemption claimed under the commission, or order, or sanction of any foreign state, or under color thereof, the validity and effect whereof depend upon the law of nations; or unless it is necessary to bring the prisoner into court to testify. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Resolution.\n It has been brought to the attention of the Richard L. Kitchens Post, No. 31, American Legion, Helena, Arkansas, that the Governor is contemplating commuting the sentence of four of the negroes, who are now under death sentences for their participation in the Elaine riot, to lesser sentences, and we, the members of this post, feel that any action toward this end by the Governor would do more harm in the community and breed lawlessness, as well as disregard for constituted authority, as at the time of this race riot the members of this post were called upon to go to Hoop Spur and Elaine to protect life and property, and in compliance with this request, there were two American Legion members killed and one seriously injured, besides the other nonmembers who also perished, and when the guilty negroes were apprehended, a solemn promise was given by the leading citizens of the community, that if these guilty parties were not lynched, and let the law take its course, that justice would be done and the majesty of the law upheld.\n The twelve negroes now under sentence of death, but whose sentences are suspended-account of court procedure, and six of these negroes cases have-taken to the Supreme Court of the United States, which court declined to review. The other six cases, whose original trials were reversed and new trials given them, were convicted, and their cases were appealed to the Supreme Court of the state and attorneys of their own selection were permitted to handle their cases. \n\n\n\n\n","134":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMUNTER v. WEIL CORSET CO.(1923)\nNo. 255\nArgued: January 22, 1923Decided: February 26, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. Elijah N. Zoline, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Benjamin Slade, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Action in the District Court for the District of Connecticut, by the Weil Corset Company, a corporation of Connecticut, against Charles Munter, a citizen and resident of New York, for breach of contract; damages being laid at $7,273.26, with interest from November 13, 1914. Service upon Munter was made in New York City.\n The case is between citizens of different states and involves more than $3,000, exclusive of \n\n[261 U.S. 276, 277]\n\u00a0\n interest and costs. It therefore is within the general jurisdiction of the District Courts, Section 24 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  991). The plaintiff being a resident of the district in which the suit was brought, the defendant could not object to the venue or place of suit. Section 51, Judicial Code Comp. St.  1033). Comp v. Gress, \n250 U.S. 308\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 478; Lee v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. (January 22, 1923) \n260 U.S. 653\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 230, 67 L. Ed. --.\n But service of process was made upon Munter in New York, and he availed himself of the fact by filing on August 30, 1918, before the return day, by his attorney, the following motion:\n'The defendant moves that the above-entitled case be erased from the docket, because it appears from the writ and complaint therein that the defendant was at the time of the commencement of said action a resident of the state of New York, and it appears from the return thereon that service of said writ and complaint was not otherwise made upon him than by leaving a copy of said writ and complaint with him in the borough of Manhattan, city, county, and state of New York.'\n\n The court denied the motion, on the ground that it 'contained no prayer for judgment'; a prayer for judgment, it was held, being necessary under the statutes of Connecticut in pleas 'to the jurisdiction, or in attachment, or both,' and that the condition was made applicable to the District Court by the Conformity Act (Section 914, Revised Statutes of United States [Comp. St.  1537]). That act provides:\n'That the practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding in ... other than equity and admiralty causes in the Circuit and District Co rts [of the United States] shall conform, as near as may be, to the practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding existing at the time in like causes in the courts of record of the state within which such Circuit or District Courts are held, any rule of court to the contrary notwithstanding.'\n\n It may well be contended that the objection to the motion was more verbal than real. There was substantially \n\n[261 U.S. 276, 278]\n\u00a0\n a prayer for judgment, the only judgment that could be granted; that is, that the 'case be erased from the docket,' which, necessarily, meant dismissed for want of jurisdiction in the court over the defendant, because the 'service of said writ and complaint was not otherwise made upon him than by leaving a copy of said writ and complaint with him in the borough of Manhattan, city, county, and state of New York.'\n We have decided, in cases which concern the jurisdiction of the federal courts, that, notwithstanding the Conformity Act, neither the statutes of the states nor the decisions of its courts are conclusive upon the federal court, the determination of such questions being 'in this court alone.' Mechanical Appliance Co. v. Castleman, \n215 \nU.S. 437, 443\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 125, 128 (54 L. Ed. 272). The motion of Munter, therefore, should have been granted, and the action dismissed.\n It is, however, contended that he, by his subsequent conduct, submitted to the ruling and waived his right of objection. The motion was made August 30, 1918. The case was assigned for trial for November 28, 1921. After some correspondence with counsel for plaintiff and some conversation with the court, Munter, through other counsel, moved the court 'for an order vacating and setting aside the decision of June 12, 1919, and directing that the above-entitled action be erased from the docket of the court.'\n The court denied the motion. The court took pains to review the prior proceedings, and distinguished between the objections to the jurisdiction that cannot be waived, and those that can be waived, assigning the objection of Munter to the latter, and when they are waived, 'the jurisdiction of the court is complete.'\n The court deduced a waiver from the conduct of counsel, notwithstanding the court conceded that counsel had strenuously insisted upon the objection. The conclusion, was reached because, in view of the court, the defective \n\n[261 U.S. 276, 279]\n\u00a0\n service had not been properly taken advantage of, and that 'by failing to follow up the ruling made on June 12, 1919,' the defendant was 'guilty of gross laches, and by his laches' had 'waived his right,' and this was 'equivalent to an actual waiver under the statute accorded him-to object to the jurisdiction.'\n We are unable to concur. The service on Munter was void. The District Court of Connecticut had no power to send its process to New York, for service. Toland v. Sprague, 12 Pet. 300, 330; Herndon v. Ridgway, 17 How. 424; New York Life Insurance Co. v. Bangs, \n103 U.S. 435\n. That Munter might have waived his right to object to the service is established by the cases cited by the court. They are all to the effect that pleading to the merits or a general appearance without objecting to the service is a waiver. There is no such pleading or appearance in the present case and no action or conduct tantamount to either. There was delay, it is true, but it was as much the delay of the Corset Company as of Munter, and to this situation the company brought its action. It subjected its action to the indulgence of Munter, and he, in the exercise of his right, immediately declared his opposition to the invalid service made in another district and state. He did all that was incumbent upon him to avail of his right. The court erred by denying it, and erred again in refusing to set aside the order denying it.\n Reversed and remanded, with directions to dismiss the action. \n\n\n\n","135":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMUTUAL LIFE INS.

C., for petitioner.[ Mutual Life Ins Co of New York v. Hurni Packing Co \n263 U.S. 167\n (1923) ]\n\n\n[263 U.S. 167, 173]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles M. Stilwill and Edwin J. Stason, both of Sioux City, Iowa, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action to recover the amount of a life insurance policy issued by the petitioner to Rudolph Hurni. At the conclusion of the evidence the jury found for the plaintiff, respondent here, under the peremptory instruction of the court, and judgment was rendered accordingly. Upon appeal this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 280 Fed. 18.\n There were two trials below. Upon appeal following the first, the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment in favor of plaintiff on the ground of material misrepresentation by the insured. 260 Fed. 641, 171 C. C. A. 405. Pending the second trial plaintiff amended its reply to the answer and alleged for the first time that this defense was barred, under the terms of the policy, by defendant's failure to contest within two years.\n The policy was applied for on September 2, 1915. It was in fact executed on September 7th, but antedated as of August 23, 1915, and was delivered to insured about September 13th. The insured died on July 4, 1917\n\n\n The application provides that 'the applicant upon request may have the policy antedated for a period not to exceed six months.' Underneath the heading of the application there was written the direction: 'Date policy, August 23, 1915; age, 47.' The testimonium clause, followed by the signatures of the officials, reads: 'In witness whereof the company has caused this policy to be executed this 23d day of August, 1915.' The policy acknowledges the receipt of the first premium and provides that a like amount shall be paid 'upon each 23d day of August hereafter until the death of the insured.'- \n\n[263 U.S. 167, 174]\n\u00a0\n The determination of the case depends upon the meaning of a clause in the policy as follows:\n'Incontestability.-This policy shall be incontestable, except for nonpayment of premiums, provided two years shall have elapsed from its date of issue.'\n\n The trial court held that the words 'its date of issue' were to be construed as referring to the date upon the face of the policy, viz. August 23, 1915, and this was also the view of the Court of Appeals. The first action taken by the insurance company to avail itself of the misrepresentation of the insured was on the 24th day of August, 1917, one day beyond the period of two years after the conventional date of the policy. It is contended on behalf of the insurance company: (1) That the period of incontestability did not begin to run until the delivery of the policy, or, in any event, until its actual execution on September 7th; and ( 2) that the policy was matured by the death of the insured, and the rights of the parties thereby became fixed so that the incontestability clause never became operative, even within the conventional limitation.\n First. The rule is settled that in case of ambiguity that construction of the policy will be adopted which is most favorable to the insured. The language employed is that of the company and it is consistent with both reason and justice that any fair doubt as to the meaning of its own words should be resolved against it. First National Bank v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., \n95 U.S. 673\n, 678-679; Thompson v. Phenix Insurance Co., \n136 \nU.S. 287, 297\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 1019; Imperial Fire Insurance Co. v. County of Coos, \n151 \nU.S. 452, 462\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 379.\n The word 'date' is used frequently to designate the actual time when an event takes place, but, as applied to written instruments, its primary signification is the time specified therein. Indeed this is the meaning which its derivation (datus=given) most naturally suggests. In Bement & Dougherty v. Trenton Locomotive, etc., Co., \n\n[263 U.S. 167, 175]\n\u00a0\n 32 N. J. Law, 513, 515, 516, it is said:\n'The primary signification of the word 'date' is not time in the abstract nor time taken absolutely, but, as its derivation plainly indicates, time 'given' or specified, time in some way ascertained and fixed; this is the sense in which the word is commonly used. When we speak of the date of a deed, we do not mean the time when it was actually executed, but the time of its execution, as given or stated in the deed itself. The date of an item, or of a charge in a book account, is not necessarily the time when the article charged was, in fact, furnished, but simply the time given or set down in the account, in connection with such charge.'\n\n This language was used in construing a provision of the New Jersey lien law to the effect that no lien should be enforced unless summons be issued 'within one year from the date of the last work done, or materials furnished, in such claim,' and, specifically applying it to that provision, the court concluded:\n'And so 'the date of the last work done, or materials furnished, in such claim,' in the absence of anything in the act indicating a different intention, must be taken to mean the time when such work was done or materials furnished, as specified in the plaintiffs' written claim.'\n\n Here the words, referring to the written policy, are 'from its date of issue.' While the question, it must be conceded, is not certainly free from reasonable doubt, yet, having in mind the rule first above stated, that in such case the doubt must be resolved in the way most favorable to the insured, we conclude that the words refer not to the time of actual execution of the policy or the time of its delivery but to the date of issue as specified in the policy itself. Wood v. American Yeomen, 148 Iowa, 400, 403, 404, 126 N. W. 949; Anderson v. Mutual Life Insurance Co., 164 Cal. 712, 130 Pac. 726, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 903; Harrington v. Mutual Life Insurance Co., 21 N. D. 447, 131 N. W. 246, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 373; Yesler v. Seattle, 1 Wash. 308, 322, 323, 25 Pac. 1014. It was competent for the parties to agree that the effective \n\n[263 U.S. 167, 176]\n\u00a0\n date of the policy should be one prior to its actual execution or issue; and this, in our opinion, is what they did. Plainly their agreement was effective to govern the amount of the premiums and the time of their future payment, reducing the former and shortening the latter, and, in the absence of words evincing a contrary intent, we are unable to avoid the conclusion that it was likewise effective in respect of other provisions of the policy, including the one here in question. This conclusion is fortified by a consideration of the precise words employed, which are 'from its [that is, the policy's] date of issue,' or, in other words, from the date of issue as specified in the policy. It was within the power of the insurance company if it meant otherwise, to say so in plain terms. Not having done, so, it must accept the consequences resulting from the fact that the doubt for which its own lack of clearness was responsible must be resolved against it.\n Second. The argument advanced in support of the second ground relied upon for reversal, in substance, is that a policy of insurance necessarily imports a risk, and where there is no risk there can be no insurance; that when the insured dies what had been a hazard has become a certainty and that the obligation then is no longer of insurance but of payment; that by the incontestability clause the undertaking is that after two years, provided the risk continues to be insured against for the period, the insurer will make no defense against a claim under the policy; but that if the risk does not continue for two years (that is, if the insured dies in the meantime) the incontestability clause is not applicable. Only in the event of the death of the insured after two years, it is said, will the obligation to pay become absolute. The argument is ingenious, but fallacious, since it ignores the fundamental purpose of all simple life insurance, which is not to enrich the insured, but to secure the beneficiary, who has, therefore, a real, albeit sometimes only a contingent, interest in the policy. \n\n[263 U.S. 167, 177]\n\u00a0\n It is true, as counsel for petitioner contends, that the contract is with the insured, and not with the beneficiary; but, nevertheless, it is for the use of the beneficiary, and there is no reason to say that the incontestability clause is not meant for his benefit, as well as for the benefit of the insured. It isfor the benefit of the insured during his lifetime, and upon his death immediately inures to the benefit of the beneficiary. As said by the Supreme Court of Illinois in Monahan v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 283 Ill. 136, 141, 119 N. E. 68, 70 (L. R. A. 1918D, 1196):\n'Some of the rights and obligations of the parties to a contract of insurance necessarily become fixed upon the death of the insured. The beneficiary has an interest in the contract, and as between the insurer and the beneficiary all the rights and obligations of the parties are not determined as of the date of the death of the insured. The incontestable clause in a policy of insurance inures to the benefit of the beneficiary after the death of the insured as much as it inures to the benefit of the insured himself during his lifetime. The rights of the parties under such an incontestable clause as the one contained in this contract do not become fixed at the date of the death of the insured.'\n\n In order to give the clause the meaning which the petitioner ascribes to it, it would be necessary to supply words which it does not at present contain. The provision plainly is that the policy shall be incontestable upon the simple condition that two years shall have elapsed from its date of issue-not that it shall be incontestable after two years if the insured shall live, but incontestable without qualification and in any event. See Monahan v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., supra; Ramsey v. Old Colony Life Ins. Co., 297 Ill. 592, 601, 131 N. E. 108; Ebner, Administrator, v. Ohio, etc., Ins. Co., 69 Ind. App. 32, 42-48, 121 N. E. 315; Hardy v. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., 180 N. C. 180, 104 S. E. 166, 168, 169.\n Counsel for petitioner cites two cases which, it is said, sustain his view of the question: Jefferson Standard Life \n\n[263 U.S. 167, 178]\n\u00a0\n Ins. Co. v. McIntyre (D. C.) 285 Fed. 570, and Jefferson Standard Life Ins. Co. v. Smith, 157 Ark. 499, 248 S. W. 897. But the incontestability clause under review in those cases was unlike the one here. There the clause was:\n'After this policy shall have been in force for one full year from the date hereof it shall be incontestable,' etc.\n\n The decisions seem to have turned upon the use of the words 'in force,' the District Judge in the first case saying:\n'Are the policies 'in force' as contemplated in the clause, after the death of the assured occurring prior to one year from the date of the policy? It seems to me that the proper construction of this clause is that it contemplates the continuance in life of the assured during that year; else why except the nonpayment of premiums?'\n\n This amounts to little more than a quaere, since the question was then dismissed and the case decided upon another ground. We express neither agreement nor disagreement with the construction put by these decisions upon the provision therein considered; but dealing alone with the provision here under review, we are constrained to hold that it admits of no other interpretation than that the policy became incontestable upon the sole condition that two years had elapsed.\n Certain difficulties, both legal and practical, said to arise from this interpretation, in respect of the enforcement of the rights of the insurer, are suggested by way of illustration. But these we deem it unnecessary to review. It is enough to say that they do not, in fact, arise in the instant case, and they could not arise except as a result of the contract, whose words the insurance company itself selected and by which it is bound.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","136":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMYERS v. INTERNATIONAL TRUST CO.(1923)\nNo. 89\nArgued: October 18, 1923Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. Edward F. McClennen, of Boston, Mass., for petitioners.\n Mr. John R. Lazenby, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.[ Myers v. International Trust Co. \n263 U.S. 64\n (1923) ]\n\n\n[263 U.S. 64, 68]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was begun in the superior court of Massachusetts by the International Trust Company, a bank, against Samuel A. and Harry Myers, brothers and partners, for damages for deceit in that the defendants had obtained credit from the trust company by a false statement of their financial condition. The action resulted in a verdict for $14,304.49. The amended answer of the defendants pleaded res adjudicata in the cause by a decree of the United States District Court for Massachusetts in bankruptcy, and on the trial the defendants offered the record therein as evidence of an estoppel by judgment \n\n[263 U.S. 64, 69]\n\u00a0\n against the plaintiff as to the fact of falsity. The trial court excluded the record. The case was taken by bill of exceptions to the Supreme Judicial Court, which overruled the exceptions and sent down the rescript and pursuant thereto final judgment was entered on the verdict. The Massachusetts courts held that the bankruptcy proceedings neither were res judicata as to the cause nor estopped the plaintiff as to the fact of falsity. The case here turns on the effect of the bankruptcy record, and so presents the federal question whether full faith and credit was given to the judgment of a federal court. Radford v. Myers, \n231 \nU.S. 725, 730\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 249; National Foundry & Pipe Works v. Oconto Water Supply Co., \n183 \nU.S. 216, 233\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 111.\n In January, 1917, an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against the Myers Brothers. They made an offer of composition. A majority of the creditors accepted the offer. The referee recommended that it be confirmed. The Myers Brothers applied for confirmation. The International Trust Company entered its appearance as a creditor and opposed the confirmation on the ground, among others, that the Myers Brothers had obtained loans from the trust company by the statement made in writing on the first day of January, 1916, that the accounts receivable amounted to $ 58,425.06; that the statement was materially false and was made for the purpose of obtaining certain aforesaid sums on credit, 'said falsity being that the alleged bankrupts concealed and omitted to set forth in said statement the fact that of the said accounts receivable a certain portion in the neighborhood of $20,000 (the exact sum being unknown to your petitioner), had been assigned and set over to the Commercial Investment Trust and, further, that the accounts receivable, as set forth in said statement did not amount to the sum of $58,425.06.' The referee to whom the objections were referred reported that Myers Brothers had made the statement and the trust company had relied on \n\n[263 U.S. 64, 70]\n\u00a0\n it in making them loans, but that when it was made it was a true statement and correctly set forth the financial condition of the bankrupts on January 1, 1916, as shown by their books kept according to the custom of the bankrupts at that time by an experienced and competent bookkeeper, and he found no evidence that the bankrupts or either of them falsely or purposely concealed or omitted to set forth in said statement the amount of the accounts assigned to the Commercial Investment Company and that the objection could not be sustained. The District Judge (International Trust Co. v. Myers, 245 Fed. 110) confirmed the finding of the referee. The International Trust Company carried this ruling on appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, and that court (245 Fed. 110, 112, 157 C. C. A. 406) affirmed the order confirming the composition.\n The declaration of the Trust Company in this action for deceit has put the case on the falsity of the same statement of January 1, 1916\n\n\n The general principles which must govern here are laid down in an oftquoted opinion of Mr. Justice Field in Cromwell v. Sac County, \n94 U.S. 351\n. In that case suit had been brought upon coupons attached to bonds issued by the county for the erection of a schoolhouse, and it was adjudged that the bonds and coupons were invalid in the hands of one not a bona fide holder for value before maturity, and, as the plaintiff had not shown himself to be such a holder, he could not recover. In a second suit on other coupons from the same bond, he proved that he was a holder for value before maturity, and the county sought to defeat the second suit by pleading the judgment in the first as res judicata. It was held that the cause was different and that the first judgment was not a bar. Mr. Justice Field said (\n94 U.S. 352\n, 353 [24 L. Ed. 195]):\n'In considering the operation of this judgment, it should be borne in mind, as stated by counsel, that there is a difference between the effect of a judgment as a bar \n\n[263 U.S. 64, 71]\n\u00a0\n or estoppel against the prosecution of a second action upon the same claim or demand, and its effect as an estoppel in another action between the same parties upon a different claim or cause of action. In the former case, the judgment, if rendered upon the merits, constitutes an absolute bar to a subsequent action. It is a finality as to the claim or demand in controversy, concluding parties and those in privity with them, not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose. ...\n\n'But where the second action between the same parties is upon a different claim or demand, the judgment in the prior action operates as an estoppel only as to those matters in issue or points controverted, upon the determination of which the finding or verdict was rendered. In all cases, therefore, where it is sought to apply the estoppel of a judgment rendered upon one cause of action to matters arising in a suit upon a different cause of action, the inquiry must always be as to the point or question actually litigated and determined in the original action, not what might have been thus litigated and determined. Only upon such matters is the judgment conclusive in another action.'\n\n See, also, Southern Pacific R. R. Co. v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 1, 50\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 18; Troxell v. Del. Lack. & West. R. R., \n227 \nU.S. 434, 440\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 274.\n Coming, now, to apply these principles to the case before us, it is very clear that the opposition to the composition in the bankruptcy court was not the same cause of action as the suit for deceit here. That is settled by the decision of this court in Friend v. Talcott, \n228 U.S. 27\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 505, in a case involving similar facts, to be more fully stated. The defense of res judicata as to the cause was therefore not established by the judgment confirming the composition. \n\n[263 U.S. 64, 72]\n\u00a0\n Counsel for the petitioners, however, urge that in spite of this the bankruptcy record was admissible in evidence. What he contends is that the essential fact found as between the petition and respondent in the bankruptcy proceedings and the confirmation of the composition was the truth of, and lack of falsity in, the statement of January 1, 1916, that in the trial of this action for deceit the burden of the trust company was to prove the falsity of the statement or fail, and that the Myers Brothers were entitled to introduce as evidence conclusively rebutting the trust company's evidence of such falsity, the record of the bankruptcy proceedings showing that the question of such falsity in the statement had been adjudged against the trust company and in favor of the Myers Brothers in a cause to which both were parties and in which the fact of falsity was a relevant and indispensable issue.\n In the bankruptcy proceedings after the bankrupts' application was made to confirm the composition, the International Trust Company entered its appearance and filed its specifications as it was required to do under General Order XXXII (18 Sup. Ct. ix) before it could oppose the confirmation and the consequent discharge of the bankrupts. Then followed before the referee, to whom the issue thus made was referred, what was equivalent to a hearing in equity. This was the beginning of a distinct, separate and new suit. In re Guilbert (D. C.) 154 Fed. 676; In re Amer et al. (D. C.) 228 Fed. 576. This suit between respondent and petitioners was decided by the referee and the two courts against the respondent, and the composition was confirmed, because it was found that the statement of January 1, 1916 was true, and not false. This is exactly the same issue which arose in the suit for deceit which is before us. Recovery of the judgment under consideration cannot be sustained, except upon the finding that the statement was false. The respondent, the trust company, \n\n[263 U.S. 64, 73]\n\u00a0\n cannot litigate again that issue in this case, because it is bound by the finding against it in its opposition to the confirmation of the composition. This follows necessarily from the rule in the second class of cases laid down by Mr. Justice Field in the language already quoted.\n An adjudication of bankruptcy, or a discharge therefrom, is a judgment in rem and is binding on, and res judicata as to, all the world, only in respect of the status of the bankrupt, and is not conclusive as to the findings of fact or subsidiary questions of law on which it is based except as between parties to the proceedings or privies thereto. Gratiot State Bank v. Johnson, \n249 \nU.S. 246, 248\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 263; Manson v. Williams, \n213 \nU.S. 453, 455\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 519; In re Henry Ulfelder Clothing Co. (D. C) 98 Fed. 409, 413; In re Schick, 2 Ben. 5, Fed. Cas. No. 12,455. Here the International Trust Company was a real party to the issue and conducted the litigation. While the creditors whom it represented on the question of the discharge were only concluded as to the status of the bankrupt, it was estopped as between itself and the bankrupts in respect of the relevant facts determined in the controversy exactly as if the proceeding in opposition to the composition and discharge had been an ordinary civil suit by it against them.\n The respondent, however, contends, and the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held, that this case is controlled upon this point as well as in respect to general defense of res judicata, by Friend v. Talcott, \n228 U.S. 27\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 505, and must be affirmed on the authority of that case. That was a case like this in which a creditor, having opposed a composition in bankruptcy, was defeated in his effort and brought suit in tort for deceit for damages equal to the balance of his claim after deducting what he had received on his provable claim for goods sold. The deceit alleged in the specification was a false report of \n\n[263 U.S. 64, 74]\n\u00a0\n inancial condition of the bankrupt made to a commercial agency whose report the opposing creditor relied on. The bankruptcy court held that these facts thus alleged did not bring the case within paragraph (3) of section 14b of the Act of July 1, 1898 (chapter 541, 30 Stat. 550), as amended by the Act of February 5, 1903 (chapter 487,  4, 32 Stat. 797), which provided that--\n'The judge shall hear the application for a discharge, and such proofs and pleas as may be made in opposition thereto by parties in interest, at such time as will give parties in interest a reasonable opportunity to be fully heard, and investigate the merits of the application and discharge the applicant unless he has ... (3) obtained property on credit from any person upon a materially false statement in writing made to such person for the purpose of obtaining such property on credit.' Comp. St.  9598.\n\n It confirmed the composition. The reasoning of the bankruptcy court was that paragraph (3) required that the materially false statement, to be effective to prevent a discharge, should be made directly to the creditor or his representative whom the debtor intended to deceive, and that, as the specification only showed a statement made to a commercial agency, it did not aver facts sufficient to constitute a bar to the composition and the bankrupt's discharge.\n A year later the creditor began his action for deceit. In addition to the general issue, the defendants and former bankrupts set up the above judgment as res judicata. In the District Court the cause was heard on this plea of former adjudication and the plea was sustained. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the defense of res judicata was not sustained and reversed the judgment of the District Court.\n This court held that the causes of action were not the same, that the first concerned the general discharge of all the creditors under one section, and the second the exception from such general discharge of a particular \n\n[263 U.S. 64, 75]\n\u00a0\n creditor under another section and that the defense of former adjudication was bad.\n Coming, then, to the question of estoppel by judgment on the issue of fact as to the deceit, Chief Justice White, speaking for the court, used this language:\n'It is elaborately argued, however, that whatever be the infirmity of the decree of confirmation as res judicata in the complete sense, that decree was necessarily binding in so far as it established relevant facts which were at issue between the parties and therefore is here conclusive. But the proposition rests upon an unfounded assumption, as nothing in the assertion of the right to be exempt from the operation of the discharge here relied upon involves a traverse or denial of any relevant fact established as a result of the approval of the composition. On the contrary, as we have seen, the facts here relied upon to establish the exemption from discharge, are the facts which were conceded to exist and were not traversed for the purpose of the hearing on the composition.'\n\n The court thus points out that the issue of material falsity of statement was not an issue of fact in the bankruptcy court, because that court had held that even if the fact of falsity as alleged in the specification of opposition were conceded, it did not prevent the confirmation of the composition and discharge under paragraph (3),  14b, of the Bankruptcy Act because the statement was not made to the creditor or his representative, whereas the right of the creditor to recover in the action in hand was based on an exception to the discharge under the seventeenth section of the Bankruptcy Act of a liability 'for obtaining property by false pretenses or false representations' (amendment of February 5, 1903, chapter 487,  5, 32 Stat. 798 [Comp. St.  9601]), without any restriction as to whom the representation should be made. In other words, the exact point upon which the suit for deceit depended, to wit, the falsity of the statement, was not considered and passed on by the bankruptcy \n\n[263 U.S. 64, 76]\n\u00a0\n court. That court, without inquiring as to the truth of the statement, held as matter of law that it could not prevent the composition.\n Nor does that which follows the above quotation help respondents. It had evidently been argued that the view of the bankruptcy court as to the limitation of paragraph (3),  14b, was erroneous and that the issue of deceit was necessary before it and so in the result was decided. This led the Chief Justice to say (\n228 U.S. 41\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 509):\n'Conceding for the sake of argument that the facts which were alleged as the basis of the opposition to the approval of the composition were sufficient, had the law been rightly applied, to have prevented the approval of the composition, such concession would afford no ground for holding that because one case in matter of law was erroneously decided, that such decision should conclusively establish the duty to erroneously decide another and distinct case.'\n\n This, of course, is to be applied to the facts of the case. The question of law whether the statement had to be made to the creditor or his representative only, under paragraph (3),  14b, of the Bankruptcy Act, did not arise in the second case at all, for, as said above, that involved only the meaning of section 17, which had no such words of limitation. The circumstance that the bankruptcy court may have erroneously declined to decide the question of falsity could not give its action in avoiding decision of it the same conclusive effect as if it had decided it, in a subsequent action between the same parties in which the reason for aviding it however in which the reason for avoiding it however continued (\n228 U.S. 42\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 509):\n'If, on the other hand, it be conceded that the composition was rightfully approved, as the determination of that subject did not under the very terms of the statute involve passing upon the separate and distinct claim of creditors to be exempt from the operation of the discharge, it results \n\n[263 U.S. 64, 77]\n\u00a0\n that in no view of the case is there merit in the contention as to res judicata.'\n\n This was only to say that the issue of falsity in paragraph (3),  14b, if rightly construed by the bankruptcy court, was not the same as that in section 17.\n The distinction between that case and this then is clear. The whole and sole effect of the decision in Friend v. Talcott was, first, that the judgment confirming the composition and discharge, based on paragraph (3 ),  14b, was not the same cause of action as that in the action for deceit based on section 17, and therefore that it did not estop the creditor from obtaining a judgment in the latter suit; and second, that the issue of the falsity of the statement, while essential to recovery in the second suit for deceit, was not essential to the judgment in bankruptcy as held by the court which rendered the judgment and was in fact not determined by that court. In the case before us, however, we find that the issue of the statement's falsity was the same and was controlling in both suits and that because it was decided against the trust company in the first suit, the decision concludes the issue against the company in the second. It was error, therefore, to exclude from the evidence the record of the bankruptcy judgment on the composition.\n The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","137":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNASHVILLE, C. & ST.

St.  8595), provides, among other things:\n'That nothing in this act shall prevent the carriage, storage or handling of property free or at reduced rates for the United States, state, or municipal governments, or for charitable purposes, or to or from fairs and expositions for exhibition thereat. ...'1\n\n Whether this section should be construed as denying to the Interstate Commerce Commission power to prohibit such reduced rates, even where they result in unjust discrimination or in undue prejudice to interstate commerce is the main question for decision.\n On July 29, 1920, the Interstate Commerce Commission authorized a general increase, throughout Southern territory, of 25 per cent. in interstate freight rates. Ex parte 74, Increased Rates, 1920, 58 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 220. Thereafter the Railroad and Public Utilities Commission of Tennessee authorized, for that state, a like increase of intrastate rates. But the following articles (among others) were excluded from this increase: Carload shipments of stone and gravel when for use in building public highways and consigned to federal, state, county, and municipal authorities or their bona fide agents. To remove the exception, carrier applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission, claiming that the exception produced illegal discrimination against interstate commerce and an undue prejudice \n\n[262 U.S. 318, 321]\n\u00a0\n to persons and localities engaged in such commerce. The Commission found such discrimination; and ordered that the intrastate rates on these commodities, also, be increased to the level of the interstate rates. Tennessee Rates and Charges, 63 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 160, 172. On October 21, 1921, the state of Tennessee and its commission brought, in the federal court for the Middle District of Tennessee, this suit against the United States to have the order set aside. The Interstate Commerce Commission, the Nashville, Chattanooga St. Louis Railway, and two other interstate carriers intervened as defendants. The case was heard by three judges under the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 220 (Comp. St.  998). A final decree was entered, declaring the order void, and enjoining its enforcement. 284 Fed. 371. The case is here on two appeals. No. 396 is that of the carriers; No. 429, that of the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., \n257 U.S. 563\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 232, 22 A. L. R. 1086, had been decided by this court before entry of the judgment appealed from. But the District Court considered that case inapplicable, and held that, by reason of section 22, the Interstate Commerce Commission is 'without jurisdiction to forbid the railroads from carrying freight for the public at a less price than it charges individuals for the same carriage of the same freight'; that the section 'excludes this particular traffic from the rate structure which the Commission is authorized to erect and control; in still other words, there is freedom of discrimination.'\n The argument is, in substance, this: An order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, increasing intrastate rates to the level of interstate rates, must rest upon a finding of illegal preference resulting from the relation of intrastate to interstate rates. Preference to governmental shippers is expressly permitted by section 22 of the act. Hence a grant of such preference cannot be held to be unjust or \n\n[262 U.S. 318, 322]\n\u00a0\n unreasonable under sections 2 and 3 (Comp. St.  8564, 8565). There was no finding that these lower intrastate rates resulted in failure of the intrastate traffic to yield its proper share of the earnings of the carriers. Consequently the order of the Commission is void. \n2\n The argument is, in our opinion, unsound.\n Every rate which gives preference or advantage to certain persons, commodities, localities or traffic is discriminatory; for such preference prevents absolute equality of treatment among all shippers or all travelers. But discrimination is not necessarily unlawful. The Act to Regulate Commerce prohibits (by sections 2 and 3) only that discrimination which is unreasonable, undue, or unjust. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 \nU.S. 197, 219\n, 220 S., 16 Sup. Ct. 666; Manufacturers Railroad Co. v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 457, 481\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 383. Whether a preference or discrimination is undue, unreasonable, or unjust is ordinarily left to the Commission for decision; and the determination is to be made, as a question of fact, on the matters proved in the particular case. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Alabama Midland Ry. Co., \n168 \nU.S. 144, 170\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 45. The Commission may conclude that the preference given is not unreasonable, undue or unjust, since it does not, in fact, result in any prejudice or disadvantage to any other person, locality, commodity, or class of traffic. On the other hand, preferential treatment of a class, ordinarily harmless, may become undue, because, under the special circumstances, it results in prejudice, or disadvantage to some other person, commodity, or locality, or to interstate commerce. \n\n[262 U.S. 318, 323]\n\u00a0\n Section 22 must in this matter, as in others, be read in connection with the rest of the act, and be interpreted with due regard to its manifest purpose. Robinson v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n222 \nU.S. 506, 511\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 114.3 Congress did not intend, by this provision concerning reduced rates and free transportation, to create an instrument, by which the carrier was authorized, in its discretion, to subject interstate commerce to undue prejudice, or by which the state was empowered to compel the carriers so to do. The object of the section was to settle, beyond doubt, that the preferential treatment of certain classes of shippers and travelers, in the matters therein recited is not necessarily prohibited. And in this respect its provisions are illustrative, not exclusive. It limits, or defines, the requirement of equality in treatment which is imposed in other sections of the act. By so doing, it preserves the right of the carrier theretofore enjoyed of granting, in its discretion, preferential treatment to particular classes in certain cases. Only in this sense can it be said that the section is permissive. It confers no right upon any shipper or traveler. Nor does it confer any new right upon the carrier.\n The grant of a lower rate on road material to a government, engaged in highway construction, may benefit the government without subjecting to prejudice any person, locality of class of traffic. But a lower rate may result in giving to a single quarry within the state all of the governmental business, so that competing quarries and localities within or without the state, or interstate traffic, would be prejudiced. That such undue discrimination does, and will, result from the order of the Tennessee Commission was expressly found by the Interstate Commerce \n\n[262 U.S. 318, 324]\n\u00a0\n Commission. Its findings are necessarily conclusive, since the evidence on which it acted was not introduced in this suit. Louisiana & Pine Bluff Railway Co. v. United States, \n257 U.S. 114\n, 42 Sup.

Dickey were on the brief.\n\n\n[263 U.S. 403, 411]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a proceeding brought by the United States under the Act of July 2, 1890, c. 647,  4 (26 Stat. 209 [Comp. St.  8823]), to prevent an alleged violation of section 1 (Comp. St.  8820), which forbids combinations in restraint of trade among the States. The defendants are all the manufacturers of handblown window glass, with certain of their officers, and the National Window Glass Workers, a voluntary association, its officers and members, embracing all the labor to be had for this work in the United States. The defendants established a wage scale to be in effect from September 25, 1922, to January 27, 1923, and from January 29, 1923, to June 11, 1923; and the feature that is the object of the present attack is that this scale would be issued to one set of factories for the first period and to another for the second, but that no factory could get it for both, and without it they could not get labor and therefore must stop work. After a hearing a final decree was entered enjoining the defendants from carrying out the above or any similar agreements so far as they might limit and prescribe the time during which the defendant manufacturers should operate their factories for handblown window glass. 287 Fed. 228.\n This agreement does not concern sales or distribution, it is directed only to the way in which union labor, the only labor obtainable it is true, shall be employed in production. If such an agreement can be within the Sherman Act at least it is not necessarily so. United Mine Workers of America v. Coronado Coal Co., \n259 \nU.S. 344, 408\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 570. To determine its legality requires a consideration \n\n[263 U.S. 403, 412]\n\u00a0\n of the particular facts. Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 231, 238\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 242, Ann. Cas. 1918D, 1207\n\n\n The dominant fact in this case is that in the last quarter of a century machines have been brought into use that dispense with the employment of the highly trained blowers and the trained gatherers needed for the handmade glass and in that and other ways have enabled the factories using machines to produce window glass at half the cost of the handmade. The price for the two kinds is the same. It has followed of course that the companies using machines fix the price, that they make much the greater part of the glass in the market, and probably, as was testified for the defendants, that the handmakers are able to keep on only by the sufferance of the others and by working longer hours. The defendants say, and it is altogether likely, that the conditions thus brought about and the nature of the work have driven many laborers away and made it impossible to get new ones; for the work is very trying, requires considerable training, and is always liable to a reduction of wages if the machine industry lowers the price. The only chance for the handworkers has been when and where they could get cheap fuel and therefore their tendency has been to follow the discoveries of natural gas. The defendants contend with a good deal of force that it is absurd to speak of their arrangements as possibly having any effect upon commerce among the States, when manufacturers of this kind obviously are not able to do more than struggle to survive a little longer before they disappear, as human effort always disappears when it is not needed to direct the force that can be got more cheaply from water or coal.\n But that is not all of the defendants' case. There are not twenty- five hundred men at present in the industry. The government says that this is the fault of the union; the defendants with much greater probability that it is the inevitable coming to pass. But wherever the fault, if \n\n[263 U.S. 403, 413]\n\u00a0\n there is any, that is the fact with which the defendants had to deal. There were not men enough to enable the factories to run continuously during the working season, leaving out the two or three summer months in which the heat makes it impossible to go on. To work undermanned costs the same in fuel and overhead expenses as to work fully manned, and therefore means a serious loss. On the other hand the men are less well off with the uncertainties that such a situation brings. The purpose of the arrangement is to secure employment for all the men during the whole of the two seasons, thus to give all the labor available to the factories, and to divide it equally among them. From the view that we take we think it unnecessary to explain how the present system sprang from experience during the war when the Government restricted production to one-half of what it had been and an accident was found of work well, or to do more than advert to the defendants' contention that with the means available the production is increased. It is enough that we see no combination in unreasonable restraint of trade in the arrangements made to meet the short supply of men.\n Decree reversed.\n Petition dismissed. \n\n\n\n","139":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW ORLEANS LAND CO. v. BROTT(1923)\nNo. 64\nArgued: Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles Louque, of New Orleans, La., for New Orleans Land co.\n Mr. Wm. Winans Wall, of New Orleans, La., for Brott and others.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court. \n\n[263 U.S. 97, 98]\n\u00a0\n This is a petitory action for land in New Orleans brought by the Brotts against the New Orleans Land Company. Judgment was given for the Brotts except as to one parcel which was adjudged to belong to the defendant. The defendant brings a writ of error and the Brotts a cross- writ. The ground of the judgment was that the State acquired title to the land under the Swamp Land Act of March 2, 1849, c. 87, 9 Stat. 352, and conveyed it to the plaintiffs' predecessors, except that the parcel awarded to the defendant was held to have been excluded from the Swamp Land grant to the State because before the territory was transferred by France to the United States is had been conveyed to private persons by a complete grant.\n The New Orleans Land Company contends that at the time of the Swamp Land Act all the land in controversy was in private hands and therefore did not pass to the State; the statute providing that the Secretary of the Treasury shall approve the list of swamp lands directed to bemade out 'so far as they are not claimed or held by individuals,' and the list having been approved 'subject to any valid legal rights.' It asks this Court to take jurisdiction on the ground that there is drawn in question the validity of an authority exercised under a state law, that is, the issue of the patent, on the ground that it was repugnant to the Treaty of 1803 with France, 8 Stat. 202, and the laws of the United States, and that the decision upheld the validity of the state patent. It also sets up a prior purchase under a decree of the Circuit Court of the United States, but that contention is disposed of by New Orleans Land Co. v. Leader Realty Co ., \n255 U.S. 266\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 259. The Brotts rely upon alleged errors as to the grants before the treaty and in recognizing a title under them, even if it existed, when the alleged owner had not had it confirmed as required by the Act of March 2, 1805, c. 26,  4, 2 Stat. 324, 326, and later acts. \n\n[263 U.S. 97, 99]\n\u00a0\n The defendant, the Land Company, to make out its case would have to maintain that notwithstanding the unquestionable validity of the Acts of 1805 and later, requiring outstanding titles to be established or registered after Louisiana was acquired by the United States, Botiller v. Dominguez, \n130 U.S. 238\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 525, and notwithstanding the failure of its predecessor in title to comply with the requirement, the land did not pass to the State under the Swamp Land grant if at that time there was any outstanding claim even though the claim turned out to be void. Whatever may be thought of the proposition we cannot deal with it now. No statute of Louisiana has been called to our attention that purports to identify and authorize a conveyance of these particular lands. See La. Stats., March 14, 1855, No. 247; March 16, 1870, No. 38; May 31, 1871, No. 104; Rev. Sts. 1870,  2920. The validity of no statute has been called in question. The conveyances under which the Brotts claim were authorized by state law only if the lands concerned were part of the Swamp Land grant of Louisiana. The general authority to convey such lands is not attacked, but only the specific patent. If by any chance or hiatus the present lands were not embraced the officials who undertook to convey them were not exercising an authority under the State within the rather narrow meaning that necessarily has been given to the phrase in the statute authorizing writs of error. United States v. Lynch, \n137 U.S. 280\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 114; Cook County v. Calumet & Chicago Canal & Dock Co., \n138 U.S. 635\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 435; French v. Taylor, \n199 \nU.S. 274, 277\n, 26 S. Sup.

St.  1214). It follows that the New Orleans Land Company's writ of error must be dismissed.\n The cross-writ taken out by the Brotts also must be dismissed. There very well may have been ground for a writ of certiorari but there is no suggestion that would \n\n[263 U.S. 97, 100]\n\u00a0\n warrant a writ of error under the amendment of section 237 of the Judicial Code by the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, just cited. The Supreme Court of the State may have unduly limited the Act of Congress of March 2, 1805, but did not dispute its binding effect.\n Writs of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","140":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOKLAHOMA NATURAL GAS CO. v.

Ratliff, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellees Corporation Commission and others.\n Mr. Henry G. Snyder, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellees Russell and others.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two cases were argued separately, but they turn on the same point, were decided in a single opinion by the Court below and do not require a separate consideration here. The plaintiffs are corporations organized under the laws of Oklahoma and furnish natural gas to consumers in that State, at rates established by the Corporation Commission. They applied to the Commission for higher rates but were denied an advance. The Constitution of Oklahoma, admitted to be like that of Virginia dealt with in Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 U.S. 210\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 67, gives an appeal to the Supreme Court of the State, acting in a legislative capacity as explained in the case cited, with power to substitute a different order and to grant a supersedeas in the meantime. Appeals were taken to the Supreme Court and supersedeas was applied for but refused. The appeals are still not decided. After the plaintiffs had been denied a supersedeas by the Supreme Court, they filed these bills alleging that the present rates are confiscatory, setting up their constitutional rights and asking preliminary injunctions, and permanent injunctions unless the Supreme Court should allow adequate rates. Applications for temporary injunctions supported by evidence \n\n[261 U.S. 290, 292]\n\u00a0\n were heard by three judges but were denied by the majority on the authority of the Prentis Case. Appeals were taken directly to this Court.\n A doubt has been suggested whether these cases are within section 266 of the Judicial Code, Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1087, 1162, as amended by the Act of March 4, 1913, c. 160, 37 Stat. 1013 (Comp. St.  1243). The section originally forbade interlocutory injunctions restraining the action of state officers in the enforcement or execution of any statute of a State, upon the ground of its unconstitutionality, without a hearing by three judges. The amendment inserted after the words 'enforcement or execution of such statute' the words 'or in the enforcement or execution of an order made by an administrative board or ommission acting under and pursuant to the statutes of such State' but did not change the statement of the ground, which still reads 'the unconstitutionality of such statute.' So if the section is construed with narrow precision it may be argued that the unconstitutionality of the order is not enough. But this Court has assumed repeatedly that the section was to be taken more broadly. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Finn, \n235 \nU.S. 601, 604\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 146; Phoenix Ry. Co. v.

The amendment seems to have been introduced to prevent any question that such orders were within the section. It was superfluous, as the original statute covered them. Louisville & Nashville R. R.

Railroad Commission of Indiana, \n221 \nU.S. 400, 403\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 537. But it plainly was intended to enlarge not to restrict the law. We mention the matter simply to put doubts to rest. \n\n[261 U.S. 290, 293]\n\u00a0\n Coming to the principal question, if the plaintiffs respectively can make out their case, as must be assumed for present purposes, they are suffering daily from confiscation under the rate to which they now are limited. They have done all that they can under the state law to get relief and cannot get it. If the Supreme Court of the State hereafter shall change the rate, even nunc pro tunc, the plaintiffs will have no adequate remedy for what they may have lost before the Court shall have acted. Springfield Gas & Electric Co. v. Barker (D. C.) 231 Fed. 331, 335. In such a state of facts Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co. has no application. See Love v. Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. co., 185 Fed. 321, 324, 325, 107 C. C. A. 403. Rules of comity or convenience must give way to constitutional rights. In the case cited there was no doubt as to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court but simply a decision that the bills should be retained to await the result of appeals if the companies saw fit to take them. \n211 U.S. 232\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 67. The companies had made no effort to secure a revision and there had been no present invasion upon their rights, but only the taking of preliminary steps toward cutting them down. In such circumstances it was thought to be more reasonable and proper to await further action on the part of the State.\n As in our opinion the District Court had jurisdiction and a duty to try the question whether preliminary injunctions should issue, and as that question has not yet been considered, the cases should be remanded to that Court with directions to proceed to the trial. Generally it is not desirable that we should pass upon such matters until they have been dealt with below. Lutcher & Moore Lumber Co. v. Knight, \n217 \nU.S. 257, 267\n, 268 S., 30 Sup.

Ryan, both of St. Paul, Minn., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are suits to restrain and prevent the enforcement of a taxing act adopted by the state of Minnesota, April 11, 1921. Chapter 223, Laws 1921. The principal sections of the act are copied in the margin1 and may be summarized as follows: The first subjects all who are 'engaged in the business of mining or producing iron ore or other \n\n[262 U.S. 172, 175]\n\u00a0\n ores' within the state to the payment in each year of 'an occupation tax' equal to 6 per cent. of the value of the ore mined or produced during the preceding year-such tax to be 'in addition to all other taxes.' The second directs that the tax be computed on the value of the ore at the place where it is 'brought to the surface of the earth' less certain deductions to be noticed presently. The third requires all who are engaged in such business to make on or before the 1st of February in each year a true report under oath of relevant information respecting their mining operations during the preceding year. And the sixth provides that, where such a report is not made, the State Tax Commission shall determine, from such information as it may possess or obtain, the amount and\n___ 'Sec. 6. If any person, subject of this act, shall fail to make the report provided for in section 3 hereof at the time and in the manner therein provided, the Tax Commission shall in such case, upon such information as it may possess or obtain, ascertain the kind and amount of ore mined or produced, together with the valuation thereof, and shall thereon find and determine the amount of the tax due from such person, and there shall be added thereto a penalty for failure to report, which penalty shall equal ten per cent. of the tax imposed and shall be treated as a part thereof.' \n\n[262 U.S. 172, 176]\n\u00a0\n value of the ore, and shall compute the tax and include therein a penalty of 10 per cent. for the failure to make the report.\n The plaintiffs are corporations engaged in the business of mining or producing iron ore from mines within the state, and the defendants are the officers designated to carry the act into effect.\n Preparatory to assessing the tax in 1922 the defendants requested the plaintiffs to make the prescribed reports of their mining operations during 1921, which the plaintiffs refused to do because they conceived that the act was invalid. The defendants then proceeded to take the requisite steps for imposing the tax, and the plaintiffs brought these suits to restrain and prevent such action on the grounds that the act and the tax about to be imposed were in conflict with the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and with a clause in section 1 of article 9 of the state Constitution providing:\n'Taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects.'\n\n The cases were heard together on an agreed statement of facts and some supplemental evidence which was free from conflict. One of the matters stipulated was that the suits were brought in circumstances making them cognizable in equity. The District Court sustained the act and the tax and dismissed the suits on the merits. The cases are here on direct appeals by the plaintiffs under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St .  1215).\n The parties differ about the nature of the tax; the plaintiffs insisting it is a property tax, and the defendants that it is an occupation tax. Both treat the question as affecting the solution of other contentions. There has been no ruling on the point by the Supreme Court of the state. We think the tax in its essence is what the act calls it-an occupation tax. It is not laid on the land containing the ore, nor on the ore after removal, but on \n\n[262 U.S. 172, 177]\n\u00a0\n the business of mining the ore, which consists in severing it from its natural bed and bringing it to the surface where it can become an article of commerce and be utilized in the industrial arts. Mining is a well- recognized business, wherein capital and labor are extensively employed. This is particularly true in Minnesota. Obviously a tax laid on those who are engaged in that business, and laid on them solely because they are so engaged, as is the case here, is an occupation tax. It does not differ materially from a tax on those who engage in manufacturing. Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, \n231 \nU.S. 399, 414\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 136; Stanton v.

But that case is not in point. The tax there considered, as the opinion shows (\n255 U.S. 292\n-294, 41 Sup. Ct. 272), was not laid on any business, but on the mere exertion by an owner of distilled spirits of his right to withdraw them from a bonded warehouse, and had 'none of the ordinary incidents of an occupation tax.'\n We shall therefore treat the tax as an occupation tax in dealing with the contentions presented.\n The chief contention is that mining as conducted by the plaintiffs, if not actually a part of interstate commerce, is no closely connected therewith that to tax it is to burden or interfere with such commerce, which a state cannot do consistently with the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States.\n The facts on which the contention rests are as follows: The demand or market within the state for iron ore covers only a negligible percentage of what is mined by the plaintiffs. \n2\n Practically all of their output is mined to fill existing contracts with consumers outside the state \n\n[262 U.S. 172, 178]\n\u00a0\n and passes at once into the channels of interstate commerce. Three-fourths of it is from open pit mines and one-fourth from underground mines. At the open pit mines empty cars are run from adjacent railroad yards into the mines and there loaded. Steam shovels sever the ore from its natural bed and lift it directly into the cars. When loaded the cars are promptly returned to the railroad yards, where they are put into trains which start the ore on its interstate journey. The several steps follow in such succession that there is practical continuity of movement from the time the ore is severed from its natural bed. The operations within the mine and the movement of the cars into and out of the mine are conducted by the plaintiffs. The subsequent transportation is by public carriers. At the underground mines the plaintiffs dig the ore, bring it to the surface through shafts and put it in elevated pockets where it readily can be loaded into cars. The subsequent movements are much the same as at the open pit mines, but their continuity is not so pronounced. Some of the ore from both kinds of mines-between 10 and 20 per cent.-is concentrated by washing or beneficiated after coming out of the mine and before starting out of the state, but our conclusion respecting the usual operations renders this deflection immaterial.\n Plainly the facts do not support the contention. Mining is not interstate commerce, but like manufacturing, is a local business, subject to local regulation and taxation. Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1, 20\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 6; Capital Dairy Co. v.

Its character in this regard is intrinsic, is not affected by the intended use or disposal of the product, is not controlled by contractual engagements, and persists even though the \n\n[262 U.S. 172, 179]\n\u00a0\n business be conducted in close connection with interstate commerce.

Ct. 83, 67 L. Ed. --.\n The ore does not enter interstate commerce until after the mining is done, and the tax is imposed only in respect of the mining. No discrimination against interstate commerce is involved. The tax may indirectly and incidentally affect such commerce, Just as any taxation of railroad and telegraph lines does, but this is not a forbidden burden or interference.\n The contentions made under the equal protection provision of the Fourteenth Amendment and under the state constitutional provision that 'taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects' present a question or classification and have been argued together.\n Consistently with both provisions, the Legislature of the state may exercise a wide discretion in selecting the subjects of taxation, particularly as respects occupation taxes. It may select those who are engaged in one class of business and exclude others, if all similarly situated are brought within the class and all members of the class are dealt with according to uniform rules. Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 \nU.S. 114, 121\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 496; State ex rel. v. Parr, 109 Minn. 147, 152, 123 N. W. 408, 134 Am. St. Rep. 759. Here the selection is of all who are engaged in mining or producing ores on their own account; that is to say, as owners or lessees. The selection seems to be an admissible one, so we turn to the objections urged against it.\n One is that contractors who strip off the overburden of soil, gravel, etc., in open pit mines, other contractors who \n\n[262 U.S. 172, 180]\n\u00a0\n load the ore in such mines into cars, and still others, usually four in a group, who take ore out of underground mines, are not included. But none of these are engaged in mining on their own account. Instead, they are working for those who are so engaged. However important their service, they are not principals in the business, but employees; and their pay, whatever it be, is part of the expense of the business. Their omission has a reasonable basis.\n Another objection is that all owners and lessees who mine or produce ore are included, while those who do extensive development work, but remove no ore, are omitted. This is not fairly subject to criticism. Equality does not require that unproductive mining be taxed along with productive mining. Besides, if ore is uncovered or made accessible by such development work, the tax will be imposed when the ore is mined.\n Among the deductions which the act provides shall be made from the value of the ore before computing the tax is 'the amount of royalties paid on the ore mined and produced during the year.' This provision is assailed as working a serious discrimination in favor of those who operate under leases and pay royalties, as all the lessees do, and against owners who operate their own mines and pay no royalties. The question is an important one, and has not been before the Supreme Court of the state. It apparently requires a construction of the particular provision along with other parts of the act, and possibly of the state constitutional provision. After that it may be that there would be need for turning to the Fourteenth Amendment. 'Only those whose rights are directly affected can properly question the constitutionality of a state statute and invoke our jurisdiction in respect thereto.' Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 621\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 140, 142 (59 L. Ed. 385); Hatch v. Reardon, \n204 \nU.S. 152, 160\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 188, 9 Ann. Cas. 736; Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n23 \nU.S. 531, 544\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 359. The record shows that of the many iron mines in the state all but six are operated \n\n[262 U.S. 172, 181]\n\u00a0\n under leases, and that none of the six was operated in any way during 1921, the year in respect of which the tax was about to be imposed when these suits were begun. Therefore no tax could be imposed in respect of the six mines based on that year's operations, and it is made plain that the defendants have no purpose to impose one. It cannot be merely assumed that mining has been resumed at those mines, nor that any tax in respect of them for later years is now threatened. The situation in these cases is therefore such that none of the plaintiffs is entitled to invoke a decision of the question. We accordingly leave it entirely open.\n It also is said that the royalty provision and others respecting deductions will work a discrimination as between different lessees in that some will be subjected to a higher tax than others. No doubt there will be differences in the amount, but they will result from differences in situation and not from differences in treatment. Some lessees pay higher royalties than others and will secure a higher deduction on that score. Some are subjected to greater expense in mining than others and will secure reductions accordingly. And some are subjected to higher local taxes on their mines than others-the mines being scattered through several counties and minor municipal subdivisions-and this will cause the deductions to vary. But all lessees will have the benefit of deductions adjusted to the royalties, expenses and taxes actually paid; and the value of the ore, according to which the tax will be computed, will in each instance be its actual value when it is brought out of the mine less those deductions. In short, the tax is to be adjusted to the value of the output less the major expenses of the business, and this according to uniform rules. We therefore cannot say that it is intended to or will work any arbitrary or unreasonable discrimination as between different lessees.\n Decrees affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Section 1.

U S(1923)\nNo. 229\nArgued: March 1, 1923Decided: April 9, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. Geo. Maurice Morris, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.[ Omnia Commercial Co. v. U S \n261 U.S. 502\n (1923) ]\n\n\n[261 U.S. 502, 507]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Riter, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, on May 19, 19 7, by assignment, became the owner of a contract, by which it acquired the right to purchase a large quantity of steel plate from the Allegheny Steel Company, of Pittsburgh, at a price under the market. The contract was of great value, and if carried out would have produced large profits.\n In October, 1917, before any deliveries had been made, the United States government requisitioned the steel company's entire production of steel plate for the year 1918, and directed that company not to comply with the terms of appellant's contract, declaring that if an attempt was made to do so the entire plant of the steel company would be taken over and operated for the public use.\n Appellant brought an action in the Court of Claims alleging, in addition to the foregoing, that by the orders \n\n[261 U.S. 502, 508]\n\u00a0\n of the government the performance of the contract by the steel company had been rendered unlawful and impossible; that the effect was to take for the public use appellant's right of priority to the steel plate expected to be produced by the steel company and thereby appropriate for public use appellant's property in the contract. As a result it alleged that it had incurred losses in a large sum which it sought to recover, as just compensation, by virtue of article 5 of the Amendments to the Constitution. To this petition the United States interposed a demurrer, which was sustained, and the petition dismissed. From this judgment the case comes here by appeal.\n A question is raised as to the statutory authority of the officer, who made the order of requisition and gave the directions respecting noncompliance with the contract, to bind the government; but, for the purposes of the case, we assume he was authorized, as he could have been under 39 Stat. 1193, c. 180 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/16 b, 3115 1\/16 c), or 40 Stat. 182, 183, c. 29 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/16 d). We also pass, without deciding, a contention challenging the sufficiency of the complaint and come to the case on the merits.\n The contract in question was property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment (Long Island Water Supply Co. v. Brooklyn, \n166 \nU.S. 685, 690\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 718; Cincinnati v. Louisville & Nashville Ry. Co., \n223 \nU.S. 390, 400\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 267), and if taken for public use the government would be liable. But destruction of, or injury to, property is frequently accomplished without a 'taking' in the constitutional sense. To prevent the spreading of a fire, property may be destroyed without compensation to the owner, Bowditch v. Boston, \n101 U.S. 16\n, 18, a doctrine perhaps to some extent resting on tradition. Pennsylvania Coal Co., Inc., v. Mahon, \n260 U.S. 393\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 158, 67 L. Ed. --, December 11, 1922\n\n\n There are many laws and governmental operations which injuriously affect the value of or destroy property-for example, restrictions upon the height or character of buildings, destruction of diseased \n\n[261 U.S. 502, 509]\n\u00a0\n cattle, trees, etc., to prevent contagion-but for which no remedy is afforded. Contracts in this respect do not differ from other kinds of property. See Calhoun v. Massie, \n253 U.S. 170\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 474, where an act of Congress invalidating contracts made with attorneys for compensation exceeding a certain percentage for the prosecution of claims against the government was sustained, although it had the effect of putting an end to an existing contract. This court said (\n253 \nU.S. 175, 176\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 476):\n'An appropriate exercise by a state of its police power is consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment, although it results in serious depreciation of property values, and the United States may, consistently with the Fifth Amendment, impose for a permitted purpose, restrictions upon property which produce like results. Lottery Case, \n188 U.S. 321\n, 357; Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, \n220 U.S. 45\n, 58; Hoke v. United States, \n227 U.S. 30\n , 323; Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., \n251 U.S. 146\n. The sovereign right of the government is not less because the property affected happens to be a contract. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Mottley, \n219 U.S. 467\n, 484; Union Dry Goods Company v. Georgia Public Service Corporation, \n248 U.S. 372\n.'\n\n In Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Mottley, \n219 U.S. 467\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 265, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 671, it was held that an act of Congress, prohibiting the issuance of free transportation by interstate common carriers, which invalidated a contract for transportation previously entered into and valid when made, did not have the effect of taking private property without compensation. The court, speaking through Mr. Justice Harlan, said (\n219 U.S. 484\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 271, 34 L. R. A. [N. S.] 671):\n'It is not determinative of the present question that the commerce act as now construed will render the contract of no value for the purposes for which it was made. In Knox v. Lee, 12 Wall. 457, above cited, the court, referring \n\n[261 U.S. 502, 510]\n\u00a0\n to the Fifth Amendment, which forbids the taking of private property for public use without just compensation or due process of law, said: 'That provision has always been understood as referring only to a direct appropriation, and not to consequential injuries resulting from the exercise of lawful power. It has never been supposed to have any bearing upon or to inhibit laws that indirectly work harm and loss to individuals. A new tariff, an embargo, a draft, or a war, may inevitably bring upon individuals great losses; may, indeed, render valuable property almost valueless. They may destroy the worth of contracts.\"\n\n The conclusion to be drawn from these and other cases which might be cited is that for consequential loss or injury resulting from lawful governmental action the law affords no remedy. The character of the power exercised is not material. C., B. & Q. Railway v. Drainage Com'rs, \n200 U.S. 561\n, 583-585, 592, 593, 26 Sup. Ct. 341, 4 Ann. Cas. 1175. If, under any power, a contract or other property is taken for public use, the government is liable; but, if injured or destroyed by lawful action, without a taking, the government is not liable. What was here requisitioned was the future product of the steel company, and, since this product in the absence of governmental interference would have been delivered in fulfillment of the contract, the contention seems to be that the contract was so far identified with it that the taking of the former, ipso facto, took the latter. This, however, is to confound the contract with its subject-matter. The essence of every executory contract is the obligation which the law imposes upon the parties to perform it. 'It [the contract] may be defined to be a transaction between two or more persons, in which each party comes under an obligation to the other, and each reciprocally acquires a right to whatever is promised by the other.' Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 629, 654 (4 L. Ed. 629). Plainly here there was \n\n[261 U.S. 502, 511]\n\u00a0\n no acquisition of the obligation or the right to enforce it. If the steel company had failed to comply with the requisition, what would have been the remedy? Not enforcement of the contract, but enforcement of the statute. If the government had failed to pay for what it got, what would have been the right of the steel company? Not to the price fixed by the contract, but to the just compensation guaranteed by the Constitution.\n In exercising the power to requisition, the government dealt only with the steel company, which company thereupon became liable to deliver its product to the government, by virtue of the statute and in response to the order. As a result of this lawful governmental action the performance of the contract was rendered impossible. It was not appropriated, but ended.\n Parties and a subject-matter are necessary to the existence of a contract, but neither constitutes any part of it; the contract consists in the agr ement and obligation to perform. If one makes a contract for the personal services of another, or for the sale and delivery of property, the government, by drafting one of the parties into the army, or by requisitioning the subject-matter, does not thereby take the contract. In Marshall v. Glanvill et al., \n\n[261 U.S. 502, 1917]\n\u00a0\n L. R. 2 K. B. 87, the plaintiff had been employed by the defendants upon a contract of service. While the agreement was in force the former was called into the military service. It was held that this put an end to the contract. The court said:\n'Here the parties clearly made their bargain on the footing that it should continue lawful for the plaintiff to render and for the defendants to accept his services. The rendering and acceptance of these services ceased to be lawful in July, 1916, and thereupon the bargain came to an end.'\n\n The American and English cases all agree that the result is the same where the subjectmatter of the contract \n\n[261 U.S. 502, 512]\n\u00a0\n is requisitioned. Tex. as Co. v. Hogarth Shipping Co., \n256 U.S. 619\n, 629- 631, 41 Sup. Ct. 612; The Claveresk (C. C. A.) 264 Fed. 276, 282-284; The Frankmere (D. C.) 262 Fed. 819, 822.

App. Cases, 435, 445.\n In The Frankmere, supra, where a ship under charter was requisitioned by the British government, the court said that:\n'... The contract was thereby frustrated when the government to took possession of the ship, and the rights of the charterer were absolutely ended and terminated, and those of the owner, subject, however, to the paramount power of the government to use the ship, without consulting the desire of the owner, revived, as though the charter had never been entered into.'\n\n In Re Shipton, supra, a parcel of wheat then lying in a warehouse was sold, for future payment and delivery. The wheat was subsequently requisitioned by the English government, and, in consequence, the sellers were unable to deliver. A claim for damages was put forward against the sellers, but the Court of King's Bench Division held that they were not liable, upon the ground that performance had become impossible without their fault. Darling, Justice, agreeing with the opinion of Lord Reading, said (pages 683, 684):\n'If one contracts to do what is then illegal, the contract itself is altogether bad. If after the contract has been made it cannot be performed without what is illegal being done, there is no obligation to perform it. In the one case the making of the contract, in the other case the performance of it, is against public policy. It must be here presumed that the crown acted legally, and there is no contention to the contrary. We are in a state of war; that is notorious. The subject-matter of this contract \n\n[261 U.S. 502, 513]\n\u00a0\n has been seized by the state acting for the general good. 'Salus populi suprema lex' is a good maxim, and the enforcement of that essential law gives no right of action to whomsoever may be injured by it.'\n\n In the present case the effect of the requisition was to bring the contract to an end, not to keep it alive for the use of the government.\n The government took over during the war railroads, steel mills, shipyards, telephone and telegraph lines, the capacity output of factories and other producing activities. If appellant's contention is sound, the government thereby took and became liable to pay for an appalling number of existing contracts for future service or delivery, the performance of which its action made impossible. This is inadmissible. Frustration and appropriation are essentially different things.\n There is nothing in Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, \n148 U.S. 312\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 622, or in the other cases cited by appellant, which in any way conflicts with what we have said.\n In the Monongahela Case the property which was taken was a lock and dam, built by the company, p rsuant to the invitation of the United States and the state of Pennsylvania, the latter, in consideration, giving the company a franchise to exact tolls. The franchise, therefore, was not merely a contract in respect of the property taken, but was an integral part of it, and this court (\n148 U.S. 329\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 627) said:\n'So, before this property can be taken away from its owners, the whole value must be paid; and that value depends largely upon the productiveness of the property, the franchise to take tolls.'\n\n The lock and dam constituted, in effect, a going concern, whose value was of course affected by what it would produce. Moreover, the case rested primarily upon the doctrine of estoppel, as this court has in several cases since \n\n[261 U.S. 502, 514]\n\u00a0\n pointed out. Greenleaf-Johnson Lumber Co. v. Garrison, \n237 \nU.S. 251, 264\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 551; Oyster Co. v. Briggs, \n229 U.S. 82\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 679, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 232.\n In Long Island Water Supply Co. v. Brooklyn, \n166 U.S. 685\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 718, the statute providing for condemnation expressly included contracts, and these were in fact taken and compensation therefor specifically allowed. This was pointed out in the opinion of this court ( \n166 U.S. 691\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 720):\n'In other words, the condemnation proceedings did not repudiate the contract, but appropriated it and fixed its value.'\n\n We have examined the other cases relied upon, but find nothing to justify a conclusion other than that which we have reached.\n The judgment of the court below is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","143":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOSAKA SHOSEN KAISHA v.

Ct. 491; Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 U.S. 205\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900; Union Fish Co. v. Erickson, \n248 U.S. 308\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 112.\n Both courts below acted upon the view that while the ship is not liable in rem for breaches of an affreightment contract so long as it remains wholly executory, she becomes liable therefor whenever she partly executes it, as by taking on board some part of the cargo. In support of this view, it is said: Early decisions of our circuit and district courts held that under maritime law the ship is liable in rem for any breach of a contract of affreightment with owner or master. That The Freeman (1856) 18 How. 182, 188, and The Yankee Blade (1857) 19 How. 82, 89, 90, 91, modified this doctrine by denying such liability where the contract remains purely executory, but left it in full force where the vessel has partly performed the agreement, as by accepting part of the indicated cargo. The Hermitage, 12 Fed. Cas. 27, No. 6,410; The Williams, 29 Fed. Cas. 1342, No. 17,710; The Ira Chaffee (C. C.) 2 Fed. 401; The Director (D. C.) 26 Fed. 708; The Starlight (C. C.) 42 Fed. 167; The Oscoda (D. C.) 66 Fed. 347; The Helios (D. C.) 108 Fed. 279; The Oceano (D. C.) 148 Fed. 131; Wilson v. Peninsula Bark & Lumber Co., 188 Fed. 52, 110 C. C. A. 190, were cited. \n\n[260 U.S. 490, 496]\n\u00a0\n We think the argument is unsound.\n Prior to The Freeman and The Yankee Blade, this court had expressed no opinion on the subject; but, so far as the reports show, the lower courts had generally asserted liability of the ship for breaches of affreightment contracts. 'It is grounded upon the authority of the master to contract for the employment of the vessel, and upon the general doctrine of the maritime law, that the vessel is bodily answerable for such contracts of the master made for her benefit.' The Flash, 1 Abbott, 67, 70, Fed. Cas. No. 4,857; The Rebecca, 1 Ware, 188, Fed. Cas. No. 11, 619; The Ira Chaffee, supra. Since 1857, some of the lower courts have said that the ship becomes liable for breaches of affreightment contracts with her owner or master whenever partly executed by her; but it is forcibly maintained that in none of the cases was the point directly involved. The Hermitage, The Williams, The Ira Chaffee, The Director, The Starlight, The Oscoda, The Helios, The Oceano, and Wilson v. Peninsula Bark & Lumber Co., supra.\n The Freeman and The Yankee Blade distinctly rejected the theory of the earlier opinions. They are inconsistent with the doctrine that partial performance may create a privilege or lien upon the vessel. And in so far as the lower courts express approval of this doctrine in their more recent opinions, they fail properly to interpret what has been said here.\n While, perhaps, not essential to the decision, this court, through Mr. Justice Curtis, said in The Freeman:\n'Under the maritime law of the United States the vessel is bound to the cargo, and the cargo to the vessel, for the performance of a contract of affreightment; but the law creates no lien on a vessel as a security for the performance of a contract to transport cargo, until some lawful contract of affreightment is made, and a cargo shipped under it.'\n\n In The Yankee Blade, Mr. Justice Grier, speaking for the court, declared:- \n\n[260 U.S. 490, 497]\n\u00a0\n 'The maritime 'privilege' or lien is adopted from the civil law, and imports a tacit hypothecation of the subject of it. It is a 'jus in re,' without actual possession or any right of possession. It accompanies the property into the hands of a bona fide purchaser. It can be executed and divested only by a proceeding in rem. This sort of proceeding against personal property is unknown to the common law, and is peculiar to the process of courts of admiralty. The foreign and other attachments of property in the state courts, though by analogy loosely termed proceedings in rem, are evidently not within the category. But this privilege or lien, though adhering to the vessel, is a secret one; it may operate to the prejudice of general creditors and purchasers without notice; it is therefore 'stricti juris,' and cannot be extended by construction, analogy, or inference. 'Analogy,' says Pardessus (Droit Civ. vol. 3, 597), 'cannot afford a decisive argument, because privileges are of strict right. They are an exception to the rule by which all creditors have equal rights in the property of their debtor, and an exception should be declared and described in express words; we cannot arrive at it by reasoning from one case to another.' ...\n'Now, it is a doctrine not to be found in any treatise on maritime law that every contract by the owner or master of a vessel, for the future employment of it, hypothecates the vessel for its performance. This lien or privilege is founded on the rule of maritime law as stated by Cleirac (597): 'Le batel est obligee a la marchandise et la marchandise au batel.' The obligation is mutual and reciprocal. The merchandise is bound or hypothecated to the vessel for freight and charges (unless released by the covenants of the charter party), and the vessel to the cargo. The bill of lading usually sets forth the terms of the contract, and shows the duty assumed by the vessel. Where there is a charter party, its \n\n[260 U.S. 490, 498]\n\u00a0\n covenants will define the duties imposed on the ship. Hence it is said (1 Valin, Ordon. de Mar. b. 3, tit. 1, art. 11) that 'the ship, with her tackle, the freight, and the cargo, are respectively bound ( affectee) by the covenants of the charter party.' But this duty of the vessel, to the performance of which the law binds her by hypothecation, is to deliver the cargo at the time and place stipulated in the bill of lading or charter party, without injury or deterioration. If the cargo be not placed on board, it is not bound to the vessel, and the vessel cannot be in default for the nondelivery, in good order, of goods never received on board. Consequently, if the master or owner refuses to perform his contract, or for any other reason the ship does not receive cargo and depart on her voyage according to contract, the charterer has no privilege or maritime lien on the ship for such breach of the contract by the owners, but must resort to his personal action for damages, as in other cases. ... 'And this court has decided, in the case of The Schooner Freeman v. Buckingham, 18 How. 188, that the law creates no lien on a vessel as a security for the performance of a contract to transport cargo, until some lawful contract of affreightment is made, and a cargo shipped under it.\"\n\n In Bulkley, Claimant of the Barque Edwin v. Naumkeag Steam Cotton Co., 24 How, 386, 393 (16 L. Ed. 599), the barque was libeled to recover damages for not delivering part of the cotton-707 bales-which the master had agreed to carry from Mobile to Boston. With most of the cargo on board the vessel was towed below the bar, there to receive the remainder from lighters. A lighter carrying 100 bales sank, and the cotton was lost or damaged. The barque delivered 607 bales at Boston in good condition. The owner of the vessel claimed exemption for her upon the ground that she never received the 100 bales. This court said:\n'In the present case the cargo was delivered \n\n[260 U.S. 490, 499]\n\u00a0\n in pursuance of the contract, the goods in the custody of the master, and subject to his lien for freight, as effectually as if they had been upon the deck of the ship, the contract confessedly binding both the owner and the shipper; and, unless it be held that the latter is entitled to his lien upon the vessel also, he is deprived of one of the privileges of the contract, when, at the same time, the owner is in the full enjoyment of all those belonging to his side of it.'\n\n Later opinions approve the same general rule.\n'The doctrine that the obligation between ship and cargo is mutual and reciprocal, and does not attach until the cargo is on board, or in the custody of the master, has been so often discussed and so long settled, that it would be useless labor to restate it, or the principles which lie at its foundation. The case of the Schooner Freeman v. Buckingham, decided by this court, is decisive of this case.' The Lady Franklin, 8 Wall. 325, 329 (19 L. Ed. 455).\n\n'It is a principle of maritime law that the owner of the cargo has a lien on the vessel for any injury he may sustain by the fault of the vessel or the master; but the law creates no lien on a vessel as a security for the performance of a contract to transport a cargo until some lawful contract of affreightment is made, and the cargo to which it relates has been delivered to the custody of the master or some one authorized to receive it.' The Keokuk, 9 Wall. 517, 519 (19 L. Ed. 744).\n\n The maritime privilege or lien, though adhering to the vessel, is a secret one which may operate to the prejudice of general creditors and purchasers without notice and is therefore stricti juris and cannot be extended by construction, analogy or inference. The Yankee Blade, supra. The contract of affreightment itself creates no lien, and this court has consistently declared that the obligation between ship and cargo is mutual and reciprocal and does not attach until the cargo is on board or in \n\n[260 U.S. 490, 500]\n\u00a0\n the master's custody. We think the lien created by the law must be mutual and reciprocal; the lien of the cargo owner upon the ship is limited by the corresponding and reciprocal rights of the shipowner upon the cargo. See The Thomas P. Sheldon (D. C.) 113 Fed. 779, 782, 783.\n The theory that partial acceptance of the designated cargo under a contract of affreightment creates a privilege of lien upon the ship for damages resulting from failure to take all, is inconsistent with the opinions of this court and, we think, without support of adequate authority. In The S. L. Watson, 118 Fed. 945, 952, 55 C. C. A. 439, 446, the court well said:\n'The rule of admiralty, as always stated, is that the cargo is bound to the ship and the ship to the cargo. Whatever cases may have been decided otherwise disregarded the universal fact that no lien arises in admiralty except in connection with some visible occurence relating to the vessel or cargo or to a person injured. This is necessary in order that innocent parties dealing with vessels may not be the losers by secret liens, the existence of which they have no possibility of detecting by any relation to any visible fact. It is in harmony with this rule that no lien lies in behalf of a vessel against her cargo for dead freight, or against a vessel for supplies contracted for, but not actually put aboard. The Kiersage, 2 Curt. 421, Fed. Cas. No. 7,762; Pars. Ship. & Adm. (1869) 142, 143. It follows out the same principle that Mr. Justice Curtis states in The Kiersage, 2 Curt. 424, Fed. Cas. No. 7,762, that admiralty liens are stricti juris, and that they cannot be extended argumentatively, or by analogy or inference. He says: 'They must be given by the law itself, and the case must be found described in the law.\"\n\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","144":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPACKARD v. BANTON(1923)\nNo. 126\nArgued: January 2, 1924Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n 3. \nWe come then, to the question whether the statute assailed contravenes the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. That the selection of cities of the first class for the application of the regulations and the exclusion of all others is not an unreasonable and arbitrary classification does not admit of controversy. Hayes v. Missouri, \n120 U.S. 68\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 350. We cannot say that there are not reasons applicable to the streets of large cities-such as \n\n[264 U.S. 140, 144]\n\u00a0\n their use by a great number of persons or the density and continuity of traffic-justifying measures to safeguard the public from dangers incident to the operation of motor vehicles which do not obtain in the case of the smaller communities.\n The contention most pressed is that the act unreasonably and arbitrarily discriminates against those engaged in operating motor vehicles for hire in favor of persons operating such vehicles for their private ends, and in favor of street cars and motor omnibuses. If the state determines that the use of streets for private purposes in the usual and ordinary manner shall be preferred over their use by common carriers for hire, there is nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment to prevent. The streets belong to the public and are primarily for the use of the public in the ordinary way. Their use for the purposes of gain is special and extraordinary, and, generally at least, may be prohibited or conditioned as the Legislature deems proper. Neither is there substance in the complaint that street cars and omnibuses are not included in the requirements of the statute. The reason, appearing in the statute itself, for excluding them is that they are regulated by the Public Service Commission Laws, and this circumstance, if there were nothing more, would preclude us from saying that their noninclusion renders the classification so arbitrary as to cause it to be obnoxious to the equal protection clause. Decisions sustaining the validity of legislation like that here involved are numerous and substantially uniform. Among them we cite the following: Nolen v. Riechman (D. C.) 225 Fed. 812, 818; Schoenfeld v. Seattle (D. C.) 265 Fed. 726, 730; Lane v. Whitaker (D. C.) 275 Fed. 476, 480; Huston v City, 176 Iowa, 455, 468, 156 N. W. 883; City of Memphis v.

Supp. 28, where the statute now under review was sustained against the attacks here made as to its constitutionality. And see Fifth Avenue Coach Co. v. New York, \n221 U.S. 467\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 709; Pacific Express Co. v. Seibert, \n142 \nU.S. 339, 353\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 250\n\n\n It is asserted that the requirements of the statute are so burdensome as to amount to confiscation, and therefore to result in depriving appellant of his property without due process of law. The allegation is that the rate of premium fixed by insurance companies operating in New York amounts to about $18.50 per week for each taxicab, while the net income from each is about $35 per week. The operator, under the statute, however, is not confined to this method of security, but instead may file either a personal bond with two approved sureties or a corporate surety bond. Appellant says that he cannot procure a personal bond, but it does not appear that he might not procure the corporate surety bond at a less cost. Affidavits filed below on behalf of appellees tend to show that insurance policies in mutual casualty companies may be secured for $540 a year, and that operators of upwards of a thousand cars have furnished personal bonds. The fact that, because of circumstances peculiar to him, appellant may be unable to comply with the requirement as to security without assuming a burden greater than that generally borne, or excessive in itself, does not militate against the constitutionality of the statute. Moreover, a distinction must be observed between the regulation of an activity which may be engaged in as a matter of right and one carried on by government sufferance or permission. In the latter case the power to exclude altogether generally includes the lesser power to condition and may justify a degree of regulation not admissible in the former. See Davis v. Massachusetts, \n167 U.S. 43\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 731.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPAGE CO. v. MACDONALD(1923)\nNo. 308\nArgued: March 13, 1923Decided: April 9, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. Asa P. French, of Boston, Mass., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Weld A. Rollins, of Boston, Mass., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Page Company brought suit in the District Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts against the defendant in error for libel, constituted, it was alleged, by allegations in a certain bill of complaint which was filed by her against that company in a superior court of Massachusetts.\n A question of jurisdiction in the sense of immunity from process is presented. Plaintiff in error is a Massa chusetts \n\n[261 U.S. 446, 447]\n\u00a0\n corporation; defendant in error, a resident and citizen of Leaksdale, Ontario, Canada.\n The Page Company brought this suit against defendant in error, alleging her suit against it, the Page Company, was a deliberate and malicious libel; its statements having been made 'with full information and knowledge that they were false,' and for the purpose of injuring the company's reputation. Damages were prayed.\n The facts are stipulated and are condensed by the District Court as follows:\n'The facts on which this plea is grounded are not in dispute: Mrs. Macdonald brought a suit in equity against the Page Company in t e state court. The Page Company, claiming that certain statements made by her in the bill were libelous and actionable, brought the present action at law against Mrs. Macdonald in this court; and service was made upon her while she was in the district 'in attendance before a special master appointed by the superior court to hear the parties and their evidence' ... in the other case. She has pleaded in abatement of this action that she was immune from service while within the district for the purpose stated.'\n\n The court decided 'that the plea in abatement is good and that the action must be abated'-citing Stewart v. Ramsay, \n242 U.S. 128\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 44; Larned v. Griffin (C. C.) 12 Fed. 590; Diamond v. Earle, 217 Mass. 499, 105 N. E. 363, 51 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1178, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 984.\n The Page Company, contesting the ruling and the application of the cases cited to sustain it, contends that immunity cannot be claimed and sustained from the judicial process of a different sovereignty.\n In Diamond v. Earle and Stewart v. Ramsay, it is said both courts were exercising jurisdiction conferred by the same sovereignty. It is, necessarily, a condition of the contention, that the federal court in Massachusetts is a foreign court within the principle.\n We are unable to concur. A federal court in a state is not foreign and antagonistic to a court of the state \n\n[261 U.S. 446, 448]\n\u00a0\n within the principle and, therefore, as said in Stewart v. Ramsay, supra:\n'Suitors as well as witnesses, coming from another state or jurisdiction, are exempt from the service of civil process while in attendance upon court, and during a reasonable time in coming and going.'\n\n And we can add nothing to what is said in support of the rule. 'It is founded,' it is said, 'in the necessities of the judicial administration,' and the courts, federal and state, have equal interest in those necessities. They are both instruments of judicial administration within the same territory, available to suitors, fully available, neither they nor their witnesses subject to be embarrassed or vexed while attending, the one 'for the protection of his rights'; the others 'while attending to testify.'\n The next contention of the Page Company is that defendant in error 'forfeited her right to claim and obtain immunity from the service here questioned by using the state court as a medium for the publication of a deliberate and malicious libel concerning this plaintiff [the Page Company] as to matters not material to any issue raised by the bill in her suit against this plaintiff, to testify in which she came to Massachusetts.' It must be assumed, is the further contention, to be a libel, 'a continuing tort, potentially and actually working injury to the plaintiff down to and at the moment of the service upon defendant of the process in this suit.'\n The contention has strength upon first impression which disappears upon reflection of the purpose of the principle and the necessity of its inflexibility. The service of process is upon the individual but the exemption from its requirement is something more than a privilege to him. It is 'the privilege of the court,' we have seen, rather than his. 'It is founded in the necessities of the judicial administration.' Besides, it cannot be assumed as plaintiff in error does, that the pleading in her suit against plaintiff in error was false and a tort, and on that \n\n[261 U.S. 446, 449]\n\u00a0\n assumption deny her the immunity to which she is entitled. The truth or falsity of the pleadings is not to be assumed; it is to be established.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","146":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPENNSYLVANIA R. CO. v. U S RAILROAD LABOR BOARD(1923)\nNo. 585\nArgued: January 11, 1923Decided: February 19, 1923\n\n\n\n This case involves the construction of title 3 of the Transportation Act of 1920. Chapter 91, 41 Stat. 456, 469. The title provides for the settlement of disputes between railroad companies engaged in interstate commerce and their employees, and as a means of securing this, it creates a Railroad Labor Board and defines its functions and powers.\n The Pennsylvania Railroad Company began this action by a bill in equity against the Railroad Labor Board and its individual members in the District Court for the \n\n[261 U.S. 72, 73]\n\u00a0\n Northern District of Illinois, where the Board has its office, averring that the suit involved more than $3,000, and praying an injunction against the defendants' alleged unlawful proceedings under the act and especially against their threatened official publication under section 313 of the title that the Railroad Company had violated the Board's decision under the act.\n The defendants moved to dismiss the bill on the ground that the suit was one against the United States without its consent, and also for want of equity and a lack of a cause of action. They also filed an answer making the same objections to the bill as in the motion and setting forth by exhibits more in detail the proceedings before the Board and its decisions. The District Court heard the case on the bill, motion and answer, and granted the injunction as prayed. The Board appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals (282 Fed. 701) which reversed the decree and directed the dismissal of the bill. The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, not being made final by the statutes, the case is brought here by appeal under section 241 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1218).\n On December 28, 1917, the President, by authority of the Act of Congress of August 29, 1916 (chapter 418, 39 Stat. 619, 645 [Comp. St.  1974a]), took over the railroads of the country, including that of the complainant, and operated them through the Director General of Railroads until March 1, 1920, when pursuant to the Transportation Act of 1920, possession of them was restored to the companies owning them. During his operation, the Director General had increased wages and establised the rules and working conditions by what were called national agreements with national labor unions composed of men engaged in the various railroad crafts. Further demands by employees through such unions were presented to the Director General and were pending and undetermined when the Transportation Act was approved. Conferences were held between the \n\n[261 U.S. 72, 74]\n\u00a0\n heads of the labor unions, signatories to the national agreement, and representatives of the railroads after the railroads were restored to private ownership but without successful issue. When the members of the Labor Board were appointed and organized, April 15, 1920, it assumed jurisdiction of these demands and proceeded to deal with them. It rendered its decision as to the wage dispute on July 20, 1920, and postponed that as to rules and working conditions until April 14, 1921, when it decided that such rules and working conditions as were fixed in the so-called national agreements under the Director General and had been continued by the Board as a modus vivendi should end July 1, 1921, and remanded the matter to the individual carriers and their respective employees, calling upon them in the case of each railroad to esignate representatives to confer and decide so far as possible respecting rules and working conditions for the operation of such railroad and to keep the Board advised of the progress toward agreement. The Board accompanied this decision (No. 119) with a statement of principles or rules of decision which it intended to follow in consideration and settlement of disputes between the carriers and employees. The only two here important are sections 5 and 15, as follows:\n'5. The right of such lawful organization to act toward lawful objects through representatives of its own choice, whether employees of a particular carrier or otherwise, shall be agreed to by management.\n\n'15. The majority of any craft or class of employees shall have the right to determine what organization shall represent members of such craft or class. Such organization shall have the right to make an agreement which shall apply to all employees in such craft or class. No such agreement shall infringe, however, upon the right of employees not members of the organization representing the majority to present grievances either in person or by representatives of their own choice.' \n\n[261 U.S. 72, 75]\n\u00a0\n On June 27, 1921, the Board announced that some carriers in conference with their employees had agreed upon rules and working conditions and others had not. As to the latter the Board continued the old rules and working conditions until it should render a decision as to them.\n\n In May, 1921, the officers of the Federal Shop Crafts of the Pennsylvania System, a labor union of employees of that system engaged in shop work, and affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, met the representatives of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. They said they represented a majority of the employees of the Pennsylvania System in those crafts and were prepared to confer and agree upon rules and working conditions. The Pennsylvania representatives refused to confer with the Federation for lack of proof that it did represent such a majority, and said they would send out a form of ballot to their employees asking them to designate thereon their representatives. The Federation officers objected to this ballot because it was not in accordance with principles 5 and 15 of the Board, in that it made no provision for representation of employees by an organization, but specified that those selected must be natural persons, and such only as were employees of the Pennsylvania Company, and also because it required that representatives of the employees should be selected regionally rather than from the whole system. The result was that the company and the Federation each sent out ballots. The Federation then filed a complaint, under section 307 of the Transportation Act, against the Pennsylvania Company, complaining on behalf of its members directly interested of the company's course in respect of the ballots. The company appeared, a hearing was had and the Board decided (decision No. 218) that neither of the ballots sent out by the parties was proper, that representatives so chosen were not proper representatives, and that rules and work- \n\n[261 U.S. 72, 76]\n\u00a0\n ing conditions agreed upon by them would be void. It further appeared that the votes cast on the company's ballots were something more than 3,000 out of more than 33,000 employees entitled to vote. The Federation had advised its members not to vote on the company's ballots. What the result was in the vote of the Federation ballots did not appear. The persons chosen by the 3,000 votes on the company's ballots conferred with the Pennsylvania Company's representatives and agreed upon rules and working conditions. The Board in its decision ordered a new election, for which rules were prescribed and a form of ballot was specified, on which labor organizations as well as individuals could be voted for as representatives at the option of the employee.\n The company, on September 16, 1921, applied to the Board to vacate this decision on the ground that there was no dispute before the Board of which by title 3 of the Transportation Act the Board was given jurisdiction. After a hearing the Board declined to vacate its order, but said that it would allow the company to be heard on the question of the ratification of its shop craft rules by representatives of the crafts concerned when fairly selected.\n Title 3 of the Transportation Act of 1920 bears the heading, 'Disputes between Carriers and Their Employees and Subordinate Officials.'\n Section 301 makes it the duty of carriers, their officers, employees, and subordinate officials, to exert every reasonable effort to avoid interruption to the operation of an interstate commerce carrier due to a dispute between the carrier and its employees, and further provides that such disputes shall be considered and if possible decided 'in conference between representatives designated and authorized so to confer by the carriers, or the employees or subordinate officials thereof, directly interested in the dispute.' \n\n[261 U.S. 72, 77]\n\u00a0\n The section concludes:\n'If any dispute is not decided in such conference, it shall be referred by the parties thereto to the board which under the provisions of this title is authorized to hear and decide such dispute.'\n\n Section 302 provides for the establishment of railroad boards of adjustment by agreement between any carrier, group of carriers or the carriers as a whole, and any employees or subordinate officials of carriers, or organization or groups of organizations thereof. No such boards of adjustment were established when this controversy arose.\n Section 303 provides for hearing and decision by such boards of adjustment upon petition of any dispute involving only grievances, rules or working conditions not decided as provided in section 301.\n Sections 304, 305, and 306 provide for the appointment and organization of the 'Railroad Labor Board' composed of nine members, three from the Labor Group, three from the Carrier Group, and three from the Public Group.\n Section 307 (a) provides that, when a labor adjustment board under section 303 has not reached a decision of a dispute involving grievances, rules or working conditions in a reasonable time, or when the appropriate adjustment board has not been organized under section 302, the Railroad Labor Board--\n'(1) upon the application of the chief executive of any carrier or organization of employees or subordinate officials whose members are directly interested in the dispute, (2) upon a written petition signed by not less than 100 unorganized employees or subordinate officials directly interested in the dispute, or (3) upon the Labor Board's own motion if it is of the opinion that the dispute is likely substantially to interrupt commerce, shall receive for hearing, and as soon as practicable and with due diligence decide, any dispute involving grievances, rules, or \n\n[261 U.S. 72, 78]\n\u00a0\n working conditions which is not decided as provided in section 301.'\n\n Paragraph (b) of the same section provides for a hearing and decision of disputes over wages.\n Paragraph (c) makes necessary to a decision of the Board the concurrence of five members of whom, in the case of wage disputes, a member of the Public Group must be one. The paragraph further provides that:\n'All decisions of the Labor Board shall be entered upon the records of the Board and copies thereof, together with such statement of facts bearing thereon as the Board may deem proper, shall be immediately communicated to the parties to the dispute, the President, each Adjustment Board, and the [Interstate Commerce] Commission, and shall be given further publicity in such manner as the Labor Board may determine.'\n\n Paragraph (d) requires that decisions of the Board shall establish standards of working conditions which in the opinion of the Board are just and reasonable.\n Section 308 prescribes other duties and powers of the Labor Board, among which is that of making 'regulations necessary for the efficient execution of the functions vested in it by this title.'\n Section 309 prescribes that:\n'An party to any dispute to be considered by an Adjustment Board or by the Labor Board shall be entitled to a hearing either in person or by counsel.'\n\n Section 313 is as follows:\n'The Labor Board, in case it has reason to believe that any decision of the Labor Board or of an Adjustment Board is violated by any carrier, or employee or subordinate official, or organization thereof, may upon its own motion after due notice and hearing to all persons directly interested in such violation, determine whether in its opinion such violation has occurred and make public its decision in such manner as it may determine.' \n\n[261 U.S. 72, 79]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frederic D. McKenney, of Washington, D. C., and T. J. Scofield, of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n\n Mr. Blackburn Esterline, of Washington, D. C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n It is evident from a review of title 3 of the Transportation Act of 1920 that Congress deems it of the highest public interest to prevent the interruption of interstate commerce by labor disputes and strikes, and that its plan is to encourage settlement without strikes, first by conference between the parties, failing that, by reference to adjustment boards of the parties' own choosing and, if this is ineffective, by a full hearing before a national board appointed by the President, upon which are an equal number of representatives of the Carrier Group, the Labor Group, and the Public. The decisions of the Labor Board are not to be enforced by process. The only sanction of its decision is to be the force of public opinion invoked by the fairness of a full hearing, the intrinsic justice of the conclusion, strengthened by the official prestige of the Board, and the full publication of the violation of such decision by any party to the proceeding. The evident thought of Congress in these provisions is that the economic interest of every member of the public in the undisturbed flow of interstate commerce and the acute inconvenience to which all must be subjected by an interruption caused by a serious and widespread labor dispute, fastens public attention closely on all the circumstances \n\n[261 U.S. 72, 80]\n\u00a0\n of the controversy and arouses public criticism of the side thought to be at fault. The function of the Labor Board is to direct that public criticism against the party who, it thinks, justly deserves it.\n The main and controlling question in this case is whether the members of the Board exceeded their powers on the facts as disclosed in the bill and answer.\n It is contended by the carrier that the Labor Board cannot obtain jurisdiction to hear and decide a dispute until it is referred by the parties to the Board after they have conferred and failed to agree under section 301. Undoubtedly the act requires a serious effort by the carrier and his employees to adjust their differences as the first step in settling a dispute, but the subsequent sections dispel the idea that the jurisdiction of the Board to function in respect to the dispute is dependent on a joint submission of the dispute to it. If adjustment boards are not agreed upon, then under section 307, either side is given an opportunity to bring its complaint before the Labor Board, which then is to summon everyone having an interest, and after a full hearing is to render a decision. A dispute existed between all the carriers and the officers of the national labor unions as to rules and working conditions in the operation of the railroads. By order of the Labor Board, this dispute which had arisen before the passage of the Transportation Act, and before the government had turned back the railroads to their owners, was continued for settlement before the Labor Board. That Board had been obliged to postpone the decision of the controversy until it could give it full hearing and meantime had ordered that the existing rules and conditions should be maintained as a modus vivendi.\n Counsel of the railroad company insist that the Board had no jurisdiction to make an rder or to take up the controversies between the Government Railroad Administration and the national labor unions; that when the rail roads \n\n[261 U.S. 72, 81]\n\u00a0\n were turned back to their owners each company had the right to make its own rules and conditions and to deal with its own employees under section 301, and that the jurisdiction of the Board did not attach until a dispute as to such rules and conditions between the company and its employees had thereafter arisen.\n We are not called upon to pass upon the propriety or legality of what the Labor Board did in continuing the existing rules and labor conditions which had come over from the Railroad Administration, or in hearing an argument as to their amendment by its decision. It suffices for our decision that the Labor Board at the instance of the carriers finally referred the whole question of rules and labor conditions to each company and its employees to be settled by conference under section 301; that such conferences were attempted in this case, and that thereafter the matter was brought before the Board by Federation No. 90 of Shop Crafts of the Pennsylvania System under section 307. It is the alleged invalidity of this proceeding, thus initiated, which is really the basis of the bill of complaint of the company herein, and it is this only which we need consider.\n First, Did Federation No. 90 have the right under section 307 to institute the hearing of the dispute? Section 307 says that this may be invoked on the application of the chief executive of any organization of employees whose members are directly interested in the dispute. Its name indicates, and the record shows, that the Federation is an association of employees of the Pennsylvania Company directly interested in the dispute. The only question between the company and the Federation is whether the membership of the latter includes a majority of the company's employees who are interested. But it is said that the Federation is a labor union affiliated with the American Federation of Labor and that the phrase 'organization \n\n[261 U.S. 72, 82]\n\u00a0\n of employees' used in the act was not intended by Congress to include labor unions. We find nothing in the act to impose any such limitation if the organization in other respects fulfills the description of the act. Congress has frequently recognized the legality of labor unions, United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., \n259 U.S. 344\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 570, decided June 5, 1922, and no reason suggests itself why such an association, if its membership is properly inclusive, may not be regarded as among the organizations of employees referred to in this legislation.\n The next objection made by the company to the jurisdiction of the Board to entertain the proceeding initiated by the Federation is that it did not involve the kind of dispute of which the Board could take cognizance under the act. The result of the conferences between the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and its employees under section 301 appears in the statement of the case. By a vote of 3,000 out of more than 30,000 employees, a representative committee was appointed with which the officers of the company made an agreement as to rules and working conditions. Federation No. 90 for its members objected to the settlement on the ground that it had not been made by properly chosen representatives of the employees and brought this dispute before the Labor Board. The Pennsylvania Company was summoned and appeared before the Board and the issue was heard.\n It is urged that the question who may represent the employees as to grievances, rules and working conditions under section 301 is not within the jurisdiction of the Labor Board to decide; that these representatives must be determined before the conferences are held under that section; that the jurisdiction of the Labor Board does not begin until after these conferences are held, and that the representatives who can make application under section 307 to the Board are representatives engaged in the conference under  ction 301. Such a construction would give either side \n\n[261 U.S. 72, 83]\n\u00a0\n an easy opportunity to defeat the operation of the act and to prevent the Labor Board from considering any dispute. It would tend to make the act unworkable. If the Board has jurisdiction to hear representatives of the employees, it must of necessity have the power to determine who are proper representatives of the employees. That is a condition precedent to its effective exercise of jurisdiction at all. One of its specific powers conferred by section 308 is to 'make regulations necessary for the efficient execution of the functions vested in it by this title.' This must include the authority to determine who are proper representatives of the employees and to make reasonable rules for ascertaining the will of the employees in the matter.\n Again, we think that this question of who may be representatives of employees, not only before the Board, but in the conferences and elsewhere, is and always has been one of the most important of the rules and working conditions in the operation of a railroad. The purpose of Congress to promote harmonious relations between the managers of railways and their employees is seen in every section of this Act, and the importance attached by Congress to conferences between them for this purpose is equally obvious. Congress must have intended, therefore, to include the procedure for determining representatives of employees as a proper subjectmatter of dispute to be considered by the Board under section 307. The act is to be liberally construed to effect the manifest effort of Congress to compose differences between railroad companies and their employees, and it would not help this effort, to exclude from the lawful consideration of the Labor Board a question which has so often seriously affected the relations between the companies and their employees in the past and is often encountered on the very threshhold of controversies between them.\n The second objection is that the Labor Board in decision 119 and principles 5 and 15, and in decision 218, \n\n[261 U.S. 72, 84]\n\u00a0\n compels the railroad company to recognize labor unions as factors in the conduct of its business. The counsel for the company insist that the right to deal with individual representatives of its employees as to rules and working conditions is an inherent right which cannot be constitutionally taken from it. The employees, or at least those who are members of the labor unions, contend that they have a lawful right to select their own representatives, and that it is not within the right of the company to restrict them in their selection to employees of the company or to forbid selection of officers of their labor unions qualified to deal with, and protect their interests. This statute certainly does not deprive either side of the rights claimed.\n But title 3 was not enacted to provide a tribunal to determine what were the legal rights and obligations of railway employers and employees or to enforce or protect them. Courts can do that. The Labor Board was created to decide how the parties ought to exercise their legal rights so as to enable them to cooperate in running the railroad. It was to reach a fair compromise between the parties without regard to the legal rights upon which each side might insist in a court of law. The Board is to act as a board of arbitration. It is to give expression to its view of the moral obligation of each side as members of society to agree upon a basis for cooperation in the work of running the railroad in the public interest. The only limitation upon the Board's decisions is that they should establish a standard of conditions, which, in its opinion, is just and reasonable. The jurisdiction of the Board to direct the parties to do what it deems they should do is not to be limited by their constitutional or legal right to refuse to do it. Under the act there is no constraint upon them to do what the Board decides they should do except the moral constraint, already mentioned, of publication of its d cision. \n\n[261 U.S. 72, 85]\n\u00a0\n It is not for this or any other court to pass upon the correctness of the conclusion of the Labor Board if it keeps within the jurisdiction thus assigned to it by the statute. The statute does not require the railway company to recognize or to deal with or confer with labor unions. It does not require employees to deal with their employers through their fellow employees. But we think it does vest the Labor Board with power to decide how such representatives ought to be chosen with a view to securing a satisfactory cooperation and leaves it to the two sides to accept or reject the decision. The statute provides the machinery for conferences, the hearings, the decisions and the moral sanction. The Labor Board must comply with the requirements of the statute; but having thus complied, it is not in its reasonings and conclusions limited as a court is limited to a consideration of the legal rights of the parties.\n The propriety of the Board's announcing in advance of litigated disputes the rules of decision as to them is not before us except as to principles 5 and 15 of decision No. 119, so far as they determine the methods by which representatives of employees should be selected. They were applied and followed in the form of ballot prescribed by decision 218. These decisions were necessary in order that conferences should be properly begun under section 301, and that disputes there arising should be brought before the Board. They were therefore not premature. It is not for us to express any opinion upon the merits of these principles and decisions. All that we may do in this case is to hold, as we do, that they were within the lawful function of the Board to render, and not being compulsory, violate no legal or equitable right of the complaining company.\n For this reason, we think that the District Court was wrong in enjoining the Labor Board from proceeding to entertain further jurisdiction and from publishing its \n\n[261 U.S. 72, 86]\n\u00a0\n opinions, and that the Court of Appeals was right in reversing the District Court and in directing a dismissal of the bill. We do not find it necessary, therefore, to consider the questions raised at the bar as to whether the Railroad Labor Board is a corporation under the act and capable of suing or being sued, without the consent of the United States, and whether the Board's publication of its opinions in matters beyond its jurisdiction could be properly enjoined by a court of equity.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","147":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE EX REL CLYDE v. GILCHRIST(1923)\nNo. 318\nArgued: Decided: April 30, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 94, 95]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Arthur E. Goddard, of Brooklyn, N. Y., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Francis W. Cullen, James S. Y. Ivins, and Claude T. Dawes, all of Albany N. Y., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a statutory proceeding to recover the amount of taxes for 1919 paid under duress and protest. As the first step the relator, the plaintiff in error, filed an application for a revision of the tax with the Comptroller of the State. His determination presented the issue in a few words. The relator held bonds secured by mortgages upon which latter the mortgage recording tax under Article 11 of the Tax Law (Consol. Laws N. Y. c. 60) had been paid. She also held secured debts upon which a tax had been paid under Article 14 of the Tax Law as amended by Chapter 802 of the \n\n[262 U.S. 94, 96]\n\u00a0\n Laws of 1911. An additional assessment was made under the Income Tax Law of 1919, c. 627, on account of the relator's income from these bonds and debts. The relator seems to have contended that if the Income Tax Law imposed the additional assessment it was unconstitutional as impairing the obligation of contracts made by the statutes laying the taxes first mentioned. The Comptroller held that the additional assessment was correct and that no payment was unlawfully exacted. His determination was confirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, and the order of the Appellate Division was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. No opinion was delivered by either Court. The case was brought here by writ of error and the defendant in error moved to dismiss on the ground that it does not appear that the judgment below necessarily decided a question that can be brought here in this way. Cuyahoga River Power Co. v. Northern Realty Co., \n244 \nU.S. 300, 304\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 643\n\n\n he position of the relator is that where the ground of judgment does not appear this Court will not assume that the Court below proceeded upon ground clearly untenable, and that therefore if the only one that seems plausible opens a constitutional question raised upon the record, this Court will proceed to deal with it. Adams v. Russell, \n229 \nU.S. 353, 358\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 846. The only ground suggested by the defendant in error as local is that the decision of the Appellate Division at least is shown to have gone upon the construction of the exempting statutes by an opinion rendered at the same time as the present judgment, to the effect that the exemption of mortgages by the Mortgage Recording Tax Law, if a contract, did not extend to the interest upon the debt. People ex rel. Central Union Trust Co. v. Wendell, 197 App. Div. 131, 188 N. Y. Supp. 344. To this the relator rightly replies that when a statute is alleged to impair the obligation of a contract this Court must decide for itself whether there was a contract \n\n[262 U.S. 94, 97]\n\u00a0\n and what it was. Detroit United Ry. v. Michigan, \n242 \nU.S. 238, 249\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 87; Columbia Water Power Co. v. Columbia Electric Street Railway, Light & Power Co., \n172 \nU.S. 475, 487\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 247. The relator in her petition to the Supreme Court failed to call attention in terms to the provision of the Constitution relied upon. Harding v. Illinois, \n196 \nU.S. 78, 88\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 176. But she set forth that the exemptions claimed were granted by the statutes under which the earlier taxes were fixed, that they were secured for a valuable consideration, the payment of those taxes, and that the subsequent tax upon the income of the bonds and securities violated the provisions of the Constitution of the United States. We shall assume in her favor that Article 1, Section 10, was sufficiently indicated as the clause upon which she relied.\n Nevertheless we are not satisfied that the relator is entitled to prevail. It is apparent that the New York Courts held that there was no contract of the kind that it alleged. It would be extravagant to suppose that they upheld a law admitted to impair the obligation of an admitted contract. The opinion of the Supreme Court shows clearly enough the general nature of the defense sustained. The relator contends and must contend that this is so. While it is true that we are not bound by the construction of the New York statutes by the New York Courts in deciding the constitutional question, yet when we are dealing with a matter of local policy, like a system of taxation, we should be slow to depart from their judgment, if there was no real oppression or manifest wrong in the result. Troy Union R. Co. v. Mealy, \n254 \nU.S. 47, 50\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 17.\n The Mortgage Recording Tax Law, Article 11,  251, provides that all mortgages of real property situated within the State that are taxed by that article and the debts and obligations that they secure shall be exempt \n\n[262 U.S. 94, 98]\n\u00a0\n from other taxation by the State and local subdivisions. The caution that should be used before interpreting such declarations of legislative policy as promises, even when they manifestly tend and are expected to induce voluntary action, is illustrated in Wisconsin & Michigan R. Co. v. Powers, \n191 \nU.S. 379, 386\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 107; Troy Union R. R. Co. v. Mealy, \n254 \nU.S. 47, 50\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 17. But the Appellate Division, in the case that we have cited, while having this caution in mind, preferred to assume without deciding that there was a contract of exemption, but held that it did not extend to this income tax. The Court recognized that for many purposes a tax upon the interest received from a mortgage debt is a tax upon the mortgage; but for the purpose of construing the words of a statute it rightly recognized that a distinction might be taken. That a distinction was intended, or rather that the Legislature had in mind only a tax upon the principal debt or obligation i deduced from a nice consideration of the words of the statute, which led it to the conclusion that 'the dominant idea in the mind of the Legislature was to render mortgagees independent of the action, capricious or otherwise, of local tax officials.' Considering that only the principal of mortgages was taxed when the law was passed and that in those days no one thought of an income tax; that any contract of exemption must be shown to have been indisputably within the intention of the Legislature; that it is difficult to believe that the Legislature meant to barter away all its powers to meet future exigencies for the mrer payment of a mortgage recording tax; and that a tax upon the individual measured by net income might be regarded as one step removed from a tax on the capital from which the income was derived, Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165, 175\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 432; it held that there was no promise that the present tax should not be imposed. With regard to the mortgages the conclusion does not seem to us very difficult to reach. The State did not need to offer a bar gain \n\n[262 U.S. 94, 99]\n\u00a0\n to induce mortgagees to record their deeds. Federal Land Bank of New Orleans v. Crosland (March 19, 1923) \n261 U.S. 374\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 385, 67 L. Ed. --.\n The provision as to the tax on secured debts other than the foregoing is to the effect that any person may send them or a description of them to the Comptroller and may pay a tax of one-half of one per centum on the face value and that thereupon the Comptroller by indorsement or receipt shall certify that they are exempt from taxation and that thereafter they shall be exempt from all taxation in the State or local divisions of the State with certain specified exceptions. Laws 1911, c. 802,  331. This is an alternative to a tax, at such rate as may be fixed, on the fair market value of the security. Section 336. There is an argument that it relates only to the year for which payment is made, and, although for reasons indicated in Wisconsin & Michigan R. Co. v. Powers, supra, consideration seems to be of little importance except as bearing on interpretation, that the payment of an alternative tax is consideration for exemption from nothing except its alternative. On the other hand the provision for an indorsement upon the security hardly is reconcilable with less than a permanent exemption; it is said that so the law generally has been understood; and the ground taken by the Appellate Division in the case that we have cited indicates that they were not prepared to deny that the exemption even of mortgages looked beyond the year. In the absence of further opinion it seems fair to assume that the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeals decided against the exemption for the reasons stated in People ex rel. Central Union Trust Co. v. Wendell, 197 App. Div. 131, 188 N. Y. Supp. 344, of which we have given a summary. As we said at the outset we ought to be slow to depart from the judgment of the Courts of the State in a case like this and we accept their conclusion also with regard to secured debts. We are not prepared to say that the judgment was wrong and therefore it is affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","148":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE OF STATE OF NEW YORK EX REL DOYLE v.

Y., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The record presents a preliminary question as to our jurisdiction under the writ of error.\n The relators were arrested by the police of the city of Mt. Vernon, N. Y., while holding a street meeting, on the charge of violating an ordinance which prohibited, under \n\n[261 U.S. 590, 591]\n\u00a0\n penalty of fine, the gathering or assembling of persons or the holding of public meetings upon the public streets of the city, without special permit of the mayor. Before trial the relators obtained writs of habeas corpus from the Supreme Court of the State, at Special Term, which, being heard together, resulted in an order sustaining the writs and discharging the relators. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (197 App. Div. 225, 188 N. Y. Supp. 803), on appeal reversed this order and dismissed the writs; and the Court of Appeals of the State, on a further appeal, affirmed the order of the Appellate Division (232 N. Y. 96, 133 N. E. 364) and remitted the record and proceedings to the Supreme Court to be proceeded upon according to law. Thereafter this writ of error was granted by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals to review the judgment of that court.\n It is urged, in substance, that the Court of Appeals denied the contention of the relators that the ordinance, both by its provisions and through the alleged discriminatory manner in which it was enforced, deprived them of their rights of freedom of speech and assembly in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court of Appeals, however, held not only that the ordinance was a valid and constitutional exercise of the police power, but also that the writ of habeas corpus was not, under the state practice, the proper method of contesting its validity. In the opinion of that court, after passing upon the constitutional question, it was said:\n'A writ of habeas corpus cannot take the place of [of] perform the functions of an appeal from a judgment of conviction. The court before which a person is brought under such writ simply inquires whether the court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction to do so. If that fact appears, and the mandate under which the defendant is held be regular upon its face, the writ must be dismissed. People ex rel. Hubert v Kaiser, 206 N. Y. 46. The magistrate before \n\n[261 U.S. 590, 592]\n\u00a0\n whom the relators were taken had jurisdiction to try them for a violation of the ordinance in question, and they are now legally in custody. The Appellate Division, therefore, properly held that the order of the Special Term was erroneous, reversed the same, dismissed the writs and remanded the relators.'\n\n It is settled law, that where the record discloses that the judgment of a state court was based, not alone upon a ground involving a federal question, but also upon another and independent ground, broad enough to maintain the judgment, this Court will not take jurisdiction to review such judgment and will dismiss a writ of error brought for that purpose.

Black, Chief of Engineers of the United States Army, as lessor and Goltra, as lessee, whereby the boats and barges (then under construction) by the United States were leased and chartered to Goltra for the period of five years from the date of delivery of the boats and barges to him, Goltra, upon the payment of certain periodical rentals and a compliance by Goltra with other terms and conditions.\n The suit by Goltra, the pleadings in which are detailed in the petition, was brought to determine his rights under the contract and a supplement to it.\n The contract was preceded by negotiations between Goltra and representatives of the government, particularly \n\n[263 U.S. 389, 391]\n\u00a0\n with the War Department and the then Secretary of War, which included among other things the construction of a fleet of towboats and barges in the then emergency of war But after the signing of the Armistice when the emergency of war had ceased, other negotiations were had between Goltra and the War Department and the Secretary of War, and a lease was made, the contract above, whereby the boats and barges were leased to Goltra, by him to be operated on the Mississippi river and its tributaries as a common carrier, he to pay all operating expenses, to take out fire and marine insurance, and incur and discharge other obligations.\n On May 26, 1921, the supplement to the contract was entered into between Maj. Gen. Beach, then Chief of Engineers of the United States Army, the successor of Black.\n On March 3, 1923, Weeks, as Secretary of War, undertook to cancel the contract for the noncompliance by Goltra, as lessee, with its terms and conditions, and demanded the return of the boats and barges to the United States, and the defendants on March 25, 1923, unlawfully took possession of some, and were about to take possession of the remainder of them.\n There was a prayer by Goltra for a temporary restraining order against such action, or against any action interfering with his possession. There was also a prayer for a temporary injunction against any act whatsoever looking to the cancellation and termination of the lease, or the retention of the boats and barges taken before the attempted cancellation of the contract. The prayer was, that upon final hearing, a decree be entered in favor of Goltra to determine his rights under the contract and to perpetually enjoin the defendants from interfering in any way with his rights thereunder.\n A mandatory order was issued as prayed, and an order to show cause why a temporary injunction should not be issued. \n\n[263 U.S. 389, 392]\n\u00a0\n In response to the order to show cause the Attorney General filed suggestions against the jurisdiction of the court, and subsequently the other defendants made returns to the order averring that the suit was in purpose and effect, one against the United States and its property.\n A motion was made in accordance with the representations. It was overruled, and the defendants granted time to plead.\n It is alleged in the petition that, unless restrained, the District Court Judge will proceed with the cause and issue an injunction as prayed by Goltra, and that such order will deprive the United States of the possession and use of boats and barges of the value approximately of $3, 800,000.\n Prohibition was prayed as above stated.\n The return of Judge Faris to the petition concedes some of its allegations and denies others. It denies the character ascribed to Goltra's suit. It alleges that there is a right of possession of the boats and barges in Goltra, and that while his bill was in course of preparation the defendants in the suit were proceeding with a large force of men to take from him and remove from St. Louis the boats and barges that remained in his possession, and that the suit was not one against the Unites States, but against individual defendants who were proceeding in violation of law, and it is averred that there is an adequate remedy by appeal.\n The answer of Goltra to the petition is presented with elaborate detail of fact and argument. In foundation and essence it is the same as that of the District Court. The opinion of the court, which was oral, is attached to it. The opinion cites that of Judge Baker in United States Harness Company v. Graham et al., 288 Fed. 929, in the District Court for the Northern District of Virginia,\n The merits of the case present interesting questions. The question of the remedy is, however, the more insistent. Does the case justify it? Prohibition is a remedy \n\n[263 U.S. 389, 393]\n\u00a0\n of exigency and in exclusion of other process of relief. It is directed against unwarranted assumptions of jurisdiction or excesses of it. In some cases there may be instant judgment that such is the situation and the writ granted. In other cases there may be doubt and the writ denied. Ex parte Muir, \n254 \nU.S. 522, 534\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 185. And doubt in the instant case would seem to be justified, for two District Courts have decided that, under circumstances such as presented in this case, it does not involve or constitute a suit against the United States. And also the writ is to be denied if there be remedy against the action complained of by appeal.\n Ex parte Oklahoma, \n220 U.S. 191\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 426, and cases cited, is a complete exposition of the writ and its uses. The opinion in that case observed the distinctions of prior cases; that is, that the writ is a remedy against unwarranted assumptions of jurisdiction and that besides, the condition of its issue is that the party attacking the jurisdiction has no other remedy In other words, the writ cannot be made to perform the office of an appeal or writ of error. Are the decisions applicable here?\n There was submitted to the court the contracts and their construction and effect-whether under them the United States or its officers retained property in the boats and barges or whether that property was transferred with the right of possession to Goltra. The court so construed them, adjudging Goltra's right to the property and necessarily, his right to the possession of it, and that he was entitled to an injunction to protect that possession pending the suit. From that decision there was right of review by appeal, and it would be timely and adequate for relief, if the decision were erroneous. Judicial Code,  129 (Comp. St.  1121); U. S.

CLEVELAND REFINING CO. OF CLEVELAND, OHIO(1923)\nNo. 324\nArgued: March 15, 1923Decided: April 9, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. J. Meyer and John G. Price, both of Columbus, Ohio, and Ray Martin, of Newark, Ohio, for appellant.\n Messrs. Charles D. Chamberlin and H. B. Fuller, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Cleveland Company is a dealer in petroleum products, and brought this suit to restrain the execution of an act passed by the General Assembly of Ohio may 19, \n\n[261 U.S. 449, 450]\n\u00a0\n 1915, entitled 'An act to provide for the inspect on of petroleum, illuminating oils, gasoline, and naphtha, and to repeal sections 844 to 868, inclusive, of the General Code' (Ohio Laws, vol. 105, p. 309).\n The case presented by the bill is as follows: The company is engaged in business in East Cleveland and has the necessary instrumentalities for carrying on its business (the bill enumerates them). It buys its products in other states, ships them into Ohio, and receives at its place of business large quantities of them. It has contracts for them which it is bound to consummate, and which it cannot perform without great loss, except through its established business.\n By the terms of the statute, oil intended for sale for illuminating purposes must be inspected in Ohio, and it designates the fees to be paid to the state inspector or his deputy, which are payable on demand and are made a lien upon the articles inspected; and there are provisions which safeguard the quality of the oil.\n The quantities of petroleum products are increased year by year, and the revenue derived by the state will increase over and above the revenue derived in past years, if the enforcement of the act is permitted to continue, and the act is repugnant to article 1, section 10, clause 2, of the Constitution of the United States forbidding states from laying imposts without the consent of Congress upon interstate commerce, except such as may be absolutely necessary for the execution of inspection laws.\n The act violates section 8, article 1, giving to Congress the power to regulate commerce, and also violates certain provisions of the Constitution of Ohio.\n The District Court decided that 'the act, except as to the amount of fees charged for inspection' was 'in its essential details and even in nearly all of the language employed, a re-enactment of the law declared unconstitutional in Castle v. Mason, 91 Ohio St. 296.' Commenting \n\n[261 U.S. 449, 451]\n\u00a0\n on the latter case, the court said it found the earlier act did not differ materially from the law pronounced void in Foote v. Maryland, \n232 U.S. 494\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 377, and that also held to be void in Red 'C' Oil Manufacturing Co. v. Board of Agriculture, \n222 U.S. 380\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 152, and observed:\n'The General Assembly, with at least constructive knowledge that, under the operations of the law, the excess of receipts over expenses was large and annually mounting, permitted the inspection charges to remain undisturbed, and in this respect its conduct has differed from' the conduct 'of the Minnesota Legislature with reference to the act considered in Pure Oil Company v. Minnesota, \n248 U.S. 158\n.'\n\n The conclusion of the court was upon further consideration of the facts pertinent to the purpose and quality of the act, that it was an interference with interstate commerce. The court said:\n'The fees prescribed by the statute are beyond the cost of legitimate inspection to determine the quality of the articles inspected, and the act is therefore not only a police measure, but a revenue measure also. Such cost by necessary operation unduly burdens and obstructs the freedom of interstate commerce, and, as such commerce cannot be separated from the intrastate shipments, the whole tax is void.'\n\n The court was of opinion that the other questions discussed by counsel were not necessary to consider.\n Phipps, as an individual, was dismissed from the case, except as director of the department of commerce. Against him as such a temporary injunction was ordered issue.\n Appellant contests the conclusion of the court and condenses his assignments of error to the following propositions:\n'(1) The state's cost of interstate inspection is greater than the fees charged therefor. (2) In practical administration, the comparative cost of interstate inspection is ascertainable as distinguished from the cost of intrastate inspection.' \n\n[261 U.S. 449, 452]\n\u00a0\n It is admitted that these conclusions depend upon an estimate of the evidence, and the District Court adjudged against them The court found that the fees colle ted from July 1, 1915, to June 30, 1920, amounted to $ 639,057.47; the disbursements to $321,188.68. The court further found that:\n\n'The collections when least were 63 per cent. greater than the inspection costs,' and had 'so advanced from year to year that the fees provided by the statute must be held to be unreasonable and disproportionate to the service rendered, and the act must be declared unconstitutional, as imposing a direct burden upon interstate commerce, unless interstate shipments under the provisions of the act are separable from intrastate shipments and the fees collected for the inspection of the former are equal or substantially equal to the cost of inspecting shipments of that character. The defendant's [appellant's] position is that the two classes of shipments are thus separable, and the interstate shipments have in fact been inspected at a loss to the state.'\n\n The position was held untenable by the court upon considerations and reasoning which we need not reproduce. It is enough to say we approve of them. It is contended by appellant that whatever defects may exist on the face of the act, may be and will be corrected in its administration, and whatever excess there may be in the fees collected will not be assigned to interstate commerce. There is quite a minute and detailed argument to show how this can be done. The District Court upon consideration in connection with the evidence rejected it, and we affirm its judgment.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","151":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPORTERFIELD v. WEBB(1923)\nNo. 28\nArgued: Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. Louis Marshall, of New York City, for appellants.[ Porterfield v. Webb \n263 U.S. 225\n (1923) ]\n\n\n[263 U.S. 225, 228]\n\u00a0\n Mr. U. S. Webb, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellees.\n\n\n[263 U.S. 225, 231]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellants brought this suit to enjoin the above-named Attorney General and district attorney from enforcing the California Alien Land Law, submitted by the initiative, and approved by the electors, November 2, 1920 (St. 1921, p. lxxxiii).\n Appellants are residents of California. Porterfield is a citizen of the United States and of California. Mizuno was born in Japan of Japanese parents and is a subject of the emperor of Japan. Porterfield is the owner of a farm in Los Angeles county containing 80 acres of land, which is particularly adapted to raising vegetables, and which for some years has been devoted to that and other agricultural purposes. The complaint alleges that Mizuno is a capable farmer and a desirable person to become a tenant of the land, and that Porterfield desires to lease the land to him for a term of five years, and that he desires to accept the lease, and that the lease would be made, but for the act complained of, and it is alleged that the appellees, as Attorney General and district attorney, have threatened to enforce the act against the appellants if they enter into such lease, and will forfeit, or attempt to forfeit, the leasehold interest to the state, and will prosecute the appellants criminally for violation of the act. It is further alleged that the act is so drastic, and the penalties attached to a violation of it are so great, that neither of the appellants may make the lease, even for the purpose of testing the constitutionality of the act, and that, unless the court shall determine its validity in this suit, appellants will be compelled to submit to it, whether valid or invalid, and thereby will be deprived of \n\n[263 U.S. 225, 232]\n\u00a0\n their property without due process of law and denied equal protection of the laws.\n Appellants made a motion for a temporary injunction to restrain appellees, during the pendency of the suit, from bringing or permitting to be brought any proceeding for the purpose of enforcing the act against the appellants. This was heard by three judges as provided in section 266 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243). The motion was denied.\n The act provides in sections 1 and 2 as follows:\n'Section 1. All aliens eligible to citizenship under the laws of the United States may acquire, possess, enjoy, transmit, and inherit real property, or any interest therein, in this state, in the same manner and to the same extent as citizens of the United States, except as otherwise provided by the laws of this state.\n\n'See. 2. All aliens other than those mentioned in section one of this act may acquire, possess, enjoy and transfer real property, or any interest therein, in this state, in the manner and to the extent and for the purpose prescribed by any treaty now existing between the government of the United States and the nation or country of which such alien is a citizen or subject, and not otherwise.'\n\n Other sections provide penalties by escheat and imprisonment for violation of section 2.\n The treaty between the United States and Japan (37 Stat. 1504-1509) does not confer upon Japanese subjects the privilege of acquiring or leasing land for agricultural purposes. Terrace et al. v. Thompson, \n263 U.S. 197\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 15, 68 L. Ed.--.\n Appellants contend that the law denies to ineligible aliens equal protection of the laws secured by the Fourteenth Amendment, because it forbids them to lease land in the state although the right to do so is conferred upon all other aliens. They also contend that the act is unconstitutional, because it deprives Porterfield of the right to enter into contracts for the leasing of his realty, and \n\n[263 U.S. 225, 233]\n\u00a0\n deprives Mizuno of his liberty and properly by debarring him from entering into a contract for the purpose of earning a livelihood in a lawful occupation.\n This case is similar to Terrace et al. v. Thompson, supra. In that case the grounds upon which the Washington Alien Land Law (Laws Wash. 1921, c. 50) was attacked included those on which the California act is assailed in this case. There the prohibited class was made up of aliens who had not in good faith declared intention to become citizens. The class necessarily includes all ineligible aliens, and in addition thereto all eligible aliens who have failed so to declare. In the case now before us the prohibited class includes ineligible aliens only. In the matter of classification, the states have wide discretion. Each has its own problems, depending on circumstances existing there. It is not always practical or desirable that legislation shall be the same in different states. We cannot say that the failure of the California Legislature to extend the prohibited class, so as to include eligible aliens who have failed to declare their intention to become citizens of the United States, was arbitrary or unreasonable. See Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373, 383\n, 384 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 342, L. R. A. 1915F, 829, and cases cited.\n Our decision in Terrace et al. v. Thompson, supra, controls the decision of all questions raised here.\n The order of the District Court is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS think there is no justiciable question involved, and that the case should have been dismissed on that ground.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","152":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPOTHIER v. RODMAN(1923)\n\nArgued: Decided: March 12, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. Davis G. Arnold, of Providence, R. I., for the motion. \n\n[261 U.S. 307, 308]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a motion for leave to proceed on this appeal in forma pauperis. The character of the appeal is set forth in the motion papers, and upon the facts therein stated we reach our conclusion.\n Act July 20, 1892, c. 209,  1, 27 Stat. 252, as amended by Act June 27, 1922, c. 246, 42 Stat. 666 provides:\n'That any citizen of the United States entitled to commence any suit or action, civil or criminal, in any court of the United States, may, upon the order of the court, commence and prosecute or defend to conclusion any suit or action, or a writ of error, or an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, or to the Supreme Court in such suit or action, including all appellate proceedings, unless the trial court shall certify in writing that in the opinion of the court such appeal or writ of error is not taken in good faith, without being required to prepay fees or costs or for the printing of the record in the appellate court or give security therefor, before or after bringing suit or action, or upon suing out a writ of error or appealing, upon filing in said court a statement under oath in writing that because of his poverty he is unable to pay the co ts of said suit or action or of such writ of error or appeal, or to give security for the same, and that he believes that he is entitled to the redress he seeks in such suit or action or writ of error or appeal, and setting forth briefly the nature of his alleged cause of action, or appeal.'\n\n Counsel for appellant files the motion setting out in brief the facts of the cause and accompanies it with an affidavit of his own, alleging that he has examined the case, that he believes the appellant has a just cause for appeal, that the appellant is without funds, and because of his poverty he is unable to pay the costs of the appeal, that his friends and relatives have already expended large \n\n[261 U.S. 307, 309]\n\u00a0\n sums in his defense, and that during his continued confinement in jail, the American Red Cross has been providing for his sickly wife and child. The affidavit further alleges that the appellant was allowed to prosecute the proceedings before the District Court in forma pauperis.\n Under the statute the affidavit as to the poverty of the applicant is to be made by himself and not by another, even his counsel. A supporting affidavit may properly be made by the counsel, but the importance that he who is seeking the privilege accorded by the statute should be required to expose himself to the pains of perjury in a case of bad faith is plain.\n Assuming, however, that this defect can be satisfactorily supplied, the motion must be denied, because it does not appear from the motion papers or the record that this court has jurisdiction of the appeal. There can be no doubt from a reading of the statute that an application of this character cannot be granted if it appear on its face that the appeal or writ of error in which the costs are to be incurred at public expense does not lie and cannot be considered by the court. The case made in the motion is as follows:\n On October 19, 1922, the appellant was arrested and brought before Henry C. Hart, United States commissioner for the district of Rhode Island, under a warrant to apprehend him and to remove him pursuant to section 1014 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1674), from Rhode Island to the Southern Division of the Western district of Washington for trial under an indictment for murder of Alexander P. Cronkhite, committed in territory in that district within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, to wit, the Camp Lewis military reservation. Appellant pleaded not guilty and was committed to the custody of the marshal without bail.\n The petition for the writ of habeas corpus reciting these facts was filed in the District Court and was accompanied \n\n[261 U.S. 307, 310]\n\u00a0\n by a prayer for a writ of certiorari directing the United States commissioner to send up the proceedings.\n The petition averred that the place in which the indictment alleged the crime to have been committed was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state of Washington, and that the indictment did not, therefore, charge a crime against the United States, and that the court in which the indictment was found was without jurisdiction to hear it.\n The District Court of Rhode Island found that this averment did not state a case warranting the discharge of the accused from custody or a halting of his removal under the warrant to the place of trial and so made the order appealed from.\n Appeal from the order lay to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the First Circuit, not to this court. Final decisions of a District Court are to be reviewed by the proper Circuit Courts of Appeals in all cases other than those in which appeals and writs of error may be taken direct to the Supreme Court, as provided in section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), unless otherwise provided by law. Section 128, Judicial Code, as amended by Act Jan. 28, 1915, c. 22,  2, 38 Stat. 803 (Comp. St.  1120). There is no other provision of law for appeals from an order granting or denying writs of habeas corpus, except when they come within section 238. Horn v. Mitchell, \n243 \nU.S. 247, 48\n, 249 S., 37 Sup. Ct. 293; Chin Fong v. Backus, \n241 \nU.S. 1, 3\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 490; Wise v. Henkel, \n220 \nU.S. 556, 557\n, 31 S. Sup.

Ct. 517.\n Section 238, Judicial Code, as amended by Act Jan. 28, 1915, c. 22, 38 Stat. 803, allows appeals direct from the District Courts to this court:\n\n\n (1)\n In any case in which the jurisdiction of the court is in issue, in which case the question of jurisdiction alone shall be certified to the Supreme Court from the court below for decision;\n\n\n (2)\n From the final sentences and decrees in prize causes; \n\n[261 U.S. 307, 311]\n\u00a0\n (3) In any case that involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States;\n\n\n (4)\n In any case in which the constitutionality of any law of the United States or the validity of any treaty made under its authority, is drawn in question; and\n\n\n (5)\n In any case in which the Constitution or law of a state is claimed to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States.\n The case presented on this motion comes within none of these classes. Even if a direct appeal from a conviction under the indictment in the District Court of Western Washington would lie to this court under section 238 on the question whether Camp Lewis was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, still the issue of jurisdiction which section 238 makes cognizable by this court on direct appeal is the jurisdiction of the District Court from which the appeal is taken, not that of the court to whose jurisdiction it is proposed to remove the petitioner. Carey v. Houston & Texas Central Ry. Co., \n150 \nU.S. 170, 180\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 63; Ex parte Jim Hong, 211 Fed. 73, 78, 127 C. C. A. 569. There was no doubt of the jurisdiction of the District Court of Rhode Island to issue a writ of habeas corpus to look into the legality of the detention of the petitioner. Certainly he made no question of it because he asked for its exercise.\n But it is clear that the objection raised by the petitioner does not raise a question of jurisdiction directly appealable to this court from the District Court. Such an objection goes to the merits and the appeal must be to the Circuit Court of Appeals. Louie v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 548, 550\n, 551 S., 41 Sup. Ct. 188.\n Nor is there any question of the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States or of the validity of a statute or treaty of the United States or of a statute of a state under the federal Constitution. The assignments of error recite that constitutional questions \n\n[261 U.S. 307, 312]\n\u00a0\n did arise but neither the motion nor the record discloses one. The issue is simply whether the specified place of the alleged murder is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States and that does not appear to involve in any way the construction of the federal Constitution.\n This motion must therefore be denied, but the ground upon which we deny it requires us to go further. Act Sept. 14, 1922 (42 Stat. 837), requires us, when an appeal has been taken to this court that should have been taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, not to dismiss the appeal but to transfer it to the proper Circuit Court of Appeals which in this case is that of the First Circuit. Heitler v. United States, \n260 U.S. 438\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 185, 67 L. Ed. --, decided January 2, 1923\n\n\n If the motion disclosed that the present appeal had been framed under section 238 to present solely the question of the jurisdiction of the District Court of Rhode Island certified here by that court, it would require us to consider whether on such a limited appeal it would be our duty and within our power to order a transfer of the appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals under Act Sept. 14, 1922. The record shows, however, that the appeal is not so imited. The order of transfer to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit will be made. \n\n\n\n","153":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPRENDERGAST v. NEW YORK TEL CO(1923)\nNo. 542\nArgued: February 21, 1923Decided: April 16, 1923\n\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 43, 45]\n\u00a0\n Wilbur W. Chambers, of Albany, N. Y., and Simon Fleischmann, of Buffalo, N. Y., for appellants.\n John W. Davis and Chas. T. Russell, both of New York City, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal, under Section 266 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243) from an order of the District Court enjoining pendente lite the enforcement of orders of the Public Service Commission of New York prescribing maximum rates for the exchange service of the Telephone Company.\n The Commission, having entered upon an investigation as to the rates charged by the Company for telephone service within the State, on March 3, 1922, after a large amount of evidence had been taken, but before the hearings had been completed, made the two orders in question. One of these reduced temporarily, pending final determination, the maximum rates to be charged by the Company after April 1, for exchange telephone service in the City of New York. The other made a like reduction \n\n[262 U.S. 43, 46]\n\u00a0\n in the maximum rates for such service in other municipalities within the State, which were divided into groups, with basic area rates in each; with a further provision that either the Company or any municipality affected might apply for modification of the classifications on or before April 15. The Company on March 29 filed its bill in the District Court against the Commission, its counsel and the Attorney General of the State, for the purpose of enjoining the enforcement of these orders, upon the ground that they were confiscatory and in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. An application for an interlocutory injunction was heard by three judges; and the court as thus constituted on June 12 granted an interlocutory order enjoining the defendants from enforcing the orders of the Commission pending the final hearing and until the further order of the court; the Company being required to give bond for $6,000,000 to secure the repayment to its subscribers of all excess charges paid pending the suit in the event the injunction should thereafter be dissolved. From this interlocutory order the defendants have appealed directly to this court.\n Since the argument on the appeal the Company has submitted a motion to dismiss the appeal or affirm the order of the court, upon the ground that on January 25, 1923, the Commission made final orders in the pending investigation establishing a schedule of telephone rates for the State which will yield the Company a much higher annual return than the temporary rates whose enforcement was enjoined. This, it is insisted, shows that the injunction was properly granted. \n1\n The fact that the \n\n[262 U.S. 43, 47]\n\u00a0\n Commission has, more than seven months after the injunction was granted, made orders allowing higher rates-whose correctness may yet be questioned in appropriate procee ings for review-upon evidence not before us, does not establish that the injunction was rightly granted under the conditions which then existed. See Cumberland Telephone Co. v. Louisiana Commission ( D. C.) 283 Fed. 215, 218. Hence the motion is denied.\n The appellants urge, in substance, as grounds of error: That the special court of three judges had no jurisdiction to grant the injunction; that the bill contained insufficient averments of fact, as distinguished from mere conclusions; that it was prematurely filed; and that the injunction was granted upon insufficient evidence.\n We conclude:\n\n 1. \nThe specially constituted court of three judges had jurisdiction under Section 266 of the Judicial Code to hear and determine the application for the injunction upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of the orders of the Commission. Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. Russell ( March 5, 1923) \n261 U.S. 290\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 353, 67 L. Ed. --.\n\n 2. \nThe defendants answered the bill on the merits without questioning in any way the sufficiency or form of its averments. See Campbell v. United States, \n244 \nU.S. 99, 106\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 398. The bill specifically alleged that the cost of the Company's property in the State devoted to the rendition of intrastate telephone service, the cost of its reproduction, and its fair and reasonable value exceeded the sums of $247, 000,000, $373,000,000 and $323,000,000, respectively; and that the rates prescribed by the Commission would prevent it from earning more than 2.56% per annum upon the cost of such property and 1.96% upon its fair and reasonable value and would not afford it a fair return upon such value. In short, it aptly stated the ultimate facts upon which the Company asked relief, \n\n[262 U.S. 43, 48]\n\u00a0\n omitting any mere statements of evidence. Equity Rule 25, par. 3 (198 Fed. xxv, 115 C. C. A. xxv).\n\n 3. \nUpon the making by the Commission of the orders in question the proceedings had reached the judicial state entitling the Company to resort to the court for relief. Bacon v. Rutland Railroad, \n232 \nU.S. 134, 137\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 283, distinguishing Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line, \n211 \nU.S. 210, 229\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 67, in which an appeal had not been taken to the highest tribunal vested with the final legislative authority of the State. Here the Commission is vested with the final legislative authority of the State in the ratemaking process; the authority exercised by the state courts upon a review by certiorari ( People v. Wilecox, 194 N. Y. 383, 87 N. E. 517), being purely judicial and having no legislative character. Civil Practice Act (Laws New York 1920, c. 925)  1304, 1305\n\n\n It was not necessary that the Company should apply to the Commission for a rehearing before resorting to the court. While under the Public Service Commissions Law any person interested in an order of the Commission has the right to apply for a rehearing, the Commission is not required to grant such rehearing unless in its judgment sufficient reason therefor appear; the application for the rehearing does not excuse compliance with the order or its enforcement except as the Commission may direct; and any change made in the original order upon the rehearing does not affect the enforcement of any right arising from the original order ( Sec. 22). As the law does not require an application for a rehearing to be made and its granting is entirely within the discretion of the Commission, we see no reason for requiring it to be made as a condition precedent to the bringing of a suit to enjoin the enforcement of the order. See, by analogy, Hollis v. Kutz, \n255 \nU.S. 452, 454\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 371; In re Arkansas Rate Cases (C. C.) 187 Fed. 290, 306; Atlantic Coast Line v. Interstate Commission (Com. Ct.) 194 Fed. 449, 452; Baltimore Railroad v. Railroad Commission (C. C.) 196 Fed. 690, 693, \n\n[262 U.S. 43, 49]\n\u00a0\n 699; and Chicago Railways v. Illinois Commission (D. C.) 277 Fed. 970, 974. In Palermo Land & Water Co. v. Railroad Commission (D. C.) 227 Fed. 708, the statute spec fically provided that no cause of action should accrue in any court out of any order of the Commission unless an application for a rehearing had been made. Here the Commission did not suggest in its answer that it perceived any ground upon which it would have granted a rehearing, if an application had been made, but, on the contrary, maintained the correctness of its orders in all respects. Manifestly under such circumstances the injunction should not have been denied merely because application had not been made to the Commission for a rehearing.\n And for like reasons, it was not necessary that the Company should have exercised the privilege granted by one of the orders of applying to the Commission for modification of the classification.\n Nor did the fact that the orders of the Commission merely prescribed temporary rates to be effective until its final determination, deprive the Company of its right to relief at the hands of the court. The orders required the new reduced rates to be put into effect on a given date. They were final legislative acts as to the period during which they should remain in effect pending the final determination; and if the rates prescribed were confiscatory the Company would be deprived of a reasonable return upon its property during such period, without remedy, unless their enforcement should be enjoined. Upon a showing that such reduced rates were confiscatory the Company was entitled to have their enforcement enjoined pending the continuance and completion of the rate-making process. Cumberland Telephone Co. v. Louisiana Commission, supra. And see, by analogy, Oklahoma Natural Gas. Co. v. Russell, supra; and Love v. Atchison Railway (C. C. A.) 185 Fed. 321, 326, 107 C. C. A. 403 (affirming [C. C.] \n\n[262 U.S. 43, 50]\n\u00a0\n 174 Fed. 59 and 177 Fed. 493). If the Commission, however, had fixed an early date for the final hearing this might have been taken into consideration by the court as an element affecting the exercise of its discretion in the matter of granting an interlocutory injunction. Cumberland Telephone Co. v. Louisiana Commission, supra, 283 Fed. 217. But in the present case the Commission was still continuing indefinitely its general investigation and had not fixed any date for the final hearing.\n\n 4. \nThe application for the injunction was heard by the District Court upon the pleadings and affidavits relating to the cost and value of the Company's property, its revenue and expenses. It was not necessary that the Company offer in evidence the voluminous testimony that had been taken by the Commission on the legislative question prior to making the orders in question. The bill did not challenge the orders of the Commission on the ground that it had acted arbitrarily, without any evidence. See Louisville Railroad v. Garrett, \n231 \nU.S. 299, 308\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 48. The sole issue presented was whether or not the orders were confiscatory; which was to be determined by the court upon the evidence submitted to it. Either party might, of course, show, by competent testimony, any fact brought out before the Commission which might throw light upon this issue; and the defendants cannot now rightly complain that the Company did not introduce evidence which they themselves do not appear to have regarded as material.\n The District Court, after consideration and analysis of the evidence, concluded that the value of the Company's property upon which it was entitled a return could not be reduced much below $300,000,000, and that the rates prescribed could not possibly yield a fair return upon such valuation. It is well settled that the granting of a temporary injunction, pending final hearing, is within the sound discretion of the trial court; and that, upon appeal, \n\n[262 U.S. 43, 51]\n\u00a0\n an order granting such an injunction will not be disturbed unless contrary to some rule of equity, or the result of improvident exercise of judicial discretion. Meccano, Ltd., v. Wanamaker, \n253 \nU.S. 136, 141\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 463; Love v. Atchison Railway, supr , 185 Fed. 331, and cases there cited. Especially will the granting of the temporary writ be upheld, when the balance of injury as between the parties favors its issue. City of Amarillo v. Southwestern Telephone Co. (C. C. A.) 253 Fed. 638, 640, 165 C. C. A. 264. Here the Commission had prescribed temporary rates which were found to be confiscatory, which were to continue in effect pending the final determination of the Commission after its investigation had been completed; and no date had been fixed for the completion of this investigation or the final hearing. The Company meanwhile could only be protected from loss by injunction; while, on the other hand, its subscribers were protected by the bond which was required for the return of the excess charges collected if the injunction should be thereafter dissolved. There was no necessity in the particular situation presented for any test period of the new rates.\n And finding nothing in the record which justifies us in concluding that the District Court improvidently exercised its judicial discretion in granting the interlocutory injunction, its order is.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The motion, which is supported by affidavits, alleges that the annual return which will be afforded by the rates established by the final orders of the Commission will exceed by not less than $2,000,000 the revenue afforded by the rates which were in effect before the Commission prescribed the temporary rates in question, and by about $5,000,000 the revenue which would have been afforded by such temporary rates. \n\n\n\n\n","154":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPRICE FIRE & WATER PROOFING CO. v. U S(1923)\nNo. 257\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. S. S. Ashbaugh, of Washington, D. C., for appellant. \n\n[261 U.S. 179, 180]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By the Dent Act (Act March 2, 1919, c. 94, 40 Stat. 1272 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 14\/15 a-3115 14\/15 e]), the Secretary of War was authorized to adjust and discharge, upon a fair and equitable basis, agreements, express or implied, made prior to November 12, 1918, in connection with the prosecution of the war, 'when such agreement has been performed in whole or in part, or expenditures have been made or obligations incurred upon the faith of the same by any such person, firm, or corporation prior to November twelfth, nineteen hundred and eighteen, and such agreement has not been executed in the manner prescribed by law.' If an adjustment offered by the Secretary was refused by the claimant, the Court of Claims was given jurisdiction to award fair and just compensation. But it was expressly provided that neither the Secretary nor the court should include in the award 'prospective or possible profits on any part of the contract \n\n[261 U.S. 179, 181]\n\u00a0\n beyond the goods and supplies delivered to and accepted by the United States and a reasonable remuneration for expenditures and obligations or liabilities necessarily incurred in performing or preparing to perform' the contract.\n The claimant herein owned an establishment for fireproofing and waterproofing cloth. In 1917, an arrangement was made by which, after January 1, 1918, the plant, with increased facilities, was to be operated. by the claimant, wholly on cloth to be delivered to it from time to time by the government. Payment was to be made at an agreed rate per yard. No agreement was executed in the manner pr vided by law. Thereafter many orders for finishing goods were given. There were serious delays and irregularities on the part of the government, both in delivering the goods for finishing and in removing them from the premises after the work had been done, and upon the signing of the Armistice all unfinished orders were canceled. For all goods finished the claimant was paid at the agreed price. But by the action of the government prior to November 12, 1918, and by its cancellation of the orders, it was subjected to large and unanticipated expenses. A claim for these expenses and the losses incurred was duly presented to the Secretary of War. An adjustment offered by him was rejected, and thereupon claimant brought this suit in the Court of Claims for $641,313.64. The petition set forth ten distinct causes of action. On nine of these the court made the allowances set forth in the margin,1 which aggregate $47,700.08, and judgment was entered below for this \n\n[261 U.S. 179, 182]\n\u00a0\n amount. The tenth cause of action, on which $590,000 was claimed, was for loss to commercial business. On this no allowance was made. A motion for a new trial was asked for by claimant (on which ground does not appear) was overruled. Whether the court erred in disallowing the claim on the tenth cause of action is the sole question for decision on this appeal.\n The facts found by the court bearing especially on this cause of action were these:\n'When in the latter part of 1917 this arrangement was made, the plaintiff's plant, its processes, business, and good will as a going concern, were valuable, but what the value thereof was is not shown to the satisfaction of the court on the present record. \n\n[261 U.S. 179, 183]\n\u00a0\n 'When government work ceased in November, 1918, the plaintiff had no other business upon which it could continue the operation of its plant, and it became idle. The cessation of hostilities left the government with large quantities of goods on hand of the kind produced by the plaintiff company and by other concerns producing for the government the same general character of goods. These goods were sold by the government at different times in large lots at public auction, and generally at prices below cost of production, and the sale of these goods by the government supplied to a very considerable extent the demands of the trade for this class of good . In an effort to reestablish its business and preserve the value attaching to its plant as an operating concern, and in the belief that, if normal conditions should be restored, it could again do a profitable business, it has expended considerable sums of money, by operating at a loss, in keeping its business alive and its organization existent, and by reason of such efforts since the cessation of Government work it has sustained an operating loss of $125,000. It has not succeeded in re-establishing its business on a profitable basis, and its plant and business are now worth much less than before it took on government work and devoted its facilities thereto.'\n\n Claimant contends here that it should be allowed to recover this $125, 000, as expenses incurred in efforts to keep alive its business and organization to February, 1921, when the testimony was taken. The Dent Act does not permit any recovery on this ground. These were not 'expenditures or obligations or liabilities incurred in performing or preparing to perform the contract.' Nor were they made or incurred prior to November 12, 1918. There was no breach of contract or wrongful act on the part of the United States in this connection. Nor was there a taking of property for which compensation can be made. It is urged here that the full \n\n[261 U.S. 179, 184]\n\u00a0\n amount should be allowed to reimburse claimant for expenditures incurred at the plant in the early months of 1918, when it was idle because of the government's delay in supplying goods for finishing. Some allowance for expenses incurred during that period was allowed under the fifth cause of action and is included in the $47,700.08 for which judgment was entered. For awarding more there is no basis in the findings. No request for additional findings appears to have been made below. Nor was leave sought there, or here, to reopen the case, so that additional evidence could be introduced. The findings made are conclusive. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] (1) Storage and hauling charges on untreated gray goods: On this cause of action the Court of Claims awarded the plaintiff the sum of $ 2,147 05\n (2) Storage charges on treated goods after notice of completion: On this cause of action the Court of Claims awarded the plaintiff the sum of 544 60\n (3) Alterations and additions to the plant for storage purposes, including restoration: On this cause of action the Court of Claims awarded the plaintiff the sum of 11,249 16\n (4) Extra protection demanded by the defendants: On this cause of action the Court of Claims awarded the plaintiff the sum of 2, 953 11\n (5) Wages paid unemployed labor from December 29, 1917, to March 23, 1918: On this cause of action the Court of Claims awarded the plaintiff the sum of 3,013 52\n (6) Allowance on chemicals and materials left over after suspension of work: On this cause of action the Court of Claims awarded the plaintiff the sum of 3,877 87\n (7) Increased plant facilities: On this cause of action the Court of Claims awarded the plaintiff the sum of 20,000 00\n (8) Deductions made by defendants because of increased yardage resulting from treatment and for alleged loss in shipment: On this cause of action the Court of Claims awarded the plaintiff the sum of 964 09\n (9) Insurance premiums paid by plaintiff in excess of that provided for: On this cause of action the Court of Claims awarded the plaintiff the sum of 2,960 68\n Total amount awarded by Court of Claims $47,700 08 \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] There is nothing in Roxford Knitting Co. v.

Each action related to a designated part of the tax for a distinct year and was brought on the theory that the part designated was invalid because imposed under constitutional and statutory provisions repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. The Treasurer prevailed in the court of first instance and in the Supreme Court of the state. 185 Cal. 484, 197 Pac. 346. The Pullman Company then brought the cases here on writs of error.\n In 1910 California adopted an amendment to her Constitution, section 14 of article 13, one purpose of which was to effect a separation of state from local taxation by subjecting public service corporations to a designated tax for state purposes and relieving them from taxation for county and municipal purposes. Referring to this feature of the amendment, the Supreme Court of the state said in San Francisco v. Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co., 166 Cal. 244, 248, 135 Pac. 971, 973:\n'Under the old system, the property and franchises of the corporations above referred to were taxed for both state and local purposes. The amendment creates a new mode of taxing such property and franchises, and appropriates the revenue so raised to state purposes solely. The new method by which taxes are collected exclusively for the state, is substituted for the former system, under which the same subjects were taxed for both state and local purposes.'\n\n The pertinent parts of the amendment are as follows (Laws 1910-11, p. xliv):\n'Sec. 14 (a) ... All sleeping car, dining car, drawing room car, and palace car companies, ... operating upon the railroads in this state, ... shall annually pay to the state a tax upon their franchises, ... rolling stock, ... and other property, or any part thereof, used exclusively in the operation of their business in this state, computed as follows: Said tax shall be equal to the percentages hereinafter fixed upon \n\n[261 U.S. 330, 335]\n\u00a0\n the gross receipts from operation of such companies and each thereof within this state. When such companies are operating partly within and partly without this state, the gross receipts within this state shall be deemed to be all receipts on business beginning and ending within this state, and a proportion, based upon the proportion of the mileage within this state to the entire mileage over which such business is done, of receipts on all business passing through, into, or out of this state.\n\n'The percentages above mentioned shall be as follows: ... On all sleeping car, dining car, drawing room car, palace car companies , ... three per cent. ... Such taxes shall be in lieu of all other taxes and licenses, state, county and municipal, upon the property above enumerated of such companies except as otherwise in this section provided. ...\n\n'(e) ... In the event that the above named revenues are at any time deemed insufficient to meet the annual expenditures of t e state, including the above named expenditures for educational purposes, there may be levied, in the manner to be provided by law, a tax, for state purposes, on all the property in the state, including the classes of property enumerated in this section, sufficient to meet the deficiency.\n\n'(f) All the provisions of this section shall be self-executing, and the Legislature shall pass all laws necessary to carry this section into effect, and shall provide for a valuation and assessment of the property enumerated in this section. ... The rates of taxation fixed in this section shall remain in force until changed by the Legislature, two-thirds of all the members elected to each of the two houses voting in favor thereof.'\n\n Several acts to carry the amendment into effect were adopted from time to time, but it suffices here to say of them, first, that the computing percentage applicable to sleeping car, dining car, drawing room car, and palace car \n\n[261 U.S. 330, 336]\n\u00a0\n companies was increased to 4 per cent. in 1913 (chapter 6, Laws 1913) and reduced to 3.95 per cent. in 1915 (chapter 2, Laws 1915); secondly, that provision was made for enforcing the tax by either the usual tax sale or a suit in the name of the state (chapter 335,  20, 21, 24, Laws 1910-11; chapter 6,  5, Laws 1913); and, thirdly, that there was further provision that if the tax was not paid within a designated period the delinquent company, if a domestic corporation, 'will forfeit its charter' and if a foreign corporation, 'will forfeit its right to do business in this state,' and that the transaction of any business in the state on behalf of a company incurring any such forfeiture, except to settle its affairs, should be punished by substantial fines (Laws 1911, c. 335,  24; Laws 1913, c. 6,  5, and chapter 320,  9).\n The taxes in question were levied under the new system in 1911 and six subsequent years. All were alike, save in particulars not material here; so it will be enough to state the facts relating to the tax levied in 1911\n\n\n The Pullman Company is an Illinois corporation engaged in operating sleeping and parlor cars on the railroads of the country. Some of its cars are operated between points in California, some between points within and points without that state and some through the state between points outside. In 1910 the company's gross receipts from all its operations within the state were $1,905,302.97. Of this sum $938,786.80 came from operations which began and ended in the state and $966,516.17 came from that part of the interstate operations which was within the state. The latter amount was arrived at by taking every service performed partly within and partly without the state and determining on a mileage basis what portion of the sum received therefor was attributable to the part of the service within the state. To illustrate: If a passenger was carried in a sleeping car from Oakland to Chicago for $14, and one-seventh of \n\n[261 U.S. 330, 337]\n\u00a0\n the mileage was in California, $2 was deemed the gross receipt for so much of the service as was rendered in that state.\n The gross receipts were calculated and reported by the company and the state officers accepted the calculation. The amount of the tax was computed by applying to the gross receipts the percentage rule prescribed by the amendment to the state Constitution. In this way a tax of $57,159. 08 was levied in 1911. Had the gross receipts from intrastate business alone been considered the tax would have been $28,163.61-that is, $28,995. 47 less than the actual levy.\n The company objected to the consideration of the gross receipts from the interstate business, although they came only from service within the state, and objected to a corresponding part of the tax-the $28,995.47. That part was paid under protest and the first of these actions was brought to recover it-an admissible course under the state law. Laws 1910- 1911, c. 335,  23; Laws 1913, c. 320,  7. The other part was paid voluntarily and is not in controversy.\n The company insists t at the tax in question and the provisions therefor in the state Constitution and statutes are invalid under the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, because (a) the tax is laid on gross receipts from interstate commerce, and (b) its payment is made a condition to continuing an interstate business within the state, and are invalid under the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because the tax is intended to reach income from property situated and business done without the state.\n The state court holds that the tax is not a tax on gross receipts as such, but is in both name and essence a tax on property within the state, and that it is computed with reference to the gross receipts only as a means of adjusting \n\n[261 U.S. 330, 338]\n\u00a0\n it to the real value of the property in the relation in which the same is used.\n The principles to be applied in cases of this class repeatedly have been considered by this court and are now settled.\n A state can neither tax the act of engaging in interstate commerce nor lay a tax on gross receipts therefrom. In either case the tax would be a restraint or burden on such commerce and its imposition and invasion of the power of regulation confided to Congress by the commerce clause of the Constitution. Fargo v. Michigan, \n121 U.S. 230\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 857; Philadelphia & Southern Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 U.S. 326\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 1118; Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Ry. Co. v. Texas, \n210 U.S. 217\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 638; Meyer v. Wells, Fargo & Co., \n223 U.S. 298\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 218.\n The rule is otherwise with property used in interstate commerce. A state within whose limits such property is permanently located or commonly used may tax it. Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, \n246 \nU.S. 450, 453\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 373; Wells, Fargo & Co. v. Nevada, \n248 \nU.S. 165, 167\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 62; Union Tank Line Co. v. Wright, \n249 \nU.S. 275, 282\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 276. And, if the property be part of a system and have an augmented value by reason of a connected operation of the whole, it may be taxed according to its value as part of the system, although the other parts be outside the state; in other words, the tax may be made to cover the enhanced value which comes to the property in the state through its organic relation to the system. Fargo v. Hart, \n193 \nU.S. 490, 499\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 498; Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Ry. Co. v. Texas, \n210 U.S. 225\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 638; United States Express Co. v. Minnesota, \n223 \nU.S. 335, 337\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 211; Union Tank Line Co. v. Wright, supra.\n In taxing property so situated and used, a state may select and employ any appropriate means of reaching its actual or full value as part of a going concern-such as treating the gross receipts from its use in both intrastate \n\n[261 U.S. 330, 339]\n\u00a0\n and interstate commerce as an index or measure of its value-and if the means do not involve any discrimination against interstate commerce and the tax amounts to no more than what would be legitimate as an ordinary tax upon the property, valued with reference to its use, the tax is not open to attack as restraining or burdening such commerce. Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, supra; St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 367\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 99; United States Express Co. v. Minnesota, supra; Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Ry. Co. v. Texas, \n210 U.S. 227\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 638; Union Tank Line Co. v. Wright, supra.\n An examination of the tax in question in the light of these principles shows that the chief objection urged against it is not tenable. The provisions under which the tax is imposed call it a property tax, specify the property subjected to it and declare that it is in lieu of all other taxes on such property. The Supreme Court of the state holds it is a tax on the property specified. In no material respect does it differ from the tax which was recognized by this court as a property tax in United States Express Co. v. Minnesota and Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, above cited. True, it is computed with special regard to the gross receipts, but this, as is fairly shown, is done merely as a means of getting at the full value of the property, considering its nature and use. The tax is not claimed to be in excess of what would be legitimate as an ordinary tax on the property valued as part of a going concern, nor to be relatively higher than the taxes on other kinds of property. There is no ground for thinking that it operates as a discrimination against interstate commerce.\n The statutory provision that a foreign corporation which fails to pay the tax shall be excluded from doing business in the state requires but brief notice. It is not sought to be enforced here. The Pullman Company has not failed to pay the tax. The provision has not been \n\n[261 U.S. 330, 340]\n\u00a0\n construed by the state court. If it be construed as covering interstate commerce it is void, for the right to engage in such commerce is not within the state's control. See Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Massachusetts, \n125 \nU.S. 530, 554\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 961; Leloup v. Port of Mobile, \n127 \nU.S. 640, 645\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 1380; Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, \n155 \nU.S. 688, 695\n, 696 S., 15 Sup. Ct. 268. The state court may construe it as confined to intrastate business. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 368\n, 369 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 99. In neither event would it affect the validity of the tax before us.\n We find nothing in the provisions under which the tax was levied in the decision off the state court, or in the record, which gives any support to the contention that the tax is intended to reach income from property situated or business done without the state.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","156":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPUSEY & JONES CO. v. HANSSEN(1923)\nNo. 431\nArgued: February 27, 1923Decided: April 9, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. Lindley M. Garrison, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Wm. H. Button, of New York City, for respondent.[ Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen \n261 U.S. 491\n (1923) ]\n\n\n[261 U.S. 491, 494]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Section 3883 of the Revised Code of Delaware of 1915 (which embodies the Act of March 25, 1891, chapter 181; 19 Del. Laws, p. 359) provides:\n'Whenever a corporation shall be insolvent, the Chancellor, on the application and for the benefit of any creditor or stockholder thereof, may, at any time, in his discretion, appoint one or more persons to be receivers of and for such corporation, to take charge of the estate, effects, business and affairs thereof, and to collect the outstanding debts, claims, and property due and belonging to the company, with power to prosecute and defend, in the name of the corporation or otherwise, all claims or suits, to appoint an agent or agents under them, and to do all other acts which might be done by such corporation and may be necessary and proper; that powers of such receivers to be such and continued so long as the Chancellor \n\n[261 U.S. 491, 495]\n\u00a0\n shall think necessary: Provided, however, that the provisions of this section shall not apply to corporations for public improvement.'\n\n Whether the federal court sitting in equity has, by reason of the above statute, jurisdiction to appoint a receiver of an insolvent Delaware corporation upon application of an unsecured simple contract creditor is the main question presented. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Invoking the power conferred by the statute, Hanssen, a subject of Norway, brought in the federal court for the District of Delaware this suit in equity against the Pusey & Jones Company, a corporation organized under the general laws of that state. The bill, which was prosecuted on behalf of all creditors and stockholders, alleged that the corporation was insolvent, that plaintiff was a creditor, holding promissory notes issued by it, and that he was also a stockholder. It prayed that a receiver be \n\n[261 U.S. 491, 496]\n\u00a0\n appointed. \n2\n The bill was filed on June 9, 1921, receivers were appointed ex parte, and an order issued that the defendant show cause, on June 18, why the receivers should not be continued during the pendency of the cause. On June 11, the defendant moved to vacate the receivership. The motion was denied. Then, by answer, the defendant objected that the court had no jurisdiction either at law or in equity, denied that plaintiff was either a creditor or a stockholder, denied that defendant was insolvent, and asserted that defendant was entitled under the federal Constitution to have determined in an action at law the question whether plaintiff was a creditor.\n Upon a hearing of the order to show cause, had on bill, answer, affidavits, and exhibits, a decree was entered confirming the appointment of the receivers and continuing them pendente lite. 276 Fed. 296. This decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 279 Fed. 488. Neither the District Court, nor the Circuit Court of Appeals, passed upon the question whether Hanssen was a stockholder. Both courts held that, by reason of the state statute, the federal court sitting in equity had jurisdiction and power to appoint a receiver of a Delaware corporation upon a plication of a simple contract creditor, whose claim had not been reduced to judgment and who had no lien upon the corporate property. Both courts held that the controverted question whether the plaintiff was a creditor could be determined in the equity suit; and both held (upon the evidence submitted by affidavit) that the plaintiff was a creditor. The case is here on writ of certiorari. \n\n[261 U.S. 491, 497]\n\u00a0\n That this suit could not be maintained in the absence of the statute is clear. A receiver is often appointed upon application of a secured creditor who fears that his security will be wasted. Kountze v. Omaha Hotel Co., \n107 \nU.S. 378, 395\n, 2 S. Sup. Ct. 911. A receiver is often appointed upon application of a judgment creditor who has exhausted his legal remedy. See White v. Ewing, \n159 U.S. 36\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 1018. But an unsecured simple contract creditor has, in the absence of statute, no substantive right, legal or equitable, in or to the property of his debtor. This is true, whatever the nature of the property, and although the debtor is a corporation and insolvent. The only substantive right of a simple contract creditor is to have his debt paid in due course. His adjective right is, ordinarily, at law. He has no right whatsoever in equity until he has exhausted his legal remedy. After execution upon a judgment recovered at law has been returned unsatisfied, he may proceed in equity by a creditors' bill. Hollins v. Brierfield Coal & Iron Co., \n150 U.S. 371\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 127. Compare Swan Land & Cattle Co. v. Frank, \n148 U.S. 603\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 691; National Tube Works Co. v. Ballou, \n146 U.S. 517\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 165; Pierce v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 398, 403\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 365. He may, by such a bill, remove any obstacle to satisfy his execution at law, or may reach assets equitable in their nature, or he may provisionally protect his debtor's property from misappropriation or waste, by means either of an injunction or a receiver. Whether the debtor be an individual or a corporation, the appointment of a receiver is merely an ancillary and incidental remedy. A receivership is not final relief. The appointment determines no substantive right, nor is it a step in the determination of such a right. It is a means of preserving property which may ultimately be applied toward the satisfaction of substantive rights.\n That a remedial right to proceed in a federal court sitting in equity cannot be enlarged by a state statute is likewise clear. Scott v. Neely, \n140 U.S. 106\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 712; Cates v. Allen, \n\n[261 U.S. 491, 498]\n\u00a0\n \n149 U.S. 451\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 883, 977. Nor can it be so narrowed. Mississippi Mills v. Cohn, \n150 U.S. 202\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 75; Guffey v. Smith, \n237 \nU.S. 101, 114\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 526. The federal court may therefore be obliged to deny an equitable remedy which the plaintiff might have secured in a state court. \n3\n Hanssen's contention is that the statute does not enlarge the equitable jurisdiction or remedies, and that it confers upon creditors of a Delaware corporation, if the company is insolvent, a substantive equitable right to have a receiver appointed. If this were true the right conferred could be enforced in the federal courts (Scott v. Neely, \n140 \nU.S. 106, 109\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 712),4 since the proceeding is in pleading and practice conformable to those commonly entertained by a court of equity. But it is not true that this statute confers upon the creditor a substantive right. \n5\n Bankruptcy Act July 1, 1898, c. 541,  3, 18, 30 Stat. 544, 546, 551 ( Comp. St.  9587, 9602), does confer upon \n\n[261 U.S. 491, 499]\n\u00a0\n creditors of a corporation (or individual) the right, under certain conditions, to have the property of an insolvent debtor taken possession of and administered by an officer of the court. Compare Acme Harvester Co. v. Beekman Lumber Co., \n222 \nU.S. 300, 309\n, 310 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 96; ulcan Sheet Metal Co. v. North Platte Valley Irrigation Co., 220 Fed. 106, 136 C. C. A. 198. The Delaware statute does not confer upon creditors the right to have a receiver appointed, although the insolvency of the corporation may be palpable, hopeless and attended by indisputable fraud or mismanagement. Insolvency is made a condition of the Chancellor's jurisdiction; but it does not give rise to any substantive right in the creditor. Jones v. Maxwell Motor Co. (Del. Ch.) 115 Atl. 312, 314, 315. It makes possible a new remedy, because it confers upon the Chancellor a new power. Whether that power is visitorial (as the appellant insists), or whether it is strictly judicial, need not be determined in this case. Whatever its exact nature, the power enables the Chancellor to afford a remedy which theretofore would not have been open to an unsecured simple contract creditor. But because that which the statute confers is merely a remedy, the statute cannot affect proceedings in the federal courts sitting in equity.\n The case is wholly unlike Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n234 U.S. 369\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 810, and other cases in which federal courts, because of a state statute, entertained suits to remove a cloud upon title, which otherwise must have been dismissed. In those cases, as pointed out in Clark v. Smith, 13 Pet. 195, 203, the statute changed a rule of substantive law. For instance, a statute provides that a deed, void on its face, shall be deemed a cloud, whereas theretofore it was not. It declares 'what shall form a cloud on titles.' As stated in Reynolds v. Crawfordsville First National Bank, \n112 \nU.S. 405, 410\n, 55 S. Sup. Ct. 213, 216 (28 L. Ed. 733), the federal court looks 'to the legislation of the state in which the court sits [and the land is situated] to ascertain \n\n[261 U.S. 491, 500]\n\u00a0\n what constitutes a cloud upon the title, and what the state laws declare to be such the courts of the United States sitting in equity have jurisdiction to remove.' In such cases, as the statute confers upon the landowner a substantive right, he is entitled to the aid of the federal court for its enforcement. But where a state statute relating to clouds upon title is held merely to enlarge the equitable remedy, it will not support a bill in equity in the federal court. Thus, in Whitehead v. Shattuck, \n138 U.S. 146\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 276, the statute relied upon authorized a suit in equity by one out of possession against one in possession. As an action at law in the nature of ejectment afforded an adequate legal remedy, the bill to quiet title was dismissed.\n The case at bar is also unlike In re Metropolitan Railway Receivership, \n208 \nU.S. 90, 109\n, 110 S., 28 Sup. Ct. 219, and many others, in which there was express consent by the corporation to the appointment of the receiver, or where the indebtedness to plaintiff and the corporation's insolvency were admitted, or the lack of jurisdiction in equity was waived. The objection that the bill does not make a case properly cognizable in a court of equity does not go to its jurisdiction as a federal court. Smith v. McKay, \n161 U.S. 355\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 490; Blythe v. Hinckley, \n173 U.S. 501\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 497. The objection may, as pointed out in Reynes v. Dumont, \n130 \nU.S. 354, 395\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 486, be taken by the court of its own motion. But, unlike lack of jurisdiction as a federal court, Mansfield, Coldwater & Lake Michigan Ry. Co. v. Swan, \n111 \nU.S. 379, 382\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 510, lack of equity jurisdiction (if not objected to by a defendant) may be ignored by the court, in cases where the subject-matter of the suit is of a class of which a court of equity has jurisdiction. And where the defendant has expressly consented to action by the court, or has failed to object seasonably, the objection will be treated as waived. Brown v. Lake Superior Iron Co., \n134 \nU.S. 530, 535\n, 536 S., 10 Sup. Ct. 604; Southern Paci ic R. Co. v. United States (No. 1), 200 \n\n[261 U.S. 491, 501]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 341, 349, 26 Sup. Ct. 296. In cases relied upon by respondent there was such waiver. But, here, the company strenuously insisted throughout upon the absence of jurisdiction and denied every material allegation on which it is sought to support the bill.\n Respondent contends that, even if there was originally lack of equity jurisdiction, the defect was cured on October 8, 1921, when the intervention of the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation was filed and allowed. That corporation claimed to be a creditor and to have a mortgage lien on all the real estate of the Pusey & Jones Company. The contention is that the original defect in jurisdiction was thus cured, because the existence of a direct lien gives equity jurisdiction for the appointment of receivers, unhampered by the obstacles that confront unsecured simple contract creditors. The contention is clearly unsound, among other reasons, because the intervention did not occur until two months after entry of the decree here under review.\n Respondent contends, also, that, even if there was no jurisdiction of the suit as a creditors' bill, it should be sustained now as a stockholder's bill. The answer denied that Hanssen was or ever had been a stockholder, denied that any certificate of stock ever had been assigned or transferred to him, denied that any certificate ever became his property, and denied that he was the holder or owner of any stock. The bill prayed that the corporation be directed to issue to plaintiff a certificate for the stock which he claims to own. Both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals left undetermined this claim that he was or should be made a stockholder. We do not decide it. And we have no occasion to consider whether the bill could be sustained, if Hanssen proved to be a stockholder.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA and Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It will be assumed that the words 'any creditor,' as used in the statute, include an unsecured simple contract creditor. It was so held by the District Court and by the Circuit Court of Appeals in this case (276 Fed. 296; 279 Fed. 488); and it had been previously so held in the Circuit Court. Jones v. Mutual Fidelity Co. (C. C.) 123 Fed. 506. The question, which is one of construction, does not appear to have been expressly decided by the courts of Delaware. The reported cases do not disclose that it has been raised in the state courts. In those cases in which jurisdiction was taken, the plaintiff was apparently a stockholder. Thoroughgood v. Georgetown Water Co., 9 Del. Ch. 84, 77 Atl. 720; Ross v. South Delaware Gas Co., 10 Del. Ch. 236, 89 Atl. 593; Sill v. Kentucky Coal & Timber Development Co., 11 Del. Ch. 93, 97 Atl. 617; Hopper v.

The answer denied the collusion. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The oft-quoted statement in Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203, 221 (21 L.

Denson, of Birmingham, Ala., for appellant.\n Mr. Rufus S. Day, of Washington, D. C., for appellee,\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant was convicted in the federal District Court for the Northern District of Alabama of a felony and sentenced to imprisonment. The record of the District Court recites that 'a jury of good and lawful men' was duly impaneled, sworn and charged. After sentence appellant moved to amend the record entry to show that only 11 men sat as jurors in the case and offered testimony in support of the motion, The court rejected the proof on the ground that oral testimony was not admissible to modify or amend the record, and, first reciting that after hearing the evidence and arguments, being of opinion that the record of the judgment entry was as it should be, and did not need amendment, it denied the motion. Appellant then applied to this court for a writ of mandamus to require the District Judge to correct the record in the particulars just stated, setting forth in his petition the evidence offered and rejected. The writ was denied (Ex parte Riddle, \n255 \nU.S. 450, 451\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 370, 371); this court saying:\n'He [appellant] might have saved the point by an exception at the trial or by a bill of exceptions to the denial of his subsequent motion, setting forth whatever facts or offers of proof were material and then have brought a \n\n[262 U.S. 333, 335]\n\u00a0\n writ of error. Nalle v. Oyster, \n230 U.S. 165\n, 177. In such cases mandamus does not lie. Ordinarily, at least, it is not to be used when another statutory method has been provided for reviewing the action below, or to reverse a decision of record. Ex parte Morgan, \n114 U.S. 174\n; Ex parte Park Square Automobile Station, \n244 U.S. 412\n, 414. In this case the facts were more or less clearly admitted at the argument, but the record does not establish them, and the extent of agreement or dispute with regard to them does not change the remedy to be sought.'\n\n Appellant then took the case by writ of error to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Riddle et al. v. United States, 279 Fed. 216, where the judgment so far as it concerns appellant was affirmed.\n The point was not saved in a bill of exceptions, and it was not considered by the Court of Appeals. After the rendition of the judgment by that court, appellant sued out a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for the Northern Division of the Northern District of Georgia, seeking release from imprisonment on the ground that the jury which convicted him was illegally constituted of less than 12 men. That court, on the return of the appellee and after hearing, discharged the writ and remanded appellant to custody, from which order the case comes here by appeal.\n T at the trial court had jurisdiction to try and punish the appellant for the offense with which he was charged is not disputed. The attempt is collaterally to impeach the record, showing upon its face that a lawful jury was duly impaneled, sworn, and charged. Appellant's remedy, as suggested in the mandamus proceeding, was by writ of error. He did not avail himself of it, and, whatever may have been the cause or excuse for not doing so, habeas corpus cannot be used as a substitute. Frank v. Mangum, \n237 \nU.S. 309, 326\n, 35 S. Sup.

The \n\n[262 U.S. 333, 336]\n\u00a0\n writ of habeas corpus is not a proceeding in the original criminal prosecution, but an independent civil suit (Ex parte Tom Tong, \n108 \nU.S. 556, 559\n, 2 S. Sup. Ct. 871). in which the record of the trial court is not open to collateral attack, but imports absolute verity. See Ex parte Tobias Watkins, 3 Pet. 193, 202-203, 207; In re Lennon, supra; Grignon's Lessee v. Astor et al., 2 How. 319, 340-342; Matter of Gregory, \n219 U.S. 210\n, 213-214, 218, 31 Sup. Ct. 143; 2 Black on Judgments,  625; 1 Black on Judgments,  254.\n The power to inquire into facts outside the record, allowed under some circumstances (In re Mayfield, \n141 \nU.S. 107, 116\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 939), cannot be extended to such as are inconsistent with the record.\n The Frank Case relied upon by appellant, does not decide otherwise. The language quoted (\n237 U.S. 331\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 589), to the effect that the court may 'look behind and beyond the record ... to a sufficient extent to test the jurisdiction of the ... court' and 'inquire into jurisdictional facts, whether they appear upon the record or not,' was not meant to abrogate the rule established by prior decisions that the record may not be contradicted collaterally, at least where, as here, jurisdiction of the cause or parties is not involved, and this is demonstrated by the cases cited in support of the statement. In Cuddy, Petitioner, \n131 \nU.S. 280, 286\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 703, the court, sustaining the propriety of the inquiry there permitted, said: 'Such evidence would not have contradicted the record.'

Anderson, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Paul Vallee, of Los Angeles, Cal., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This record includes two cases which were tried together in the State courts and have been heard together here.\n The writs of error are brought to review judgments of the District Court of Appeal affirming judgments of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, condemning lands of the plaintiffs in error for use by the County as public highways; which they insist have deprived them of their property without due process of law and in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[262 U.S. 700, 702]\n\u00a0\n The two fundamental questions involved are whether the uses for which these lands have been taken are public uses authorized by law; and whether the taking was necessary to such uses.\n Section 1238 of the California Code of Civil Procedure includes 'highways' among the 'public uses' for which the right of eminent domain may be exercised. Section 1241, as amended in 1913, provides that before property can be taken it must appear that the use to which it is to be applied is one authorized by law and that the taking is necessary to such use: Provided, inter alia, that when the legislative body of a county has, by resolution adopted by vote of two-thirds of its members, found and determined that the public interest and necessity require the construction by the county of any proposed public improvement located within its limits and that designated property is necessary therefor, such resolution shall be 'conclusive evidence' of the public necessity for such improvement, that such property is necessary therefor, and that such improvement is located in the manner most compatible with the greatest public good and the least private injury. States. 1913, p. 549.\n The plaintiffs in error are the owners of a large tract of land lying on the shore of the Pacific Ocean, known as the Malibu Ranch, extending in an easterly and westerly direction about twenty-two miles and varying in width from one-half mile to one and one-half miles. It lies at the base of a high and rugged mountain range which parallels the shore at a distance of from three to four miles, its northern line extending along the slope and foothills of this mountain range, and is traversed by many ridges and intervening canyons leading from the mountains toward the shore. It lies about ten miles west of Santa Monica, one of the principal cities of Los Angeles County, situated on the coast to the southwest of the City of Los Angeles, and is mainly in Los Angeles County, but extends \n\n[262 U.S. 700, 703]\n\u00a0\n about a mile and a half into Ventura County, the adjoining county on the west. It is traversed lengthwise by a private road of the ranch owners which was formerly used by farmers and settlers living north of the ranch on the slope of the mountains and west of the ranch in Ventura County, but which has been for several years closed by the ranch owners to the public. \n 2\n\u00a0\n\n In 1916 and 1917 the Board of Supervisors, the legislative body of Los Angeles County, without notice to the ranch owners, adopted, by the required vote, two resolutions declaring that the public nterest and necessity required the construction of the two highways now in controversy 'for public highway purposes' and that it was necessary for such 'public uses' that the lands included therein be acquired by the county; and directing that condemnation proceedings be instituted for such purposes. One of these proposed highways, which is known in the record as the 'main road,' commences at the eastern boundary of the ranch, where it connects with and forms a continuation of a much traveled public county highway running along the shore of the ocean from Santa Monica, and extends lengthwise through the ranch in a westerly direction to the Ventura County line where it terminates within the boundaries of the ranch. The other is a branch from this main road, extending to the northern boundary of the ranch, where it terminates. There are no connecting public roads either at the western termination of the main road or the northern termination of the branch road.\n These condemnation proceedings were thereupon instituted in the Superior Court of the County. They were \n\n[262 U.S. 700, 704]\n\u00a0\n vigorously resisted by the ranch owners, who denied the County's right of condemnation. Certain special defenses which they interposed, alleging that the main road would furnish no way of necessity or convenience for public use or travel, were stricken out by the court. Upon a preliminary trial as to the right of condemnation, the trial judge, after the resolutions of the Board had been introduced in evidence by the County, ruled that while they were not conclusive evidence of the matters specified in the proviso to section 1241 of the Code, they were prima facie evidence thereof. And the ranch owners then, without objection or limitation, introduced a large mass of evidence in support of all of their defenses, including the matters which had been alleged in the special defenses that had been stricken out; and a large mass of rebuttal evidence was then introduced by the County, the testimony on both sides relating to all the matters which had been or now are in issue in the cases.\n The trial judge reviewed the evidence, and, manifestly without reference to any presumption arising under his ruling as to the prima facie evidence furnished by the resolutions, decided all the questions submitted in favor of the County, and made specific findings that the public interest and necessity required the acquisition of these public highways; that the use to which they were to be applied was authorized by law; that they would afford accommodation to the traveling public; and that they were located as required. Thereafter, the amount of landowners' compensation and damages having been determined by a jury-as to which no question is made-judgments condemning these lands for public highways were entered.\n On appeals taken by the ranch owners the District Court of Appeal held that the taking of the property for these highways was for a public use; that the proviso to section 1241 of the Code was not obnoxious to any provision of \n\n[262 U.S. 700, 705]\n\u00a0\n the State or Federal Constitutions, and under it the resolutions were conclusive evidence of the matters specified; that in any event the ranch owners had not been prejudiced by the rulings of the trial court as to the effect of this proviso as they had been permitted to introduce full and complete evidence on these subjects; and that they had not been prejudiced by the striking out of their special defenses not only because the resolutions were conclusive evidence that the taking was necessary, but also because every material issue tendered by these special defenses was otherwise raised by the pleadings and they had been permitted to offer evidence touching every matter contained therein; and it thereupon sustained the findings of the trial court and affirmed the judgments of condemnation. Los Angeles County v. Rindge Co., 53 Cal. App. 166, 200 Pac. 27.\n The ranch owners urge here, in substance: That the use for which their property was taken was not a public use authorized by aw, and their special defenses raising this question as to the main road were erroneously stricken out; that their property was taken without any public necessity, and, the proviso to section 1241 of the Code purporting to make the resolutions conclusive evidence thereof being in violation of the State Constitution and of the Fourteenth Amendment and constituting neither conclusive nor prima facie evidence, the burden of disproving this public necessity was erroneously cast upon them; and that in consequence the judgments of condemnation deprived them of their property in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n 1. \nAuthorized Public Use. The nature of a use, whether public or private, is ultimately a judicial question. However the determination of this question is influenced by local conditions; and this court, while enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment, should keep in \n\n[262 U.S. 700, 706]\n\u00a0\n view the diversity of such conditions and regard with great respect the judgments of state courts upon what should be deemed public uses in any state. Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley, \n164 \nU.S. 112, 158\n, 160 S., 17 Sup. Ct. 56; Hairston v. Danville Railway, \n208 \nU.S. 598, 606\n, 607 S. 28 Sup. Ct. 331, 13 Ann. Cas. 1008. That a taking of property for a highway is a taking for public use has been universally recognized, from time immemorial. The California Code specifically declares 'highways' to be 'public uses' for which the right of eminent domain may be exercised. Here, the Board of Supervisors, familiar with local conditions, has declared these highways to be for public uses; and the local and appellate state courts have likewise held them to be for public uses authorized by law.\n The ranch owners concede that a genuine highway, in fact adapted as a way of convenience or necessity for public use and travel, is a public use. Their real contention is that these particular roads, while called highways are 'highways' in name merely, that is, that they are shams under the name of public improvements, which cannot, in fact, furnish ways of convenience or necessity to the traveling public. This argument is based upon the fact that they extend through the ranch alone, the main road terminating within its boundaries, and connect with no other public roads at their western and northern ends. These roads will, however, be open to the general public to such extent as it can and may use it. The people to the eastward in Santa Monica, Los Angeles and other cities will have access to them and to the people living on the ranch through the connecting road from Santa Monica. The people living on the ranch will have egress over them. The people living north of the terminus of the crossroad, who now have no adequate outlet will have access to it through private roads and ways and may then travel over these two roads to Los Angeles and other cities for marketing produce and other purposes; and the \n\n[262 U.S. 700, 707]\n\u00a0\n people in these cities will have reciprocal access to them for purposes of trade and otherwise. It is not essential that the entire community, nor even any considerable portion, should directly enjoy or participate in an improvement in order to constitute a public use. Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley, supra, \n164 U.S. 161\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 56. In like manner, if Ventura County should hereafter extend the main road to the western end of the ranch the people living beyond it, who now have no practical outlet, would be furnished a similar means of egress, with reciprocal ingress to them by the people living in the cities to the east. A highway can be legally laid out terminating at a state line even though there be no connecting highway in the adjoining State and no definite official action has been taken to establish such connection highway; otherwise great embarrassment and difficulty would be experienced in establishing highways across state lines. Rice v. Rindge, 53 N. H. 530, 531. So, as to county highway . Public road systems, it is manifest, must frequently be constructed in instalments, especially where adjoining counties are involved. In determining whether the taking of property is necessary for public use not only the present demands of the public, but those which may be fairly anticipated in the future, may be considered. Central Pacific Railway v. Feldman, 152 Cal. 303, 309, 92 Pac. 849.\n But aside from these considerations, these roads, especially the main road, through its connection with the public road coming along the shore from Santa Monica, will afford a highway for persons desiring to travel along the shore to the county line, with a view of the ocean on the one side, and of the mountain range on the other, constituting, as stated by the trial judge, a scenic highway of great beauty. Public uses are not limited, in the modern view, to matters of mere business necessity and ordinary convenience, but may extend to matters of public health, recreation and enjoyment. Thus, the condemnation \n\n[262 U.S. 700, 708]\n\u00a0\n of lands for public parks is now universally recognized as a taking for public use. Shoemaker v. United States, \n147 \nU.S. 282, 297\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 361. A road need not be for a purpose of business to create a public exigency; air, exercise and recreation are important to the general health and welfare; pleasure travel may be accommodated as well as business travel; and highways may be condemned to places of pleasing natural scenery. Higginson v. Nahant, 11 Allen (Mass.) 530, 536. The Riverside Drive in New York is as essentially a highway for public use as Broadway; the Speedway in this city, as Pennsylvania Avenue. And manifestly, in these days of general public travel in motor cars for health and recreation, such a highway as this, extending for more than twenty miles along the shores of the Pacific at the base of a range of mountains, must be regarded as a public use.\n For these reasons we conclude that these highways will, as found by the trial judge, afford accommodation to the traveling public, and that the taking of land for them is a taking for a public use authorized by the laws of California.\n The ranch owners were not prejudiced by the action of the trial court in striking out their special defenses in this behalf, since' under the general issues, they were entitled, as held by the District Court of Appeal, and were in fact permitted, to introduce all their evidence bearing upon this question.\n\n 2. \nPublic necessity for the taking. We necessarily accept, as a matter of state law, the holding of the District Court of Appeal that the proviso to section 1241 of the Code made the resolutions of the Board of Supervisors conclusive evidence as to the necessity of taking these particular highways and the other matters therein specified. So construed it was held by that court not to be objectionable to any provision of the State or Federal Constitutions. By this we are controlled so far as the provisions \n\n[262 U.S. 700, 709]\n\u00a0\n of the State Constitutions are concerned. Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley, supra, \n164 U.S. 155\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 56; Georgia Railway v. Town of Decatur, \n262 U.S. 432\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 613, 67 L. Ed. --, decided to-day. And so construed this statute is not in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, either because it fails to provide for a hearing by the landowners before such resolution is adopted, or otherwise. The necessity for appropriating private property for public use is not a judicial question. This power resides in the Legislature, and may either be exercised by the Legislature or delegated by it to public officers.\n'Where the intended use is public, the necessity and expediency of the taking may be determined by such agency and in such mode as the State may designate. They are legislative questions, no matter who may be charged with their decision, and a hearing thereon is not essential to due process in the sense of the Fourteenth Amendment.' Bragg v. Weaver, \n251 \nU.S. 57, 58\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 62.\n\n'That the n cessity and expediency of taking property for public use is a legislative and not a judicial question is not open to discussion. ... Neither is it any longer open to question in this court that the Legislature may confer upon a municipality the authority to determine such necessity for itself. ... The question is purely political, does not require a hearing, and is not the subject of judicial inquiry.' Joslin Mfg. Co. v. City of Providence, \n262 U.S. 668\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 684, 67 L. Ed. --, decided to-day.\n\n And, clearly, the fact that the resolutions are made conclusive evidence by the statute only when adopted by a two-thirds vote, and as applied to an improvement lying within the county, does not constitute an unjust or unreasonable classification.\n And since the resolutions were conclusive evidence as to the necessity for the taking of these public highways, the ranch owners were not prejudiced by the ruling of the trial judge which treated them as prima facie evidence merely and allowed them full opportunity to introduce their evidence upon the subject. A litigant can \n\n[262 U.S. 700, 710]\n\u00a0\n be heard to question the validity of a statute only when and in so far as it is applied to his disadvantage. Dahnke-Walker Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282, 289\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 106.\n We therefore conclude that the property of the ranch owners has been taken for highways constituting a public use authorized by law, and upon a public necessity for the taking duly established, and that they have not been deprived of their property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The judgments of the District Court of Appeal are accordingly\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] After these judgments of affirmance petitions to have the cases heard and determined by the Supreme Court of California were denied by that court. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] There has been much litigation between the ranch owners and the county and federal authorities as to the public use of roads and ways across this ranch, in which, prior to these proceedings, the ranch owners have been successful.

U S(1923)\nNo. 335\nArgued: March 16, 1923Decided: April 9, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles H. Merillat and Charles J. Kappler, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Blackburn Esterline, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On August 30, 1905, claimant's intestate entered into a contract with the United States to install the interior finish \n\n[261 U.S. 486, 487]\n\u00a0\n in the custom house building then being constructed in New York City pursuant to Act of March 2, 1899, c. 337, 30 Stat. 969. The contract price was $1,037,281.69, and the time for completion of the work, October 15, 1906. Before it had been completed, but after that date, a supplemental agreement was made, which provided for additional work, increased the contract price $200,041.01, and extended the time for completion to June 1, 1907. The work was not completed until 121 days after that date. The government insisted that only 12 days of this delay were chargeable to it, and that the contractor was liable in liquidated damages for $420 for each of the remaining 109 days' delay. It therefore deducted $45,780 from the amount otherwise payable to the contractor.\n To recover that sum (and others) the contractor brought this suit in the Court of Claims. He contended that, since the government had caused some of the delay, the provision for liquidated damages became wholly inapplicable and was unenforceable, and that, since the government had failed to prove actual damage, it was not entitled to any damages whatsoever. The court found that, of the 121 days of delay, only 61 days were chargeable to the contractor, and that the remainder were caused by the government, after the date of the supplemental contract. It accordingly gave the claimant judgment (among other things) for $20,160, being that part of the amount withheld which represented the delay in excess of 61 days, 57 Ct. Cl. 7. The case is here on claimant's appeal. Whether on these facts the provision for liquidated damages governs is the main question for decision.\n The original contract provided that the contractor 'shall be allowed one day, additional to the time herein stated, for each and every day of ... delay [that may be caused by the government],' 'that no claim shall be \n\n[261 U.S. 486, 488]\n\u00a0\n made or allowed to [the contractor] for any damages which may arise out of any delay caused by [the government],' and hat the contractor shall pay $ 120 for each and every day's delay not caused by the United States. The supplemental contract provided that the extension then granted was in lieu of all additional time which had accrued to that date 'on account of delays by the government.' The construction of the contract and the findings of fact are clear. If the provision for liquidated damages is not to govern, it must be either because, as matter of public policy, courts will not, under the circumstances, give it effect (even as a defense) or, because in spite of the explicit finding, no day's delay can, as matter of law, be chargeable to the contractor, where the government has caused some delay. Neither position is tenable.\n The provision is not against public policy. The law required that some provision for liquidated damages be inserted. Act of June 6, 1902, c. 1036,  21, 32 Stat. 310, 326 (Comp. St.  6922). In construction contracts a provision giving liquidated damages for each day's delay is an appropriate means of inducing due performance, or of giving compensation, in case of failure to perform, and courts give it effect in accordance with its terms. Sun Printing & Publishing Association v. Moore, \n183 \nU.S. 642, 673\n, 674 S., 22 Sup. Ct. 240; Wise v. United States, \n249 U.S. 361\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 303; J. E. Hathaway & Co. v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 460, 464\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 346. The fact that the government's action caused some of the delay presents no legal ground for denying it compensation for loss suffered wholly through the fault of the contractor. Since the contractor agreed to pay at a specified rate for each day's delay not caused by the government, it was clearly the intention that it should pay for some days' delay at that rate, even if it were relieved from paying for other days, because of the government's action. If it had appeared that the first 61 days' delay had been due wholly \n\n[261 U.S. 486, 489]\n\u00a0\n to the contractor's fault, and the government had caused the last 60 days' delay, there could hardly be a contention that the provision for liquidated damages should not apply. Here the fault of the respective parties was not so clearly distributed in time, and it may have been difficult to determine, as a matter of fact, how much of the delay was attributable to each. But the Court of Claims has done so in this case. Its findings are specific and conclusive. Compare United States v. Bethlehem Steel Co., \n205 \nU.S. 105, 121\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 450; Carnegie Steel Co. v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 156, 163\n, 164 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 342. The case is wholly unlike United States v. United Engineering Co., \n234 U.S. 236\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 843, upon which claimant relies. The question there was one of construction. The lower court found, as a fact that, but for the government's action, the work would have been completed within the contract period, and this court construed the provision for liquidated damages as not applicable to such a case. Here the question is not properly one of construction.\n It is also assigned as error that the court sustained a deduction by the government from the contract price of the amount paid by it for certain repairs. The contract contained a guarantee by the contractor of the condition of the work for one year after acceptance. The specifications provided for window sashes of solid oak. After the contract had been signed, and before putting in the windows, the contractor called the architect's attention to the fact that solid oak is not well suited for a damp climate and locality, like that of lower New York City, and he suggested a modification of the specifications to avoid warping. The suggestion was not accepted. By reason, in part, of warping which occurred within a year after acceptance of the work, extensive repairs became necessary. He was requested by the government to make the repairs, but refused to do so. Then the government had them made by others. The Court of Claims found that, \n\n[261 U.S. 486, 490]\n\u00a0\n owing partly to the fact that oak is not suitable to the climate and partly 'to the further facts that the materials of some of the sash were not of the best quality, nor thoroughly seasoned, and that the workmanship in their construction and installation was in some instances not of first- class character, there occurred ... much warping, ... which required extensive repairs of an expensive character.'\n The contractor contends that the government's refusal to adopt the modification proposed relieved him from the obligation under the guarantee. The contention is unsound. He entered into a contract plain and comprehensive in terms. There was no finding of mutual mistake, or of fraud, misrepresentation, or concealment on the part of the government or any of its officers or employees. Under such circumstances, the contractor cannot be relieved from an obligation deliberately assumed. Wells Brothers Co. v. United States, \n254 U.S. 83\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 34; MacArthur Bros. Co. v. United States, \n258 U.S. 6\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 225. If the warping had been caused entirely by the adoption of wood unsuitable to the climate, it may be that, as a matter of construction, the guaranty would not extend thereto. But the findings do not present such a case. The case is wholly unlike United States v. Spearin, \n248 U.S. 132\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 59; United States v. Atlantic Dredging Co., \n253 U.S. 1\n, 40 Sup.

FIDELITY TRUST CO(1923)\nNo. 285\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[261 U.S. 114, 115]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. V. Rooker, of Indianapolis, Ind., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Charles E. Cox, of Indianapolis, Ind., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n For present purposes this case may be shortly stated. A wife and husband, both financially embarrassed, transferred certain land in Indiana to a corporate trustee pursuant to an arrangement whereby the trustee was to advance moneys for their benefit, assist in procuring advances from others, protect the title, ultimately sell the land, use the proceeds in satisfying such mortgages or liens as might be superior to the rights of the trustee and in repaying moneys advanced by it and by others, and turn the residue over to the wife, her personal representatives or assigns. The purpose of the transfer and the engagements of the parties were set forth in two deeds and a trust agreement, all executed the same day. Differences afterwards arose between the parties, and the grantors brought a suit in a state court in Indiana against the trustee charging that it had violated and repudiated the trust, demanding damages and an accounting, and praying that the trustee be removed and a receiver appointed to administer the trust. The trustee answered taking issue with portions of the complaint, and in an amended cross-complaint set up what it claimed had been done under the trust agreement, alleged in substance that the trustee was not in default, but stood ready to carry out the trust and was being hindered and obstructed by the plaintiffs, and prayed that the title of the trustee, as such, be \n\n[261 U.S. 114, 116]\n\u00a0\n quieted, that further hindrance and obstruction by the plaintiffs be enjoined, that an accounting be had, and that the trustee then be directed to make a sale under the trust agreement and to distribute the proceeds according to its provisions. The plaintiffs traversed portions of the amended cross-complaint. Thereafter a trial of the issues was had, and the court made a special finding of facts favorable to the trustee and entered judgment thereon substantially as prayed in the amended cross-complaint. The Supreme Court of the state affirmed the judgment (131 N. E. 769), and at the solicitation of the plaintiffs the Chief Justice of that court allowed the present writ of error.\n The trustee challenges our jurisdiction on the ground that the case is not one the judgment in which may be reviewed by us on writ of error. The challenge is well taken unless the case comes within that part of section 237 of the Judicial Code, as amended September 6, 1916, c. 448,  2, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St.  1214), which provides:\n'A final judgment or decree in any suit in the highest court of a state in which a decision in the suit could be had, where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under the Unite States, and the decision is against their validity; or where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of their validity, may be reexamined and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court upon a writ of error.'\n\n It is conceded that there was no effort to question the validity of any treaty or law of, or authority exercised under, the United States. But the plaintiffs insist that the validity of a statute of Indiana relating to conclusions stated in pleadings and the mode of securing better statements (chapter 322, Acts 1913; chapter 62, Acts 1915) was drawn in \n\n[261 U.S. 114, 117]\n\u00a0\n question by them on the ground of the statute's repugnance to various provisions of the Constitution of the United States and that the court upheld and applied the statute. Of course, in determining whether that question was raised and decided we must be guided by the record. Butler v. Gage, \n138 \nU.S. 52, 56\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 235; Zadig v. Baldwin, \n166 \nU.S. 485, 488\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 639. It has been examined and we find it does not show that the question was raised in any way prior to the judgment of affirmance in the Supreme Court. In their assignments of error on the appeal to that court the plaintiffs said nothing about the statute or its validity; nor was there any reference to either in the court's opinion. All that appears is that after the judgment of affirmance the plaintiffs sought to raise the question by a petition for rehearing, which was denied without opinion. But that effort came too late. Bushnell v. Crooke Mining & Smelting Co., \n148 \nU.S. 682, 689\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 771; Godchaux Co. v. Estopinal, \n251 U.S. 179\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 116; Citizens' National Bank v. Durr, \n257 \nU.S. 99, 106\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 15. Federal questions, like others, should be presented in an orderly way before judgment. Dewey v. Des Moines, \n173 \nU.S. 193, 200\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 379. And see John v. Paullin, \n231 \nU.S. 583, 585\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 178; Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Mims, \n242 \nU.S. 532, 535\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 188. It is at least doubtful that the question is one of any substance, but its tardy presentation renders further notice of it unnecessary.\n The case had been before the Supreme Court of the state on a prior appeal, and the court had then construed the trust agreement and dealt in a general way with the rights of the parties under it. Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 185 Ind. 172, 109 N. E. 766. Referring to this, the plaintiffs, by way of asserting another ground for the writ of error, claim that on the second appeal the court took and applied a view of the trust agreement different from that taken and announced on the first appeal, and that this change in decision impaired the obligation of the agreement contrary to the contract clause of the Constitution \n\n[261 U.S. 114, 118]\n\u00a0\n of the United States and was a violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Plainly this claim does not bring the case within the writ of error provision. Both decisions were in the same case. The first was interlocutory (185 Ind. 187-188, 109 N. E. 766); the second, final. Concededly the case was properly before the court on the second appeal; the plaintiffs evidently thought so, for they took it there. Whether the second decision followed or departed from the first, it was a judicial act, not legislative. The contract clause of the Constitution, as its words show, is directed against impairment by legislative action, not against a change in judicial decision. It has no bearing on the authority of an appellate court, when a case is brought before it a second time, to determine that effect to be given to the decision made when the case was first there. Cross Lake Club v. Louisiana, \n224 \nU.S. 632, 638\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 577; Ross v. Oregon, \n227 \nU.S. 150, 161\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 220, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 224; Seattle, Renton & Southern Ry. Co. v.

Assuming that the objection to a change in decision was seasonably presented, it amounted to nothing more than saying that in the plaintiffs' opinion the court should follow the first decision. It did not draw in question the validity of an authority exercised under a state in the sense of the writ of error provision. Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co. v.

FIDELITY TRUST CO.(1923)\nNo. 295\nArgued: Decided: December 10, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 413, 414]\n\u00a0\n Wm. V. Rooker, of Indianapolis, Ind., for appellants, in opposition to the motion.\n Charles E. Cox, of Indianapolis, Ind., for appellees, in support of the motion.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity to have a judgment of a circuit court in Indiana, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state, declared null and void, and to obtain other relief dependent on that outcome. An effort to have the judgment reviewed by this court on writ of error had failed because the record did not disclose the presence of any question constituting a basis for such a review. Rooker v Fidelity Trust Co., \n261 U.S. 114\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 288. The parties to the bill are the same as in the litigation in the state court, but with an addition of two defendants whose presence does not need special notice. All are citizens of the same state. The grounds advanced for resorting to the District Court are that the judgment \n\n[263 U.S. 413, 415]\n\u00a0\n was rendered and affirmed in contravention of the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States (article 1,  10, cl. 1) and the due process of law and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment ( section 1), in that it gave effect to a state statute alleged to be in conflict with those clauses and did not give effect to a prior decision in the same cause by the Supreme Court of the State which is alleged to have become the 'law of the case.' The District Court was of opinion that the suit was not within its jurisdiction as defined by Congress, and on that ground dismissed the bill. The plaintiffs have appealed directly to this court under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215).\n The appellees move that the appeal be dismissed, or in the alternative that the decree be affirmed.\n The appeal is within the first clause of section 238; so the motion to dismiss must be overruled. But the suit is so plainly not within the District Court's juridiction as defined by Congress that the motion to affirm must be sustained.\n It affirmatively appears from the bill that the judgment was rendered in a cause wherein the circuit court had jurisdiction of both the subject- matter and the parties, that a full hearing was had therein, that the judgment was responsive to the issues, and that it was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state on an appeal by the plaintiffs. 131 N. E. 769. If the constitutional questions stated in the bill actually arose in the cause, it was the province and duty of the state courts to decide them; and their decision, whether right or wrong, was an exercise of jurisdiction. If the decision was wrong, that did not make the judgment void, but merely left it open to reversal or modification in an appropriate and timely appellate proceeding. Unless and until so reversed or modified, it would be an effective and conclusive adjudication. Elliott v. Peirsol, 1 Pet. 328, 340; Thompson v. Tolmie, 2 Pet. 157, 169; Voorhees v. Bank \n\n[263 U.S. 413, 416]\n\u00a0\n of United States, 10 Pet. 449, 474; Cornett v. Williams, 20 Wall. 226, 249; Ex parte Harding, \n120 U.S. 782\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 780. Under the legislation of Congress, no court of the United States other than this court could entertain a proceeding to reverse or modify the judgment for errors of that character. Judicial Code,  237, as amended by Act Sept. 6, 1916, c. 448,  2, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St.  1214). To do so would be an exercise of appellate jurisdiction. The jurisdiction possessed by the District Courts is strictly original. Judicial Code,  24 ( Comp. St.  991). Besides, the period within which a proceeding might be begun for the correction of errors such as are charged in the bill had expired before it was filed, Act Sept. 6, 1916, c. 448,  6, 39 Stat. 726 ( Comp. St.  1228a), and, as is pointed out in Voorhees v. Bank of United States, supra, after that period elapses an aggrieved litigant cannot be permitted to do indirectly what he no longer can do directly.\n Some parts of the bill speak of the judgment as given without jurisdiction and absolutely void; but this is merely mistaken characterization. A reading of the entire bill shows indubitably that there was full jurisdiction in the state courts and that the bill at best is merely an attempt to get rid of the judgment for alleged errors of law committed in the exercise of that jurisdiction.\n In what has been said we have proceeded on the assumption that the constitutional questions alleged to have arisen in the state courts respecting the validity of a state statute (Acts 1915, c. 62), and the effect to be given to a prior decision in the same cause by the Supreme Court of the state (185 Ind. 172, 109 N. E. 766), were questions of substance, but we do not hold that they were such-the assumption being indulged merely for the purpose of testing the nature of the bill and the power of the District Court to entertain it.\n A further matter calls for brief notice. The bill charges that the judgment of affirmance by the Supreme Court \n\n[263 U.S. 413, 417]\n\u00a0\n of the state is void because one of the judges participating therein had an interest in the case which worked his disqualification. The case related to the duties and obligations of a corporation holding property under a conventional trust. The facts set forth to show the disqualification are as follows: Three or four years theretofore a citizen of the state had executed a will wherein he designated the judge as one of the executors and trustees under the will. The testator died about the time the case was submitted to the court, and the will was admitted to probate a day or two before or after the judgment of affirmance. The judge became an executor and trustee under the designation in the will. When the will was executed, and up to the time of his death, the testator owned many shares of stock in corporations holding property under trusts like that in question. The stock was to pass, and did pass, to the executors and trustees for administration and disposal under the will. The judge's relation or prospective relation to that estate and to the stocks belonging to it is the sole basis of the charge that he had a disqualifying interest in the case. We think the facts set forth and relied upon neither support nor tend to support the charge; and we experience difficulty in reconciling its presence in the bill with the care and good faith which should attend the preparation of such a pleading. Certainly the charge does not change the nature of the bill or require that it be given any effect which it otherwise would not have.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","163":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROSENBERG BROS. & CO. v.

Corn, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Rosenberg Bros. & Co., Inc., a New York corporation, brought this suit in the Supreme Court of that state against Curtis Brown Company, an Oklahoma corporation. The only service of process made was by delivery of a summons to defendant's president while he was temporarily in New York. Defendant appeared specially; moved to quash the summons on the ground that the corporation was not found within the state, and, after evidence was taken but before hearing on the motion, removed the case to the federal court for the Western District of New York. There the motion to quash was granted, upon the ground that the defendant was not amenable to the process of the state court at the time of the service of the summons. A writ of error was sued out under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), and the question of jurisdiction was duly certified. The order entered below, although in form an order to quash the summons, and not a dismissal of the suit, is a final judgment, and the case is properly here. Goldey v. Morning News, \n156 U.S. 518\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 559; Conley v. Mathieson Alkali Works, \n190 U.S. 406\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 728. Compare The Pesaro, \n255 \nU.S. 216, 217\n, 41 S. Sup.

Philadelphia & Reading Ry. Co. v. McKibbin, \n243 \nU.S. 264, 265\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 280. The District Court found that it was not. That decision was clearly correct. The Curtis Brown \n\n[260 U.S. 516, 518]\n\u00a0\n Company is a small retail dealer in men's clothing and furnishings at Tulsa, Okl. It never applied, under the foreign corporation laws, for a license to do business in New York; nor did it at any time authorize suit to be brought against it there. It never had an established place of business in New York; nor did it, without having such established place, regularly carry on business there. It had no property in New York, and had no officer, agent, or stockholder resident there. Its only connection with New York appears to have been the purchase there from time to time of a large part of the merchandise to be sold at its store in Tulsa. The purchases were made, sometimes by correspondence, sometimes, through visits to New York of one of its officers. Whether, at the time its president was served with process, he was in New York on business or for pleasure, whether he was then authorized to transact any business there, and to what extent he did transact business while there, are questions on which much evidence was introduced, and some of it is conflicting.\n But the issues so raised are not of legal significance. The only business alleged to have been transacted by the company in New York, either then or theretofore, related to such purchases of goods by officers of a foreign corporation. Visits on such business, even if occurring at regular intervals, would not warrant the inference that the corporation was present within the jurisdiction of the state.

Wheat, of New York City., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases, here on appeal from the Court of Claims, differ in details of fact, but are controlled by the same principles of law, and depend alike upon the construction and application of the same statutory provisions.\n The salient facts in the case of the Motor Car Company are as follows: That company, on May 14, 1918, entered into a contract, numbered 1498, with the United States, acting through the Secretary of the Navy, to make 250 anti-air craft gun mounts, at an agreed price of $7,860 each, to be delivered at stipulated periods; the last being the 60 days ending April 30, 1919\n\n\n Prior to the making of the foregoing contract, viz. in November, 1917, a similar contract, numbered 949, had been entered into by the same parties; the last period for delivery being the 60 days ending January 15, 1919. The actual work under contract 949 was begun about March, 1918, and some time later, and after the making of contract 1498, at the request of the company, the Secretary consented to allow all shipments of mounts to be applied upon contract 949 until its completion. Deliveries under that contract were finished in June, 1919.\n On November 18, 1918, the Navy Department expressed a desire that the manufacture of gun mounts under both contracts be greatly decreased and that the company resume production of peace-time products as soon as possible, 'so that the minimum of economic disturbance \n\n[261 U.S. 514, 517]\n\u00a0\n will be felt during the transition.' In its communication the Navy Department requested that immediate arrangements be made for the reduction and eventual stoppage of production of materials under these contracts and the substitution therefor of commercial products, and that the company 'initiate preparations for the cancellation along the lines indicated.' On November 23, 1918, the company was notified that the Secretary had authorized the cancellation of contract 1498, directed to cease work in connection therewith not later than December 2, 1918, and informed that a just and fair settlement would be made as provided by contract and in accordance with the statute covering such cases. Extended negotiations followed, in an effort to bring about a settlement, and the Secretary finally fixed the sum of $444,847.68 as just compensation for the cancellation of the contract. Seventy-five per cent. of this amount was paid and accepted by the company, expressly without prejudice to its rights.\n The Court of Claims, after hearing the case, found that just compensation for the cancellation of the contract was the sum of $495,250. 34, which amount included a number of elements and items not necessary to be set forth. The court further found that, if the company had been permitted t complete the contract according to its terms, it could and would have earned a profit, in round figures, of $960,000, but held that the action of the Secretary of the Navy in canceling the contract was within the authority conferred by the statute, presently to be mentioned, and that the company consequently was not entitled to an award including anticipated profits.\n The statute upon which this determination rested was the Act of June 15, 1917 (40 Stat. p. 182, c. 29), making deficiency appropriations for the military and naval establishment on account of war expenses, and for other purposes. This act contained a provision authorizing and \n\n[261 U.S. 514, 518]\n\u00a0\n empowering the President, within the limits of the amounts appropriated:\n'... (b) To modify, suspend, cancel, or requisition any existing or future contract for the building, production, or purchase of ships or material.' Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/16 d.\n\n The President was authorized to exercise the authority conferred upon him by the act and expend the money therein and thereafter appropriated 'through such agency or agencies as he shall determine from time to time.' The authority so far as it concerned the Navy, was by him delegated to the Secretary of the Navy in an order dated August 21, 1917,\n'in so far as applicable to and in furtherance of the construction of vessels for the use of the Navy and of contracts for the construction of such vessels, and the completion thereof, and all powers and authority applicable to and in furtherance of the production, purchase and requisitioning of materials for construction of vessels for the Navy and for war materials, equipment, and munitions required for the use of the Navy, and the more economical and expeditious delivery thereof.'\n\n The word 'material,' the act provided, should include stores, supplies and equipment for ships and everything required for or in connection with the production thereof, and in our opinion included the articles contracted for in this as well as in the other two cases. The act provided that whenever the United States should cancel, modify, suspend, or requisition any contract just compensation should be made therefor to be determined by the President. If the amount so determined should be unsatisfactory, the person entitled to receive it could accept 75 per cent. thereof and bring suit to recover such further sum as added to the 75 per cent. would make just compensation. By the terms of the act the authority granted to the President or delegated by him was to 'cease six months after the final treaty of peace is proclaimed between this government and the German Empire.' \n\n[261 U.S. 514, 519]\n\u00a0\n The Motor Car Company contends that subdivision (b) of the statute above quoted applies to private contracts alone and affords no authority for the cancellation by the government of its own contracts. The Court of Claims held otherwise and whether its holding or the company's contention is correct presents the principal question for our consideration.\n It must be apparent, we think, that the words of the provision, 'any existing or future contract,' read with literal exactness, include all contracts, whether private or governmental. But it is pointed out that the power to 'requisition' cannot apply to a governmental contract; and this may be conceded, since the government cannot requisition what it already has. Then it is said that inasmuch as the application of the word 'requisition' must be confined to private contracts, the other words associated with it must be likewise restricted by virtue of the maxim 'noscitur a sociis.' That a word may be known by the company it keeps is, however, not an invariable rule, for the word may have a character of its own not to be submerged by its association. Rules of statutory construction are to be invoked as aids to the ascertainment of the meaning or application of words otherwise obscure or doubtful. They have no place, as this court has many times held, except in the domain of ambiguity. Hamilton v. Rathbone, \n175 \nU.S. 414, 421\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 155; United States v. Barnes, \n222 U.S. 513\n, 518-519, 32 Sup. Ct. 117. They may not be used to create but only to remove doubt. Id. Moreover, in cases of ambiguity the rule here relied upon is not exclusive. The problem may be submitted to all appropriate and reasonable tests, of which 'noscitur a sociis' is one. Here we have one word which it may be conceded applies only to private contracts, but the other three words, standing alone, it likewise must be conceded, naturally apply to governmental contracts as well. Indeed, they more naturally apply to such contracts. The \n\n[261 U.S. 514, 520]\n\u00a0\n power to modify the obligations of a private contract is, to say the least, a most unusual one for governmental exercise. To modify a contract is in effect to make a new one, and it puts something of a strain on our conception of the functions of government to concede its power to make contracts between private parties, to which neither may assent, and which, consequently, neither will be bound to perform.\n We do not mean to deny the power of Congress, in time of war, to authorize the President to modify private contracts (leaving the parties free, as between themselves, to accept or not), nor do we suggest that Congress has not done so by the present statute; but the contention here is, not that the power in question extends to private contracts, but that it is limited to them. This cannot be conceded. The meaning of the four predicate words is not doubtful; in that respect, as well as in their operative scope, they obviously differ from one another. The question we are called upon to answer is whether, because the words 'any ... contract' must be given a narrower meaning when qualified by the predicate 'requisition,' their meaning must be limited in like manner when qualified by one of the other three predicates. 'Noscitur a sociis' is a well- established and useful rule of construction, where words are of obscure or doubtful meaning, and then, but only then, its aid may be sought to remove the obscurity or doubt by reference to the associated words. Virginia v. Tennessee, \n148 \nU.S. 503, 519\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 728; Benson v. Chicago, etc., R. R. Co., 75 Minn. 163, 77 N. W. 798, 74 Am. St. Rep. 444. But here the meaning of the words considered severally is not in doubt, and the rule is invoked not to remove an obscurity, but to import one. There is nothing in the rule or in the statute which requires us to assimilate the words 'modify' and 'cancel' to the scope of the word 'requisition,' simply because the latter has a necessarily narrower application. The \n\n[261 U.S. 514, 521]\n\u00a0\n meaning of the several words, standing apart, being perfectly plain, what should be done is to apply them distributively, diverso intuitu, giving to each its natural value and appropriate scope when read in connection with the object (any contract) which they are severally meant to control. Thus, the predicate 'requisition' will be limited to private contracts, while the other words may be appropriately extended to include governmental contracts as well. An illustration is afforded by the commerce clause of the Constitution. The power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce is found in the same clause and conferred by the same words, but the scope of the power when applied to the former may be narrower than when applied to the latter. Groves v. Slaughter, 15 Pet. 449, 505.\n This disposition of the question also accords with the broad purposes of the legislation. When the act was passed we were in the midst of a great war, which called for the utilization of all our resources. The necessities were great, beyond the power of statement. The government was confronted with the vital necessity, not only of producing ships and supplies in unprecedented quantities, but of producing them with the utmost haste. Hence it was necessary that everything which stood in the way of or hindered such production should be put aside. But this was a necessity which Congress, of course, realized must sooner or later come to an end, suddenly and completely. With the termination of the war the continued production of war supplies would become, not only unnecessary, but wasteful. Not to provide, therefore, for the cessation of this production, when the need for it had passed, would have been a distinct neglect of the public interest. The situation, it is plain, required that production should proceed while the war lasted to the utmost limit of the nation's power, but that it should come to an end as soon as possible upon the passing of the emergency. \n\n[261 U.S. 514, 522]\n\u00a0\n In the light of these circumstances, it is not unreasonable to regard the statute now under consideration as intended to accomplish both results, that is: (1) To enable the President, during the emergency, to utilize his powers over contracts to stimulate production to the utmost; and then, (2) upon the passing of the emergency, to enable him to utilize these same powers to stop that production as quickly as possible. To the latter accomplishment authority to modify and cancel government war contracts would contribute most effectively. These considerations lend support to the judgment of the court below construing the statute as having this effect.\n In this connection it is not without significance that the authority granted to the President was to cease six months after the final treaty of peace. Obviously, the powers granted to him-among them to modify and cancel contracts-were to continue during the six months' period, not for the purpose of forwarding war production, but, on the contrary, for the purpose of stopping it. To that end, we conclude, he was authorized to cancel the government's own contracts, such as the one here involved, upon making just compensation to the parties concerned.\n We are referred to the utterances of certain members of Congress in debate, which it is argued show that the provision under consideration was meant to cover private contracts. Whether they come within the rule forbidding resort to legislative debates (Lapina v. Williams, \n232 \nU.S. 78, 90\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 196; Omaha Street Railway v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n230 \nU.S. 324, 333\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 890, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 385; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1, 50\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 502, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 834, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 734; United States v. Freight Association, \n166 \nU.S. 290, 318\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 540), or within the exception (Wisconsin R. R. Comm. v. C., B. & Q. R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563, 588\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 232, 22 A. L. R. 1086), we need not consider, since, for reasons already stated, extrinsic aid for ascertaining the meaning of the language here under review is not required. Besides, though they \n\n[261 U.S. 514, 523]\n\u00a0\n may tend to show that the statute was meant to apply to private contracts, these utterances do not justify the conclusion that the statute was not meant to apply to governmental contracts also.\n Certain other contentions of the Car Company may be briefly disposed of. In the first place, it is said that the President did not delegate his power respecting contracts to the Secretary of the Navy, and it is suggested that that officer did not in fact pretend to cancel this contract under the statute. The order of the President delegating his authority to the Secretary is in sweeping terms and it is impossible to conclude otherwise than that it was intended to cover the whole field of power in so far as it pertained to the Navy. Executive power, in the main, must of necessity be exercised by the President through the various departments. These departments constitute his peculiar and intimate agencies and in devolving authority upon them meticulous precision of language is neither expected nor required. In canceling the contract it was not necessary that the statute should be expressly referred to. It was public law of which every one was bound to take notice.\n It is contended, further, tha even if the action of the Secretary of the Navy was warranted by the statute, the Car Company was nevertheless entitled to have included as just compensation its anticipated profits.\n This contention confuses the measure of damages for breach of contract with the rule of just compensation for the lawful taking of property by the power of eminent domain. In fixing just compensation, the court must consider the value of the contract at the time of its cancellation, not what it would have produced by way of profits for the Car Company, if it had been fully performed. It is evident that no prudent person, desiring to acquire this contract, would have paid for it the full amount which could be realized upon completion, leaving no chance of \n\n[261 U.S. 514, 524]\n\u00a0\n return to himself upon the investment, or for the risk and labor incident to its performance. The contract, we must assume, was entered into with the prospect of its cancellation in view, since the statute was binding and must be read into the contract. The possible loss of profits, therefore, must be regarded as within the contemplation of the parties. The lower court was right in refusing to allow anticipated profits, and, there being nothing in the findings to justify the contrary, we must accept the amount fixed on the basis of just compensation as adequate.\n Our attention is directed to the fact that prior to the cancellation of contract No. 1498, the Car Company had manufactured 25 mounts, which it would have delivered under that contract, except for the fact that they were made applicable to the former contract, No. 949, and it is insisted that the profit which the Car Company would have made upon these mounts should have been included in the amount of its compensation in any event. It is sufficient to say that the Car Company was permitted to deliver these mounts under its former contract at its own request. Presumably the full contract price therefor was paid in the adjustment of that contract.\n It is unnecessary to burden this opinion with a statement of the facts in the Freygang and Anderson Manufacturing Company Cases. They are not differentiated in any essential respect from the case of the Motor Car Company, and are governed by the same reasons and conclusions.\n The judgments of the Court of Claims are severally\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","165":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSALINGER v.

RICHARDSON(1923)\nNo. 81\nArgued: Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 88, 89]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. I. Brobeck, of San Francisco, Cal., and Herbert W. Clark, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. U. S. Webb, of San Francisco, Cal., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case presents the validity of state taxation on the franchise of the Oceanic Steamship Company, a corporation of the state of California.\n There is no dispute of facts. The case turns entirely upon the law applicable to them. The company was organized to engage under California laws in the transportation of freight and passengers between San Francisco and the Hawaiian Islands and certain foreign countries and did no intrastate business except the purchase of its fuel and supplies used in its transportation business.\n The company made a written report to the state board of equalization as required by the law of the state. The report contained a concise statement and description of every franchise enjoyed by the company, and other matters required of the company by the law.\n The board in pursuance of the law and the Constitution of the state determined the value of the franchise granted by the state to be $120,000 and assessed and levied a tax \n\n[263 U.S. 88, 90]\n\u00a0\n thereon of 1 per cent. which amounted to the sum of $1,200. It is contended that the assessment and levy were and are void under section 1 of Amendment 14 of the Constitution of the United States, because thereby the board assessed and taxed the company on property the situs of which was for more than a year prior to the assessment, and is, without the state of California and beyond the jurisdiction of the state for the purpose of taxation, and attempts to regulate and burden interstate and foreign commerce.\n The specification of the means is expressed in the complaint in addition to the situation of the company's property as follows: The company engaged in business outside of the state. In assessing the franchise of the company the board of equalization did so in pursuance of a fixed rule and general system which necessarily was discriminatory and inequitable. The board ascertained the actual or market value of the capital stock of the company, which was constituted of all the value of its property outside of the state, and from such sum deducted the value of the tangible property of the company in and out of California, and the sum thus ascertained was held by the board to be the value of the franchise of the company. The board then ascertained the percentage and proportion of the total business of the company transacted in California during the year 1913, and determined the same percentage and proportion of the total franchise value to be the value of the franchise assessable and taxable in California, and the board thereupon took 15 per cent. of that sum which amounted to $120,000, and on that sum levied a tax at the rate of 1 per cent. amounting to $1,200. And it is alleged that the market value of the shares of capital stock of the company was at all times materially increased by reason of, and in a great part due to, the ownership and use by the company of the property outside of the state. \n\n[263 U.S. 88, 91]\n\u00a0\n The company paid the tax under protest. It subsequently assigned its claim to Edwin Schwab, plaintiff in error, who brought this action in the superior court of San Francisco against the state, basing the ground of action upon the illegality of the tax.\n The answer of the treasurer to the complaint admitted the assessment of the franchise, but denied that the method pursued by the board of equalization in the assessment produced a result which was unnecessarily or at all discriminatory, or necessarily or at all inequitable;\n Denied that the assessment was or is void under any law or for any reason whatsoever, or that the board assessed or taxed the company on any property the situs of which was or is without the state or beyond the jurisdiction of the state for the purpose of assessment;\n Alleged that the value of the franchise was the sum fixed by the board.\n Judgment was moved on the pleadings, and plaintiff in error elected to stand on the motion without introducing evidence. The motion was denied and judgment rendered against him. It was affirmed by the Supreme Court. 188 Cal. 27, 204 Pac. 396.\n Three contentions are made against the assessment and levy: (1) They deprive the company of its property without due process of law. (2) They are an attempt to regulate interstate and foreign commerce. (3) They are burdens upon interstate commerce.\n The argument is that they have such effect because they are 'based on the value of property outside of California and on interstate and foreign commerce engaged in, so that the amount of' them 'grows in proportion to the growth of such property and commerce.'\n The basis of the contention is not a new one in this court. It is not always easy to answer and has involved difference of opinion. Any property of a corporation engaged in interstate commerce may be said to take on \n\n[263 U.S. 88, 92]\n\u00a0\n value from such commerce and a tax on the property be increased as the commerce increases. The cases, however, have been careful to distinguish when such effect produces illegality and when it does not.\n They have been careful to declare the immunity of interstate commerce from state taxation, but as careful to declare the power of a state to tax values within its borders though they may get enhancement from the exercise of rights outside of those borders. How intimate and direct such rights must be cannot be pronounced in formula. A state may not burden or interfere with interstate commerce or tax property outside of its borders, yet, on the other hand, it has a definite sphere of government which must not be curtailed. Certainly it is not restricted to property taxation, nor to any particular form of excises.\n The exertion of the power of a state in taxation has been considered in many cases. A review of them we do not think is necessary. Their pertinence and value are not insistent. The present case is more single. Its instance-the taxation exercised-is upon intangible property. The power of a state over that has been declared many times and has many illustrations. The case is, therefore, free from the perplexity of a consideration of situs which may beset tangible property. Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 U.S. 194\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 36, 4 Ann. Cas. 493. It is strictly a franchise tax laid on the company because it derives its existence-its right to be-from the state.\n This is the field within which this case lies and we are not concerned with those which reach beyond that field. To this we confine ourselves. The state has taxed the right which it granted, and which it was competent to tax. Horn Silver Mining Co. v. New York, \n143 U.S. 305\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 403; Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, \n155 U.S. 688\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 268; Kansas City, etc., Ry. Co. v. Botkin, Sec'y, \n240 U.S. 227\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 261; Cream of Wheat Co. v. Grand Forks, \n253 U.S. 325\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 558. And \n\n[263 U.S. 88, 93]\n\u00a0\n it has been recognized that its-the franchise's-value may be constituted of its employment in interstate commerce, and have measurement in the property which is its instrumentality. Kansas City, etc., Ry. Co. v. Botkin, sec'y, supra; St. Louis-San Francisco Railway v. Middlekamp, \n256 U.S. 226\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 489.\n Plaintiff in error resists these cases yet concedes the power of the state to tax the franchise-a 'right of its own creation'-and concedes that neither the constitutional provisions or the statute under which the tax was levied 'are on their face obnoxious to the commerce or due process clause of the federal Constitution.' That effect is worked, it is the contention, emphasized by repetition, because the tax is based in whole or in substantial part on the value of the property outside of California, or on interstate or foreign commerce engaged in, so that the amount of it grows in proportion to the growth of such property or commerce.\n The contention and its basis are in antagonism to the cases cited and their authority. A repetition of their reasoning is unnecessary. They establish that the method pursued by the board was not illegally oppressive to interstate commerce or beyond the jurisdictional power of the state. We agree with the Supreme Court that it was admitted by the motion for judgment on the pleadings without introducing evidence that the tax was not excessive and that if the state had jurisdiction the imposition of the tax was a proper exercise of it.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","167":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSEABOARD AIR LINE R.

C., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for the United States.[ Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. U S \n261 U.S. 299\n (1923) ]\n\n\n[261 U.S. 299, 302]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiff in error, the Seaboard Air Line Railway Company, was the owner of 2.6 acres of land at Charleston, South Carolina, adjoining he Charleston Port Terminal, subject to a mortgage to the Guaranty Trust Company and William C. Cox. \n1\n On May 23, 1919, the United States, under authority of section 10 of the Lever Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 ii),2 requisitioned and took possession of such land to provide storage facilities for supplies necessary to the support of the army and other uses connected with the public defense.\n The President, through the War Department Board of Appraisers, determined the compensation to be the sum \n\n[261 U.S. 299, 303]\n\u00a0\n of $235.80, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum from the date of the taking to the date of voucher for final payment. The amount was not satisfactory to the owner, and the United States was so notified. Demand was made for 75 per cent. of the award, but no part of the amount was paid. The owner sued to recover such further sum as, when added to such 75 per cent., would amount to just compensation for the property so taken.\n The jury returned a verdict as follows:\n'We find that the fair and reasonable value which would constitute a just compensation to be paid for the taking for public purposes on May 23, 1919, of the lands mentioned and described in the petition, under the issue herein, to be six thousand dollars.'\n\n Judgment was entered for $6,000, with interest from May 23, 1919, at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum (the statutory rate in South Carolina).\n The United States objected to the interest allowed, and took the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and that court reversed the judgment of the District Court and awarded a new trial, unless the owner file a remittitur abating all interest. The owner refused and brought the case here on writ of error.\n Did the District Court err in allowing interest on the amount of the verdict? \n\n[261 U.S. 299, 304]\n\u00a0\n The rule is that, in the absence of a stipulation to pay interest or a statute allowing it, none can be recovered against the United States upon unpaid accounts or claims. United States v. Rogers et al., \n255 \nU.S. 163, 169\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 281; United States v. North American Transportation & Trading Co., \n253 U.S. 330\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 518; United States v.

Ct. 465.\n Section 10 of the Lever Act authorizes the taking of property for the public use on payment of just compensation. There is no provision in respect of interest. Just compensation is provided for by the Constitution and the right to it cannot be taken away by statute. Its ascertainment is a judicial function. Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312, 327\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 622.\n The compensation to which the owner is entitled is the full and perfect equivalent of the property taken. Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312, 327\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 622. It rests on equitable principles and it means substantially that the owner shall be put in as good position pecuniarily as he would have been if his property had not been taken. United States v. Rogers et al. (C. C. A. Eighth Circuit) 257 Fed. 397, 400, 168 C. C. A. 437. He is entitled to the damages inflicted by the taking. Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. North American Telegraph Co. (C. C. A. Eighth Circuit) 230 Fed. 347, 352, 144 C. C. A. 489, L. R. A. 1916E, 572, and cases there cited.\n The United States in effect claims that the owner is entitled to no more than the value of the land, as of date of taking, to be paid at a later time, when ascertained. The owner has been deprived of the land and its use since the taking, May 23, 1919. The value of the property, as ascertained by the President, was $235.80, and this was allowed with interest from date of taking. But, as judicially determined later, the value when taken was $6,000.\n The owner's right does not depend on contract, express or implied. A promise to pay is not necessary. None is \n\n[261 U.S. 299, 305]\n\u00a0\n alleged. This suit is a part of the authorized procedure initiated by the United States for the condemnation of the land. The owner was not satisfied with the amount fixed by the President and sued. A necessary condition of the taking is the ascertainment and payment of just compensation. Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312, 337\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 622; Searl v. School District, Lake County, \n133 \nU.S. 553, 562\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 374; United States v. Jones, \n109 U.S. 513\n, 518, et seq., 3 Sup. Ct. 346; United States v. Sargent, 162 Fed. 81, 83, 89 C. C. A. 81. It is not suggested in this case that the provisions of section 10 of the Lever Act do not meet the constitutional requirement. The only question here is whether payment at a subsequent date of the value of the land as of the date of taking possession is sufficient to constitute just compensation.\n In support of its contention the government cites United States v. North American Transportation & Trading Co., \n253 U.S. 330\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 518. That case does not sustain its contention. That was a suit in the Court of Claims based on an implied promise of the United States to pay for property appropriated by it. It was not a condemnation case. The distinction between that case and a condemnation case is pointed out in the opinion. It was there suggested, without so deciding, that in the case of condemnation of land, interest might be collected, even in the absence of state enactments allowing it adopted by the conformity provisions.\n The case of United States v. Rogers et al., \n255 U.S. 163\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 281, is a condemnation case, and it was held that the owner was entitled as a part of the just compensation to interest on the confirmed award of the commissioners from the time when the United States took possession. The land was situated in New Mexico, and the proceedings were had under the Conformity Act of August 1, 1888. Chapter 728, 25 Stat. 357 (Comp. St.  6909, 6910). Interest was allowed, not by virtue of state statute, but as constituting a part of the just compensation safeguarded by the Constitution. Speaking for the- \n\n[261 U.S. 299, 306]\n\u00a0\n court, Mr. Justice Day said:\n'Having taken the lands of the defendants in error, it was the duty of the government to make just compensation as of the time when the owners were deprived of their property'-citing Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, \n148 U.S. 341\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 622.\n\n It is obvious that the owner's right to just compensation cannot be made to depend upon state statutory provisions. The Constitution safeguards the right and section 10 of the Lever Act directs payment. The rule above referred to, that in the absence of agreement to pay or statute allowing it the United States will not be held liable for interest on unpaid accounts and claims, does not apply here. The requirement that 'just compensation' shall be paid is comprehensive and includes all elements and no specific command to include interest is necessary when interest or its equivalent is a part of such compensation. Where the United States condemns and takes possession of land before ascertaining or paying compensation, the owner is not limited to the value of the property at the time of the taking; he is entitled to such addition as will produce the full equivalent of that value paid contemporaneously with the taking. Interest at a proper rate is a good measure by which to ascertain the amount so to be added. The legal rate of interest, as established by the South Carolina statute was applied in this case. This was a 'palpably fair and reasonable method of performing the indispensable condition to the exercise of the right of eminent domain, namely, of making 'just compensation' for the land as it stands, at the time of the taking.' United States v. Sargent (C. C. A. Eighth Circuit) 162 Fed. 81, 84, 89 C. C. A. 81.\n The addition of interest all wed by the District Court is necessary in order that the owner shall not suffer loss and shall have 'just compensation' to which he is entitled.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and that of the District Court is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] For convenience, the railway company and mortgagees will be referred to herein as 'the owner.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of Congress approved August 10, 1917 (40 Stat. 276):\n'Sec. 10.

If the compensation so determined be not satisfactory to the person entitled to receive the same, such person shall be paid seventy-five per centum of the amount so determined by the President, and shall be entitled to sue the United States to recover such further sum as, added to said seventy-five per centum will make up such amount as will be just compensation for such necessaries or storage space, and jurisdiction is hereby conferred on the United States District Courts to hear and determine all such controversies: Provided, That nothing in this section, or in the section that follows, shall be construed to require any natural person to furnish to the government any necessaries held by him and reasonably required for consumption or use by himself and dependents, nor shall any person, firm, corporation, or association be required to furnish to the government any seed necessary for the seeding of land owned, leased, or cultivated by them.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","168":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSECURITY SAV. BANK v. STATE OF CALIFORNIA(1923)\nNo. 21\nArgued: Decided: November 19, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 282, 283]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. E. J. McCutchen, Warren Olney, Jr., and A. C. Greene, all of San Francisco, Cal., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. U. S. Webb, or San Francisco, Cal., for the State of California.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the state of California to have transferred to it certain deposits in the Security Savings Bank which had been unclaimed for more than 20 years, and to have these declared escheat. The bank and the depositors were named as defendants. The bank was served personally and defended. The depositors were served by publication; but none of them appeared. \n1\n The \n\n[263 U.S. 282, 284]\n\u00a0\n bank is a California corporation and has its only place of business there. The last known residences of the depositors are not stated. All the proceedings were in conformity with section 1273 of the California Code of Civil Procedure and section 15 of its Bank Act (Stat. 1915, c. 608, p. 1106). A judgment for the plaintiff was affirmed by the highest court of the state. State v. Security Savings Bank, 186 Cal. 419, 199 Pac. 791. The case is here on writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code as amended (42 Stat. 366, c. 54). The question for decision is whether the statutes violate rights guaranteed a state bank by the federal Constitution. \n2\n It is claimed that they are obnoxious to both the contract clause and the due process clause (Const. Amend. 14,  1).\n The substantive provision of the legislation is this: If a bank account has not been added to or drawn upon by the depositor for more than 20 years, and no one claiming the money has, within that period, filed with the bank any notice showing his present residence, and the president or managing officer of the bank does not know that the depositor is alive, then the bank shall, upon entry of a judgment establishing these facts, deposit with the state treasurer the amount of the deposit and accumulations. The suit cannot be begun until after the expiration of the 20 years. The statute does not effect an immediate escheat upon the lapse of the 20 years. It provides for taking over the deposit when so adjudged in the action. A valid claim to a deposit duly made at any time prior to entry of the judgment prevents its transfer to the state. Mathews v. Savings Union Bank & Trust Co., 43 Cal. App. 45, 48, 184 Pac. 418; State v. Savings Union Bank & Trust Co., 186 Cal. 294, 298, 199 Pac. 26.\n The procedural provision is this: The suit is brought by the Attorney General in Sacramento county. Upon the bank, personal service must be made. Upon the depos itors, \n\n[263 U.S. 282, 285]\n\u00a0\n service is to be made by publication of the summons for 4 weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published in that county. With the summons a notice must also be published, requiring all persons other than the named defendants to appear and show cause why the moneys involved in the suit shall not be deposited with the state treasurer. Any person interested may become a party to the suit. The judgment to be entered requires the 'banks to forthwith deposit all such moneys with the state treasurer, to be received, invested, accounted for and paid out in the same manner and by the same officers as is provided in the case of other escheated property.' For a period of five years after entry of the judgment any person not a 'party or privy' to it may sue the state to recover the moneys so received. In the case of infants and persons of unsound mind, the period is extended for one year after removal of the disability. Code of Civil Procedure,  1272\n\n\n The unclaimed deposits are debts due by a California corporation with its place of business there. State v. Anglo & London Paris National Bank, 186 Cal. 746, 753, 200 Pac. 612; State v. Security Savings Bank, 186 Cal. 419, 423, 199 Pac. 791. The debts arose out of contracts made and to be performed there. Farmers' & Merchants' Bank v. Federal Reserve Bank, \n262 U.S. 649, 660\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 651. Thus the deposits are clearly intangible property within the state. \n3\n Over this intangible property the state has the same dominion that it has over tangible property. Pennington v.

It was settled in Provident Institution for Savings v. Malone, \n221 U.S. 660\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 661, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1129, that, where the procedure is appropriate, neither the due process clause, nor any right of the bank under the contract clause, is violated by a law requiring it to pay over to the \n\n[263 U.S. 282, 286]\n\u00a0\n state as depositary savings deposits which have long remained unclaimed. Compare Cunnius v. Reading School District, \n198 U.S. 458\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 721, 3 Ann. Cas. 1121; Blinn v. Nelson, \n222 U.S. 1\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 1, Ann. Cas. 1913B, 555. The contract of deposit does not give the banks a tontine right to retain the money in the event that it is not called for by the depositor. It gives the bank merely the right to use the depositor's money until called for by him or some other person duly authorized. If the deposit is turned over to the state in obedience to a valid law, the obligation of the bank to the depositor is discharged. Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Deer, \n200 U.S. 176\n, 26 Sup.

It is no concern of the bank's whether the state receives the money merely as depositary or takes it as an escheat.\n The bank's main contention is that it is denied due process because, owing to defects in the prescribed procedure, depositors will not be bound by the judgment, and, hence, that payment to the state will not discharge the bank from its liability to them. The argument that there is no proper provision for service upon depositors or other claimants is this: If the proceeding is in personam, the law is invalid as to nonresidents of the state, since they are served only by publication; and it is invalid as to residents, because they are served by publication without a prior showing of the necessity for such service. If the proceeding is quasi in rem, the law is invalid as to all depositors and claimants, because there is no seizure of the res, or its equivalent, because the notice provided for is inadequate and unreasonable, and because it is binding only on parties to the action. If the proceeding is strictly in rem the law is invalid, because it does not provide for such seizure of the res, nor give reasonable notice to depositors and claimants.\n The proceeding is not one in personam-at least, not so far as concerns the depositor. The state does not seek to enforce any claim against him. It seeks to have the deposit transferred. The suit determines the custody \n\n[263 U.S. 282, 287]\n\u00a0\n (and perhaps the ownership) of the deposit. The state court likened the proceeding to garnishment, and thought that it should be described as quasi in rem. In form it resembles garnishment. In substance it is like proceedings in escheat, Hamilton v. Brown, \n161 U.S. 256, 263\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 585; Christianson v. King County, \n239 U.S. 356, 373\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 114; for confiscation, The Confiscation Cases, 20 Wall. 92, 104; for forfeiture, Friedenstein v. United States, \n125 U.S. 224, 230\n, 231 S., 8 Sup. Ct. 838; for condemnation, Huling v. Kaw Valley Railway, etc., Co., \n130 U.S. 559\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 603; for registry of titles, American Land Co. v. Zeiss, \n219 U.S. 47\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 200; and libels for possession brought by the Alien Property Custodian, Central Trust Co. v. Garvan, \n254 U.S. 554\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 214. These are generally considered proceedings strictly in rem. But whether the proceeding should be described as being in rem or as being quasi in rem is not of legal significance in this connection. In either case the essentials of jurisdiction over the deposits are that there be seizure of the res at the commencement of the suit, and reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard. Compare Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 U.S. 714\n, 724; Freeman v. Alderson, \n119 U.S. 185, 187\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 165; Arndt v. Griggs, \n134 U.S. 316\n;4 Overby v. Gordon, \n177 U.S. 214, 231\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 603. These requirements are satisfied by the procedure prescribed in the statutes of California. There is a seizure or its equivalent. And the published summons to the depositors named as parties defendant is supplemented by the notice directed to all claimants whomsoever. Moreover, there is no constitutional objection to considering the proceeding as in personam, so far as concerns the bank; as quasi in rem, so far as concerns the depositors; and as strictly in rem, so far as concerns other claimants. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Seizure of the deposit is effected by the personal service made upon the bank. Provident Institution for Savings v. Malone, \n221 U.S. 660\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 661, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1129. Thereby the res is subjected \n\n[263 U.S. 282, 288]\n\u00a0\n to the jurisdiction of the court. Compare Miller v. United States, 11 Wall. 268, 297, 298. Alexandria v. Fairfax, \n95 U.S. 774\n, 779. The service upon the bank has the same effect as had service of the injunction in Pennington v. Fourth National Bank, \n243 U.S. 269\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 282, L. R. A. 1917F, 1159; or the service upon the garnishee in Harris v. Balk, \n198 U.S. 215, 223\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 625, 3 Ann. Cas. 1084; or the application for administration of the debt due an absentee in Cunnius v. Reading School District, \n198 U.S. 458\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 721, 3 Ann. Cas. 1121; or the levy of the writ and return of the fact to the court on attachment of the real estate in Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308. The fact that the claim of the state to the deposit may be defeated by the appearance of the depositor or other claimant does not, as argued, prove that the deposit was not seized. An attachment of real estate is a seizure, although it may be dissolved by bankruptcy or otherwise.\n The statutory service is reasonable, and the court is required to hear any one who may appear in the suit. The objections urged to the notice are not that insufficient time is allowed for entering an appearace, as in Roller v. Holly, \n176 U.S. 398\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 410; and Goodrich v. Ferris, \n214 U.S. 71\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 580; or that the contents of the notice fail to convey the required information, as in Grannis v. Ordean, \n234 U.S. 385\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 779. The objections taken are to the order and the place of publication. It is urged that the notice is insufficient, because service may not be made by publication until it has been shown by affidavit that personal service is impossible or impractical. Such an affidavit is a common requirement in statutes providing for service by publication on absent defendants. Compare Romig v. Gillett, \n187 U.S. 111\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 40; Jacob v. Roberts, \n223 U.S. 261\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 303. But it is not constitutionally indispensable. The reason for requiring the affidavit is that ordinarily personal service would be more likely to acquaint a defendant with the pendency of the suit. But here the general facts which underlie the legislation establish the futilty of such a requirement. \n\n[263 U.S. 282, 289]\n\u00a0\n It may be that in California banks usually endeavor to ascertain the whereabouts of depositors whose accounts have remained dormant for many years. The statute applies only to deposits in the name of a person who is not known to the president or managing officer of the bank to be alive, whose account has not been added to or drawn upon for 20 years, and who has not filed within that time any notice or claim giving his then residence. The Legislature evidently assumed that it would be impossible to serve such depositors personally. The Supreme Court of the state held that the Legislature was warranted in this assumption. The owners of the deposits were, therefore, treated like persons unknown. Compare Leigh v. Green, \n193 U.S. 79\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 390. We cannot say that the view entertained by the Legislature and the state courts was so unreasonable as to constitute a denial of due process.\n It is further argued that the publication prescribed is not reasonable notice, because it is made in Sacramento county, instead of in the county in which the bank is located. The Legislature apparently assumed that publication in Sacramento county would be more likely to attract the attention of the depositor, or of those claiming under him, than publication in the city in which the bank was located. Support for that opinion may be found in the statutes which have required savings banks (and later all banks) to publish annually in a newspaper of the city in which it is located a statement showing the amount of each deposit therein, the name and last known residence of each depositor, and the fact of his death, if known, in all cases where the depositor has not made a deposit or withdrawal for 10 years next preceding, unless the depositor is known to be living or the deposit is less than $50. Stats. 1893, p. 183; Stats. 1897, p. 27; Civil Code,  583b. Such annual publications, \n\n[263 U.S. 282, 290]\n\u00a0\n if seen, would be apt to remind a depositor of his account, even if he were not named therein. And if he had died, it might serve as a reminder, or as a suggestion, to his next of kin. The fact that, after nine or more such publications in the local newspaper, a deposit remains unclaimed, affords the Legislature some basis for thinking that the further publication provided for in these proceedings would be more apt to accomplish the purpose of actual service, if made in the county in which the state capital is located. The highest court of the state deemed the prescribed publication in Sacramento county reasonable notice. We have no ground for saying that it was not. Obviously the question 'is one of local experience, on which this court ought to be very slow to declare that the state Legislature was wrong in its facts' or abused its discretion. Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 U.S. 138, 144\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 281; Adams v. Milwaukee. \n228 U.S. 572, 583\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 610.\n In the opinion below it was suggested that the statute may be construed as permitting a depositor, although named as defendant in the Attorney General's suit, to make claim as against the state, under section 1272, at any time within the 5 years (or the extended period) after final judgment, if he did not appear in the suit. As no depositor had appeared, the point was not passed upon; and the state court expressly left open the rights of depositors and their privies in respect to escheat. State v. Security Savings Bank, 186 Cal. 419, 431, 199 Pac. 791. We have no occasion to consider them.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As to two depositors originally named as defendants a dismissal was entered by stipulation-as to one, because it appeared that the deposit had not been unclaimed for the 20 years; as to the other, because a claim had been made by an administrator, since the expiration of the 20 years. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] That the statutes are invalid as applied to national banks was settled in First National Bank v.

DAKOTA COUNTY, NEB.(1923)\nNo. 105\nArgued: November 20, 1922Decided: January 2, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. F. W. Sargent, of Chicago, Ill., and Wymer Dressler, of Omaha, Neb., for petitioner.\n Mr. R. A. Van Orsdel, of Omaha, Neb., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Thi case is here by writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Nebraska. The question is whether the taxing authorities of the state of Nebraska and of Dakota county in assessing taxes against the petitioner, the Sioux \n\n[260 U.S. 441, 442]\n\u00a0\n City Bridge Company, upon that part of its bridge across the Missouri river at South Sioux City, which is in the jurisdiction of Nebraska, deprived the Bridge Company of due process of law and denied it the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n For a number of years before 1918, the Bridge Company had returned the Nebraska part of the bridge for taxation at $600,000. In that year the assessor of Dakota county sent the blank return to the Bridge Company as usual, but the Bridge Company sent back the proposed return, refusing to sign, and insisting that the valuation was too high. The assessor then returned the bridge at $600,000 as formerly. The Bridge Company appealed to the board of equalization of the county. Only the counsel for the Bridge Company and for the city of South Sioux City appeared. No witnesses were called and no evidence produced, but the board of equalization, on the appeal of the Bridge Company for reduction, raised the assessment above that of the assessor $100,000. From this ruling an appeal was taken to the district court of Dakota county for relief against the action of the board of equalization on the ground that the valuation was excessive, was without evidence and arbitrary, that it violated the Constitution of the state requiring a uniformity of taxing burdens, and that it deprived the Bridge Company of due process and equal protection of the law as forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Seventy-four per cent. of the total value of the bridge is in Dakota county, Neb., and 26 per cent. is in Iowa. The original cost of the bridge was $941,000, but some wooden trestles in the original construction were taken out and steel substituted and this increased the original cost to $1, 022,000. The bridge was built in 1888. Since 1907 it has been under lease to two railroads and jointly they maintain the bridge, pay the taxes and 8 per cent. on the original cost of $945,800. The leases are \n\n[260 U.S. 441, 443]\n\u00a0\n short-time leases because the bridge, while in good repair, is too light for modern traffic and can only be used under burdensome and expensive restrictions. One of the railroad companies has made soundings for a new bridge. The engineers report the existing bridge to be totally out of date and estimate a depreciation in its value on this account of $300,000 from its original cost. The same witnesses testified that to build the bridge just as it was would cost at present prices from $1,300,000 to $1,500,000, but that it would be most foolish to build a bridge of that old type now.\n A tax commissioner of one of the lessee railroads, with long experience in taxation and valuation, testified that from an examination of the sales of real estate as shown by deeds of record in Nebraska and in Dakota county and the tax list, the acre property in Dakota county was assessed at 55.70 per cent. of its value; that improvements in city property were assessed at 49.29 per cent. of their selling value, and had been so assessed for seven years. The county assessor thought such sales were not best evidence of true value in money, and denied that there was any attempt to value at less than such value.\n The district court held the reasonable value of the bridge in Nebraska to be more than $700,000, as assessed, and dismissed the appeal. It made no finding upon the issue as to whether there was an under valuation of other real estate and improvements in Dakota county or the state and did not refer to it.\n The Bridge Company carried the case on appeal to the Supreme Court. That court found from the evidence that $700,000 as the true value was not so manifestly wrong that it was justified in disturbing the assessment. Taking up the objection that the real property and improvements were undervalued in Dakota county, th court said:\n'It is finally urged that this court should reduce the true value of the bridge as found by the court to 55 \n\n[260 U.S. 441, 444]\n\u00a0\n per cent. of such value, for the reason that other property in the district is assessed at 55 per cent. of its true value, and that it would be manifestly unjust to appellant to assess its property at its true value while other property in the district is assessed at 55 per cent. of its value.\n\n'While undoubtedly the law contemplates that there should be equality in taxation, we are of the view that the plan of equalization proposed by appellant is not the proper remedy. The rule is now settled by a recent decision of this court that when property is assessed at its true value, and other property in the district is assessed below its true value, the proper remedy is to have the property assessed below its true value raised, rather than to have property assessed at its true value reduced. Lincoln Telephone & Telegraph Company v. Johnson County, 102 Neb. 254.1 In the argument of appellant the soundness of this ruling is assailed, and authorities in other jurisdictions are cited which seem at variance with our holding. We are not willing, however, to recede from the rule of that case.'\n\n Section 1, article 9, of the Constitution of Nebraska, contains the following:\n'The Legislature shall provide such revenue as may be needful by levying a tax by valuation, so that every person and corporation shall pay a tax in proportion to the value of his, her or its property and franchises, the value to be ascertained in such manner as the Legislature shall direct. ...'\n\n Section 6300 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska provides:\n'All property in this state not expressly exempt therefrom shall be subject to taxation, and shall be valued at its actual value which shall be entered opposite each item and shall be assessed at 20 per cent. of such actual value. Such assessed value shall be entered in separate column opposite each item and shall be taken \n\n[260 U.S. 441, 445]\n\u00a0\n and considered as the taxable value of such property, and the value at which it shall be listed and upon which the levy shall be made. Actual value as used in this chapter shall mean its value in the market in the ordinary course of trade.'\n\n In the case of Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Wakefield Tp., \n247 \nU.S. 350, 352\n, 353 S., 38 Sup. Ct. 495, this court said:\n'The purpose of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is to secure every person within the state's jurisdiction against intentional and arbitrary discrimination, whether occasioned by express terms of a statute or by its improper execution through duly constituted agents. And it must be regarded as settled that intentional systematic undervaluation by state officials of other taxable property in the same class contravenes the constitutional right of one taxed upon the full value of his property. Raymond v. Chicago Union Traction Company, \n207 \nU.S. 20, 35\n, 37 S..'\n\n Analogous cases are Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 516\n, 517 S., 518, 37 Sup. Ct. 673; Cummins v. National Bank, \n101 U.S. 153\n, 160; Taylor v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 88 Fed. 350, 364, 365, 372, 374, 31 C. C. A. 537; Louisville & N. Ry. Co. v. Bosworth (D. C.) 209 Fed. 380, 452; Washington Water Power Co. v. Kootenai County (C. C. A.) 270 Fed. 369, 374.\n The charge made by the Bridge Company in this case was that the state, through its duly constituted agents, to wit, the county assessor and the county board of equalization, improperly executed the Constitution and taxing laws of the state and intentionally and arbitrarily assessed the Bridge Company's property at 100 per cent. of its true value and all the other real estate and its improvements in the county at 55 per cent.\n The Supreme Court does not make it clear whether it thinks the discrimination charged was proved or not, but assuming the discrimination, it holds that the Bridge Company has no remedy except 'to have the property \n\n[260 U.S. 441, 446]\n\u00a0\n assessed below its true value raised rather than to have property assessed at its true value reduced.' The dilemma presented by a case where one or a few of a class of taxpayers are assessed at 100 per cent. of the value of their property in accord with a constitutional or statutory requirement, and the rest of the class are intentionally assessed at a much lower percentage in violation of the law, has been often dealt with by courts and there has been a conflict of view as to what should be done. There is no doubt, however, of the view taken of such cases by the federal courts in the enforcement of the uniformity clauses of state statutes and constitutions and of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The exact question was considered at length by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit in the case of Taylor v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 88 Fed. 350, 364, 365, 31 C. C. A. 537, and the language of that court was approved and incorporated in the decision of this court in Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 516\n, 517 S., 518, 37 Sup. Ct. 673. The conclusion in these and other federal authorities is that such a result as that reached by the Supreme Court of Nebraska is to deny the injured taxpayer any remedy at all because it is utterly impossible for him by any judicial proceeding to secure an increase in the assessment of the great mass of underassessed property in the taxing district. This court holds that the right of the taxpayer whose property alone is taxed at 100 per cent. of its true value is to have his assessment reduced to the percentage of that value at which others are taxed even though this is a departure from the requirement of statute. The conclusion is based on the principle that where it is impossible to secure both the standard of the true value, and the uniformity and equality required by law, the latter requirement is to be preferred as the just and ultimate purpose of the law. In substance and effect the decision \n\n[260 U.S. 441, 447]\n\u00a0\n of the Nebraska Supreme Court in this case upholds the violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the injury of the Bridge Company. We must, therefore, reverse its judgment.\n But we construe the action of the court not to be equivalent to a finding that such intentional discrimination existed between the valuation of the Bridge Company's property and that of all other real property and improvements in the county, but rather a ruling that even if it did exist, the Bridge Company must continue to pay taxes on a full 100 per cent. valuation of its property. It was on the same principle, doubtless, that the district court ignored the issue of discrimination altogether. It is therefore just that upon reversal we should remand the case for a further hearing upon the issue of discrimination, inviting attention to the well- established rule in the decisions of this court, cited above, that mere errors of judgment do not support a claim of discrimination, but that there must be something more-something which in effect amounts to an intentional violation of the essential principle of practical uniformity. Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Wakefield Tp., \n247 \nU.S. 350, 353\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 495\n\n\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Nebraska is reversed, and is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 166 N.

Macmillan, of Salt Lake City, Utah, for petitioner.\n Messrs. A. B. Irvine and Wm. H. Folland, both of Salt Lake City, Utah, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court. \n\n[260 U.S. 596, 597]\n\u00a0\n This is a suit to determine conflicting claims to underground waters collected and brought to the surface by a mining tunnel in Utah. The plaintiff (petitioner here) is a mining company incorporated in Delaware and the defendant an irrigation company incorporated in Utah. Each seeks to have the right to use the waters quieted in itself as against the other. The District Court, with some hesitation, gave a decree for the mining company, which the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, with a direction that one for the irrigation company be given. Midway Irr. Co. v. Snake Creek Mining & Tunnel Co., 271 Fed. 157. A writ of certiorari brings the case here. \n256 U.S. 687\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 536\n\n\n The mining company owns and operates a mine in a mountain along a tributary of the Provo river and, in furtherance of its mining operations, has driven a tunnel 14,500 feet into the mountain from a portal near the stream. The tunnel intercepts and collects waters percolating through the bosom of the mountain and conveys them to the portal, whence they now flow into the stream. The tunnel was begun in 1910, and these waters are intercepted and collected along its course after it gets well into the mountain. The mining company owns a tract of land surrounding the portal, and we assume it has a right of way for the tunnel beyond that tract, although this does not appear. It has not used and does not now use any of the waters in connection with its tunnel or mine, but asserts an exclusive right to them, and has arranged, and is intending, to sell to others the right to use them for irrigating distant lands.\n The irrigation company is a corporate agency of a community of farmers, and holds, controls, and administers for their mutual advantage the water rights which enable them to irrigate and cultivate their lands, all of which are naturally arid. Long prior to the driving of the tunnel, and while the lands through which it extends were \n\n[260 U.S. 596, 598]\n\u00a0\n public lands of the United States, the irrigation company or its stockholders appropriated all the waters of the stream for irrigation and other beneficial uses; and under that appropriation these waters long have been applied and devoted to such uses on the lands of the stockholders some distance down stream from the portal of the tunnel.\n The waters intercepted and collected by the tunnel are percolating waters, which before it was driven found their way naturally, but not in a defined channel, through the rocks, gravel, and soil of the mountain into open springs near the stream, and thence by surface channels into the stream. At all seasons this was one of the stream's sources of supply, and in the late summer and early fall one of its most dependable sources. The amount of water so naturally finding its way underground into the springs, and thence into the stream, has been materially diminished by the tunnel; the diminution conforming substantially to the discharge at the portal. All the natural flow of the stream as it was before the tunnel was driven is required to satisfy the prior appropriation of the irrigation company or its stockholders, and to irrigate the lands of the latter, to which it long has been applied, and, unless the waters so intercepted and collected by the tunnel be permitted to flow from its portal into the stream in such way that they can be used under the prior appropriation, a material part of the lands heretofore reclaimed and irrigated thereunder will be without water, and their cultivation must be discontinued.\n Several questions were presented to and decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals, but only one merit discussion here. It is whether under the law of Utah the waters which the tunnel intercepts, collects, and conveys to its portal belong to the mining company or are within the appropriation made by the irrigation company or its \n\n[260 U.S. 596, 599]\n\u00a0\n stockholders before the lands through which the tunnel extends became private lands.\n The parties, while agreeing that the Utah law is controlling, differ as to what that law is. On the part of the mining company it is contended that, when the tunnel site was acquired and the tunnel driven, Utah had adopted and was applying the common-law rule respecting underground waters; that by that rule such waters, where not moving in a known and defined channel, are part of the land in which they are found and belong absolutely to its owngr; and that, if the law of Utah in this regard has since been changed, rights vested before the change are not affected by it. On the part of the irrigation company it is insisted that the common law rule never was adopted or in force in Utah; that her law always has regarded waters percolating underground, where within the public lands, as open to appropriation for irrigation or other beneficial uses, subject only to a reasonable use of them in connection with the land in which they exist by whoever may come to own it; and that her law likewise has regarded an appropriation of the natural flow of a surface stream as reaching and including its underground sources of supply within the public lands, subject only to the qualification just indicated.\n Both courts below experienced some embarrassment in solving this question of Utah law; the District Court observing that the Supreme Court of the state, although having the question before it a number of times, 'has never definitely announced its adherence' to either view, and the Circuit Court of Appeals that the early decisions, although 'not always harmonious,' 'seem to have favored the English rule,' while the later decisions have given effect to the other view. That there was some basis for the embarrassment is plain. Particularly was this true when the District Court made its ruling. Thereafter, and before the ruling by the Circuit Court of Appeals, the \n\n[260 U.S. 596, 600]\n\u00a0\n situation was partly clarified by two decisions in the state court,1 and it now has been further clarified by two still later decisions in that court. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Utah is within the semiarid region of the West, where irrigation has been practiced from the time of the earliest settlements and is indispensable to the cultivation of the lands. She was made a territory in 1850 and became a state January 4, 1896. While she was a territory and most of the lands within her borders were part of the public domain, Congress passed three acts which require notice.\n The Act of July 26, 1866, c. 262, 14 Stat. 251 (Comp. St.  4647), provided, in its ninth section:\n'Wherever, by priority of possession, rights to the use of water for mining, agricultural, manufacturing, or other purposes, have vested and accrued, and the same are recognized and acknowledged by the local customs, laws, and the decisions of courts, the possessors and owners of such vested rights shall be maintained and protected in the same.'\n\n The Act of July 9, 1870, c. 235, 16 Stat. 217, declared, in its seventeenth section (Comp. St.  4648), that 'all patents granted, or pre- emption or homesteads allowed, shall be subject to any vested and accrued water rights' recognized by the provision of 1866. And the Act of March 3, 1877, c. 107, 19 Stat. 377 (Comp. St.  4674), after providing for the sale of desert lands in small tracts to persons effecting the reclamation thereof by an actual appropriation and use of water, declared that:\n'All surplus water over and above such actual appropriation and use, together with the water of all lakes, rivers and other sources of water supply upon the public lands and not navigable, shall remain and be held free for the appropriation and use of the public for irrigation, mining and manufacturing \n\n[260 U.S. 596, 601]\n\u00a0\n purposes subject to existing rights.'\n\n This court has said of these enactments that:\n'The obvious purpose of Congress was to give its assent, so far as the public lands were concerned, to any system, although in contravention of the common-law rule, which permitted the appropriation of the waters for legitimate industries.'\n\n By an Act of February 20, 1880, the legislative assembly of the territory declared (Laws 1880, c. 20,  6):\n'A right to the use of water for any useful purpose, such as ... irrigating lands, ... is hereby recognized and acknowledged to have vested and accrued, as a primary right, ... under any of the following circumstances: First-Whenever any person or persons shall have taken, diverted and used any of the unappropriated water of any natural stream, water course, lake, or spring, or other natural source of supply. ...'\n\n It was in the presence of these enactments, congressional and territorial, and prior to any decision thereon in Utah, that the irrigation company or its stockholders made the appropriation in question.\n The first case in Utah involving rights asserted under an appropriation such as is described in these enactments was Stowell v. Johnson, 7 Utah, 215, 26 Pac. 290. The controversy was between one who relied on such an appropriation from a surface stream and another who owned lands along a lower section of the stream and was relying on the common-law doctrine of riparian rights. The Supreme Court of the territory sustained the appropriation and distinctly held that the common-law doctrine was not applicable to the conditions in the territory and never was in force there. On the latter point the court said (7 Utah, 225, 26 Pac. 291):\n'Riparian rights have never been recognized in this territory, or in any state or territory where irrigation is necessary; for the appropriation of water for the purpose of irrigation is entirely and unavoidably in conflict with the common-law doctrine of riparian proprietorship. If that had \n\n[260 U.S. 596, 602]\n\u00a0\n been recognized and applied in this territory, it would still be a desert; for a man owning 10 acres of land on a stream of water capable of irrigating 1,000 acres of land or more, near its mouth, could prevent the settlement of all the land above him. For at common law the riparian proprietor is entitled to have the water flow in quantity and quality past his land as it was wont to do when he acquired title thereto, and this right is utterly irreconcilable with the use of water for irrigation. The Legislature of this territory has always ignored this claim of riparian proprietors, and the practice and usages of the inhabitants have never considered it applicable, and have never regarded it.'\n\n This ruling has been reaffirmed but never recalled or qualified.\n The next case was Sullivan v. Northern Spy Mining Co., 11 Utah, 438, 40 Pac. 709, 30 L. R. A. 186. It involved an asserted appropriation of underground water, not in a known or defined channel. At the time of the appropriation the land where the water was found was public land. Afterwards the land was located and patented under the public land laws. The appropriator continued, as before, to take and use the water, and the owner of the land challenged the appropriation and sued to recover damages as for a trespass. In stating the question for decision, the territorial court said:\n'The federal government, as proprietor of the public lands, early recognized the necessity of permitting persons in this arid region to acquire an interest in water sources on the public lands distinct from the lands themselves. It had always been the settled law that the owner of land was likewise the owner of all waters situate thereon or percolating therein. This may be said to have been the universal rule in the United States, prior to the settlement of California. Local decisions, arising from the necessities of the people, soon altered it there, and in 1866 Congress passed an act,' etc.\n\n'The question is, then, Is the right of defendant to use water, under the fact stated, \n\n[260 U.S. 596, 603]\n\u00a0\n one that is recognized by the local customs and laws?'\n\n The court reviewed the enactments we have set forth above, said they should not be narrowly construed, and held (11 Utah, 443, 40 Pac. 710, 30 L. R. A. 186):\n'In our opinion, wherever the industry of the pioneer has appropriated a source of water, either on the surface of or under the public lands, he and his successors acquire an easement and right to take and use such water to the extent indicated by the original appropriation, and that a private owner who subsequently acquires the land takes it burdened with this easement, and we also hold that this easement carries with it such rights of ingress and egress as are necessary to its proper enjoyment.'\n\n But, notwithstanding this very definite pronouncement, the court, in concluding its opinion, added (11 Utah, 444, 40 Pac. 710, 30 L. R. A. 186):\n'This right of an appropriator is, of course, subject to the rule of law which will permit the owner to sink an adjoining well on his own premises although he should thereby dry up that of the first appropriator.'\n\n This addendum was inconsistent with the principal decision and, so far as appears, was not necessary to a full disposal of the case. With this comment it may be put out of view, for the court afterwards declared it dictum. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Shortly after the decision in that case came the constitution of the state which says (article 17,  1):\n'All existing rights to the use of any of the waters in this state for any useful or beneficial purpose, are hereby recognized and confirmed.'\n\n The next case to engage the court's attention was Crescent Mining Co. v. Silver King Mining Co., 17 Utah, 444, 54 Pac. 244, 70 Am. St. Rep. 810. It presented a controversy between two mining companies over percolating water intercepted and collected by a tunnel. One company had driven the tunnel into two patented mining claims of which it was the owner and had been permitting the water to flow from the portal into a \n\n[260 U.S. 596, 604]\n\u00a0\n so-called lake. The water was not a natural source of supply for the lake, nor had it been in any way appropriated before the mining claims were patented and the tunnel driven. After it began flowing through the tunnel, and thence into the lake the other company attempted to appropriate it at the lake by diverting it therefrom and using it. The company owning the tunnel challenged that appropriation and proceeded to use the water for purposes which prevented it from flowing into the lake. The other company then brought the suit, claiming that by its appropriation it had acquired a right to have the water flow from the tunnel into the lake uninterruptedly and continuously. The court held that underground waters collected by a tunnel from the private lands of its owner were not open to subsequent appropriation by others, and that the company owning the land and tunnel and bringing the waters, theretofore unappropriated, to the surface had the better right to use them. This, without more, determined the controversy; but in the opinion much was said which, had it been essential to a decision of the case, might well be taken as committing the court to the common-law rule respecting underground waters. But it was not essential, and the court has since recognized that the read decision was as we have just stated. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n For several years after the ruling in that case the decisions were largely in a state of flux; the opinions disclosing pronounced differences among the judges and tending at times in favor of the common-law rule and at other times against it. A notable case of that period was before the court on two successive appeals. Herriman Irrigation Co. v. Butterfield Mining Co., 19 Utah, 453, 57 Pac. 537, 51 L. R. A. 930; Herriman Irrigation Co. v. Keel, 25 Utah, 96, 69 Pac. 719. Like the present case, it involved a controversy between an irrigation company \n\n[260 U.S. 596, 605]\n\u00a0\n having an early appropriation of the natural flow of a surface stream and a mining company having a subseque t patent for adjacent lands pierced by a tunnel which encountered underground waters and conducted them to its portal whence they flowed into the stream. As here, the mining company had arranged to sell to others the right to use the waters elsewhere. Two matters were in dispute: First, whether the underground waters constituted one of the stream's natural sources of supply; and, secondly, if they did, whether the mining company was entitled to take and sell them as against the irrigation company which had appropriated the natural flow of the stream when the lands pierced by the tunnel were public lands. On the first appeal the judgment of the trial court was reversed and a new trial directed because of incomplete and erroneous findings of fact; but the plain purport of the opinion, which had the approval of all the judges, was that if in fact the waters collected by the tunnel constituted one of the stream's natural sources of supply at the time its natural flow was appropriated by the irrigation company, which was when the lands were part of the public domain, that company had the better right to those waters. On the second appeal the decision turned chiefly on questions of fact; but the judges, in separate opinions, entered into an extended discussion of the question of law with which we here are concerned. One judge thought the common-law rule was in force, and another that it had been rejected and that the decision on the first appeal had proceeded on that view. The remaining judge left his attitude on the question in some uncertainty. The case settled no principle and is without force as a precedent. Other cases during the same period are cited by counsel and particular expressions in the opinions are relied on as making for one view or the other; but it suffices here to say of these cases that they do not show any settled rule of decision. \n\n[260 U.S. 596, 606]\n\u00a0\n The later decisions have all tended in one direction and have resulted in establishing the rule for which the irrigation company contends, and which the Circuit Court of Appeals applied. These decisions frankly deal with the prior situation as we have described it, reaffirm the principles announced in the early cases of Stowell v. Johnson and Sullivan v. Northern Spy Mining Co., point out the dicta and uncertainty in the opinions delivered in several cases, hold that the common-law rule is not applicable to the conditions in Utah, and show that it never was definitely adopted or followed there. Mountain Lake Mining Co. v. Midway Irrigation Co., 47 Utah, 346, 149 Pac. 929; Bastian v. Nebeker, 49 Utah, 39, 163 Pac. 1092; Peterson v.

CURETON(1923)\nNo. 20\nArgued: October 5, 1922Decided: June 11, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 506, 507]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. M. McCormick and Francis Marion Etheridge, both of Dallas, Tex., for appellants.\n Messrs. E. F. Smith and C. M. Cureton, both of Austin, Tex., and C. W. Taylor, of Corsicanna, Tex., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a decree of a United States District Court under section 238, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), in a case in which a law of Texas is claimed to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States. The law in question is article 7377 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, approved May 16, 1907. Acts Tex. 1907, p. 479. It provides that every individual, firm, or corporation, foreign or domestic, engaging as a wholesale dealer in coal oil or other oils refined from petroleum, shall make a quarterly report to the state comptroller, showing the gross amount, collected and uncollected, from any and all sales made within the state during the quarter next preceding, and that an occupation tax shall be paid by such dealer equal to 2 per cent. of the gross amount of such sales, collected or uncollected.\n From an agreed statement of facts, the following appears:\n Sonneborn Bros. is a firm of nonresident merchants selling petroleum products, with its principal place of business in New York City. In January, 1910, it opened an office in Dallas, Tex., and since that time has maintained it and connecting warerooms and has rented space in a public warehouse at San Antonio, Tex. From January, 1910, until April 11, 1919, receipts from its total \n\n[262 U.S. 506, 508]\n\u00a0\n sales, made through orders received at the Dallas office, have amounted to $ 860,801.50. This sum included:\n\n\n (1)\n Those from the sale of oil which, when sold, was not in Texas.\n\n\n (2)\n Those from sales of oil to be delivered from Texas out of the state.\n\n\n (3)\n Those arising from the sale of oil shipped into Texas and afterwards sold from the storerooms in unbroken original packages.\n\n\n (4)\n Those from sales in Texas from broken packages.\n The receipts from the first two classes amounted to $643,622.40 and the state authorities made no effort to tax them. The receipts from (4) amounted in the period named to $16,549.84 and appellants do not deny their liability for the tax thereon. The sales made under (3) of unbroken packages, after their arrival in Texas, and after storage in the warerooms or warehouse of appellants amounted to $217,179.10, and the tax on this, amounting to $4,674.58, is the subject of the contest here.\n The question we have to decide is whether oil transported by appellants from New York or elsewhere outside of Texas to their warerooms or warehouse in Texas, there held for sales in Texas in original packages of transportation, and subsequently sold and delivered in Texas in such original packages, may be made the basis of an occupation tax upon appellants, when the state tax applies to all wholesale dealers in oil engaged in making sales and delivery in Texas.\n Our conclusion must depend on the answer to the question: Is this a regulation of, or a burden upon, interstate commerce? We think it is neither. The oil had come to a state of rest in the warehouse of the appellants, and had become a part of their stock, with which they proposed to do business as wholesale dealers in the state. The interstate transportation was at an end, and, whether in the original packages or not, a state tax upon the oil \n\n[262 U.S. 506, 509]\n\u00a0\n as property or upon its sale in the state, if the state law levied the same tax on all oil or all sales of it, without regard to origin, would be neither a regulation nor a burden of the interstate commerce of which this oil had been the subject.\n This has been established so far as property taxes on the merchandise are concerned by a formidable line of authorities. Brown v. Houston, \n114 U.S. 622\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 1091; Coe v. Errol, \n116 U.S. 517\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 475; Pittsburg Coal Co. v. Bates, \n156 U.S. 577\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 415; Diamond Match Co. v. Ontonagon, \n188 U.S. 82\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 266; American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, \n192 \nU.S. 500, 520\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 365; General Oil Co. v. Crain, \n209 U.S. 211\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 475; Bacon v. Illinois, \n227 U.S. 504\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 299.\n But the argument is that for articles in original packages the sale is a final step in the interstate commerce, and that the owner may not be taxed upon such sale, because this is a direct burden on that step. The reasoning is based on the supposed analogy of the immunity from state taxation of imports from foreign countries which lasts until the article imported has been sold, or has been taken from its original packages of importation and added to the mass of merchandise of the state. This immunity of imports was established by this court in Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 446, 447, and was declared in obedience to the prohibition of the Constitution contained in section 10, art. 1, par. 2, providing that:\n'No state shall, without the consent of the Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws.'\n\n The holding was that the sale was part of the importation. It is the article itself to which the immunity attaches and whether it is in transit or is at rest, so long as it is in the form and package in which imported and in the custody and ownership of the importer, the state may not tax it. This immunity has been enforced as against \n\n[262 U.S. 506, 510]\n\u00a0\n a license or occupation tax on the importer in Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, as against a personal property tax on a stock of wines of a wine dealer to the extent to which the stock included imported wines in the original packages. Low v. Austin, 13 Wall. 29, and as against an occupation tax on an auctioneer measured by his commissions on the sales of such imports, Cook v. Pennsylvania, \n97 U.S. 566\n. When, however, the article imported is sold or is taken from the original package and exposed for sale, the immunity is gone. Waring v. Mobile, 8 Wall. 110; May v. New Orleans, \n178 U.S. 496\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 976\n\n\n Cases subsequent to Brown v. Maryland show that the analogy between imports and articles in original packages in interstate commerce in respect of immunity from taxation fails. The distinction is that the immunity attaches to the import itself before sale, while the immunity in case of an article because of its relation to interstate commerce depends on the question whether the tax challenged regulates or burdens interstate commerce.\n The first of the cases making this distinction is Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123. In that case, Woodruff, an auctioneer in Mobile, received, in the course of his general business for himself and as consignee and agent for others, merchandise from Alabama and from other states and sold it in unbroken packages. The city of Mobile under its charter levied a uniform tax on real and personal property, on sales at auction, on sales of merchandise, and on capital employed in the business in the city. Woodruff objected to paying any tax on the auction sales of merchandise from other states in original packages. The question most considered by the court was whether merchandise exported from one state to another was an export which a state was forbidden to tax by article 1,  10, par. 3, of the federal Constitution, above quoted. It was held that it was not, and that the words 'imports and exports' as there used referred to, and included only merchandise \n\n[262 U.S. 506, 511]\n\u00a0\n brought in from, or transported to, foreign countries. The court (8 Wall. 140) further held that such a tax which did not discriminate against the sales of goods from other states, but was imposed upon sales of all merchandise, whether its origin was in Alabama or in any other state, was not 'an attempt to fetter commerce among the states.'\n At the close of the opinion in Brown v. Maryland, Chief Justice Marshall made the remark 'that we suppose the principles laid down in this case apply equally to importations from a sister state.' This was pronounced in Woodruff v. Parham not to be a judicial decision of the question, but an obiter dictum.\n While the opinion by Mr. Justice Miller in Woodruff v. Parham is chiefly devoted to showing that exports are limited to goods sent out of the country, the decision on the interstate commerce phase of the issue was most fully considered. The adverse view was pressed with all the learning and force of argument of John A. Campbell, formerly a Justice of this court.\n Immediately following Woodruff v. Parham is Hinson v. Lott, 8 Wall. 148, in which was at issue the validity of a provision of the Alabama law that before it should be lawful for a dealer introducing spirituous liquors into the state to offer the same for sale, he must pay 50 cents a gallon thereon. The provision was sustained as not being an attempt to burden interstate commerce, because by another section of the same law every distiller of the state was required to pay 50 cents a gallon on all liquor made by him, and the two sections were complementary in order 'to make the tax equal on all liquors sold in the state.'\n Woodruff v. Parham was affirmed and applied in Brown v. Houston, \n114 U.S. 622\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 1091, where coal mined in Pennsylvania and sent in barges to New Orleans, to be sold after arrival from those barges, without being landed, to a \n\n[262 U.S. 506, 512]\n\u00a0\n vessel bound to a foreign port, was held while awaiting sale to be subject to taxation by the state as property in Lousiana.\n The case of Woodruff v. Parham has never been overruled, but has often been approved and followed, as the cases above cited show. As an authority it controls the case before us, and shows conclusively that the tax in question is valid.\n The distinction between the immunity from state taxation of imports in original packages, and that of articles coming from interstate commerce in original packages, is again brought out with emphasis by Mr. Justice White, afterwards Chief Justice, in American Steel & Wir Co. v. Speed, \n192 U.S. 522\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 365. In that case, articles of hardware were shipped by the American Steel & Wire Company from their factories in the East to Memphis, Tennessee, and there kept in store in original packages to be distributed to Arkansas and other states when sold, on orders to be subsequently secured. Memphis, under a general law, imposed a merchant's tax on the wire company, based on the average capital invested in the business and included this stock of original packages in the average. The court conceded that if these goods were 'imports,' they could not be taxed under Brown v. Maryland, but said (\n192 U.S. 519\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 370):\n'But the goods not having been brought from abroad, they were not imported in the legal sense, and were subject to state taxation after they had reached their destination and whilst held in the state for sale,' and cited the cases of Woodruff v. Parham and Brown v. Houston. Speaking of these cases, the Justice said:\n\n'Those two cases, decided, the one more than 35 and the other more than 18 years ago, are decisive of every contention urged on this record depending on the import and the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States. The doctrine which the two \n\n[262 U.S. 506, 513]\n\u00a0\n cases announced has never since been questioned. It has become the basis of taxing power exerted for years, by all the states of the Union.'\n\n Support for the contention that a state tax on sales of merchandise in original packages brought in from another state is to be distinguished from ad valorem taxes on the merchandise itself is supposed to be found in the cases of Leisy v. Hardin, \n135 U.S. 100\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 681; and Lyng v. Michigan, \n135 U.S. 161\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 725. In those cases it was held that a law of a state which forbade sales or merchandise brought in to the state from another state and subjected it to forfeiture, was invalid because freedom to sell was part of interstate commerce and interference with such freedom was an obstruction and would be so regarded as long as the merchandise was unsold and in an original package. The reasoning in Brown v. Maryland as to the necessity of sale to complete importation was resorted to by the Court in Leisy v. Hardin to sustain the view that a sale was a part of interstate commerce and any state action which intercepted the merchandise brought in before sale in the original package was void. In drawing the proper line between the valid operation of state prohibition laws and lawful interstate commerce, Chief Justice Marhall's conception of that to be drawn between importation from abroad under the Constitution and state taxation was adopted. Without questioning the reasoning used to reach the conclusion in Leisy v. Hardin, it is enough to point out the radical difference between state legislation preventing any sale at all accompanied by forfeiture of the merchandise, and a provision for an occupation tax applicable to all sales of such merchandise whether domestic or brought from another state. The one plainly interferes with or destroys the commerce, the other merely puts the merchandise on an equality with all other merchandise in the state and constitutes no real hindrance to introducing the merchandise into the state for sale \n\n[262 U.S. 506, 514]\n\u00a0\n upon the basis of equal competition. Mr. Justice White in his opinion in the American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, thus distinguished Leisy v. Hardin from the case then before the Court. The obstruction to interstate commerce in Leisy v. Hardin was like that in Schollenberger v. Pennsylvania, \n171 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 757, in Railroad Co. v. Husen, \n95 U.S. 465\n, 469, in Minnesota v. Barber, \n136 U.S. 313\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 862, in Brimmer v. Rebman, \n138 U.S. 78\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 213, in Scott v. Donald, \n165 \nU.S. 58, 97\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 265, in Vance v. Vandercook, No. 1, \n170 U.S. 438\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 674, and in Amer can Express Co. v. Iowa, \n196 U.S. 133\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 182.\n Counsel for the appellants cite the case of Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282, 290\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 106, as aiding their argument that a tax on a sale of merchandise in an original package brought from another state is a tax on interstate commerce and is different from an ad valorem property tax on the merchandise. But that case was not concerned with the power to tax, but rather with the power of a state to prevent an engagement in interstate commerce within her limits, except by her leave. The holding there was that a contract for the purchase of a crop of grain in Kentucky to be delivered at a railway station in Kentucky for shipment to Tennessee, conformably to a settled course of business, was an interstate contract which a corporation not authorized by Kentucky to do business in that state might nevertheless make and enforce without incurring the penalty of the state law. It was said in that case (\n257 U.S. 290\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 108) that--\n'Where goods in one state are transported into another for purposes of sale, the commerce does not end with the transportation, but embraces as well the sale of the goods after they reach their destination, and while they are in the original packages. Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 446, 447; American Steel & Wire Company v. Speed, \n192 U.S. 500\n, 519. On the same principle, where goods are purchased in one state for transportation to another, the \n\n[262 U.S. 506, 515]\n\u00a0\n commerce includes the purchase quite as much as it does the transportation. American Express Company v. Iowa, \n196 U.S. 133\n, 143.'\n\n But this language has no relevancy to show that a tax without discrimination on goods after the transportation ceases, is a burden on interstate commerce, a proposition negatived in the American Steel & Wire Co. Case it cites, or that a different rule should apply to an ad valorem property tax from that in case of a tax on sales.\n Many of the sales by the appellants were made by them before the oil to fulfill the sales was sent to Texas. These were properly treated by the state authorities as exempt from state taxation. They were in effect contracts for the sale and delivery of the oil across state lines. The soliciting of orders for such sales is equally exempt. Such transactions are interstate commerce in its essence and any state tax upon it is a regulation of it and a burden upon it. Robbins v.

Ct. 126. \n\n[262 U.S. 506, 516]\n\u00a0\n A state tax upon merchandise brought in from another state or upon its sales, whether in original packages or not, after it has reached its destination and is in a state of rest, is lawful only when the tax is not discriminating in its incidence against the merchandise because of its origin in another state. This distinction is illustrated in the difference between those cases which uphold the validity of a tax upon peddlers engaged in selling merchandise from out of the state which they carry with them, like those of Machine Co. v. Gage, \n100 U.S. 676\n; Emert v. Missouri, \n156 U.S. 296\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 367; Baccus v. Louisiana, \n232 U.S. 334\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 439; and Wagner v. Covington, \n251 U.S. 95\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 93, on the one hand, and that of Welton v. Missouri, \n91 U.S. 275\n, in which a peddler's tax was held bad because it was levied only on goods from other states, on the other. Ward v. Maryland, 12 Wall. 418, 429; Guy v. Baltimore, \n100 U.S. 434\n, 442-443; Tierman v. Rinker, \n102 U.S. 123\n; Webber v. Virginia, \n103 U.S. 344\n, 350, and Walling v. Michigan, \n116 U.S. 446\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 454, are other instances showing the invalidity of state tax laws discriminating against merchandise brought in from other states.\n Appellants' chief argument to sustain their contention that a sale of merchandise in the original package made after it is brought into the state from another state is exempt from state taxation is based upon the language of the opinions in certain recent cases in this court. They are Standard Oil Co. v. Graves, \n249 U.S. 389\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 320; Askren v. Continental Oil Co., \n252 U.S. 444\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 355, Bowman v. Continental Oil Co., \n256 U.S. 642\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 606, and Texas Co. v. Brown, \n258 U.S. 466\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 375.\n Oil Co. v. Graves was a case of excessive inspection fees. The law of Washington in that case required inspection and labelling before sale, and punished sales without them. The Supreme Court of the state said the law could be sustained as an excise law on selling oil in the state. The opinion contains this passage: \n\n[262 U.S. 506, 517]\n\u00a0\n 'In this case the amended complaint alleges that the oils were shipped into Washington from California. They are brought there for sale. This right of sale as to such importations is protected ... by the federal Constitution, certainly while the same are in the original receptacles or retainers in which they are brought into the state.'\n The court said finally:\n'We reach the conclusion that the statute imposing these excessive inspection fees, in the manner stated, upon all sales of oils brought into the state in interstate commerce necessarily imposes a direct burden upon such commerce, and is, therefore violative of ... the federal Constitution.'\n\n There is nothing in the statement of the case to show the details of the importations of oil, and nothing to indicate how much, if any, of the oil imported had been ordered before shipment into the state or how much sold after importation. The remark of the court as to original receptacles or retainers, therefore, is not shown to have been necessary to the conclusion.\n The case of Askren v. Continental Oil Co. involved the validity of a law called an inspection law, imposing a license tax upon those selling gasoline in the state, and an excise tax of 2 cents a gallon on the sale or use of it. The inspectors' duties were to see to the execution of the act and the excess of receipts after payment of their salaries and expenses went into the road fund of the state. The case was decided on the averments of the bill which described complainant's business of two kinds: First, that of selling oil to customers in tanks, and also in barrels and packages containing not less than two 5-gallon cans, without breaking them; and, second, of selling gasoline from such tanks and cans in quantities desired by the purchaser. There was nothing to show whether the first kind of business was done on orders lodged before importation or after. \n\n[262 U.S. 506, 518]\n\u00a0\n The court, however, said:\n'As to the gasoline brought into the state in the tank cars, or in the original packages, and so sold, we are unable to discover any difference in plan of importation and sale between the instant case and that before us in Standard Oil Co. v. Graves, \n249 U.S. 389\n, in which we held that a tax, which was in effect a privilege tax, as is the one under consideration, providing for a levy of fees in excess of the cost of inspection, amounted to a direct burden on interstate commerce. In that case, we reaffirmed, what had been often adjudicated heretofore in this court, that the direct and necessary effect of such legislation was to impose a burden upon interstate commerce; that under the federal Constitution the importer of such products from another state into his own state for sale in the original packages, had a right to sell the same in such packages without being taxed for the privilege by taxation of the sort here involved.'\n\n If the orders for such sales in original packages were given before importation, the conclusion reached by the court that they were protected against an excise or license tax is in accord with all of the cases already cited, though the fact that they were delivered in the original packages would not give them any additional immunity. It should be noted that in this opinion, the case of Wagner v. Covington, \n251 U.S. 95\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 93, is quoted approvingly and followed although in that case a tax was upheld on merchandise brought in from Ohio by the seller and sold there in the original packages. In the absence of specification as to when ordered, we can not be sure that the case was wrongly decided, but only that the language used contained implications which can not be sustained.\n The case of Bowman v. Continental Oil Co. was the same case as the Askren Case, the representatives of the state having changed. The Askren Case had come here on an appeal from an interlocutory injunction and was \n\n[262 U.S. 506, 519]\n\u00a0\n decided on the averments of the bill. When the case went back, an answer was filed and the case was heard and it turned out that only 5 per cent. of the business was in tank cars and unbroken packages sold, and that 95 per cent. was in sales of gasoline in quantities desired. The main point decided in the Bowman Case was that a license tax law which imposed a lump tax as a condition of doing business, part of which it was unlawful under the federal Constitution to tax, must be declared void, though the other part of the business might have been properly the subject of such a tax. As to the excise tax, the court directed the injunction to issue with respect to the imposition 'upon sales of gasoline brought from without the state into the state of New Mexico and there sold and delivered to customers in the original packages, whether tank cars, barrels, or other packages, and in the same form and condition as when received by the plaintiff in that state.' If this covered gasoline that was ordered by the purchaser before importation, it was right. If it covered gasoline, whether in original packages or not, which was sold after it reached its destination, then it is not in accord with the law as we understand it to be under the authorities we have cited. There is nothing in the case as disclosed either in the statements of facts in the Askren or the Bowman Case to show what the fact was in this regard.\n It is hardly to be supposed that the court intended in these cases to overrule or narrowly to distinguish the cases of Woodruff v. Parham, Hinson v. Lott, Brown v. Houston, Pittsburg Coal Co. v. Bates, American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, and Wagner v. City of Covington, without mentioning them, especially when we find that in Texas Co. v. Brown, \n258 \nU.S. 466, 476\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 375, 378 (66 L. Ed. 721) they are quoted approvingly and followed. That case involved the question whether an inspection law resulting in receipts greatly in excess of the cost of inspection, and construed \n\n[262 U.S. 506, 520]\n\u00a0\n by the Georgia Supreme Court to be an excise tax was valid in its application to oil shipped into Georgia from Texas and stored in Georgia for distribution and sale. It was held to be a valid tax. The case was rightly decided, and for the right reason; but in seeking to distinguish the previous cases, the opinion uses this language:\n'Appellant insists that Standard Oil Co. v. Graves, \n249 U.S. 389\n, is inconsistent with the imposition of inspection fees on a revenue basis upon goods brought from another state, however held or disposed of in Georgia. That decision, however, extended the exemption from such fees of goods brought from state to state, no further than 'while the same are in the original receptacles or containers in which they are brought into the state' (pages 394, 395), and so it was interpreted in Askren v. Continental Oil Co., \n252 U.S. 444\n, 449.'\n\n Upon full consideration and after a reargument, we can not think this extention of the exemption referred to, if intended to apply to oil sold after arrival in the state, to be justified either in reason or in previous authority, and to this extent the opinions in the cases cited are qualified.\n The cases all involved the validity of statutes providing for excessive inspection fees and the question of saving the statute as an excise law applicable to part of the sales of the oil was an incidental one. The facts upon which the line between taxable and nontaxable sales could be correctly drawn do not appear fully in any of the cases, or to have been discussed by counsel. This is what has led to a confusion as to the real distinctions and to observations in the opinions, which unless much restricted in their application constitute a departure from theretofore established principles.\n In Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 137, Mr. Justice Miller gives an illustration of the injustice which would arise if the constitutional immunity from state taxaction, as to \n\n[262 U.S. 506, 521]\n\u00a0\n imports from abroad were to be held to apply to imports from one state to another. It correctly describes the result if the interstate commerce clause were to afford the same immunity:\n'The merchant of Chicago who buys his goods in New York and sells at wholesale in the original packages, may have his millions employed in trade for half a life time and escape all state, county, and city taxes; for all that he is worth is invested in goods which he claims to be protected as imports from New York. Neither the state nor the city which protects his life and property can make him contribute a dollar to support its government, improve its thoroughfares or educate its children. The merchant in a town in Massachusetts, who deals only in wholesale, if he purchases in New York is exempt from taxation. If his neighbor purchase in Boston, he must pay all the taxes which Massachusetts levies with equal justice on the property of all its citizens.'\n\n This argument is as strong to-day as when it was written, and it would be a source of confusion and injustice, if through too broad expressions in a few opinions, a different conclusion from that to which it should carry us, were to obtain.\n The decree of the District Court is\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, concurring.\n I am unable to concur in all said to support the conclusion adopted by the court. To me the result seems out of harmony with the theory upon which recent opinions proceed. There is unfortunate confusion concerning the general subject and certainly some pronouncement that can abide is desirable.\n Apparently no great harm, and possibly some good, will follow a flat declaration that irrespective of analogies and \n\n[262 U.S. 506, 522]\n\u00a0\n for purposes of taxation we will hold interstate commerce ends when an original package reaches the consignee and comes to rest within a state, although intended for sale there in unbroken form. It may be said that th effect on interstate commerce is not substantial and too remote, notwithstanding the rather clear logic of Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, to the contrary and the much discussed theory respecting freedom of interstate commerce from interference by the states, announced and developed long after Woodruff v. Parham (1868) 8 Wall. 123. Logic and taxation are not always the best of friends. \n\n\n\n","172":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTH UTAH MINES & SMELTERS v. BEAVER COUNTY(1923)\nNo. 321\nArgued: Decided: May 21, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 325, 326]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. C. Parsons and E. O. Leatherwood, both of Salt Lake City, Utah, for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Harvey H. Cluff and Wm. A. Hilton, both of Salt Lake City, Utah, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought by the plaintiff in error (plaintiff below) against the defendant in error (defendant below) in the federal District Court for the District of Utah to recover a tax alleged to have been illegally imposed by the state taxing authorities and paid under protest. The plaintiff is a mining corporation organized and existing under the laws of Maine, and since 1909 has owned mining property in Beaver county, Utah, consisting of mining claims, a concentrating mill, now obsolete and largely dismantled, and other property incident thereto. The property was continuously operated until August, 1914. The ores were copper-bearing and upon extraction were transported to the mill and there crushed and concentrated; the resulting concentrates being shipped and sold to smelters at some distance away. As a result of the concentrating operations refuse material, still retaining small quantities of copper and other metals, was deposited near the concentrating mill as \n\n[262 U.S. 325, 327]\n\u00a0\n tailings. This deposit was begun by plaintiff's predecessor as early as May, 1903, and from then until August, 1914, approximately 900,000 tons of tailings were accumulated upon desert land owned by plaintiff, nonmineral in character, and located about three miles from its mining claims. At the time of the accumulation of these tailings there was no known process by which th small percentage of metals which they contained could be profitably recovered. In August, 1914, plaintiff stopped work on its mining claims and has never since resumed. The court below expressly found that at the date last mentioned all ores which could be profitably mined under processes then or since known had been taken out, and that plaintiff's mine, excluding the tailings, had never since been of any value; that plaintiff had never abandoned its property, but had maintained its title and paid and discharged all taxes assessed against it; and that, on January 1, 1919, the said tailings deposit was of the value of $20,000.\n In January, 1914, plaintiff made an agreement with the Utah Leasing Company for the treatment and reduction of this deposit upon a royalty of 10 per cent. The leasing company took possession of the tailings, constructed reduction works, using in connection therewith some of the plaintiff's improvements on its mining property, and, as result of its operations, recovered from the tailings in the year 1918 the net amount of $ 120,547,10 per cent. only of which was paid over to the plaintiff, under the terms of the agreement. The taxing authorities, claiming to act under the state constitution and laws, multiplied the amount thus recovered by 3 and fixed the value of plaintiff's mining property for the year 1919 for taxing purposes at the multiple thereof, viz. $361,641. The defendant thereupon assessed and collected from plaintiff $6,907.24 as a tax against plaintiff's \n\n[262 U.S. 325, 328]\n\u00a0\n mining property for the year 1919, based upon a valuation computed in the manner just stated.\n The Constitution of Utah declares (sections 2 and 3, article 13) that all property in the state shall be taxed in proportion to its value, and requires the Legislature to provide a uniform and equal rate of assessment and taxation of all property according to its value in money, and prescribe such regulations as shall secure a just valuation for the taxation of all property, so that every person and corporation shall pay a tax in proportion to such value. By an amendment to section 4, article 13, adopted in 1918, it is provided that all metalliferous mines or mining claims, in addition to an arbitrary valuation of $5 per acre, shall be assessed 'at a value based on some multiple or submultiple of the net annual proceeds thereof. All other mines or mining claims and other valuable mineral deposits, including lands containing coal or hydrocarbons, shall be assessed at their full value.'\n The Legislature, at its session in 1919, enacted a statute in pursuance of this constitutional provision, providing that metalliferous mines or mining claims shall be assessed, in addition to the $5 per acre, upon a value to be determined by taking the multiple of three times the net annual proceeds thereof. Other mines and valuable mineral deposits are to be assessed at their full value. The words 'net annual proceeds' are defined to be the net proceeds realized during the preceding calendar year from the sale, or conversion into money or its equivalent, of all ores extracted by the owner, lessee, contractor or other person working upon or operating the property during or previous to the year for which the assessment is made, including all dumps and taillings, after making certain deductions. Session Laws 1919, c. 114,  5864\n\n\n Upon the facts stated and under these constitutional and statutory provisions, the lower court upheld the validity of the tax. \n\n[262 U.S. 325, 329]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff contended in the court below that the tailings deposit was neither a mine nor a part of a mine, but a thing separate and apart from its mining claims, constituting a 'valuable mineral deposit' and taxable as such upon the value and not a multiple thereof; that the agreement with the leasing company was a sale of the deposit, which thereupon ceased to be assessable as its property, or the basis for assessment of its worked out and worthless mine; that since 1914 its mining claims, having become valueless and yielding no net proceeds, were not taxable; that the tax assessed was therefore in contravention of section 3, article 13, of the Constitution of Utah, requiring a uniform and equal rate of assessment of property according to its value in money, so that every person and corporation should pay a tax in proportion to such value; and also was in contravention of the clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in respect of due process and equal protection of the laws. The court below denied these contentions and sustained the tax and the case comes here for review upon writ of error.\n The defendant has submitted a motion to dismiss the writ of error and of this we first dispose. The ground of the motion is that the case was tried by the court without a jury; that no exceptions were taken during the trial and no request for special findings or a declaration of law made during the progress of the trial; that the court gave its decision and a general finding orally and directed judgment for the defendant, which was duly entered; that nearly three months later, on motion of plaintiff, and against defendant's objection, the court made and filed special findings of fact. The defendant challenges the power of the court to make these special findings and insists that they should be disregarded, in which event nothing substantial would be left for review.\n All of the proceedings, including the special findings, happened at the same term. The rule is that during the \n\n[262 U.S. 325, 330]\n\u00a0\n term the record is 'in the breast of the court' and may be altered during that time in its discretion as justice may require. Goddard v. Ordway, \n101 U.S. 745\n, 752; Ayres v. Wiswall, \n112 \nU.S. 187, 190\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 90; Does et al. v. Tyack et al., 14 How. 297, 312; Barrell v. Tilton, \n119 \nU.S. 637, 643\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 332; Basset v. United States, 9 Wall 38, 41.\n That rule is applicable here and the motion to dismiss is accordingly denied.\n That state constitution plainly contemplates that all property irrespective of its character, shall be taxed 'according to its value in money.' The provision with reference to the taxation of metalliferous mines does not mean to depart from this rule, but recognizes that their value cannot be determined in the ordinary way, since the ores which constitute the wealth of such property are hidden in the earth and, as a general thing, disclosure of their extent and character must await extraction. The Constitution, therefore, provides, not for disregarding value in the assessment of taxes upon mines, but for arriving at it in a special manner-that is, by a measurement proportioned to the net annual proceeds derived from the property. The value of property bears a relation to the income which it affords. If it be property whose production is uniform and of indefinite duration the capitalization of the net income derived from it at the going rate of interest, in the absence of a more certain method, will furnish a reasonable measure of the value. The life of a mine, however, is limited. The extraction of ores from year to year constitutes a constant drain upon the capital, which, in course of time, will be exhausted. It follows that a given multiple of the net annual proceeds which may be a fair measure of value in the early part of a mine's development, will become excessive as the stage of exhaustion approaches. The constitutional provision, therefore, at best, will produce only approximate equality. Undoubtedly in fixing the multiple of \n\n[262 U.S. 325, 331]\n\u00a0\n the net annual proceeds upon which the value of metalliferous mines is to be calculated a good deal of latitude must be allowed the Legislature and the taxing authorities, but the power is not unbounded. Without attempting to delimit the boundaries-a matter primarily for the state courts-it is sufficient for present purposes to say that in our opinion they have been clearly exceeded in the instant case. The net proceeds here involved arose from a lot of refuse material, which, long prior to the imposition of the tax, had been severed from the mining claims, removed to a distance, submitted to the process of reduction and stored upon lands separate and apart from the claims. Moreover, but one-tenth of the amount of these net proceeds was realized by the owner of the mining claims. To treble the total of these proceeds for the purpose of basing thereon an altogether fictitious value for a mine worked out and worthless years before the adoption of the statutory provisions supposed to confer the authority to do so, results in such flagrant and palpable injustice as would cast the most serious doubt upon the constitutionality of such provisions if thus construed. See Dane v. Jackson, \n256 \nU.S. 589, 598\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 566; Henderson Bridge Co. v. Henderson City, \n173 U.S. 592\n, 614-615, 19 Sup. Ct. 553. These statutory provisions, so far as we are informed, have not received the consideration of the state courts, and we will not assume in advance of such consideration, that they will be so construed as to produce that result. See Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 531, 546\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 359; Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Cade, \n233 \nU.S. 642, 650\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 678. Clearly they are susceptible of a construction which will preclude their application to the case now under consideration and, as that construction will resolve all doubt in favor of their constitutionality, it is our duty to adopt it. Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 U.S. 546\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 359; St. Louis Southwestern Ry. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 369\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 99; Arkansas Natural Gas Co. v. Arkansas Railroad Commission, \n261 U.S. 379\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 387, 67 L. Ed. --, decided March 19, 1923. \n\n[262 U.S. 325, 332]\n\u00a0\n The rule prescribed for the valuation of metalliferous mines, as we have already indicated, is one of necessity, and should not be extended to cases clearly not within the reason of the rule. The tailings, severed and removed from the mining claims, changed in character, placed on other and separate lands and having an ascertained and adjudicated value of their own, in our opinion, constituted a unit of property entirely apart from the mine from which they had been taken. See Forbes v. Gracey, \n94 U.S. 762\n, 765. We think the agreement with the leasing company was not a sale of these tailings, but that the ownership, pending the process of reduction, remained in plaintiff. The plaintiff, therefore, was subject to taxation upon their value, but not as a mine, since that implies something capable of being mined which this loose and homogeneous deposit obviously was not.\n While the taxing authorities cannot be held to an inflexible rule of equality, even in respect of properties in the same classification where their nature is such as to practically preclude the application of such a rule, it does not follow that all distinctions are to be ignored and indubitably dissimilar and readily distinguishable things treated as though they were the same. It may well be that the taxable value of mines differing in extent of development or in degree of exhaustion and relatively of different actual values, must, from the practical necessities of the case, be subjected to the same rule of measurement, although it may work inequality to some extent. But the difference between a mine from which ore is still being or still may be extracted and net income derived, and one conceded to be an empty shell, with no present or prospective value whatsoever, is so obvious that the imposition of a tax upon the basis of their being, nevertheless, one and the same cannot be sustained with due regard for either law or logic.\n How far the state statute defining the net annual proceeds to be considered in measuring the value of a mine, \n\n[262 U.S. 325, 333]\n\u00a0\n properly includes those derived from dumps and tailings placed and remaining upon the mining claims or connec ed with a going mine, we do not determine; but we do hold that the proceeds from the tailings in question, under the facts here disclosed, are not included within its terms. The court below should have so construed the statute and rendered judgment for the plaintiff. See Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n154 U.S. 362\n, 390- 391, 14 Sup. Ct. 1047; Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 507\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88. This disposition of the case makes it unnecessary to adjudicate the questions raised under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","173":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN R.

Each is an appeal from a decree entered by a federal District Court for North Carolina under section 266 of the Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1243) denying an interlocutory injunction. In each a railroad company engaged in interstate commerce seeks to enjoin the taxing officials from collecting the ad valorem property taxes for the year 1921, imposed for local purposes, and the franchise tax imposed for state purposes. Some of the corporations plaintiff are foreign; some, domestic. One has its lines wholly within the state; four have lines also in other states. But these differences are without legal significance in this connection. The property taxes are assailed on the ground that, as assessed, they vioate the equal protection clause, the due process clause, and the commerce clause of the federal Constitution, the uniformity provision of the state Constitution, and the statutory method of valuation. The franchise taxes are assailed on \n\n[260 U.S. 519, 522]\n\u00a0\n the ground that the statute under which they are laid violates the commerce clause, the equal protection clause, and the due process clause of the federal Constitution, as well as the uniformity clause of the state Constitution; that the amounts of these taxes were illegally calculated, in violation of the statutes of the state; and that since they are fixed by a percentage of the ad valorem valuations, they must fall because those valuations were illegally made.\n Many of the objections made raise questions as to the meaning and effect of recent statutes of the state which have not yet been construed by its courts; and we are reluctant to pass upon these questions. Some of the objections raise issues of fact on which the evidence is submitted by affidavit and is in certain respects conflicting. But in all the cases jurisdiction rests upon substantial federal questions. The objections to the validity of the legislation and of the assessments, whether arising out of the federal Constitution or out of the Constitution or statutes of the state, may be presented in a single suit. We must, therefore, determine state, as well as federal, questions. Michigan Central Railroad Co. v. Powers, \n201 \nU.S. 245, 291\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 459; Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 508\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88; Davis v. Wallace, \n257 U.S. 478\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 164. All the objections urged have been considered. We are of opinion that none of them should be sustained. The more important ones will be discussed.\n The controversy arose in this way. \n1\n By the Constitution of North Carolina taxation of real and personal property must be uniform and ad valorem 'according to \n\n[260 U.S. 519, 523]\n\u00a0\n its true value in money.' In the assessments made prior to 1920 nearly all classes of property had been grossly undervalued; but the undervaluation varied greatly in degree. The Revaluation Act of 1919 (Public Laws 1919, chapter 84) was passed in order to provide for new and fundamentally changed valuations of all property at full values. The valuation of real estate was to be made by county officials; that of railroad property by state board under an application of the unit rule; and the assessment so made was to be allocated by the state board to the counties on a mileage basis. \n2\n By that act the valuations made by these taxing boards were to become effective as assessments only upon approval by the Legislature. When so approved, they were to be the basis of the taxation for the years 1920 to 1923 inclusive. Revaluations of real estate and of railroa  were made under that act and were approved by the Legislature in August, 1920. Public Laws 1920, chapter 1. Through these revaluations the assessments of railroad property were, on the average, doubled, as compared with the assessments prevailing in 1919,3 and \n\n[260 U.S. 519, 524]\n\u00a0\n those of real estate were quadrupled. The aggregate assessment of all the railroad properties as revalued in 1920 was $250,587,158; the aggregate of the real estate, $2,006,124,997; that of the personal property, $807,866, 443; and that of industrial and financial institutions $444,748,145.\n The relatively larger increase in the revaluations of real estate and of other property resulted in railroad taxes for 1920 lower than had prevailed theretofore, and these taxes were duly paid. But widespread objection to continuing the 1920 revaluations as a basis for the taxation of real estate developed in the latter part of 1920. A severe depression in business had occurred; there was an abrupt decline in commodity prices, particularly farm products, and real estate values were affected by this decline. The Legislature, thereupon, made provision (Public Laws 1921, c. 38,  28) under which, upon application of taxpayers, the 1920 revaluations of real estate could be reviewed by county boards and those of railroad property by the state board. These boards were authorized to make corrections wherever assessments were found to exceed existing values. By proceedings under act of 1921 reductions were made in 67 counties, varying from 1 to 50 per cent. in the valuations of real estate (including that belonging to the railroads not used in the transportation service). In 33 counties no reduction in the valuations of real estate was allowed. The Legislature of 1921 had made no provision for reviewing the revaluations of personal property; and the assessments thereon remained unchanged, although the valuations of personalty had also been greatly increased in 1920. Under the Transportation Act of 1920, the Interstate Commerce Commission issued, in the latter part of 1920, orders pursuant to Ex parte 74, Increased Rates, 58 Interst. Com. Com'n. R. 220, raising freight rates in North Carolina 25 per cent. and passenger rates 20 per cent. over those prevailing when the revaluation of 1920 \n\n[260 U.S. 519, 525]\n\u00a0\n was made. Thereafter the five railroads applied to the state board for reduction of their valuations as the basis for taxation in 1921 and subsequent years. The application of the Norfolk & Southern was granted in part; and its assessment was reduced from $27,023,462 to $22,840,932. But, after due hearing, and rehearings, the state board refused to modify the assessments of the other four railroads which had been fixed by the Legislature of 1920. Thereupon these suits were begun.\n The contention of the railroads that the property taxes as assessed are obnoxious to the federal Constitution was rested here mainly on the claim that there is a denial of equal protection of the laws. This claim is asserted on several grounds. It is contended, in the first place, that the act of 1921 providing for the review of valuations is void. The argument is that the railroads were discriminated against, because real estate owners are given an appeal on assessments from the county board to the state board of equalization, but that no such appeal is provided from the assessment of railroads. It is also argued that there is discrimination in this: While chapter 38,  28g, provides for reduction by the state board in the valuation of a railroad only where it applies therefor, reductions in the value of all real estate within the county were, under section 28a, to be made provisionally, if the county board determined that the 1920 valuation was, as a whole, in excess of a fair value, and that in such event the percentage of the average excess would be applied to each parcel in the county, unless and until the assessment of individual real estate owners should be revised by the state tax commission. The differences in the classes of property, and in the conditions of ownership, obviously made difference in treatment unavoidable. Differences in the machinery for assessment or equalization do not constitute a denial of equal protection of the laws. New York v. Barker, \n179 U.S. 279\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 121. \n\n[260 U.S. 519, 526]\n\u00a0\n The claim that plaintiffs have been denied equal protection of the laws appears to rest more largely on the charge that discrimination has been practiced against them in administering the tax laws. It is urged that county boards, proceeding under section 28a, of the act of 1921, reduced real estate valuations quite generally, but that the state board, acting under section 28g, refused to reduce the valuation of any railroad except that of the Norfolk & Southern. The rule is well settled that a taxpayer, although assessed on not more than full value, may be unlawfully discriminated against by undervaluation of property of the same class belonging to others. Raymond v. Chicago Traction Co., \n207 U.S. 20\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 7, 12 Ann. Cas. 757. This may be true, although the discrimination is practiced through the action of different officials. Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. R. Co., \n244 U.S. 499\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88. But, unless it is shown that the undervaluation was intentional and systematic, unequal assessment will not be held to vioate the equality clause. Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Wakefield, \n247 \nU.S. 350, 353\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 495; Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Ry. Co. v. Babcock, \n204 U.S. 585\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 326; Coulter v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., \n196 U.S. 599\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 342; Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota County, \n260 U.S. 441\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 190, 67 L. Ed. --, decided this day. Plaintiffs have clearly failed to establish that there was intentional and systematic undervaluation by the county boards. Strong evidence to the contrary is furnished by the fact that in 33 counties, including those in which the largest cities are located, no reduction was made in the valuation of real estate and that in the remaining 67 counties the reduction varied from 1 to 50 per cent. Plaintiffs have failed, likewise, in showing systematic refusal on the part of the state board to allow a proper reduction in the valuation of any railroad. The further contention that by reduction of the Norfolk & Southern's assessment the other plaintiffs were discriminated against is also unfounded. \n\n[260 U.S. 519, 527]\n\u00a0\n The claims that the assessments made by the Legislature in 1920 violate the due process and commerce clauses of the federal Constitution and the true value and uniformity clauses of the state Constitution, rest largely upon the contentions that the valuations were made on wrong principles and are excessive. There was ample opportunity to be heard; and the opportunity was availed of. There is no suggestion of bad faith. At the most there have been errors of judgment; and mere errors of judgment are not subject to review in these proceedings. Pittsburg, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Backus, \n154 U.S. 421\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 1114; Brooklyn City R. R. Co. v. State Board of Tax Com'rs, \n199 \nU.S. 48, 52\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 713.\n There was no taxation of interstate commerce. Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, \n155 U.S. 688\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 268; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Taggart, \n163 U.S. 1\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 1054. There is not shown any taxation of property without the state as in Wallace v. Hines, \n253 U.S. 66\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 435. Because these several constitutional objections are, in our opinion, unfounded, we do not deem it necessary to consider the contention of defendants that there was open to plaintiffs the opportunity of reviewing the assessments in the state courts by writ of certiorari, and that, unless and until such remedy had been exhausted, there was no right to seek relief by these bills in equity, See Keokuk & Hamilton Bridge Co. v. Salm, \n25 \nU.S. 122, 125\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 207.\n The claim that the railroads' property taxes are void under the statutes of the state seems to rest, in the main, on the charge that in valuing them in 1920, and in passing upon the application for reduction under the act of 1921, the state board failed to follow the method of valuation prescribed. It is argued, among other things, that there was no separate assessment of tangible and intangible property, or, if so, that plaintiffs were not notified as to what that separation was; that there was no due consideration of the actual cost of replacement of the property, with just allowance for depreciation of rolling stock; that \n\n[260 U.S. 519, 528]\n\u00a0\n the franchise or intangible value was not assessed by a due consideration of the gross earnings as compared with operating expenses, or of the market value of the stocks and bonds; that the particular method prescribed by the statutes for assessing interstate roads was not followed; and that erroneous methods of valuation were adopted. To these contentions there appear to be several answers. The Revaluation Act did not make mandatory any particular method of valuation. The Legislature recognized that the difficulties inherent in valuing a railroad are great. It desired that the valuers should have access to every fact which might aid them in performing their duty. The data concerning the railroads referred to in the act, like the methods of valuation referred to in earlier and later legislation, are among those commonly used when an attempts is made to ascertain the value of a railroad. But they are merely aids. Such data are commonly in the possession of the railroad companies; and are often not readily accessible to others. The Legislature, by the Revaluation Act authorized the state board to require the railroads to furnish the information. But it did not undertake to prescribe to what extent or how the information should be used by them. Their duty was merely to exercise an informed and honest judgment in fixing values for purposes of taxation. Compare Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 434\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18.\n Another answer to plaintiffs' contention is that mere failure to follow methods of valuation referred to in earlier statutes could not, in any event, render illegal the revaluation made by the state board in 1920; since it was, by the Revaluation Act, made tentative merely. That tentative valuation became an assessment by the Legislature, and, hence the law, through approval by chapter 1, Laws Extra Session 1920, which made it the assessment for the next four years. The state board, when applied to in 1921, had power to reduce the statutory assessment; but in acting on the applications it was not, \n\n[260 U.S. 519, 529]\n\u00a0\n as we read the statutes, required to make a new valuation, or to apply any particular method of valuation. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The railroad franchise tax, equal to one-tenth of 1 per cent. of the value of the company's property within the state, is imposed wholly for the support of the state government. Such taxes are expressly quthorized by the state Constitution. Article 5. Before 1920 the contribution of railroads toward the expenses of the state government was made partly by a small privilege tax, dependent on gross earnings per mile, partly from a percentage of the ad valorem property tax paid by them, and in valuing railroad property there was included among the intangibles what is frequently called the franchise or the corporate excess. In 1920 this mileage privilege tax was abolished; payment for general state purposes of a percentage of the property tax was discontinued; and by section 82(6 1\/2) of chapter 1, Laws Extra Session 1920, and Revenue Act \n\n[260 U.S. 519, 530]\n\u00a0\n of 1921, c. 34, the so-called franchise tax here in question was imposed. It is argued that this franchise tax is an additional property tax which is not imposed on others, and that, consequently, it violates the uniformity clause of the st te Constitution and the equal protection clause of the federal Constitution. It is true that the franchise tax is measured by the value of property already subjected to the ad valorem tax. But a privilege tax is not converted into a property tax because it is measured by the value of property (compare Clark v. Titusville, \n184 \nU.S. 329, 333\n, 334 S., 22 Sup. Ct. 382); nor by the fact that in this measure is included property not used in the transportation service. Railroads differ in so many respects from other properties that they may, as a class, be taxed differently or additionally, if that it not inconsistent with the Constitution of the state.\n Nor is there any basis for the claim that the Franchise Tax Act violates the commerce clause. The tax appears to be upon the privilege of doing an intrastate business. Compare Armour Packing Co. v. Lacy, \n200 U.S. 226\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 232. It is not of the character which is held a burden upon interstate commerce. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 U.S. 350\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 99; Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113, 119\n, 120 S., 41 Sup. Ct. 45; St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. Co. v. Middlekamp, \n256 U.S. 226\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 489. Payment of the tax is not made a condition precedent to granting a railroad permission to do interstate business. Compare Leloup v. Mobile, \n127 U.S. 640\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 1380; Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113, 119\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 45. And there is no basis for the contention that the aggregate burden imposed by the property tax, the franchise tax, and the income tax, operates to obstruct interstate commerce.\n The remaining objections to the franchise taxes relate merely to the amounts at which they are calculated. It is insisted that section 82 (3 1\/2) of the Revenue Act of 1921 applies, and that therefore upon the facts stated the tax should be for one-twentieth, not for one-tenth, of 1 per cent. of the value of the company's property within \n\n[260 U.S. 519, 531]\n\u00a0\n the state. The Norfolk & Southern, insisting likewise that the section applies, argues that the taxes assessed upon others thereunder would be only one-half the percentage it is required to pay, and therefore contends that the act denies to it equal protection of the laws. Upon this question of statutory construction the courts of the state have not yet passed. The taxing officials insist that section 82(3 1\/2) has no application to railroads, and in support of their contention point to the history of the legislation. We think that they are right.\n A further objection peculiar to the Atlantic & Yadkin Railway should be mentioned. This road is located wholly within North Carolina. Its entire capital stock is owned by the Southern, and it is operated as a part of the Southern System. The state board assessed all the lines operated by the Southern System at $101,960,413, and then apportioned to the Atlantic & Yadkin the sum of $4,104,710, a sum alleged to be grossly excessive. Defendants aver that the amount represents the actual value of the property. They say, further, that the apportionment was made in accordance with the plan suggested by the tax commissioner of the Southern System; that neither the Southern Railway nor the Atlantic & Yadkin was, in any way, prejudiced by assessing the property together, or by allocating this amount to the latter; that if the Atlantic & Yadkin was overassessed, the Southern was, to that extent, underassessed; and that the company is estopped by its conduct from questioning the assessment on this ground. A doubt is raised whether the taxes assessed upon this plaintiff should be sustained. But even if the objection can be availed of in this suit, the state of the record is not such as to justify us in reversing, on this ground, the decree denying an interlocutory injunction to the Atlantic & Yadkin. It will, of course, be open to this plaintiff to renew the objection upon the final hearing.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Co stitution of North Carolina, articles 5 and 7; Laws of North Carolina 1919, c. 90 (Revenue Act) particularly sections 3, 76, 77, 78 and 82; chapter 84 (Revaluation Act) particularly sections 1, 3, 4, 7, 25, 26 and 31; Laws of North Carolina 1920, c. 1, adopting revaluation, particularly sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7a, 7b, 7d, and 82(6 1\/2); Laws of North Carolina 1921, c. 34 (Revenue Act) particularly sections 1, 2, 3, 26, 76, 77, 79, 79a, 80, 81, 82, 82(1), 82(2), 82(3), 82(3 1\/2), 82(4), 82(6), 82(6 1\/2), 82(7), 82(8), 82(9), 82(10), 82(11), 82(12), 82(13), 82(15), 82( 16), 82(17) and 82(18); chapter 38 (Machinery Act) particularly sections 28a, 28b, 28c, 28d, 28e, 28f, 28g, 61, 62, 62a, 63, 64 and 65; chapter 40 ( transferring powers of state tax commission to state department of revenue )  1, 2 and 3; Act of Special Session December, 1921 (Pub.

In 1921 the powers of the State Tax Commission were transferred to the Department of Revenue under a commissioner of revenue. In this opinion 'state board' is used throughout to refer to state authorities, as distinguished from county boards, which assessed local real estate. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] The increases were: Southern Railway, $46,869,942 to $96,605,694; Atlantic & Yadkin Railway, $1,975,806 to $4,104,710; Seaboard Railway, $20, 191,720 to $34,768,440; Atlantic Coast Line Railway, $34,645,345 to $50, 867,800. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The following statutory provisions show that no assessment was made by the state tax commission in 1920 or 1921, or by the commissioner of revenue in 1921, but that the assessment was made by the Legislature in 1920. The only power of the commissioner of revenue in 1921 was to make reductions in certain cases.\n Revaluation Act (Public Laws 1919, c. 84)  6, provided that all real property should be valued as of May 1, 1919, and such value should be used for all tax purposes for 1920, 1921, 1922, and 1923. Section 31 provided for a complete revaluation of all railroad companies to be used as the basis for computing taxes for such companies for 1920, 1921, 1922 and 1923. Section 3 provided that the assessment made under said act was not to be used as a basis for computation of taxes until it had been approved by the Legislature.\n Acts of Special Session 1920, c. 1,  1, approved the 'assessment or valuation' made under Revaluation Act of 1919 and adopted it as the basis for levy of tax rates by the state and all subdivisions thereof for 1920 and the valuation of real property so fixed was adopted for 1921, 1922 and 1923, 'except as such valuations may be hereafter changed according to law.'\n Machinery Act (Public Laws, 1921, c. 38)  64, provided for the valuation of railroads (laying down rules therefor) 'at such dates as real estate is required to be assessed for taxation.' \n\n\n\n\n","174":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHWESTERN BELL TEL.

That order undertook to reduce rates for exchange service and to abolish the installation and moving charges theretofore demanded by plaintiff in error. It is challenged as confiscatory and in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment.\n During the period of federal control-August 1, 1918, to August 1, 1919-the Postmaster General advanced the rates for telephone service and prescribed a schedule of charges for installing and moving instruments. The Act of Congress approved July 11, 1919-41 Stat. 157-directed that the lines be returned to their owners at midnight July 31, 1919, and further--\n'that the existing toll and exchange telephone rates as established or approved by the Postmaster General on or prior to June 6, 1919, shall continue in force for a period not to exceed four months after this act takes effect, unless sooner modified or changed by the public authorities-state, municipal, or otherwise-having control or jurisdiction of tolls, charges, and rates or by contract or by voluntary reduction.' Section 1.\n\n August 4, 1919, the commission directed plaintiff in error to show why exchange service rates and charges for installation and moving as fixed by the Postmaster General should be continued. After a hearing, it made an elaborate report and directed that the service rates should be reduced and the charges discontinued.\n The company produced voluminous evidence, including its books, to establish the value of its property dedicated to public use. The books showed that the actual cost of 'total plant, supplies, equipment, and working capital' amounted to $22,888,943. Its engineers estimated the reproduction cost new as of June 30, 1919, thus: Physical telephone property, $28,454,488; working capital, $1,051,564; establishing business, $ 5,594,816; total $35,100,868. They also estimated existing values \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 283]\n\u00a0\n (after allowing depreciation) upon the same date: Physical telephone property, $24,709,295; working capital, $1,051,564; establishing business, $ 5,594,816; total, $31,355,675.\n The only evidence offered in opposition to values claimed by the company were appraisals of its property at St. Louis, Caruthersville, and Springfield, respectively, as of December, 1913, February, 1914, and September, 1916, prepared by the commission's engineers and accountants, together with statements showing actual costs of additions subsequent to those dates.\n Omitting a paragraph relative to an unimportant reduction-$17,513.52- from working capital account, that part of the commission's report which deals with property values follows:\n The company offered in evidence exhibits showing the value of its property in the entire state (outside the cities of Kansas City and Independence, whose rates are not involved in this case), and also at 46 of its local exchanges in the state. It shows by such exhibits that the value of the property in the entire state (and when speaking of the property in the state in this report we mean exclusive of Kansas City and Independence) is as follows: Reproduction cost new, $ 35,100,471; reproduction cost new, less depreciation, $31,355,278; and cost as per books, $22,888,943. It also shows the company's estimate of reproduction cost new, less depreciation, and the prorated book cost, at each of the 46 local exchanges mentioned.\n The engineers of this commission have made a detailed inventory and appraisal, and this commission has formally valued the company's property at only three of its exchanges, viz.: At the city of Caruthersville, reported in Re Southwestern Tel. & Tel. Company, 2 Mo. P. S. C. 492; at the city of St. Louis in cases No. 234 and No. 235, as yet unreported; and at the city of Springfield reported \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 284]\n\u00a0\n in Re Missouri and Kansas Telephone Company, 6 Mo. P. S. C. 279-and as a result we have only the estimates and appraisals of the company before us in relation to the value of the property at the other exchanges. We think it is clear, however, from the data at hand, that the values placed by the company upon the property are excessive, and not a just basis for rate-making.\n The values fixed by this commission at Caruthersville, St. Louis, and Springfield in the cases above entioned aggregate $11,003,898, while the company estimates the aggregate cost of reproduction new of these plants in this case at $18,971,011. The ratio of the latter figure is 172.4 per cent. This percentage, divided into $35,100,471, the company's estimate of the aggregate cost of the reproduction new of its property in Missouri in this case, equals $20,350,000, which might be said to be one measure of the value of the property.\n Again, the company's estimate of the aggregate cost of reproduction new, less depreciation, of its properties at Caruthersville, St. Louis, and Springfield, in this case is $16,913,673. The ratio of this figure to the aggregate value fixed by the commission at these exchanges, plus additions reported by the company, is 153.7 per cent. This percentage divided into $31,355,278, the company's estimate of the aggregate cost of reproduction new, less depreciation, of its property in Missouri in this case, equals $20,400,000, which may be said to be another measure of the value of the property.\n The company also shows by Exhibits 19 and 212 that its return under the Postmaster General's rates on $22,888,942, the book value of its property in the state, is at the rate of 11.65 per cent. per annum for depreciation and return on the investment, which would yield the company 6 per cent. for depreciation and 5.65 per cent. for return on the book cost of the property. As stated, however, we do not think that the book cost or the \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 285]\n\u00a0\n 'prorated book cost' of the property as claimed by the company would be a fair basis for rate making.\n As we understand it, the 'prorated book cost' given in evidence by the company for the various exchanges is simply the percentage relation of reproduction cost new, which the original cost of all property bears to reproduction cost new of all property and in individual instances the actual cost might vary greatly, either up or down, from what an appraisal would show. If the company, to eliminate competition, paid a price in excess of the value or because of discouraged local operation were enabled to purchase a plant far below its actual value, the 'prorated book cost' basis would not reflect anything like the original cost.\n We also think that the figure of $22,888,943, claimed by the company to represent the book cost or original of the property cost in the state, is subject to certain adjustments with reference to the amount of nonuseful property included, working capital, and the amounts to be deducted account extinguished value recouped from patrons by charges to depreciation.\n In the St. Louis Case, supra, the original cost of the nonuseful property deducted and disallowed by the commission amounted to $454, 689.16. It appears from the company's Exhibit 256 that the 'prorated book cost' of the St. Louis exchange is just about half of that given for the state. However, it is clear that the proportion of nonused and nonuseful property in St. Louis bears a much larger percentage relation to useful property than would obtain throughout the state. It would appear that estimating the company's property not used and useful for the entire state at $500,000 would be a fair approximation. This sum at least should be deducted. ...\n The depreciation reserve applicable to the Missouri property is not shown by the company. However, on the \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 286]\n\u00a0\n the Company's Exhibit 15, the balance sheet as of June 30, 1919, of the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company (Missouri corporation), operating in Missouri, Kansas, and Arkansas, the reserve for accrued depreciation and reserve for amortization of intangibles is given as $ 7,963,082.37. The same exhibit shows the original cost of fixed capital for Missouri, Kansas, and Arkansas property as $46,061,162.76. The total fixed capital of the Missouri property shown on the Company's Exhibit 19 is $21,837,759, which is 47.4 per cent. of $46, 061,162.76 and 47.4 per cent. of the reserve for depreciation. $7,963, 082.37 equals $3,774,501 or the portion assignable to the Missouri property.\n Adjusting in accordance with the above, we have: Total plant and equipment, including working capital, as per Company's Exhibit No. 19 , $22,888,943; deduct property not used or useful, $500,000.00; deduct excess working capital, $17,513.52; deduct depreciation reserve, $3,774,501.00; [total to be deducted] $4,292,014.52. [Net total] $18,596.928.48; add for intangibles, 10 per cent., $1,859,692. 85; total adjusted original cost, $20,456,621.33.\n After carefully considering all the evidence as to values before us in this case, we are of the opinion that the value of the company's property in the state, exclusive of Kansas City and Independence, devoted to exchange service, will not exceed the sum of $20,400,000, and we will tentatively adopt this sum as the value of the property for the purposes of this case. As stated, supra, this commission has formally valued only a part of this property, and we should not be understood as authoritatively fixing the value of the property at this time.\n The three earlier valuations to which the commission referred are: St. Louis, December, 1913, $8,500,000; Caruthersville, February, 1914, $25,000; Springfield, September, \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 287]\n\u00a0\n 1916, $815,000; total, $9,340,000. Between those dates and June 30, 1919, additions were made to these properties, which cost, respectively, $1,623, 765, $5,992, and $34,141. Adding these to the original valuations gives $ 11,003,898, the base sum used by the commission for the estimates now under consideration.\n Obviously, the commission undertook to value the property without according any weight to the greatly enhanced costs of material, labor, supplies, etc., over those prevailing in 1913, 1914, and 1916. As matter of common knowledge, these increases were large. Competent witnesses estimated them as 45 to 50 per centum.\n In Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n212 \nU.S. 19, 41\n, 52 S., 29 Sup. Ct. 192, 195, 200 (53 L. Ed. 382, 48 L. R. A. [N. S.] 1134, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034), this court said:\n There must be a fair return upon the reasonable value of the property at the time it is being used for the public. ... And we concur with the court below in holding that the value of the property is to be determined as of the time when the inquiry is made regarding the rates. If the property, which legally enters into the consideration of the question of rates, has increased in value since it was acquired, the company is entitled to the benefit of such increase.\n In the Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 454\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 729, 762 ( 57 L. Ed. 1511, 48 L. R. A. [N. S.] 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18), this was said:\n The making of a just return for the use of the property involves the recognition of its fair value, if it be more than its cost. The property is held in private ownership, and it is that property, and not the original cost of it, of which the owner may not be deprived without due process of law.\n See, also, Denver v. Denver Union Water Co., \n246 \nU.S. 178, 191\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 278, Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co. of New York, \n258 U.S. 165\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 264 (March 6, 1922), and Galveston Electric Co. v. City of Galveston, \n258 U.S. 388\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 351 (April 10, 1922).\n It is impossible to ascertain what will amount to a fair return upon properties devoted to public service, without \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 288]\n\u00a0\n giving consideration to the cost of labor, supplies, etc., at the time the investigation is made. An honest and intelligent forecast of probable future values, made upon a view of all the relevant circumstances, is essential. If the highly important element of present costs is wholly disregarded, such a forecast becomes impossible. Estimates for to-morrow cannot ignore prices of to-day.\n Witnesses for the company asserted-and there was no substantial evidence to the contrary-that, excluding cost of establishing the business, the property was worth at least 25 per cent. more than the commission's estimates, and we think the proof shows that, for the purposes of the present case, the valuati n should be at least $25,000,000.\n After disallowing an actual expenditure of $174,048.60 for rentals and services by the American Telephone & Telegraph Company and some other items not presently important, the commission estimated the annual net profits on operations available for depreciation and retrun as $2,828,617. 60-approximately 11 1\/3 per cent. of $25,000,000. That 6 per cent. should be allowed for depreciation appears to be accepted by the commission. Deducting this would leave a possible 5 1\/3 per cent. return upon the minimum value of the property, which is wholly inadequate, considering the character of the investment and interest rates then prevailing.\n The important item of expense disallowed by the commission-$174,048. 60-is 55 per cent. of the 4 1\/2 per cent. of gross revenues paid by plaintiff in error to the American Telephone & Telegraph Company as rents for receivers, transmitters, induction coils, etc., and for licenses and services under the customary form of contract between the latter company and its subsidiaries. Four and one-half per cent. is the ordinary charge paid voluntarily by local companies of the general system. There is nothing to indicate bad faith. So far as appears, plaintiff in error's board of directors has exercised a proper discretion about this matter \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 289]\n\u00a0\n requiring business judgment. It must never be forgotten that, while the state may regulate with a view to enforcing reasonable rates and charges, it is not the owner of the property of public utility companies, and is not clothed with the general power of management incident to ownership. The applicable general rule is well expressed in States Public Utilities Commission ex rel. Springfield v. Springfield Gas & Electric Co., 291 Ill. 209, 234, 125 N. E. 891, 901:\n'The commission is not the financial manager of the corporation, and it is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the directors of the corporation; nor can it ignore items charged by the utility as operating expenses, unless there is an abuse of discretion in that regard by the corporate officers.'\n\n See Interstate Commerce Commission v. Chicago Great Western Railway Co., \n209 U.S. 108\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 493; Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad Co. v. Wisconsin, \n238 U.S. 491\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 869, L. R. A. 1916A, 1133; People ex rel. v. Stevens, 197 N. Y. 1, 90 N. E. 60.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, with whom Mr. Justice HOLMES concurs.\n I concur in the judgment of reversal. But I do so on the ground that the order of the state commission prevents the utility from earning a fair return on the amount prudently invested1 in it. Thus, I differ fundamentally from my brethern concerning the rule to be applied in determining whether a prescribed rate is confiscatory. The court, adhering to the so-called rule of Smyth v. Ames, \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 290]\n\u00a0\n \n169 U.S. 466\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 418, and further defining it, declares that what is termed value must be ascertained by giving weight, among other things, to estimates of what it would cost to reproduce the property at the time of the rate hearing.\n The so-called rule of Smyth v. Ames is, in my opinion, legally and economically unsound. The thing devoted by the investor to the public use is not specific property, tangible and intangible, but capital embarked in the enterprise. Upon the capital so invested the federal Constitution guarantees to the utility the opportunity to earn a fair return. \n2\n Thus it sets the limit to the power of the state to reg late rates. The Constitution does not guarantee to the utility the opportunity to earn a return on the value of all items of property used by the utility or of any of them. The several items of property constituting the utility, taken singly, and freed from the public use, may conceivably have an aggregate value greater than if the items are used in combination. The owner is at liberty, in the absence of controlling statutory provision, to withdraw his property from the public service, and, if he does so, may obtain for it exchange value. Compare Brooks-Scanlon Co. v. Railroad Commission of Louisiana, \n251 U.S. 396\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 183; Erie Railroad Co. v. Public Utility Commissioners, \n254 \nU.S. 394, 411\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 169; Texas v. Eastern Texas R. R. Co., \n258 U.S. 204\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 281. But, so long as the specific items of property are employed by the utility, their exchange value is not of legal significance.\n The investor agrees, by embarking capital in a utility, that its charges to the public shall be reasonable. \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 291]\n\u00a0\n His company is the substitute for the state in the performance of the public service, thus becoming a public servant. The compensation which the Constitution guarantees an opportunity to earn is the reasonable cost of conducting the business. Cost includes, not only operating expenses, but also capital charges. Capital charges cover the allowance, by way of interest, for the use of the capital, whatever the nature of the security issued therefor, the allowance for risk incurred, and enough more to attract capital. The reasonable rate to be prescribed by a commission may allow an efficiently managed utility much more. But a rate is constitutionally compensatory, if it allows to the utility the opportunity to earn the cost of the service as thus defined.\n To decide whether a proposed rate is confiscatory the tribunal must determine both what sum would be earned under it and whether that sum would be a fair return. The decision involves ordinarily the making of four subsidiary ones:\n\n\n (1)\n What the gross earnings from operating the utility under the rate in controversy would be. (A prediction.)\n\n\n (2)\n What the operating expenses and charges, while so operating, would be. (A prediction.)\n\n\n (3)\n The rate base; that is, what the amount is on which a return should be earned. (Under Smyth v. Ames, an opinion, largely.)\n\n\n (4)\n What rate of return should be deemed fair. (An opinion, largely.)\n A decision that a rate is confiscatory (or compensatory) is thus the resultant of four subsidiary determinations. Each of the four involves forming a judgment, as distinguished from ascertaining facts; and as to each factor there is usually room for difference in judgment. But the first two factors do not ordinarily present serious difficulties. The doubts and uncertainties incident to \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 292]\n\u00a0\n prophecy, which affect them, can often be resolved by a test period; and meanwhile protection may be afforded by giving a bond. Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., \n212 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 19 S., 29 Sup. Ct. 148; St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Railway Co. v. McKnight, \n244 U.S. 368\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 611. The doubts and uncertainties incident to the last two factors can be eliminated, or lessened, only by redefining the rate base, called value, and the measure of fairness in return, now applied under the rul of Smyth v. Ames. The experience of the 25 years since that case was decided has demonstrated that the rule there enunciated is delusive. In the attempt to apply it insuperable obstacles have been encountered. It has failed to afford adequate protection either to capital or to the public. It leaves open the door to grave injustice. To give to capital embarked in public utilities the protection guaranteed by the Constitution, and to secure for the public reasonable rates, it is essential that the rate base be definite, stable, and readily ascertainable, and that the percentage to be earned on the rate base be measured by the cost, or charge, of the capital employed in the enterprise. It is consistent with the federal Constitution for this court now to lay down a rule which will establish such a rate base and such a measure of the rate of return deemed fair. In my opinion, it should do so.\n The rule of Smyth v. Ames sets the laborious and baffling task of finding the present value of the utility. It is impossible to find an exchange value for a utility, since utilities, unlike merchandise or land, are not commonly bought and sold in the market. Nor can the present value of the utility be determined by capitalizing its net earnings, since the earnings are determined, in large measure, by the rate which the company will be permitted to charge, and thus the vicious circle would be encountered. So, under the rule of Smyth v. Ames, it is usually sought to prove the present value of a utility by ascer taining \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 293]\n\u00a0\n what it actually cost to construct and install it, or by estimating what it should have cost, or by estimating what it would cost to reproduce or to replace it. To this end an enumeration is made of the component elements of the utility, tangible and intangible;3 then the actual, or the proper, cost of producing, or of reproducing, each part is sought; and finally it is estimated how much less than the new each part, or the whole, is \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 294]\n\u00a0\n worth. That is, the depreciation is estimated. \n4\n Obviously each step in the process of estimating the cost of reproduction, or replacement, involves forming an opinion, or exercising judgment, as distinguished from merely ascertaining facts. And this is true, also, of each step in the process of estimating how much less the existing plant is worth than if it were new. There is another potent reason why, under the rule of Smyth v. Ames, the room for difference in opinion as to the present value of a utility is so wide. The rule does not measure the present value either by what the utility cost to produce, or by what it should have cost, or by what it would cost to reproduce, or to replace it. \n5\n Under that rule the tribunal is directed, in forming its judgment, to take into consideration all those and also other elements, called relevant facts. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[262 U.S. 276, 295]\n\u00a0\n Obviously, 'value' cannot be a composite of all these elements. Nor can it be arrived at on all these bases. They are very different, and must, when applied in a particular case, lead to widely different results. The rule of Smyth v. Ames, as interpreted and applied, means merely that all must be considered. What, if any, weight shall be given to any one, must practically rest in the judicial discretion of the tribunal which makes the deter mination.\n___ of these prices is merely circumstantial, or corroborative, evidence of the amount actually paid. In determining actual cost, whatever the evidence, there is no attempt to determine whether the expenditure was wise or foolish, or whether it was useful or wasteful. Historical cost, on the other hand, is the amount which normally should have been paid for all the property which is usefully devoted to the public service. It is, in effect, what is termed the prudent investment. In enterprises efficiently launched and developed, historical cost and original cost would practically coincide both in items included and in amounts paid; that is, the subjects of expenditure would coincide, and the cost at prices prevailing at the time of installation would substantially coincide with the actual cost.\n\n\n (e)\n Reproduction cost of plant and business, estimated on price levels prevailing at the date of valuation.\n\n\n (f)\n Reproduction cost of plant and business, estimated on average price levels prevailing during periods of, say, 5 to 10 years preceding the valuation. \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 296]\n\u00a0\n WHETHER A DESIRED RESULT IS REACHED MAY DepEnd upon how any one of many elements is treated. It is true that the decision is usually rested largely upon records of financial transactions, on statistics and calculations. But as stated in Louisville v. Cumberland Telegraph & Telephone Co., \n225 \nU.S. 430, 436\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 741, 742 (56 L. Ed. 1151) 'every figure ... that we have set down with delusive exactness' is 'speculative.'\n The efforts of courts to control commissions' findings of value have largely failed. The reason lies in the character of the rule declared in Smyth v. Ames. The rule there stated was to be applied solely as a means of determining whether rates already prescribed by the Legislature were confiscatory. It was to be applied judicially after the rate had been mede, and by a court which had had no part in making the rate. When applied under such circumstances, the rule, although cumbersome, may occasionally be effective in destroying an obstruction to justice, as the action of a court is, when it sets aside the verdict of a jury. But the commissions undertook to make the rule their standard for constructive action. They used it as a guide for making or approving rates, and the tendency developed to fix as reasonable the rate which is not so low as to be confiscatory. \n7\n Thus the rule which assumes that rates of utilities will ordinarily be higher than the minimum required by the Constitution has, by the practice of the commissions, eliminated the margin between a reasonable rate and a merely compensatory rate, and, in the process of rate-making, effective judicial review is very often rendered impossible. \n8\n The \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 297]\n\u00a0\n result, inherent in the rule itself, is arbitrary action on the part of the rate-regulating body; for the rule not \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 298]\n\u00a0\n only fails to furnish any applicable standard of judgment. but directs consideration of so many elements that almost any result may be justified.\n The adoption of present value of the utility's property, as the rate base, was urged in 1893 on behalf of the community, and it was adopted by the courts, largely, as a protection against inflated claims, based on what were then deemed inflated prices of the past. See argument in Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 479\n, 480 S., 18 Sup. Ct. 418; San Diego Land & Town Co. v. National City, \n174 \nU.S. 739, 757\n, 758 S., 19 Sup. Ct. 804; San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, \n189 \nU.S. 439, 442\n, 443 S., 23 Sup. Ct. 571; Stanislaus County v. San Joaquin & Kings River Canal & Irrigation Co., \n192 \nU.S. 201, 214\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 241. Reproduction cost, as the measure, or as evidence, of present value, was also pressed then by representatives of the public, who sought to justify legislative reductions of railroad rates. \n9\n The long depression which followed the panic of 1893 had brought prices to the lowest level reached in the nineteenth century. Insistence upon reproduction cost was the shippers' protest against burdens believed to have resulted from watered stocks, reckless financing, and unconscionable construction contracts. Those were the days before state legislation prohibited the issue of public utility securities without authorization from state officials, before accounting was prescribed and supervised, when outstanding bonds and stocks were hardly an indication of the amount of capital embarked in the enterprise, when depreciation accounts were unknown, and when book values, or property accounts, furnished no trustworthy evidence either of cost or of real value. Estimates of reproduction cost were then offered, largely as a means, either of supplying lacks in the proof of actual cost and investment, or of testing \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 299]\n\u00a0\n the credibility of evidence adduced, or of showing that the cost of installation had been wasteful. For these purposes evidence of the cost of reproduction is obviously appropriate.\n At first reproduction cost was welcomed by commissions as evidence of present value. Perhaps it was because the estimates then indicated values lower than the actual cost of installation; for, even after the price level had begun to rise, improved machinery and new devices tended for some years to reduce construction costs. \n10\n Evidence of reproduction costs was certainly welcomed, because it seemed to offer a reliable means for performing the difficult task of fixing, in obedience to Smyth v. Ames, the value of a new species of property to which the old tests-selling price or net earnings-were not applicable. The engineer spoke in figures-a language implying certitude. His estimates seemed to be free of the infirmi ies which had stamped as untrustworthy the opinion evidence of experts common in condemnation cases. Thus, for some time, replacement cost, on the basis of prices prevailing at the date of the valuation, was often adopted by state commissions as the standard for fixing the rate base. But gradually it came to be realized that the definiteness of the engineer's calculations was delusive, that they rested upon shifting theories, and that their estimates varied so widely as to intensify, rather than to allay doubts. \n11\n When the price \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 300]\n\u00a0\n levels had risen largely, and estimates of replacement cost indicated values much greater than the actual cost of installation, many commissions refused to consider valuable what one declared to be assumptions based on things that never happened and estimates requiring the projection of the engineer's imagination into the future and methods of construction and installation that have never been and never will be adopted by sane men. \n12\n Finally the great fluctuation in price levels incident to the World War led to the transfusion of the engineer's estimate of cost with the economist's prophecies concerning the future price plateaus. Then the view that these estimates were not to be trusted as evidence of present \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 301]\n\u00a0\n value was frequently expressed, and state utility commissions, while admitting the evidence in obedience to Smyth v. Ames, failed, in ever- increasing numbers to pay heed to it in fixing the rate base. \n13\n The conviction is widespread that a sound conclusion as to the actual value of a utility is not to be reached by a meticulous study of conflicting estimates of the cost of reproducing new the congeries of old machinery and equipment, called the plant, and the still more fanciful estimates concerning the value of the intangible elements of an established business. 14 Many commissions, like that of Massachusetts, have declared recently that 'capital honestly and \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 302]\n\u00a0\n prudently invested must, under normal conditions, be taken as the controlling factor in fixing the basis for computing fair and reasonable rates.' \n15\n\u00a0\n\n To require that reproduction cost at the date of the rate hearing be given weight in fixing the rate base may subject investors to heavy losses when the high war and post-war price levels pass and the price trend is again \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 303]\n\u00a0\n downward. \n16\n The aggregate of the investments which have already been made at high costs since 1914, and of those which will be made before prices and costs can fall heavily, may soon exceed by far the depreciated value, of all the public utility investments made theretofore at relatively low cost. For it must be borne in mind that depreciation is an annual charge. That accrued on plants constructed in the long years prior to 1914 is much larger than that \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 304]\n\u00a0\n accruing on the properties installed in the shorter period since. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n That part of the rule of Smyth v. Ames which fixes the rate of return deemed fair, at the percentage customarily paid on similar investments at the time of the rate hearing also exposes the investor and the public to danger of serious injustice. If the replacement cost measure of value and the prevailing rate measure of fairness of return should be applied, a company which raised, in 1920, \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 305]\n\u00a0\n for additions to plant, $1,000,000 on a 9 per cent. basis, by a stock issue, or by long-term bond issue, may find a decade later that the value of the plant (disregarding depreciation) is only $600,000, and that the fair return on money then invested in such enterprise is only 6 per cent. Under the test of a compensatory rate, urged in reliance upon Smyth v. Ames, a prescribed rate would not be confiscatory, if it appeared that the utility could earn under it $36,000 a year; whereas $90,000 would be required to earn the capital charges. On the other hand, if a plant had been built in times of low costs, at $1,000,000 and the capital had been raised to the extent of $750,000 by an issue at par of 5 per cent. 30-year bonds and to the extent of $250,000 by stock at par, and 10 years later the price level was 75 per cent. higher and the interest rates 8 per cent. it would be a fantastic result to hold that a rate was confiscatory, unless it yielded 8 per cent. on the then reproduction cost of $1,750,000; for that would yield an income of $140,000, which would give the bondholders $37,500, and to the holders of the $250,000 stock $102,500, a return of 41 per cent. per annum. Money required to establish in 1920 many necessary plants has cost the utility 10 per cent. on 30-year bonds. These long-time securities, issued to raise needed capital, will in 1930 and thereafter continue to bear the extra high rates of interest, which it was necessary to offer in 1920 in order to secure the required capital. The prevailing rate for such investments may in 1930 be only 7 per cent., or indeed 6 per cent., as it was found to be in 1904, in Stanislaus County v. San Joaquin Co., \n192 U.S. 201\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 241; in 1909 in Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., \n212 U.S. 1\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 148; and in 1912, in Cedar Rapids Gas Co. v. Cedar Rapids, \n223 \nU.S. 655, 670\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 389. A rule which limits the guaranteed rate of return on utility investments to that which \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 306]\n\u00a0\n may prevail at the time of the rate hearing may fall far short of the capital charge then resting upon the company.\n In essence, there is no difference between the capital charge and operating expenses, depreciation, and taxes. Each is a part of the current cost of supplying the service, and each should be met from current income. When the capital charges are for interest on the floating debt paid at the current rate, this is readily seen. But it is no less true of a legal obligation to pay interest on long-term bonds, entered into years before the rate hearing and to continue for years thereafter; and it is true, also, of the economic obligation to pay dividends on stock, preferred or common. The necessary cost, and hence the capital charge, of the money embarked recently in utilities, and of that which may be invested in the near future, may be more, as it may be less, than t e prevailing rate of return required to induce capital to enter upon like enterprises at the time of a rate hearing ten years hence. To fix the return by the rate which happens to prevail at such future day, opens the door to great hardships. Where the financing has been proper, the cost to the utility of the capital, required to construct, equip, and operate its plant, should measure the rate of return which the Constitution guarantees opportunity to earn. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n The adoption of the amount prudently invested as the rate base and the amount of the capital charge as the measure of the rate of return would give definiteness to these two factors involved in rate controversies which are now shifting and treacherous, and which render the proceedings peculiarly burdensome and largely futile. Such measures offer a basis for decision which is certain and stable. The rate base would be ascertained as a fact, not determined as matter of opinion. It would not fluctuate \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 307]\n\u00a0\n with the market price of labor, or materials, or money. It would not change with hard times or shifting populations. It would not be distorted by the fickle and varying judgments of appraisers, commissions, or courts. It would, when once made in respect to any utility, be fixed, for all time, subject only to increases to represent additions to plant, after allowance for the depreciation included in the annual operating charges. The wild uncertainties of the present method of fixing the rate base under the so- called rule of Smyth v. Ames would be avoided, and likewise the fluctuations which introduce into the enterprise unnecessary elements of speculation, create useless expense, and impose upon the public a heavy, unnecessary burden.\n In speculative enterprises the capital cost of money is always high- partly because the risks involved must be covered; partly because speculative enterprises appeal only to the relatively small number of investors who are unwilling to accept a low return on their capital. It is to the interest both of the utility and of the community that the capital be obtained at as low a cost as possible. About 75 per cent. of the capital invested in utilities is represented by bonds. He who buys bonds seeks primarily safety. If he can obtain it, he is content with a low rate of interest. Through a fluctuating rate base the bondholder can only lose. He can receive no benefit from a rule which increases the rate base as the price level rises; for his return, expressed in dollars, would be the same, whatever the income of the company. \n19\n That \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 308]\n\u00a0\n the stockholder does not in fact receive an increased return in time of rapidly rising prices under the rule of Smyth v. Ames, as applied, the financial record of the last six years demonstrates. But the burden upon the community is heavy, because the risk makes the capital cost high.\n The expense and loss now incident to recurrent rate controversies is also very large. The most serious vice of the present rule for fixing the rate base is not the existing uncertainty, but that the method does not lead to certainty. Under it, the value for ratemaking purposes must ever be an unstable factor. Instability is a standing menace of renewed controversy. The direct expense to the utility of maintaining an army of xperts and of counsel is appalling. The indirect cost is far greater. The attention of officials high and low is, necessarily, diverted from the constructive tasks of efficient operation and of development. The public relations of the utility to the community are apt to become more and more strained, and a victory for the utility may in the end prove more disastrous than defeat would have been. The community defeated, but unconvinced, remembers, and may refuse aid when the company has occasion later to require its consent or co-operation in the conduct and development of its enterprise. Controversy with utilities is obviously injurious, also, to the public interest. The prime needs of the community are that facilities be ample and that rates be as low and as stable as possible. The community can get cheap service from private companies, only through cheap capital. It can get efficient service only if managers of the utility are free to devote themselves to problems of operation and of development. It can get ample service through private companies only if investors may be assured of receiving continuously a fair return upon the investment.\n What is now termed the prudent investment is, in essence, the same thing as that which the court has always \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 309]\n\u00a0\n sought to protect in using the term present value. \n20\n Twenty-five years ago, when Smyth v. Ames was decided, it was impossible to ascertain with accuracy, in respect to most of the utilities, in most of the states in which rate controversies arose, what it cost in money to establish the utility; or what the money cost with which the utility was established; or what income had been earned by it; or how the income had been expended. It was, therefore, not feasible, then, to adopt, as the rate base, the amount properly invested or, as the rate of fair return, the amount of the capital charge. Now the situation is fundamentally different. These amounts are, now, readily ascertainable in respect to a large, and rapidly increasing, proportion of the utilities. The change in this respect is due to the enlargement, meanwhile, of the powers and functions of state utility commissions. The issue of securities is now, and for many years has been, under the control of commissions, in the leading states. Hence the amount of capital raised (since the conferring of these powers) and its cost are definitely known, through current supervision and prescribed accounts, supplemented by inspection of the commission's engineering force. Like knowledge concerning the investment of that part of the capital raised and expended before these broad functions were exercised by the utility commissions has been secured, in many cases, through investigations undertaken later, in connection with the issue of new securities or the regulation of rates. The amount and disposition of current earnings of all the \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 310]\n\u00a0\n companies are also known. It is, therefore, feasible now to adopt as the measure of a compensatory rate-the annual cost, or charge, of the capital prudently invested in the utility. \n21\n And, hence, it should be done.\n Value is a word of many meanings. That with which commissions and courts in these proceedings are concerned, in so-called confiscation cases, is a special value for rate-making purposes, not exchange value. This is illustrated by our decisions which deal with the elements to be included in fixing the rate base. In Cedar Rapids Gas Co. v. Cedar Rapids, \n223 \nU.S. 655, 669\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 389; and Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, \n238 \nU.S. 153, 165\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 811, good will and franchise value were excluded from the rate base in determining whether the prescribed charges \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 311]\n\u00a0\n of the public utility were confiscatory. In Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, \n258 U.S. 388\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 351, the cost of developing the business as a financially successful concern was excluded from the rate base. In Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines \n238 \nU.S. 153, 171\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 811, the fact that the street had been paved ( and hence the reproduction cost of laying gas mains greatly increased) was not allowed as an element of value. But, obviously, good will and franchise value are important elements when exchange value is involved; and where the community acquires a public utility by purchase or condemnation, compensation must be made for its good will and earning power, at least under some circumstances. Omaha v. Omaha Water Co., \n218 \nU.S. 180, 202\n, 203 S., 30 Sup. Ct. 615, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1084; National Waterworks Co. v. Kansas City, 62 Fed. 853, 865, 10 C. C. A. 653, 27 L. R. A. 827. Likewise, as between buyer and seller, the good will and earning power due to effective organization are often more important elements than tangible property. These cases would seem to require rejection of a rule which measured the rate base by cost of reproduction or by value in its ordinary sense.\n The rule by which the utilities are seeking to measure the return is, in essence, reproduction cost of the utility or prudent investment, whichever is the higher. This is indicated by the instructions contained in the Special Report on Valuation of Public Utilities, made to the American Society of Civil Engineers, October 28, 1916, Proceedings, vol. 42:\n'So long as the company owner keeps a sum equivalent to the total investment at work for the public, either as property serving the public, or funds held in reserve for such property, no policy should be followed in estimating depreciation that will reduce the property to a value less than the investment. ...' Page 1726\n\n\n\n'Estimates of the cost of reproduction should be based on the assumption that the identical property is to be \n\n[262 U.S. 276, 312]\n\u00a0\n reproduced, rather than a substitute property' (page 1719), 'although such a substitute property, much less costly than t e existing plant, might furnish equal or better service, it is not reproduction of service, but of property, that is under consideration; and clearly the estimate should be of existing property created with public approval, rather than of a substituted property' (page 1772).\n\n If the aim were to ascertain the value (in its ordinary sense) of the utility property, the enquiry would be, not what it would cost to reproduce the identical property, but what it would cost to establish a plant which could render the service, or in other words, at what cost could an equally efficient substitute be then produced. Surely the cost of an equally efficient substitute must be the maximum of the rate base, if prudent investment be rejected as the measure. The utilities seem to claim that the constitutional protection against confiscation guarantees them a return both upon unearned increment and upon the cost of property rendered valueless by obsolescence. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The term 'prudent investment' is not used in a critical sense. There should not be excluded, from the finding of the base, investments which, under ordinary circumstances, would be deemed reasonable. The term is applied for the purpose of excluding what might be found to be dishonest or obviously wasteful or imprudent expenditures. Every investment may be assumed to have been made in the exercise of reasonable judgment, unless the contrary is shown. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Except that rates may, in no event, be prohibitive, exorbitant, or unduly burdensome to the public.

Ct. 462. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In estimating replacement cost the first step is to determine what part of the property owned is used and useful in the public service. That involves, among other things, a consideration of retired or discarded property, and the question whether the size and capacity of the plant are, in part, excessive.\n The property included in the valuation is commonly treated under the following heads (see Report of Special Committee on Valuation, Amer. Society of Civil Engineers, October 28, 1916, Vol. 42, Proceedings, pp. 1708-1938):\n A. Tangibles: (a) Land and buildings. (b) Plant.\n B. Incidentals during construction: (a) Administration. (b) Engineering and superintendence. (c) Legal expenses. (d) Brokerage. (e) Promotion fees. (f) Insurance. (g) Taxes. (h) Bond discount. (i) Contingencies.\n C. Intangibles: (a) Good will. (b) Franchise value. (c) Going concern value. (d) Working capital.\n'Going value' was declared by the Special Report (p. 1727) to embrace, among other things, 'efficiency, favorable business arrangements and design'; intangibles to include also 'leases, easements, water rights, traffic and operating agreements, strategic location and advantages, nd other privileges.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Several different methods are used for measuring depreciation: (1) The replacement method; (2) the straight-line method; (3) the compound interest method; (4) the sinking fund method; (5) the unit cost method. It is largely a matter of judgment whether, and to what extent, any one of these several methods of depreciation should be applied. They may give widely different results. Special Report, October 28, 1916, Valuation of Public Utilities, Amer. Society of Civil Engineers, Vol. 42, Proceedings, pp. 1723-1727, 1846-1900. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] This court declared in Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 547\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 418, 434 (42 L. Ed. 819) that 'present as compared with the original cost of construction' is to be considered, and in Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 452\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 729, 761 (57 L. Ed. 1511, 48 L. R. A. [N. S.] 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18) that 'the cost of reproduction method is of service in ascertaining the present value of the plant, when it is reasonably applied and when the cost of reproducing the property may be ascertained with a proper degree of certainty.' Reproduction cost was thus held to be evidence of value. But it has never been held to be the measure of value. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Some of these so-called relevant facts are, as the rule has been applied:\n (a) Capitalization; i. e., bonds, stock, and other securities outstanding.\n (b) Book cost; i. e., the investment account, as shown on the books.\n (c) Actual cost; i. e., amounts actually paid in cash for installing the original plant and business, and the additions thereto.\n (d) Historical cost; i. e., the proper cost of the existing plant and business, estimated on the basis of the price levels existing at the respective dates when the plant and the additions were constructed. This is often called prudent investment. Historical cost would, under normal conditions, be equal in amount to the original cost. The phrases are sometimes used to donote the same thing. But they are not the same, and they are often ascertained by different processes. Original cost is the amount actually paid to establish the utility. The amount is ascertained, where possible, by inspection of books and vouchers, and by other direct evidence. If this class of evidence is not complete, it may be necessary to supplement it by evidence as to what was probably paid for some items, by showing prices prevailing for work and materials at the time the same were supplied. plied. But the evidence \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] This, it appears, was the purpose of the board in Galveston Electric Co. v. City of Galveston, \n258 U.S. 388\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 351. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] A rate order will not be set aside unless the evidence compels conviction that a fair-minded board could not have reached the conclusion that the rate would prove adequate.

Knoxville Water Co., \n212 \nU.S. 1, 17\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 148; Van Dyke v. Geary, \n244 \nU.S. 39, 49\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 483; Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, \n258 \nU.S. 388, 401\n, 402 S., 42 Sup. Ct. 351. The range for difference of opinion on each of the many factors to be taken into consideration in fixing the rate base is so wide that such compelling evidence can rarely be adduced, where the report filed recites that, after full hearing, all the so-called relevant facts were given consideration by the commission in reaching the decision made. There may often be found in opinions of utility commissions, after a lengthy and detailed discussion of a vast quantity of expert opinion, a conclusion like the following from Re Illinois Northern Utilities Co., P. U. R. 1920D, 979, 999:\n'After considering all the evidence and arguments of counsel in this case, bearing upon the valuation of the properties herein involved, the investment therein, their original costs, cost to reproduce, and present values, including all overheads, preliminary costs, cost of engineering, supervision, interest, insurance, organization, and legal expenses during construction, working capital, materials and supplies, and all other elements \n\n of value, tangible and intangible, and considering the plants are now going concerns in successful operation, the commission finds ... for the purposes of this proceeding, and for those purposes only, the fair rate- making values ... as follows.'\n Hence a commission's order must ordinarily be allowed to stand, unless it appears that there was  me irregularity in the proceedings or that some erroneous rule of law was applied.\n Since Smyth v. Ames this court has dealt with the validity (under the Fourteenth Amendment) of rate regulation by the states in over 50 cases. In only 25 of these has the court passed upon the question whether a rate fixed, or approved, by a state commission denied to the utility the opportunity of earning a fair return upon the fair value of the property. In none of these 25 cases has an order of a state commission, made after a full hearing, been declared void by this court, on the ground that the finding of the rate base, or value, was too low. In none of them has the order been declared void on the ground that the commission fixed too low a percentage of return. Lower federal courts and state courts have occasionally intervened with effect. But the instances are relatively few as compared with the number of adverse decisions of the commissions. Even where orders fixing rates have been set aside for irregularity or error, the result of the new hearing is not always advantageous to the company. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See Steenerson v.

It is based upon prophecy, instead of reality, and depends so much upon half truths that it bears only a remote resemblance to fact, and rises at best, only to the plane of a dignified guess.'\n\n In Public Service Commission v. Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co., P. U. R. 1916D, 947, 955, the commission said: 'The old methods have proven uncertain, indefinite, and unsatisfactory to honest utilities and commissions alike.'\n See, also, In re Northampton Gas Petition (Mass.)

Reproduction cost at unit prices prevailing at the date of valuation appears to have been the predominant element in fixing the rate base in only 5. In 63 the commission severely criticized, or expressly repudiated, this measure of value. In nearly all of the 363 cases, except 5, the commission either refused to pay heed to this factor as the measure of value, or indeed as evidence of any great weight.\n The following summary shows the predominant element in fixing the rate base in the several cases:\n In 5 cases: Reproduction cost at unit prices prevailing at the date of the valuation. In 28 cases: Reproduction cost at unit prices prevailing at some date, or the averages of some period, prior to the date of the valuation. In 12 cases: Reproduction cost at unit prices prevailing at some date not specifically stated. In 22 cases: Reproduction cost of an inventory of a prior date at prices prevailing at that date or prior thereto, plus subsequent additions at actual cost (so-called split inventory method). In 3 cases: Reproduction cost on basis of future predicted prices (so- called trend prices, or new plateau method). In 102 cases: A prior valuation by the commission plus the actual cost of subsequent additions. In 85 cases: The actual original cost (including both initial cost and additions). In 6 cases: Original cost arbitrarily appreciated. In 27 cases: The historical cost or prudent investment. In 28 cases: Book cost or investment. In 12 cases: Bond and stock capitalization. In 36 cases: Determination and classification of method impossible. \n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Middlesex & Boston Rate case, Public Service Commission (Mass.)

And see Id. for a quotation from an address delivered at the 'Conference on Valuation' in Philadelphia, November, 1915, in which the late John M. Eshleman, first president of the California Railroad Commission, said: 'If we had this problem at the beginning, and were not attacking it in the middle, we would have no difficulty in agreeing with the holder of capital upon this subject, for he would quite readily agree to take the cost of doing the business plus an earning upon the money actually invested comparable to the earning offered in other available investments. Therefore the cost of doing the business, plus a return upon the capital necessarily invested in the business, which return shall be as great as is offered in other businesses of similar hazard, is all that ought to be accorded for the future, and it is all that will be accorded, if the public has any business sense. And if more is asked by the private owner, then he may expect no sympathy when he finds the public his competitor and his earning power impaired.'\n No case involving t e fixing of rates by a commission has ever come to this court from New England. The only case involving in any way the validity of rates is Interstate Consolidated Street Ry. Co. v. Massachusetts, \n207 U.S. 79\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 26, 12 Ann. Cas. 555.\n See, also, Re Cripple Creek Water Co. (Colo.) P. U. R. 1916C, 788, 799, 800; Butler v. Lewiston, Augusta & Waterville St. Ry. (Me.) P. U. R. 1916D, 25, 35. \n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] Engineers testifying in recent rate cases have assumed that there will be a new plateau of prices. In Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, \n258 U.S. 388\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 351, the company contended that a plateau 70 per cent. above the price level of 1914 should be accepted, and a plateau 33 1\/3 per cent. above was found probable by the master and assumed to be such by the lower court. In Bluefield Waterworks & Improvement Co. v. Public Serice Commission, \n262 U.S. 679\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 675, 67 L. Ed. -- (No. 256, October Term, 1922), one 50 per cent. above the 1914 level was contended for; in the case at bar a plateau 25 per cent. above. But for the assumption that there will be a plateau there is no basis in American experience. The course of prices for the last 112 years indicates, on the contrary, that there may be a practically continuous decline for nearly a generation, that the present price level may fall to that of 1914 within a decade, and that, later, it may fall much lower. Prices rose steadily (with but slight and short recessions) for the 20 years before the United States entered the World War. From the low level of 1897 they rose 21 per cent. to 1900; then rose further (with minor fluctuations, representing times of good business or bad) and reached in 1914 a point 50 per cent. above the 1897 level. Then the great rise incident to the war set in. 'Wholesale Prices, 1890 to 1921,' U. S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bulletin No. 320, pp. 9- 26. These are averages of the wholesale prices of all commodities. In the Bureau chart the 1913 prices are taken as the datum line (100). As compared with them the 1897 level was 67, the 1900 level 81. The chart on page 10 of the pamphlet, entitled 'Price Changes and Business Prospects,' published by the Cleveland Trust Company, gives price fluctuations for the 110 years prior to 1921. It shows three abrupt rises in the price level, by reason of war, and some less abrupt falls, by reason of financial panic. These may be called abnormal. But the normal has never been a plateau. The chart shows that the peak price levels were practically the same during the War of 1812, the Civil War, and the World War, and it shows that practically continuous declines, for about 30 years, followed the first two wars. The experience after the third may be similar. \n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] The new enterprises undertaken at the present high level, or projected, are many, among them, development and long-distance transmission of hydroelectric power, and of electric power generated at the coal mines. Moreover, nearly every utility now existing must make expenditures upon its plant to provide improvements, additions, or extensions. The growth of our communities, and increase in the demands of the individual, constantly compel enlargement of a utility's fa ilities. The present annual investment in public utility enterprises is much greater in amount than at any time in the past. Some of the construction done during the war was at prices for labor and materials 120 per cent. above those prevailing in 1914. Recent construction was at prices 70 per cent. higher. If replacement cost should become the measure of the rate base, the return on enterprises entered upon after 1914 would, obviously, be imperilled. And a serious decline of the price level would subject the return on many utilities established earlier to like dangers. A collapse of public utility values might result. And the impairment of public utility credit might be followed by the cessation of extensions and new undertakings. \n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] The community may, of course, demand, in respect to financing, as in respect to operation, that the right to earn a fair return be limited by the requirement that reasonable efficiency be exercised. \n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] Of course, any one who chances to have money to invest, when money rates are high, gets the advantage incident to investing in a favorable market. If he invests in utility bonds, the higher agreed return upon his capital would be provided for by a rule which measures fair return by capital charges, as suggested above. If he elects to invest in the stock, he would, under the rule suggested, have the opportunity of earning a return commensurate with the value of the capital at the time it was embarked as stock in the enterprise. \n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] Compare Mr. Justice Field in Railroad Commission Cases, \n116 \nU.S. 307, 343\n, 344 S., 6 Sup.

Ames was decided, only one state- Massachusetts-had control by commission of the issue of securities by all public utility companies. (New Hampshire controlled security issues of railroads and street railways; Maine and New York controlled increase of capital stock by railroads; and Connect cut, the issue of bonds by railroads.) In 1923 at least 24 states and the District of Columbia controlled through commissions the issue of securities of public utility companies. Legislation for 1923 and 1922 (in part) has not been available. Other states may have legislated on the subject in 1923 or 1922.\n In 1898 no state had control by commission of the accounting of all public utilities. Massachusetts controlled the accounting of gas, electric light, street railway, and railroad companies; Iowa, of railways and carriers; New York, Texas, and Vermont, of railroads only. In 1923 at least 36 states and the District of Columbia controlled through commissions the accounting of public utility companies.\n In 1898, only one state-Massachusetts-exercised through a commission control of all public utilities. In 1923 such control is exercised in at least 39 states and the District of Columbia. This does not include those states exercising commission control over railroads and related utilities, such as street railways, express companies, and telephone and telegraph companies. These states number 47. The number of states having commission control of railroads in 1898 was 27. In 1922 every state except Delaware had commission control of railroads. \n\n\n\n\n","175":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST LOUIS MALLEABLE CASTING CO. v. GEORGE C PRENDERGAST CONST CO.(1923)\nNo. 154\nArgued: Decided: January 2, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 469, 470]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Lambert E. Walter, of St. Louis, Mo., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Wm. K. Koerner, of St. Louis, Mo., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Suit in equity to have declared invalid and canceled a tax bill issued against the property of plaintiff in error, herein designated as plaintiff, for the construction of sewers in Braden sewer district No. 2, city of St. Louis.\n There is a charge of excess and resultant invalidity in the tax bill, because the taxing district (sewer district) does not contain tracts of land which it should contain and that are within its drainage area.\n The Fourteenth Amendment is invoked against the tax: (1) In that the limits of the sewer district and the apportionment of the costs between the several lots or parcels of land and their respective owners, without a hearing being accorded, deny plaintiff due process of law. (2) In the exclusion from the district of tracts of land as above stated plaintiff is denied due process of law and the equal protection of the law.\n There is an elaborate detail of the particulars upon which the charges are alleged to rest. The particulars include the charter of the city and the various ordinances passed in executing its purpose, the action of the board of aldermen, and the action of the board of public service in execution of the direction to contract for the construction of the sewers, and, when constructed, to cause the \n\n[260 U.S. 469, 471]\n\u00a0\n entire expense to be computed, to levy and assess such expense as a special tax in accordance with the requirements of the charter, and to issue a special tax bill against each parcel of ground liable.\n And it is alleged that the defendant was awarded, under the requirement and directions of the ordinances, the contract, and received from the city special tax bills as authorized by the charter and ordinances, among which was one issued against the property of plaintiff for $9,168.86 which, it is alleged, purports to confer upon the holder thereof a lien authorized by the charter of the city.\n The trial court, after reciting that it found 'in favor of the defendant on the issues joined' and that the plaintiff 'was not entitled to the relief prayed,' adjudged and decreed that the suit be dismissed.\n The Supreme Court (231 S. W. 989) affirmed the decree. The court reviewed at length the pleadings of plaintiff and said that it, the plaintiff, made 'a very plausible case by the allegations of its petition, but it is not supported by either the evidence in the case or the finding of the trial court.' The conclusion of the court, therefore, was that there was no arbitrary or discriminating exclusion of property from the district that was within the benefit of the sewer, and, further, that:\n'Defendant's evidence tended to show: The sewer, for proportionate part of the cost of which appellant's ground was assessed, had been fully completed when this suit was brought, and appellant had connected its said premises with this sewer and was in actual enjoyment of the benefits thereof. [Italics ours.] The evidence fails to show any act of commission or omission on the part of the contractor. The appellant does not question the utility of the sewer. Yet, without offering to pay any part of its cost, appellant comes into a court of equity and asks that the entire assessment against its property be canceled.' \n\n[260 U.S. 469, 472]\n\u00a0\n The conclusion, in effect, was that the fact of connecting its premises with the sewer estopped plaintiff from denying the validity of the tax bill, and the conclusion was supported by the citation of a number of cases, including Wight v. Davidson, \n181 U.S. 371\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 616.\n\n The evidence leaves no doubt of the fact that plaintiff, during the construction of the district sewer, made application for a license to connect with it, and afterward did connect with it. The only reply that counsel makes is that the court meant nothing more by its conclusion and the cases cited 'than the statement of an abstract legal principle' which was 'in no way connected up with the evidence.' It is further said that:\n'Nowhere in the statement does the Supreme Court find any facts constituting an estoppel.'\n\n The comment is not justified. Our quotations from the court's opinion established the contrary, and that the plaintiff did something more than stand by and make no protest; it availed of the benefits of the sewer. The state cases cited are, therefore, not in point. Nor is O'Brien v. Wheelock, \n184 \nU.S. 450, 489\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 354, of relevant consideration. It is not attempted here, as there, to enforce a law as of validity by estoppel to particular persons, though invalid, under the Constitution of the state, to all of the world besides.\n Finally, it is said that, if the Supreme Court had intended to hold plaintiff estopped from raising the questions under and federal Constitution, the case would have been peremptorily disposed of without discussing or ruling against those questions. And 'neither is it conceivable,' it is further said, 'that the petition for writ of error to this court would have been granted by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Missouri if the case had been decided against plaintiff in error upon a question of local law.' The propositions are not estimable in meaning, except there is concession in them that if the estoppel \n\n[260 U.S. 469, 473]\n\u00a0\n was ruled it was adequate to justify the court's decree. It was ruled. The effect is not lessened because the court ruled as well on the constitutional questions. As we have seen, the court said that the 'plausible case' made by plaintiff 'by the allegations of its petition' was 'not supported by either the evidence in the case or the finding of the trial court.' Whether this conclusion received or needed aid from the force the court considered should be assigned to the establishment of the sewer district as furnishing an indisputable presumption of notice, is not absolutely clear. Nor is it clear whether the court considered that notice of the meeting of the board of public service and opportunity to be heard before the board satisfied the constitutional requirements urged by plaintiff.\n However, we are not called upon to resolve the uncertainty, if any there be, in the grounds of the court's ruling upon the constitutional questions. It is enough for our action that the court considered plaintiff estopped to contest the validity of the sewer or the validity of the tax which was imposed by connecting its premises with the sewer. In that conclusion we concur.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","176":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST LOUIS SOUTHWESTERN R. CO. v. U S(1923)\nNo. 184\nArgued: Decided: April 23, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 70, 71]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Benjamin Carter, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Blackburn Esterline, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Prior to July 1, 1910, claimant entered into a contract with the Post Office Department to carry the mails over a part of its line for the period of four years from that date. Prior to July 1, 1911, it entered into a like contract to carry the mails over another part of its lines. These contracts were in form and substance similar to that involved in New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. Co. v. United States, \n258 U.S. 32\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 209, and other recent cases. \n1\n By them the amount of compensation was fixed by a weighing prior to the date of the contract. While the mails \n\n[262 U.S. 70, 72]\n\u00a0\n were being carried by claimant under these contracts, the parcel post system was established pursuant of Act Aug. 24, 1912, c. 389,  8, 37 Stat. 539, 557-559 (Comp. St.  7319 et seq.). From the inauguration of the service, on January 1, 1913, to the end of the contract periods, claimant carried the parcel post together with the other mail. For rendering this service, during the first six months, no additional compensation has been paid claimant. For rendering it during the remainder of the contract periods, claimant received, under later legislation, sums in addition to the compensation provided by the contracts. These sums it deems inadequate. On February 1, 1919, this suit was brought to recover, as reasonable compensation for the service rendered, the several amounts which it insists should have been paid. The government demurred to the petition. The Court of Claims dismissed it on the ground that there was neither a contract express or implied in fact, nor a law of Congress to support the claims for additional compensation. The cas is here on appeal.\n The Act of August 24, 1912, provided that the establishment of parcel post zones and postage rates should go into effect January 1, 1913. It increased the weight of fourth class mail matter from four to eleven pounds and the size to seventy-two inches in length and girth. It also authorized further increases of the weight limit, by order of the Postmaster General with the consent of the Interstate Commerce Commission. But that act (Comp. St.  7446), while it authorized the Postmaster General to 'readjust the compensation of star route and screen wagon contractors if it should appear that as a result of the parcel post system the weight of the mails handled by them has been materially increased,' made no provision whatsoever for increasing the pay of railroads because of carrying parcel post matter. Act March 4, 1913, c. 143, 37 Stat. 791, 797 (Comp. St.  7494), authorized the Postmaster General 'to add to the compensation paid for transportation on railroad routes \n\n[262 U.S. 70, 73]\n\u00a0\n on and after July first, one thousand nine hundred and thirteen, for the remainder of the contract terms' not exceeding 5 per cent. thereof per annum 'on account of the increased weight of mails resulting from the enactment of' the parcel post provision of the preceding year. The Postmaster General allowed claimant, under this act on some routes the full 5 per cent.; on some less; on some nothing additional. But the latter act, also, contained no provision authorizing additional pay to the railroads for carrying parcel post matter from January 1, 1913, to June 30, 1913\n\n\n First. That no recovery can be had for the period after June 30, 1913, is clear. Before that date Congress had made express provision for the additional compensation and in so doing had limited the amount payable. The power to grant or to withhold was, within the limit set, vested in the Postmaster General; and his decision as to additional compensation was conclusive except upon Congress. \n2\n The protest alleged to have been made in August, 1913, against the amounts proposed to be paid for this period, cannot avail claimant. New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. Co. v. United States, \n251 U.S. 123\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 67.\n Second. The first six months' period presents a different situation; but the legal result is the same. There is no claim of an express contract to pay additional compensation; nor is there any basis for a claim on a contract implied in fact. The petition alleges that the parcel post matter was radically different in character \n\n[262 U.S. 70, 74]\n\u00a0\n from the ordinary mails as constituted before January 1, 1913. It may be, that claimant might legally have refused, for this reason, to carry the parcel post mail under then existing contracts; even if additional compensation had been offered. Compare United States v. Utah, Nevada & California Stage Co., \n199 U.S. 414\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 69; Hunt v. United States, \n257 U.S. 125\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 5. But the petition contains no allegation that it refused to perform this extra service, unless the government would agree to pay additional compensation. The petition contains allegations apparently designed to show that objection to carrying the parcel post matter would have been largely futile;3 but the allegations fall far short of showing a demand that the parcel post matter be eliminated, or a protest against carrying it under the conditions then existing. If the parcel post act, or other legislation, gives a right to compensation, the refusal or failure of the Postmaster General to allow the claim could not, of course, defeat recovery. Compare Campbell v. United States, \n107 \nU.S. 407, 411\n, 2 S. Sup. Ct. 795; \n\n[262 U.S. 70, 75]\n\u00a0\n United States v. Knox, \n128 U.S. 230\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 63. But, unless there is such legislation, claimant cannot recover without showing a contract, express or implied, in fact to pay the extra compensation. Compare United States v. North American Transportation & Trading Co., \n253 \nU.S. 330, 335\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 518; Sutton v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 575, 581\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 563, 19 A. L. R. 403. No basis for such a contract is afforded by the further allegation that when the act of 1912 was passed, and when the parcel post system was established, railroads, high officials of the Post Office Department, and members of both houses of Congress, in charge of postal legislation, understood that Congress would provide additional compensation to the railroads.\n The legislation makes no provision for additional compensation to the railroads for the period prior to July 1, 1913, and its history makes clear that Congress concluded not to allow any. For some time prior to the passage of the Act of August 24, 1912, there had been much discussion in Congress concerning the pay of railroads for carrying the mail. The carriers urged generally that the pay was inadequate; and there were proposals for increase of compensation. On the part of the public, there was a widespread belief that the railroads were overpaid; and there were proposals to reduce the compensation. When Congress passed the 1912 act, it was not prepared to decide this controverted question. It, therefore, appointed a special committee to inquire into the subject, and also others, relating to parcel post, and directed the committee to report at the earliest date possible. Meanwhile, the discussion continued in Congress. That the parcel post would result in largely increased weight of mail was repeatedly asserted; but it was insisted that the pay under existing contracts would give the railroads even more compensation than they deserved. The fact was recognized that the appropriation bill enacted March 4, 1913, provided increased pay only for parcel post service renddered \n\n[262 U.S. 70, 76]\n\u00a0\n AFTER JUNE 30, 1913.4 the failUre OF CONGRESS TO MAKE ANY PROVISion for the preceding six months was not inadvertent. It was the deliberate purpose of Congress not to give the railroads additional pay for carrying the parced post mail during that period. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The case at bar is wholly unlike Freund v. United States (Nos. 29 and 37) \n260 U.S. 60\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 70, 67 L. Ed. --, decided November 13, 1922; United States v. Utah, Nevada & California Stage Co., \n199 U.S. 414\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 69, and Hunt v. United States, \n257 U.S. 125\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 5, on which claimant relies. In each of those cases there was ample power in the Postmaster General to pay the additional compensation claimed. In each the main question presented was whether under the proper construction of the contract claimant was entitled to additional pay. Moreover, in each, the contractor had by proper protest preserved his rights, and there was perhaps an element of duress. Here, as in Sutton v. United States, \n256 U.S. 575\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 563, 19 A. L. R. 403, the Department had been denied power to pay an additional sum; there \n\n[262 U.S. 70, 77]\n\u00a0\n was no protest by the contractor against assuming the additional service; and there was no duress. The service was undertaken voluntarily; no doubt, in the expectation that Congress would provide additional compensation. It made some provision, but concluded not to make any for the first six months. We may not inquire into the reasons for this refusal, or undertake to revise its judgment. The obstacle to recovery is not strictly lack of jurisdiction in the Court of Claims. There was an express contract between the parties; there was also legislation, and on these the claim is founded. The obstacle to recovery is lack of legal merits. The government did not in fact promise to pay for the extra service; nor did the legislation give to claimant a right to compensation. In other words, the petition fails to set out a cause of action.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] United States v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., \n249 U.S. 451\n, 39 Sup.

Ct. 162. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Some further compensation was in fact made after the expiration of the contracts, under later legislation. By Act of July 28, 1916, c. 261, 39 Stat. 412, 425 (Comp. St.  7494b), passed after both contracts with claimant had expired, the Postmaster General was authorized to make an additional payment not exceeding one-half of 1 per centum per annum on account of the increased weight of mails resulting from his order effective August 15, 1913, raising the weight limit to 20 pounds and additional payment not exceeding 1 per cent. on account of the increased weight resulting from his order effective January 1, 1914, raising the weight limit to 50 pounds. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The petition alleges: 'Much the larger part of the mails on petitioner's routes and on the routes of the other important railroad companies were carried in post office cars, for which cars arrangements were made between the Post Office Department and the railroad companies independent of the contracts for mail transportation, and, under such arrangements, such cars were in operation on petitioner's said routes at the time when the parcel post was established and at the times when the increases in weight of the parcel post matter became effective. The greater part of the mails carried in such cars were loaded into and out of the same by contractors or other persons employed by the Post Office Department, over whom petitioner and the other railroad companies had no control, and the Postal Laws and Regulations (sec. 1583) forbade that railroad employes should enter the post office cars when in motion for any other purpose than the operation of the trains. Moreover, the parcel post matter was so confused with the other mails that the employes of petitioner and the other railroad companies could not possibly have distinguished them, and removed them from the post office cars, if otherwise they had had opportunity.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See volume 49, Cong.

PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF STATE(1923)\nNo. 284\nArgued: Decided: March 19, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. E. T. Miller and Wm. T. Evans, both of St. Louis, Mo., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Frank E. Atwood, of Carrollton, Mo., and L. H. Breuer, of Rolla, Mo., for defendant in error. \n\n[261 U.S. 369, 370]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Railway Company conducts an interstate railroad between Kansas City, Mo., and Birmingham, Ala., passing through the city of Mountain Grove, Mo.\n Upon the petition of a volunteer organization of the city, the Public Service Commission of Missouri ordered the Railway Company to (1) provide for the stopping of its southbound train No. 105 at Mountain Grove for the purpose of taking on and discharging passengers at that point; (2) provide for the stopping of north-bound train No. 106 at the city, on flag or signal, for the purpose of letting off passengers who board the train at points south of the Arkansas state line, and for the purpose of taking on passengers holding tickets for points beyond Springfield, Mo.; (3) the order to be in full force and effect on and after the 16th day of June, 1919\n\n\n The order was attacked by the railway company on the ground that it was 'in violation of section 8 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States, in that it constituted a regulation of, interference with, and burden upon interstate commerce.' The order, however, was successively affirmed by the circuit court having jurisdiction, and by the Supreme Court of the state. To the judgment of the latter this writ of error is directed.\n The Supreme Court expressed the question to be 'whether or not the order of the commission as affirmed by the circuit court imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce.' The court considered the question a 'vital one to be determined under the facts in this case.'\n Chicago, Burl ngton & Quincy Railroad Co. v. Railroad Commission of Wisconsin, \n237 U.S. 220\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 560, was adduced for the conclusion that a state may require of a railroad adequate local facilities, even to the stoppage of interstate \n\n[261 U.S. 369, 371]\n\u00a0\n trains or the rearrangement of their schedules, whether done directly by the Legislature or through an administrative body.\n It was decided, however, that it was for this court to determine 'the fact of local facilities,' that determination being necessary to our power to consider whether the regulation of the state affected interstate commerce to an illegal extent.\n The primary principle is that, although interstate commerce is outside of regulation by a state, there may be instances in which a state, in the exercise of a necessary power, may affect that commerce. There is, however, no inevitable test of the instances; the facts in each must be considered. In Gladson v. Minnesota, \n166 U.S. 427\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 627, it was decided that a state requlation requiring all regular passenger trains running wholly within the state to stop at stations at all county seats long enough to take on and discharge passengers invaded no constitutional right of the railroad, nor was it an infringement of interstate commerce because it was made applicable to interstate connecting trains or trains transporting mails of the United States.\n In Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Railway Co. v. Illinois, \n177 U.S. 514\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 722, a statute requiring all regular passenger trains to stop a sufficient length of time at county seats to receive and let off passengers was held invalid as an interference with interstate commerce, there being local trains sufficient for the local business. The case reviewed prior cases including Gladson v. Minnesota, and declared that while there is no regulatory power in a state over interstate commerce in a proper case, the state may exercise its power to secure local facilities, although some interference with interstate commerce may result.\n To the like effect is Mississippi Railroad Commission v. Illinois Central Railroad Co., \n203 U.S. 335\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 90, and Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co. v. Wharton et al., \n207 U.S. 328\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 121. In this \n\n[261 U.S. 369, 372]\n\u00a0\n case, indeed in all of the cases, the admonitory caution is expressed:\n'That any exercise of state authority, in whatever form manifested, which directly regulates interstate commerce, is repugnant to the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution.'\n\n There is concession, however, to the requisition of reasonable facilities; necessarily, therefore, the fact of such facilities at, or their absence from, Mountain Grove must be inquired into.\n Mountain Grove has a population of 2,500 persons, contains a number of banks, stores of the kind that a population of 2,500 persons would naturally demand and support, with a trade proportionate in volume and value. It has besides, a creamery, a soda water plant, a wholesale grocery business which handles dairy products, and there are shipments of live stock from the city. There is also an overall factory which employs about 50 girls, a state fruit experimental station and a state poultry experimental station.\n The finding of the commission is that:\n'The trade territory is estimated at from 30 to 50 miles north and northeast, and 25 to 40 miles south and southwest.'\n\n Trains Nos. 105 and 106 are through trains operated in long-distance travel. The order of the commission requires of one of them the fixed duty of stopping; of the other, stopping on signal, its accommodation presumably being only occasional. The trains are night trains, and it is difficult to see how they are necessary to the enterprise of the city, or an essentially contributing factor or adjunct to its business. We say 'essentially contributing,' as distinguished from some personal convenience or accommodation, which no doubt they are. It is to be borne in mind that interstate commerce and intrastate commerce have different purposes and these purposes are to be considered-the power of the nation and the power of the states are accommodated to them and delimited by them. \n\n[261 U.S. 369, 373]\n\u00a0\n and kept from interference and confusion. Our cases illustrate this, and we think, determine against the power exercised in the order under review. In other words, the order under review transcends the power of the state; the order of the commission being of detriment to interstate commerce.\n Much is made of the experimental stations, and it is said that 700 persons visit them annually who will suffer inconvenience by the discontinuance of the trains. The instance has attractive appeal, but any instance of convenience has like appeal. But as we have said, the distinction between the commerces-state and interstate-and their purposes are to be considered, and the different powers necessary to direct those purposes. Interstate commerce is concerned with the business of states, states distant often from one another, involving, necessarily, a difference in service. And such is the character of the trains in question. They are operated in long-distance traffic, are the instruments of such traffic, and it is a part of their efficiency that they are run at night. They may be a facility in some degree to Mountain Grove. It is to be remembered, however, that the city has four other through interstate passenger trains and any deficiency in their schedules or equipment can be corrected without burdening interstate commerce by stopping the trains in question. This conclusion, we think, is in accordance with our decisions.\n We are compelled, therefore, to reverse the judgment and remand the cause for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","178":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST.

Companhia Geral, Etc. \n263 U.S. 119\n (1923) ]\n\n\n[263 U.S. 119, 122]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. Curtis Rouse, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The General Commercial Company, Limited, doing business as commission merchant and exporting concern at \n\n[263 U.S. 119, 123]\n\u00a0\n New York, in May, 1918, old 800 barrels of rosin c. i. f. to the respondent, a Brazilian corporation. and procured a written freight reservation or agreement from the agents of the schooner St. Johns N. F. to carry the goods to Rio de Janeiro, 'on or under deck, ship's option,' and subject 'to terms of bills of lading in use by steamer's agents.'\n The rosin was loaded on board June 11th and clean receipts-without indorsement concerning stowage-were given therefor. A day or two later, upon prepayment of freight, the ship issued a clean bill of lading in the usual form. It contained no reference to the prior freight agreement. The goods were placed on deck, but neither the shipper nor the consignee knew this until after the loss occurred. There was no general custom at the port so to stow goods of this kind for such a voyage. The vessel was a general ship carrying many kinds of merchandise and no charter party question is involved. She sailed from New York June 19th. Before reaching Rio de Janeiro she encountered a storm and for sufficient cause the master jettisoned the rosin in order to relieve her. The loss resulted directly from the on deck stowage; the under deck cargo was safely delivered.\n Respondent libeled the schooner and demanded the value of the goods at destination. It claims that by issuing the clean bill of lading the vessel in effect notified the shipper that she had exercised the option specified by the freight agreement and would stow underdeck; also, that the ship broke her contract as by deviation and thereby lost the benefit of limitation or relieving clauses in the bill.\n The owners maintain that as the freight agreement gave an option as to place of stowage it was unnecessary for the bill of lading to specify the action taken in respect thereto, and that silence did not amount to a promise to carry under deck. Moreover, that consent to deck stowage sufficiently appeared by the bill of lading read \n\n[263 U.S. 119, 124]\n\u00a0\n with the freight agreement and therefore there was no departure and no ground for assessing damages.\n The court below sustained the position of the respondent and decreed accordingly. The St. Johns N. F. (C. C. A.) 280 Fed. 553.\n We find no conflict between the written original freight contract and the bill of lading. The former referred to a bill thereafter to be issued and made the place of stowage optional with the ship. When issued under such circumstances the bill amounted to a declaration that the option had been exercised and the goods would go under deck.\n We are not dealing with a case arising under a general port custom permitting above deck stowage notwithstanding a clean bill, with notice of which all shippers are charged. When there is no such custom and no express contract in a form available as evidence, a clean bill of lading imports under deck stowage. The Delaware, 14 Wall. 579, 602, 604, 605. Upon this implication respondent had the right to rely. To say that the shipper assented to stowage on deck is not correct. It gave the vessel an option, and the clean bill of lading amounted to a positive representation by her that this had been exercised and that the goods would go under deck.\n By stowing the goods on deck the vessel broke her contract, exposed them to greater risk than had been agreed and thereby directly caused the loss. She accordingly became liable as for a deviation, cannot escape by reason of the relieving clauses inserted in the bill of lading for her benefit,1 and must account for the value at \n\n[263 U.S. 119, 125]\n\u00a0\n destination. Generally, the measure of damages for loss of goods by a carrier when liable therefor is their value at the destination to which it undertook to carry them. Lawrence v.

The bill avers that the latter state has, by constructing cut-off ditches and straightening the Mustinka river, increased the speed and volume of its flow into Lake Traverse, and thereby raised the level of the lake, causing its outlet, the Bois de Sioux river, to overflow and greatly to injure a valuable farming area in North Dakota lying on the west bank of that stream. The damage to the complainant in destruction of roads and bridges is alleged to be $5,000, and the \n\n[263 U.S. 365, 372]\n\u00a0\n damage to owners of the farms in destruction of crops and injury to the arable quality of their land, to be more than $1,000,000. A further allegation is that the ditch is likely at every period of high water to cause overflows as injurious as those complained of. The prayer is for an order enjoining the continued use of the ditches and a decree against the state of Minnesota for the damages sustained by the complainant state and its farmers. Minnesota in her answer admits the construction of the ditches for drainage and sanitation, but denies that they caused the overflow complained of, and avers that the flooding was due to unusual rainfall in the successive years of 1914, 1915, and 1916\n\n\n One owning land on a water course may by ditches and drains turn into it all the surface water that would naturally drain there, but he may not thus discharge into the water course more water than it has capacity to carry, and thus burden his lower neighbor with more than is reasonable. In such cases, the injured party is entitled to an injunction. Jackman v. Arlington Mills, 137 Mass. 277; McKee v. Delaware Canal Co., 125 N. Y. 353, 26 N. E. 305, 21 Am. St. Rep. 740; Noonan v.

St. Rep. 414; 1 Farnham on Waters,  488, p. 1633; Gould on Waters,  274.\n If one state by a drainage system turns into an interstate river water in excess of its capacity, and floods its banks in another state, and thus permanently and seriously injures valuable farm lands there, may the latter state have an injunction in this court?\n The jurisdiction and procedure of this court in controversies between states of the Union differ from those which it pursues in suits between private parties. This grows out of the history of the creation of the power, in that it was conferred by the Constitution as a substitute \n\n[263 U.S. 365, 373]\n\u00a0\n for the diplomatic settlement of controversies between sovereigns and a possible resort to force. The jurisdiction is therefore limited generally to disputes which, between states entirely independent, might be properly the subject of diplomatic adjustment. They must be suits 'by a state for an injury to it in its capacity of quasi sovereign. In that capacity the state has an interest independent of and behind the titles of its citizens, in all the earth and air of its domain.'\n'When the states by their union made the forcible abatement of outside nuisances impossible to each, they did not thereby agree to submit to whatever might be done. They did not renounce the possibility of making reasonable demands on the ground of their still remaining quasi sovereign interests, and the alternative to force is a suit in this court.' Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., \n206 \nU.S. 230, 237\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 618, 619 (51 L. Ed. 1038, 11 Ann. Cas. 488).\n\n In accord with this principle, this court has entertained a suit by one state to enjoin the deposit by another state, in an interstate stream, of drainage containing noxious typhoid germs because dangerous to the health of the inhabitants of the former. Missouri v. Illinois, \n180 \nU.S. 208, 241\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 331; Id., \n200 \nU.S. 496, 518\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 268. It has assumed jurisdiction to hear and determine a bill to restrain one state from a diversion of water from an interstate stream by which the lands of a state lower down on the stream may be deprived of the use of its water for irrigation in alleged violation of the right of the lower state. Kansas v. Colorado, \n185 \nU.S. 125, 141\n, 143 S., 22 Sup. Ct. 552; Id., \n206 \nU.S. 46, 95\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 655. In Wyoming v. Colorado, \n259 \nU.S. 419, 464\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 594, it granted relief to one state to prevent another from diverting water from an interstate stream to the injury of rights acquired through prior appropriations of the water by landowners of the former state under the doctrine of appropriation recognized and administered in both states. In Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., supra, it enjoined in behalf of a state the generation and spread of noxious fumes by a \n\n[263 U.S. 365, 374]\n\u00a0\n factory in another state, because it was a public nuisance in destroying crops and forests within the borders of the former state. In Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, \n262 \nU.S. 553, 592\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 658, at the suit of one state, this court has enjoined another state from enforcing its statute by which the flow of natural gas in interstate commerce from the latter state was forbidden, to the threatened loss and suffering of the people of the suing state who had become dependent for comfort and health upon its use. It needs no argument, in the light of these authorities, to reach the conclusion that, where one state by a change in its method of draining water from lands within its border increases the flow into an interstate stream, so that its natural capacity is greatly exceeded and the water is thrown upon the farms of another state, the latter state has such an interest as quasi sovereign in the comfort, health, and prosperity of her farm owners that resort may be had to this court for relief. It is the creation of a public nuisance of simple type for which a state may properly ask an injunction.\n In such action by one state against another the burden on the complainant state of sustaining the allegations of its complaint is much greater than that imposed upon a complainant in an ordinary suit between private parties.\n'Before this court can be moved to exercise its extraordinary power under the Constitution to control the conduct of one state at the suit of another, the ... invasion of rights must be of serious magnitude and it must be established by clear and convincing evidence.'

Ct. 268.\n\n North Dakota, in addition to an injunction, seeks a decree against Minnesota for damages of $5,000 for itself and of $1,000,000 for its inhabitants whose farms were injured and whose crops were lost. It is difficult to see how we can grant a decree in favor of North Dakota \n\n[263 U.S. 365, 375]\n\u00a0\n for the benefit of individuals against the state of Minnesota in view of the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids the extension of the judicial power of the United States to any suit in law or equity prosecuted against any one of the United States by citizens of another state or by citizens and subjects of a foreign state. The evidence discloses that nearly all the Dakota farm owners, whose crops, lands, and property were injured in these floods, contributed to a fund which has been used to aid the preparation and prosecution of this cause. It further appears that each contributor expects to share in the benefit of the decree for damages here sought in proportion to the amount of his loss. Indeed, it is inconceivable that North Dakota is prosecuting this damage feature of its suit without intending to pay over what it thus recovers to those entitled. The question of the power of this court in such a case was very fully considered in New Hampshire v. Louisiana, \n108 U.S. 76\n, 2 Sup. Ct. 176. There citizens of one state held bonds of another state, payment of which was in default. The holders assigned the bonds to their state, which as assignee brought an action in this court to recover a decree for the amount due against the obligee in the bonds. The law of the suing state authorizing the suit provided that on recovery the money should be turned over to the assignors, less the expenses of the litigation. Recovery was held to be forbidden by the Eleventh Amendment and the bill was dismissed. It was argued that as a sovereign the state might press the claims of its citizens against another state, but it was answered by this court that such right of sovereignty was parted with by virtue of the original Constitution in which as a substitute therefor, citizens of one state were permitted to sue another state in their own names, and that when the Eleventh Amendment took away this individual right, it did not restore the privilege of state sovereignty to press such claims. The right of a state as parens patriae to \n\n[263 U.S. 365, 376]\n\u00a0\n bring suit to protect the general comfort, health, or property rights of its inhabitants threatened by the proposed or continued action of another state by prayer for injunction is to be differentiated from its lost power as a sovereign to present and enforce individual claims of its citizens as their trustee against a sister state. For this reason the prayer for a money decree for the damage done by the floods of 1915 and 1916 to the farms of individuals in the Bois de Sioux valley is denied for lack of jurisdiction.\n Having thus pointed out the rules of law which must control our conclusion, we come to consider the much disputed issues of fact upon which our decision as to the injunction prayed turns.\n The boundary line between South Dakota and North Dakota on the west, and Minnesota on the east, runs through the middle of Lake Traverse, and thence north by the channel of the Bois de Sioux river until that river joins the Otter Tail river to make the Red River of the North. Lake Traverse lies in a basin between Minnesota and South Dakota. The east and west line between the two Dakotas is some five miles north of the point of discharge of the lake into the Bois de Sioux. The basin is the bed of an ancient lake formed by glacial action. The present lake reaches from southwest to northeast, has an average width of more than 2 miles and is with its extended ponds and swamps about twenty miles long. To the south it has high rocky banks and is a real lake. As it extends toward the north, it is divided into smaller lakes or ponds or sloughs by deltas from entering streams. The Mustinka river reaches the lake at its northern end just beyond the region of its high banks and makes a delta walling off Mud Lake. The Bois de Sioux flows north and is a sluggish stream, with low marshy banks for 15 miles to a point opposite where the Rabbit river enters from the Minnesota side. Beyond that, its \n\n[263 U.S. 365, 377]\n\u00a0\n banks grow higher. It flows down the eastern side of its basin so that the Minnesota lowlands on its bank are of small area.\n The watershed for Lake Traverse and the Bois de Sioux as far as the mouth of the Rabbit river, but not including the watershed of that river, is 1,442 square miles, of which 924 miles are in Minnesota and 518 miles are in the Dakotas. Of the 924 miles of Minnesota watershed, 131 miles drain directly into the lake, and 793 miles drain through the Mustinka. Of these, the drainage from 105 miles enters below the ditches and tributaries which play any part in our problem. It will thus be seen that the drainage into the lake and the Bois de Sioux from the Mustinka river and the ditches, here under consideration, is from a watershed of 688 miles, or something less than 50 per cent. of the whole watershed by the run-off from which the basin of the Bois de Sioux in 1915 and 1916 was overflowed. The Mustinka watershed extends northeast from Lake Traverse acrose a level prairie country, embracing much of Traverse county and part of Grant county, Minn., until it reaches on the east, north and south a much higher level of hills and hollows with lakes and standing pools called in this case the Moraine Zone. The trend of the Mustinka river bed upwards from the lake is at first to the northeast some 20-odd miles to a point where Twelve Mile creek enters the river from the south, thence easterly several miles to where Five Mile creek enters the river also from the south. Above this point, the river is known as the Upper Mustinka. Of these three constitutents, Twelve Mile creek is the dominant stream draining 364 miles, or 54 per cent., of the whole Mustinka watershed. Five Mile creek drains 121 square miles, or 16 2\/3 per cent., while the Upper Mustinka drains 203 square miles, or 29 per cent. The Upper Mustinka is a winding, crooked stream with banks not always well defined, and with a fall in its \n\n[263 U.S. 365, 378]\n\u00a0\n channel of 2.25 feet to the mile. Five Mile creek is less crooked, but with low banks easily overflowed and a slope of 5 feet in the mile. Twelve Mile creek has a slope in its channel of 2 2\/3 feet for 9 miles and 1 1\/4 feet in the next three. It has higher banks than the others and a more marked channel and rarely overflows.\n The original Mustinka ditch was intended to drain farm lands in Grant county, east of Traverse county, and was built before 1900 from a point in the Upper Mustinka near the town of Norcross in a westerly direction along the valley of that stream some 7 miles, cutting off its curves and crossing the Five Mile creek south of its confluence with the Mustinka, and emptying at right angles into Twelve Mile creek. There was a great flood, due to a succession of wet years, in 1906 and 1907. The farmers in the lower watersheds of the Five Mile and Twelve Mile creeks concluded that the state ditch, as it was called, was the cause of the flooding, and in a petition they asked the Legislature by further work to relieve them from danger of future overflows. The Legislature was thus induced to pass an act in 1911 (Laws Minn. 1911, c. 138) containing a preamble, on the recitals of which North Dakota strongly relies to support its case as admissions of Minnesota. The preamble recited that the ditch constructed before 1900 to drain lands in Grant county had in crop seasons of several years caused the flooding of 8,000 acres of farm land in Traverse county never before overflowed, to the damage of farmers in that county of $28, 000, and had created a condition dangerous to the health of the inhabitants. The act then proceeded to authorize the expenditure of $35, 000 by the state drainage commissioners to remedy the situation. The money was expended in the building of a cut-off ditch 2 1\/2 miles in length, which continued the old ditch at right angles across the Twelve Mile creek to the main channel of the Mustinka, and also in the straightening of the river from the mouth of the cut-off \n\n[263 U.S. 365, 379]\n\u00a0\n to the lake, a distance of some 15 miles. The bend in the Mustinka which the new ditch cut off was about 7 miles long, thus saving some 5 miles in flow of the water. The straightening of the river below the cut-off shortened the river's course from that point to the lake 3 miles. Halfway down to the lake the river runs by the town of Wheaton, near which in 1916 there was, notwithstanding these improvements, a wide and prolonged overflow of its banks.\n The evidence in the case consisted, first, of the testimony of farmers in the overflow region in the valley of the Bois de Sioux, as to the extent of the flood and their losses in 1915 and 1916; second, of farmers in the Mustinka watershed as to the floods of 1915 and 1916 and the effect in their neighborhood; and, third, of expert engineers and a geologist as to the part played by the ditches in these floods.\n The engineers who were called by North Dakota said that the immediate cause of overflow was the maintenance in Lake Traverse of a high-water level of 977 feet above the sea during part of the summer of 1915 and all of 1916; that this was 3 feet above the mean lake level of 974 feet; that the last foot or more of this rise was caused by the state ditching of the Mustinka, which prolonged the floods two summer seasons. One of these witnesses, Ralph, who had been state drainage engineer, first of Minnesota and then of North Dakota, and who seems to have been employed to prepare the case for the latter state, says that the ditching on the Mustinka raised the lake from 1 to 1 1\/2 feet in 1916. Dean Shenehon, another engineer expert, says that, when the lake is at a mean height of 974, the Minnesota ditches are responsible for a permanent increase in the level of from 3 to 6 inches, say 4 inches, and that in time of flood, when the lake rises to 977, the ditches account for 10 inches. The varying estimates of these two principal \n\n[263 U.S. 365, 380]\n\u00a0\n witnesses for North Dakota do not seem to rest on definitely ascertained data. We have no government or other gaugings of the flow from the Mustinka into the lake before the cut-off was completed in 1915. The first of such gaugings was taken near Wheaton in March, 1916. The cubic feet of flow into the lake from the Mustinka, before the cut-off ditch was constructed, is therefore a matter of judgment rather than calculation, dependent on the probable run-off during the period of floods from the watershed, the extend of detaining basins that then existed, the possible evaporation under then conditions, the cross-sections of the present ditches compared with probable cross-sections of the channel of the old river as it was before the ditches and the straightening of the river, and the extent to which it then overflowed its banks in time of flood. Most of these factors and their effect were a matter of unsatisfactory estimate in the absence of actual gaugings and measurements of the flow into the lake from the old Mustinka in a state of nature. The situation was indeed complex, as Dean Shenehon expressed it. He said he could not say definitely how large a detaining basin was destroyed by the new work. He left the subject with this general statement:\n'I looked over that country, and in may judgment all that comples of cut-off canals, and state ditches, and improved Mustinka river, from the outlet of the cut-off to Lake Traverse,\n\n'I looked over that country, and in my judgment all that complex of cut-off canals, and flood conditions substantially 50 per cent. ... I have viewed the conditions, and in my judgment as an engineer, which is the best judgment I can give you, the run-off is 50 per cent. greater than in a state of nature.'\n\n Having thus reached the proportion of increase, the witness' estimate was that the flow into the lake from the Mustinka in a state of nature was 1,600 cubic second feet, and that the ditching by the state added 800 cubic \n\n[263 U.S. 365, 381]\n\u00a0\n feet, and that increase accounted for maintenance of the high lake level and the continuous flood complained of. the assumption that there was what Ralph called the delta zone, covering from 70 to 100 called the delta zona, covering from 70 to 100 square miles lying immediately east of Twelve Mile creek and extending east toward the Upper Mustinka, and north beyond the line of the cut-off and old ditch. Both Ralph and Shenehon maintained that this was a low, moist, marshy region, with a rim which acted as a retaining basin for the overflowed waters of the confluence of the three Mustinka constituent streams, and that the cut-off, by draining this, prevented the former heavy loss by evaporation, accelerated the flow, and increased the volume of the water carried down to the lake by one-half, and would give every recurring flood the same effect.\n Ralph also insisted that in the state of nature, before the ditching, whenever there was high water in the Mustinka, the water flowed north over a ridge or low height of land into the sources of the Rabbit river in Tintah Slough; that thus a very considerable amount was carried directly to the Bois de Sioux basin, some 15 miles north of the lake; and that by this diversion the level of the lake was kept lower. Now, he said, the cut- off made this diversion negligible, and of course added to the flow into the lake. The weight of the evidence, however, is that it has only been when the level of the Mustinka river at the confluence with the Twelve Mile creek exceeds the height of 998 feet above the sea, that it has flowed into the Rabbit river; that it reached this height during the summers of 1915 and 1916; and that then the same amount of water flowed over into the Rabbit creek as formerly. While in a general way Ralph was corroborated by Dean Shenehon and Professor Chandler, another expert witness, neither of these attached \n\n[263 U.S. 365, 382]\n\u00a0\n much importance to the part played by the diversion into the Rabbit river from the Mustinka either before or after the state ditching works.\n The case for North Dakota was much weakened by the weight of evidence showing that the great detaining basin in the so-called delta zone was nonexistent. The testimony of three engineering experts and a geologist called by Minnesota, who examined the watershed, as well as the numerous farmers and old-time residents who lived on, and successfully cultivated, all of the delta zone, was convincing to show that the land was ordinary prairie land, with an inclination to the north and northwest of 5 feet in a mile down to the Mustinka, and without any rim or rising border to make a detaining basin. The slope of the zone was said by one competent witness to be greater than that of much of the fertile prairie lands of Illinois. There were only two places in the neighborhood which could be described as possible detaining basins. One was the Redpath Slough which yields wild hay in a dry season and covers an area of 6 or 7 square miles. The other was Tintah Slough, a basin of like character, already referred to as one of the sources of the Rabbit river and not in the Mustinka watershed.\n The testimony adduced by the defendant state tended to show that the new cut-off which had been constructed to avoid floods in this region in high water was not regarded as effective by whose who had pressed for its construction, because in times of flood, their lands were overflowed apparently as much as before. There was substantial evidence that the cut- off did not run full in times of the highest water because of the obstruction from the onrush at such times of the Twelve Mile creek at right angles across the union of the old and new ditches. The Twelve Mile creek thus dominated the ditches to such an extent that it carried much of its water north to its old confluence with the Upper Mustinka, and round the old \n\n[263 U.S. 365, 383]\n\u00a0\n bend of that stream of 6 or 7 miles. The result, as estimated by Minnesota's witnesses, was that the old bend at the crest of the flood carried twice as much water as the cut-off.\n Professor Bass for Minnesota testified that at the time of flood it took 9 hours for the water by way of the cut-off from Twelve Mile creek to reach the lake and 13 hours by way of the old bend, and his estimate was that before the cut-off was built it would have taken 18 hours. This would seem to indicate that the difference in speed of flow into the lake made by the new cut-off in a flood which lasted all summer would be negligible in effect. Doubtless the ditches of the Mustinka helped to carry the water into the lake faster than before they were constructed, but a speedier flow of the same amount of water would in an entire summer of flood have but little effect on the height of the lake, or the overflow in its outlet through the Bois de Sioux valley. Mr. Meyer and Mr. Morgan, witnesses for Minnesota, and both engineers of great experience in floods, say that a more rapid flow into a lake with an outlet will not raise the level of the lake as high as a slower inflow because the more rapid the inflow the greater the opportunity for outflow during the period of rising.\n An additional factor of the high water on the banks of the Bois de Sioux in time of flood, as pointed out by Professor Bass, were in the railroad embankments and county roads crossing the whole sloughlike basin of the Bois de Sioux. These with their limited outlets, he thought, served to dam the flooded river in its sluggish flow. He also called attention to the obstruction by the back water from the discharge of the Rabbit river which delivered itself with such force as to throw gravel and debris over to the opposite bank of the Bois de Sioux. Professor Bass relied on special measurements made for the purpose by \n\n[263 U.S. 365, 384]\n\u00a0\n a competent engineer, of the capacity of the bend, the Twelve Mile creek, and the old ditch and the new cut-off, as well as that of the straightened river between the cut-off and the lake, the extent of the flooding halfway down the river to the lake near Wheaton and the basin of the Bois de Sioux. He testified that, when the lake was at the highest flood level, the added and more rapid flow due to the ditches did not increase this more than 2 inches and was negligible in creating a flood in the Bois de Sioux.\n A marked difference between the evidence of the experts for the complainant and of those for the defendant was in respect to the effect they attributed to the rainfall in 1914, 1915, and 1916. Those for North Dakota insisted that in neither 1915 nor 1916 was there the exceptional rainfall to produce the unusual flood in the Bois de Sioux valley and that this was a significant fact in support of the view that the exceptional overflow in that valley was due to the artificial cut-off and the straightening of the Mustinka river bed. This contention was met and completely overcome by the government records and other evidence of the rainfall and floods in 1915 and 1916 in the whole upper Red River valley. The evidence satisfactorily establishes the fact to be that the flood in 1915 and that in 1916 exceeded any flood in that region for a succession of years since 1881. Great floods seem to have occurred about every 10 years, and to have been the result of excessive precipitation for 3 successive years. One was in 1881. Another of these was in the period of 1895, 1896, and 1897. Another was in the period of 1905, 1906, and 1907, and a third was in the period of 1914, 1915, and 1916. The last two were greater than the second. There was a run-off all over the upper Red River valley in the year 1916 greater than in any period preceding since 1902. There were heavy rains in 1914, so that in October there was an accumulated excess of 3.54 inches. In 1915 the \n\n[263 U.S. 365, 385]\n\u00a0\n excess continued to grow, until in October of that year there was an excess of 7.94 inches. Winter came on when the waters were at flood, and froze them, so that the spring freshets of 1916 were very heavy, and these were succeeded by heavy precipitation in June and July, so that by the fall of 1916 there was an excess of 16.15 inches. The flood was thus continuous during the whole summer season of that year. There was no opportunity to plant in the fall of 1915, because it was so wet, and in 1916 cultivation was impossible. The soil was described as mush. The farmers of all that region, not only in the valley of the Bois de Sioux, but in the Mustinka watershed and elsewhere in the upper valley of the Red river, had only a third or half of a crop in 1915, and in 1916 there was no crop at all, due to excessive and continuous rain.\n It is not contended on behalf of the complainant that the damage from the floods of 1915 and 1916 in the Bois de Sioux were due to the higher flood line reached in those years so much as to the prolonged period during which the waters lay on the flooded area. It is admitted that such freshets were to be expected in the spring from time to time, but it is said that previously they had only lasted from 3 to 8 days, and that the water receded, leaving the land on the banks of the Bois de Sioux cultivable and productive in the proper season. We cannot fail to note, however, that this strip, half a mile to 2 miles wide and 15 miles long, injury to which is complained of, was low and subject to overflow. There were sloughs in it running into the Bois de Sioux, and the government survey showed on the plats that 27 per cent. of it was marshy. Much of the tract was good farming land, except in time of excessive flood, which the history of the region shows, as we have said, was to be expected about every 10 years.\n It is difficult for a court to decide issues of fact upon which experts equal in number and standing differ flatly, \n\n[263 U.S. 365, 386]\n\u00a0\n and when their conclusions rest on estimates upon the correctness of which the court, without technical knowledge, cannot undertake to pass. In such cases, the court looks about for outstanding facts from which the lay mind can safely draw inferences as to the probabilities. The court is also aided by its judgment of the care and accuracy with which the contrasted experts respectively have determined the data upon which they base their conclusions. The experts called by Minnesota in this case seemed to us to use more specific and accurately ascertained data for their estimates than those for North Dakota, and this circumstance, as well as the more satisfactory factory reasons given, lead us to think that their conclusions are more to be depended on.\n When we consider the extent and prolonged period of the floods of 1915 and 1916, covering, as they did, the whole upper valley of the Red river, of which the Mustinka watershed was but a small part, when we note that that watershed is only one-half of what feeds Lake Traverse, when we find that all this upper Red River valley was drenched with continuous rain for two summer seasons, with a frozen flood between them, when it appears that the farmers of the Mustinka valley lost as much of their crops in 1915, and had as total a loss in 1916, as the farmers on the Dakota banks of the Bois de Sioux, when we know that these farmers in the Bois de Sioux are used to frequent floods in the spring for 3 to 8 days because of the low level of their lands, the system of state ditching in the Mustinka sinks into a circumstance of negligible significance in the consideration of the mighty forces of nature which caused these floods. To attribute to such a minor, but constant, artificial incident a phenomenal effect for two whole summer seasons, without a recurrence since, is to fly in the face of all reasonable probability. The evidence must be clear and convincing indeed to support such a theory. Instead of that, it is a \n\n[263 U.S. 365, 387]\n\u00a0\n combination of estimates, and conjecture based on no accurate knowledge of the flow of the Mustinka before the ditches were put in, and depending greatly on a hypothetical detaining basin in the so-called delta zone, existence of which the greater weight of the evidence negatives. Moreover, as already pointed out, the burden of proof that the state of North Dakota must carry in this case is much greater than that imposed on the ordinary plaintiff in a suit between private individuals.\n The possibility of saving these Bois de Sioux lands from recurring floods, whether each year or every 10 years, by controlling and distributing the flow from the lake and making larger its outlet, suggests itself even to the layman. The capacity of the present outlet is between 1, 200 and 1,500 cubic second feet, offering too small opportunity for safe escape of the high water of the lake, which experience shows may be expected in that region. Accordingly, after the first hearing of this case, without reaching a conclusion as to the legal responsibility for the overflow complained of, and with the thought that the court might be able to provide for a proper remedy in its decree, it ordered a rehearing and the taking of supplemental proof, deemed necessary to an adequate consideration and disposition of the cause, as to the possibility and cost of ameliorating the flood conditions by means other than the injunction prayed in the bill. The order specified the projects to which the proof should be directed as follows:\n First, to a project for detaining basins in the Mustinka river watershed.\n Second, to a sluice dam in Lake Traverse.\n Third, to improvements of the Bois de Sioux outlet by increasing its capacity.\n Fourth, to making an outlet from the lake across a height of land into Big Stone Lake which drains into the Mississippi; and \n\n[263 U.S. 365, 388]\n\u00a0\n Fifth, to a larger diversion of the Mustinka river waters into the Rabbit river.\n The court also directed proof as to the flood conditions which had prevailed in the area claimed to have been flooded since the filing of the bill. Three engineers were to be called on each side.\n All the remedies suggested by the court were rejected by the engineers of both sides as impracticable, except those of a sluice dam in lake Traverse and the enlarging of the capacity of the lake outlet through the Bois de Sioux. The engineers for North Dakota thought that such an improvement could be constructed for about $100,000, while the engineers for Minnesota insisted that the dam and dredging provided at that cost would be a mere temporary and unsatisfactory makeshift, and that ampler works needed for a permanent remedy would require an expenditure of from 2 1\/2 to 5 times as much. The evidence further showed that there had been no flooding of the lands in question since the filing of the bill, a period of 6 years, although there had been a very great rainfall and large increases in the flow of the Mustinka river in the spring of 1917, which was followed by a dry season.\n The conclusion we have come to on the issue of fact, that Minnesota is not responsible for the floods of which complaint is made, makes it unnecessary for us to consider this evidence as to a practical remedy for them, and requires us to leave the opinions and suggestions of the expert engineers for the consideration of the two states in a possible effort by either or both to remedy existing conditions in this basin.\n The bill is dismissed without prejudice. \n\n\n\n","180":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF OKLAHOMA v.

This boundary is part of an old one between the territory of the United States and the Spanish possessions to the southwest which was agreed on and defined in the third article of the treaty of 1819. 8 Stat. 252. As to line in question that definition is still controlling; it has been reaffirmed on several occasions, but never changed. The controversy arises chiefly out of diverging views of what the definition means and how it is to be applied. The full treaty provision reads as follows:\n'Article 3. The boundary line between the two countries, west of the Mississippi, shall begin on the Gulph of Mexico, at the mouth of the river Sabine, in the sea, continuing north, along the western bank of that river, to the 32d degree of latitude; thence, by a line due north, to the degree of latitude where it strikes the Rio Roxo of Nachitoches, or Red river; then following the course of the Rio Roxo westward, to the degree of longitude, 100 west from London and 23 from Washington; then, crossing the said Red river, and running thence, by a line due north, to the river Arkansas; thence, following the course of the southern bank of the Arkansas, to its source, in latitude 42 north; and thence, by that parallel of latitude, to the South Sea. The whole being as laid down in Melish's map of the United States, published at Philadelphia, improved to the first of January, 1818. But, if the source of the Arkansas river shall be found to fall north or south of latitude 42, then the line shall run from the said source due south or north, as the case may be, till it meets the \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 624]\n\u00a0\n said parallel of latitude 42, and thence, along the said parallel, to the South Sea: All the islands in the Sabine, and the said Red and Arkansas rivers, throughout the course thus described, to belong to the United States; but the use of the waters, and the navigation of the Sabine to the sea, and of the said rivers Roxo and Arkansas, throughout the extent of the said boundary, on their respective banks, shall be common to the respective inhabitants of both nations.\n\n'The two high contracting parties agree to cede and renounce all their rights, claims, and pretensions, to the territories described by the said line; that is to say: The United States hereby cede to his Catholic Majesty, and renounce forever, all the r rights, claims, and pretensions, to the territories lying west and south of the above- described line; and in like manner, his Catholic Majesty cedes to the said United States, all his rights, claims, and pretensions, to any territories east and north of the said line; and for himself, his heirs, and successors, renounces all claim to the said territories forever.'\n\n In the early stages of the suit the chief point of difference between the parties was that Oklahoma and the United States were claiming the south bank of the river as the boundary, while Texas was contending for the thread or middle of the stream. That difference was disposed of in an opinion delivered April 11, 1921, wherein this court recognized that in the earlier case of United States v. Texas, \n162 U.S. 1\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 725, it had been adjudged that the boundary, as fixed by the treaty, is along the south bank. \n256 U.S. 70\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 420. The purport of that opinion was embodied in an interlocutory decree of June 1, 1921, which also made provision for taking additional evidence and for a further hearing to determine what constitutes the south bank, where along that bank the boundary is, and the proper mode of locating it on the ground-these being matters on which the parties were unable to agree. 256 \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 625]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 608, 41 Sup. Ct. 539. Additional evidence filling several printed volumes was afterwards taken, and the further hearing was had near the close of the last term.\n On the questions of what constitutes the south bank, and where along the same the boundary is, the parties are still far apart. Oklahoma and the United States contend that the bank and boundary are at the foot of a range of hills or bluffs which fringes the south side of the valley through which the river runs, while Texas insists that they are 'at low- water mark' on that side of the river-meaning as is said in the brief 'the edge of the water at that usual and ordinary stage in which it is found during most of the year.' This is now the principal issue and to it the evidence and arguments are largely directed. Its solution involves a consideration of what was intended by the treaty provision and of the physical situation to which the provision is to be applied.\n The treaty provision names three rivers-the Sabine, the Red, and the Arkansas. It expressly locates the boundary along the 'western bank' of the Sabine and the 'southern bank' of the Arkansas, and describes the intermediate section as leaving the Sabine at a designated point and running due north until it 'strikes' the Red, then 'following the course' of the Red westward to the 100th meridian, then 'crossing' the Red and running due north to the Arkansas. Thus, while the boundary is in exact words fixed along a designated bank of the Sabine and the Arkansas, it is not expressly so fixed as respects the Red. This difference in terms, if not otherwise overcome, might well be taken as signifying a difference in purpose. But that it has no such signification is otherwise made plain. We say this, first, because the direction for 'crossing' the Red at the 100th meridian on a line running north strongly implies that the preceding course is somewhere on the southerly side of the river; secondly, because the declaration that 'the use of the waters, and \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 626]\n\u00a0\n the navigation of the Sabine to the sea, and of the said rivers Roxo [Red] and Arkansas, throughout the extent of the said boundary, on their respective banks,' shall be common to the respective inhabitants of both nations, distinctly shows that a bank boundary is intended along the Red just as along the Sabine and the Arkansas; and, thirdly, because available historical data relating to the negotiations which culminated in the treaty show indubitably that those who framed and signed it on behalf of the United States and Spain intended to establish, and understood they were establishing, a bank boundary along all three rivers. 4 American State Papers, Foreign Relations, p. 621, 622; 4 Memoirs of John Quincy Adams, pp. 255, 256, 260, 261, 266-270; United States v. Texas, \n162 \nU.S. 1, 27\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 725. The words 'throughout the extent of the said boundary, on their respective banks,' are the last by which the treaty provision denotes the relation of the boundary to the rivers, and, as those words are otherwise supported, they point with controlling force to what was in the minds of the high contracting parties. It follows from these considerations that the meaning of the treaty provision is just what it would be if the Red river section of the boundary were expressly described as along the south bank.\n We therefore are concerned with an instance in which the bank of a river, and not the river itself, has been made the boundary between two nations-now between two states of the Union.\n In many jurisdictions it is settled that there is a material difference between taking the bank of a river as a boundary and taking the river itself, and this rule has been recognized and applied by this court from an early time in the adjudication of controversies over state boundaries.\n During the Revolutionary period Virginia ceded to the United States all her 'territory northwest of the river \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 627]\n\u00a0\n Ohio.' Afterwards Kentucky and Indiana were admitted into the Union as states, with the southerly or initial line of that cession as the boundary between them. A controversy over that boundary was brought before this court in Handly's Lessee v. Anthony, 5 Wheat. 374. The question presented was whether the boundary was along low-water mark or at the line reached by the river when at medium height. In an opinion delivered by Chief Justice Marshall the court held the boundary was along low water mark, but was careful to say:\n'In pursuing this inquiry, we must recollect that it is not the bank of the river, but the river itself, at which the cession of Virginia commences.'\n\n Mr. Justice Story participated in the decision of that case and concurred in the opinion. Subsequently, when holding the Circuit Court for the District of Maine, he had occasion to interpret two conveyances of land adjacent to a stream in that state. One tract was described as bounded by the stream from one point to another, and the other as bounded by the bank of the stream from one point to another. The learned Justice was of opinion that the two bounding lines were essentially unlike, and he held as to the first tract that the conveyance included the flats below the bank at least to low-water mark, and as to the second that the conveyance limited the grant to the bank, and excluded the flats below. Thomas v. Hatch, 3 Sumn. 170, Fed. Cas. No. 13,899.\n A controversy over the boundary between Georgia and Alabama was before this court in Howard v. Ingersoll, 13 How. 381. The boundary had been defined in a cession by Georgia to the United States as beginning on the western bank of the Chattahoochee river where it crosses a stated line and running thence up the river 'along the western bank thereof' to the great bend. See 1 American State Papers, Public Lands, pp. 113-114. The nature of the controversy was such that it called for an interpretation and application of the words just quoted. \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 628]\n\u00a0\n At the locus there was an abrupt and high bank on the western, or Alabama, side which was washed by the river in periods of ordinary high water. In periods of low water, which comprised two-thirds of the year, a sloping strip of from 30 to 60 yards of dry land lay between the abrupt bank and the water. The flowing stream was about 200 yards wide in periods of ordinary high water and about 30 yards in periods of low water. At that point the water never reached the top of the abrupt bank, but at other points, where the bank was lower, the water in exceptional times of flood overflowed the bank and temporarily submerged adjacent lands. The case was tried in an Alabama court, which ruled that the boundary was at the line of ordinary low water. That ruling was sustaine by the Supreme Court of the state (17 Ala. 780), and the case was brought here on writ of error. Another case involving the same questions, and brought here from the Circuit Court for the District of Georgia, was heard at the same time, but a description of the first suffices for present purposes. This court, upon much consideration, held that the boundary was not at the line of ordinary low water, but along the water-washed bank or elevation which bounds the river bed and confines the water within definite outer limits, save in the exceptional instances when it is so far at flood that it overflows its restraining banks and spreads over adjacent lands. The ruling and the grounds on which it was put are indicated in the following excerpts from the opinion:\n 13 How. 415: 'When the commissioners used the words 'bank' and 'river,' they did so in the popular sense of both. When banks of rivers were spoken of, those boundaries were meant which contain their waters at their highest flow, and in that condition they make what is called the bed of the river. They knew that rivers have banks, shores, water, and a bed, and that the outer line on the bed of a river, on either side of it, may be distinguished \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 629]\n\u00a0\n upon every stage of its water, high or low; at its highest or lowest current. It neither takes in overflowed land beyond the bank, nor includes swamps or low grounds liable to be overflowed, but reclaimable for meadows or agriculture, or which, being too low for reclamation, though not always covered with water, may be used for cattle to range upon, as natural or uninclosed pasture. But it may include spots lower than the bluff or bank, whether there is or is not a growth upon them, not forming a part of that land which, whether low or high, we know to be upland or fast lowland, if such spots are within the bed of the river. Such a line may be found upon every river, from its source to its mouth. It requires no scientific exploration to find or mark it out. The eye traces it in going either up or down a river, in any stage of water. With such an understanding of what a river is, as a whole, from its parts, there is no difficulty in fixing the boundary line in question.'\n 13 How. 417: 'The call is for the bank, the fast land which confines the water of the river in its channel or bed in its whole width, that is to be the line. The bank or the slope from the bluff or perpendicular of the bank may not be reached by the water for two-thirds of the year, still the water line impressed upon the bank above the slope is the line required by the commissioners, and the shore of the river, though left dry for any time, and but occasionally covered by water in any stage of it to the bank, was retained by Georgia as the river up to that line. Wherever it may be found, it is a part of the state of Georgia, and not a part of Alabama. Both bank and bed are to be ascertained by inspection, and the line is where the action of the water has permanently marked itself upon the soil.'\n 13 How. 418: 'Our interpretation ... is that the western line of Georgia ... is a line to run up the \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 630]\n\u00a0\n river on and along its western bank, and that the jurisdiction of Georgia in the soil extends over to the line which is washed by the water, wherever it covers the bed of the river within its banks. The permanent fast land bank is referred to as governing the line.'\n The members of the court all agreed that the call 'along the western bank' distinguished the case from that of Handly's Lessee v. Anthony, and that the Alabama court had erred in treating the ordinary low water as the boundary intended; but three members, while concurring in the judgment of reversal to that extent, differed from the court's reasoning and conclusion in other respects.\n That was a private litigation, and seven years later the same questions-this time covering the full length of the boundary-were presented to this court by the two states. Alabama v. Georgia, 23 How. 505. Alabama claimed the 'usual or common low-water mark' as the boundary, and Georgia contended for 'the western bank at high-water mark, using 'highwater mark' in the sense of the highest water line of the river's bed, or, in other words, the highest water line of that bed, where the passage of water is sufficiently frequent to be marked by a difference in soil and vegetable growth.' Alabama asserted and George admitted that the banks of the river, though abrupt and high at some places, were low and relatively flat at others, and that at the latter, when the river was high, the water overflowed the outer limits of its bed and spread over adjacent lands-at some places as much as a half mile. The controversy thus presented was disposed of in an opinion having the approval of the entire court. The court said:\n 23 How. 511: 'In making such construction, it is necessary to keep in mind that there was by the contract of cession a mutual relinquishment of claims by the contracting parties, the United States ceding to Georgia all its right, \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 631]\n\u00a0\n title, etc., to the territory lying east of that line, and Georgia ceding to the United States all its right and title to the territory west of it.'\n 23 How. 514: 'With these authorities and the pleadings of this suit in view, all of us reject the low-water mark claimed by Alabama as the line that was intended by the contract of cession between the United States and Georgia. And all of us concur in this conclusion, that by the contract of cession, Georgia ceded to the United States all of her lands west of a line beginning on the western bank of the Chattachoochee river where the same crosses the boundary line between the United States and Spain, running up the said Chattahoochee river and along the western bank thereof.\n'We also agree and decide that this language implies that there is ownership of soil and jurisdiction in Georgia in the bed of the river Chattahoochee, and that the bed of the river is that portion of its soil which is alternately covered and left bare, as there may be an increase or diminution in the supply of water, and which is adequate to contain it at its average and mean stage during the entire year, without reference to the extraordinary freshets of the winter or spring, or the extreme droughts of the summer or autumn.\n\n'The western line of the cession on the Chattahoochee river must be traced on the water line of the acclivity of the western bank, and along that bank where that is defined, and in such places on the river where the western bank is not defined, it must be continued up the river on the line of its bed, as that is made by the average and mean stage of the water, as that is expressed in the conclusion of the preceding paragraph of this opinion.'\n\n Upon the authority of these cases, and upon principle as well, we hold that the bank intended by the treaty provision is the water-washed and relatively permanent elevation or acclivity at the outer line of the river bed which \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 632]\n\u00a0\n separates the bed from the adjacent upland, whether valley or hill, and serves to confine the waters within the bed and to preserve the course of the river, and that the boundary intended is on and along the bank at the average or mean level attained by the waters in the periods when they reach and wash the bank without overflowing it. When we speak of the bed we include all of the area which is kept practically bare of vegetation by the wash of the waters of the river from year to year in their onward course, although parts of it are left dry for months at a time; and we exclude the lateral valleys, which have the characteristics of relatively fast land and usually are covered by upland grasses and vegetation, although temporarily overflowed in exceptional instances when the river is at flood.\n The conclusion that the boundary intended is on and along the bank and not at low-water mark or any other point within the river bed has full confirmation in available h storical data respecting the negotiations which attended the framing and signing of the treaty. 4 American State Papers, Foreign Relations, pp. 621, 622; 4 Memoris of John Quincy Adams, pp. 255, 256, 260, 261, 266-270.\n Texas places some reliance on the concluding words of the treaty provision, 'but the use of the waters, and the navigation of the Sabine to the sea, and of the said rivers Roxo [Red] and Arkansas, throughout the extent of the said boundary, on their respective banks shall be common to the respective inhabitants of both nations.' As already observed, these words show that the boundary intended is 'on' the bank. No doubt they reserve and secure a right of access to the water, at all stages, adequate to the enjoyment of the permitted use; but they afford no basis for regarding the boundary as below the bank or within the river bed. Dunlap v. Stetson, 4 Mason, 349, 366, Fed. Cas. No. 4,164. This part of the treaty provision is quite unlike the old compact considered in Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 633]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 577, 30 Sup. Ct. 630, which gave to the citizens of Virginia full property in the shore of the Potomac, and so carried the jurisdiction and title to the water's edge. See Handly's Lessee v. Anthony, 5 Wheat. 374, 385. In an earlier opinion disposing of other phases of this suit it was determined that the section of the Red river adjacent to this boundary is not navigable. \n258 U.S. 574\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 406.\n Texas refers to the proceedings in 1840 and 1841 whereby the United States and the Republic of Texas jointly traced and marked so much of the treaty boundary as lies along the western bank of the Sabine, and claims that what was done makes for a view different from that here expressed. We do not so understand the proceedings. Gen. Hunt, who represented the Republic of Texas in that undertaking, took the position that portions of the river bed often immersed could be treated as the bank and that low- water mark should be regarded as the boundary. Mr. Overton, who represented the United States, dissented and said:\n'The term 'bank' does not imply, I conceive, a line of the character proposed by you, but it rather means that natural barrier which confines the waters, and compels them to flow within a well-defined channel, although the surface of the river may fluctuate in elevation between its banks at various seasons of the year. The same conception of the meaning of this term precludes on my part the idea that it would be just to claim the western margin of any inundations caused by the river overflowing its banks, because in such cases the usual well-defined barrier is temporarily surmounted.'\n\n Mr. Overton's view prevailed and, as nearly as can be told now, the work proceeded on the view that the boundary was along the mean water line on what he defined as the bank. H. R. Ex. Dec. 51.\n With what was intended by the treaty provision in mind, we turn to the physical situation to which the provision is to be applied. \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 634]\n\u00a0\n This section of the Red river flows eastward in a serpentine course through a valley bordered on either side by a range of bluffs or hills. The distance along the river is 539 miles, and on a direct line 321 miles. The valley widens irregularly from about 2 miles on the west to 15 or more on the east. The bed over which the water flows is composed of light, loose sand, and is of varying breadth, the maximum being 1 1\/4 miles and the average one-third of a mile. On either side are stretches of valley land which vary in both width and length by reason of the winding of the river and the irregularities in the face of the bluffs. This land is fairly covered with grasses and other upland growth, and often is studded with trees. Many of the trees are old, and among them are elm, pecan, and other kinds of hard wood. A slight depression or a succession of depressions usually lies along the foot of the bluffs. The river or a channel may have been there in years that are gone, but, if so, no one k ows when. Almost uniformly the valley land is separated from the sand bed of the river by a clearly defined waterworn bank, designated by witnesses and counsel as a cut bank. This bank ranges in height from 2 to 10 or more feet, the height generally increasing from west to east and the lower parts usually being where the bed is wide. On the valley side of the bank is vegetation and on the river side bare sand. The cut banks effectively confine the water to the sand bed, save in exceptional instances, when the river is at flood and overflows adjacent lands for a few days. There is some overflowing almost every year and in one year out of 12 or 15 the overflow reaches back to the bluffs in many places.\n When the water is in substantial volume, it flows over the whole of the sand bed and washes both banks; but when the volume is relatively low, much of the bed is dry. The latter is the prevailing condition, and this because the source and upper reaches of the river are within a \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 635]\n\u00a0\n region where the rainfall is light, seasonal only, and quickly carried into the stream. Along the western part of the boundary the bed is entirely dry in long stretches for weeks at a time; and when the water is flowing, but low, it is found in shallow channels, which divide and shift about over the bed. Witnesses accustomed to crossing there speak of finding the flowing channel near one side of the bed in the morning and in the middle or near the other side in the evening. Only in pronounced bends are the channels relatively stable. Along the eastern part of the boundary the volume of water always is substantial, but there again it is inclined to divide into separate channels and to cross and recross the bed frequently. Along both parts, when the water is low, as is the rule, the channels in which it moves have low marginal elevations, but these are composed of mere sand, have no permanency, and yield readily to the action of the water and the winds. Material changes in them are habitual, not exceptional.\n This survey of the physical situation demonstrates that the banks of the river are neither the ranges of bluffs which mark the exterior limits of the valley, nor the low shifting elevations within the sand bed. And that this is the natural and reasonable view of the situation is illustrated by a long course of public and private action.\n The valley land always has been dealt with as upland. The United States serveyed and disposed of that on the north side under its public land and Indian laws, and Texas surveyed and disposed of that on the south side under her land laws. Both treated the cut banks as the river banks and carried their surveys to those banks, but not beyond. Patents were issued for practically all the land. Individuals freely sought and dealt with it as upland. Much of that on the south side was disposed of by Texas 50 years ago, some of it 70. Thousands of acres on that side were improved, occupied, and cultivated under these disposals, and a larger acreage was occupied \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 636]\n\u00a0\n and used under them for pastures. Through the long period covered by this course of action there never was any suggestion that this valley land was part of the river bed, nor that the shifting elevations of said within the sand bed were the river's banks, nor that the land on the south side belonged to the United States. Not until some land on the south side and part of the river bed were discovered to be valuable for oil was this unbroken course of action and opinion drawn in question. However much the oil discovery may affect values, it has no bearing on the questions of boundary and title.\n Our conclusion is that the cut bank along the southerly side of the sand bed constitutes the south bank of the river, and that the boundary is on and along that bank at the mean level of the water, when it washes the bank without overflowing it.\n The boundary as it was in 1821, when the treaty became effective, is the boundary of to-day, subject to the right application of the doctrines of erosio and accretion and of avulsion to any intervening changes. Of those doctrines this Court recently said:\n'It is settled beyond the possibility of dispute that, where running streams are the boundaries between states, the same rule applies as between private proprietors, namely, that when the bed and channel are changed by the natural and gradual processes known as erosion and accretion, the boundary follows the varying course of the stream; while if the stream from any cause, natural or artificial, suddenly leaves its old bed and forms a new one, by the process known as an avulsion, the resulting change of channel works no change of boundary, which remains in the middle of the old channel.' Arkansas v. Tennessee, \n246 \nU.S. 158, 173\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 301, 304 (62 L. Ed. 638, L. R. A. 1918D, 258).\n\n Oklahoma and the United States question the applicability of the doctrine of erosion and accretion to this river, particularly the part in western Oklahoma, and \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 637]\n\u00a0\n this because of the rapid and material changes effected during rises in the river. But we think the habit of this river is so like that of the Missouri in this regard that the ruling relating to the latter in Nebraska v. Iowa, \n143 \nU.S. 359, 368\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 396, 399 (36 L. Ed. 186) is controlling. It was there said:\n'The Missouri river is a winding stream, coursing through a valley of varying width, the substratum of whose soil, a deposit of distant centuries, is largely of quicksand. ... The large volume of water pouring down at the time of these rises, with the rapidity of its current, has great and rapid action upon the loose soil of its banks. Whenever it impinges with direct attack upon the bank at a bend of the stream, and that bank is of the loose sand obtaining in the valley of the Missouri, it is not strange that the abrasion and washing away is rapid and great. Frequently, where above the loose substratum of sand there is a deposit of comparatively solid soil, the washing out of the underlying sand causes an instantaneous fall of quite a length and breadth of the superstratum of soil into the river; so that it may, in one sense of the term, be said that the diminution of the banks is not gradual and imperceptible, but sudden and visible. ... No engineering skill is sufficient to say where the earth in the bank, washed away and disintegrating into the river, finds its rest and abiding place. The falling bank has passed into the floating mass of earth and water, and the particles of earth may rest one or 50 miles below, and upon either shore. There is, no matter how rapid the process of subtraction or addition, no detachment of earth from the one side and deposit of the same upon the other. The only thing which distinguishes this river from other streams, in the matter of accretion, is in the rapidity of the change caused by the velocity of the current; and this in itself, in the very nature of things, works no change in the principle underlying the rule of law in respect thereto.\n\n'Our conclusions are that, notwithstanding the rapidity of the changes in the course of the channel, and the \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 638]\n\u00a0\n washing from the one side and on to the other, the law of accretion controls on the Missouri river, as elsewhere, and that not only in respect to the rights of individual land owners, but also in respect to the boundary lines between states.'\n\n Common experience suggests that there probably have been changes in this stretch of the Red river since 1821, but they cannot be merely conjectured. The party asserting material changes should carry the burden of proving them, whether they be recent or old. Some changes are shown here and conceded. Others are asserted on one side and denied on the other.\n A controverted one is ascribed to the so-called Big Bend area, which is within the oil field. That area is now on the south side of the river and connected with the bluffs on that side. Oklahoma and the United States assert that in 1821 a channel of the river ran between it and the bluffs, and that the iver has since abandoned that channel. Texas denies this, and insists that the situation in 1821 was practically as now. Stimulated by the large values involved, the parties have exhausted the avenues of research and speculation in presenting testimony thought to bear on this question. The testimony, particularly of the experts, is conflicting. It is so voluminous that it does not admit of extended statement or discussion here. We can only refer to important features and give our conclusions.\n There are no surveys or records depicting the situation in 1821; nor are there any human witnesses who knew this part of the river then. But there are inanimate witnesses, such as old trees, which tell a good deal. At that place the river makes a pronounced, but gradual, bend to the north and back to the south. The area in question is on the inner side of the bend. It is larger now than 60 years ago, but how much is uncertain. The enlargement is the result of intervening accretions. The \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 639]\n\u00a0\n habit of the river is to erode the outer bank of a bend and to accrete to the opposite bank. Three surveys executed by Texas in 1856, and covering less than the whole area, disclose the presence at that time of over 1,700 acres. On the outer part are physical evidences of the formation being comparatively recent. On the inner part are like evidences of the formation being old, among them being the presence of living trees more than a century old. One of the trees, a pecan, attained an age of 170 years. A part of the area was cultivated, and the remainder used for pasturage, as early as 1877. At that time there were more trees than now. Many were taken by early settlers for firewood, fencing posts, and building logs; some logs being over 3 feet through. To overcome the inference arising from the presence of the old trees, which were well scattered, testimony was presented to show that in 1821 these trees were all on islands, which afterwards were consolidated amongst themselves and with the land on the south side. We think this testimony is essentially speculative, and not a proper basis for judgment. In this area, as elsewhere in the valley, a succession of depressions is found at the foot of the bluffs, and some testimony was produced to show that in 1821 the river, or a part of it, flowed there. It may be that the river was there long ago, but the testimony that it was there in 1821 is far from convincing. Texas has been exercising jurisdiction over the area and asserting proprietorship of the soil for more than half a century, and has surveyed and disposed of it all; the earliest disposals being in 1856. Some of the later surveys seem to conflict with those first made, but all name the river bank as a boundary. In those of 1856, and possibly others, it was the controlling call. See Schnackenberg v. State (Tex. Civ. App.) 229 S. W. 934; Cordell Petroleum Co. v. Michna (C. C. A.) 276 Fed. 483. The jurisdiction and title of Texas stood unchallenged until shortly before this suit. Our conclusion is \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 640]\n\u00a0\n that the claim that the river, or any part of it, ran south of this area in 1821, is not sustained. So the boundary follows the cut bank around the northerly limit of the area.\n Burke Bet Island and Goat Island, both near the Big Bend area, are claimed by Texas on the theory that in 1821 they were part of the land on the south side. We think the evidence, all considered, falls short of establishing the claim, and tends rather to show that neither island was ever part of the permanent fast land on that side. The claim is accordingly rejected.\n What now appears to be an island opposite mile post 575 and near the line between Hardeman and Wilbarger counties, in Texas, is claimed by that state to have been part of the land on the south side up to 1902 and then severed from it by avulsive action in time of flood. The evidence sustains the claim. So the boundary follows the north bank of the island.\n There are instances in which the river since 1821 has in time of flood left its form r channel and cut a new one through a neck of land, thereby causing land theretofore on one side of the river to be on the other. Such avulsive action does not carry the boundary with it, but leaves it where it was before. There is no controversy about these cut- offs, and the evidence indicates that they readily can be recognized.\n The matter of running, locating, and marking the boundary upon the ground in accordance with the principles stated herein will be referred to three commissioners to be appointed by the court, their action to be subject to its approval.\n The parties may submit within 30 days a form of decree to carry these conclusions into effect.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, dissenting.\n The parties to the compact of 1819 (ratified 1821) distinctly avowed the purpose 'to settle and terminate all \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 641]\n\u00a0\n their differences and pretensions by a treaty which shall designate with precision the limits of their respective bordering territories in North America.' And when all of its provisions are given proper weight, I think that instrument fixes the international boundary with reasonable precision at low-water mark on the south side of the Red river-not at the margin of the 'cut bank.'\n'It is a general principle of construction with respect to treaties that they shall be liberally construed, so as to carry out the apparent intention of the parties to secure equality and reciprocity between them. As they are contracts between independent nations, in their construction words are to be taken in their ordinary meaning, as understood in the public law of nations, and not in any artificial or special sense impressed upon them by local law, unless such restricted sense is clearly intended. And it has been held by this court that where a treaty admits of two constructions, one restrictive of rights that may be claimed under it and the other favorable to them, the latter is to be preferred.' Geofroy v. Riggs, \n133 \nU.S. 258, 271\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 295, 298 (33 L. Ed. 642).\n\n Under United States v. Texas, \n162 U.S. 1\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 725, and Oklahoma v. Texas, \n256 U.S. 70\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 420, we must interpolate 'southern bank' into the description of the contested boundary and treat this as though it read, 'then following the course of the [southern bank of the] Rio Roxo westward, to the degree of longitude 100 west from London,' etc. Thus amended, we should now interpret the compact with a view to effectuate the intention of the parties.\n A bank is the rising ground, or area, bordering a stream. To describe a boundary merely as following the course of the river bank gives it no definite location. Something more must be known before it can be laid down on the ground, e. g., that it runs with the low, ordinary, or high water mark. To ascertain this something more, when the application of a treaty is involved, the purpose and all provisions of the compact, the character of the country, and any other facts indicative of intention may be considered. \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 642]\n\u00a0\n The treaty of 1819 declares:\n'The use of the waters, and the navigation of the Sabine to the sea, and of the said rivers Roxo and Arkansas, throughout the extent of the said boundary, on their respective banks,1 shall be common to the respective inhabitants of both nations.'\n\n Parts of these rivers are navigable. For hundreds of miles the Red river passes over a sandy waste, between irregular 'cut banks,' sometimes a mile apart (one-third mile on the average), and the waters are mainly useful for domestic purposes, for live stock, and for irrigation. During most of the year the stream is only a few yards wide and flows along shallow channels, commonly at some distance from the southern 'cut bank.' Manifestly, if the boundary is on the margin of t at bank, the Spanish inhabitants were generally cut off from the stream, and could not use the waters without crossing or occupying territory of the United States. By its express terms the treaty reserved to those people the right to use and navigate the waters, and I cannot think that by mere implication it imposed a very serious barrier thereto.\n Again, if the boundary runs with the southern 'cut bank' of the Red river, of what effect are the words, 'all the islands in the Sabine, and the said Red and Arkansas rivers, throughout the course thus described, to belong to the United States'? That boundary being admitted, all islands would necessarily lie within the United States, and their reservation was unnecessary. But, if low water marks the boundary, then the reservation becomes important. Without it grave disputes might arise as to the true line where islands lie south of the main stream. See Georgia v. South Carolina, \n257 U.S. 516\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 173.\n With the boundary fixed at low-water mark, the Spanish inhabitants obtained free access to the stream at \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 643]\n\u00a0\n all seasons and could use its waters as their welfare required; the reservation of the islands to the United States is important; the parties obtained full reciprocal rights; and the unfortunate consequences incident to ownership by the United States of a long, narrow, barren strip between a foreign country and the stream are avoided.\n'Even when a state retains it dominion over a river which constitutes the boundary between itself and another state, it would be extremely inconvenient to extend its dominion over the land on the other side, which was left bare by the receding of the water. And this inconvenience is not less where the rising and falling is annual, than where it is diurnal. Wherever the river is a boundary between states, it is the main, the permanent river, which constitutes that boundary; and the mind will find itself embarrassed with insurmountable difficulty in attempting to draw any other line than the low water mark.' Chief Justice Marshall in Handly's Lessee v. Anthony et al. (1820) 5 Wheat. 374, 380, 381 (5 L. Ed. 113).\n\n Note that this cause was decided before ratification of the treaty in 1821\n\n\n The point for decision in Howard v. Ingersoll (1851) 13 How. 381, 397, 411, 412, 413, concerned the boundary between Georgia and Alabama, along the Chattahoochee river:\n'Its determination [13 How. 397] depends upon what were the limits of Georgia and her ownership of the whole country within them, when that state, in compliance with the obligation imposed upon it by the Revolutionary War, conveyed to the United States her unsettled territory, and upon the terms used to define the boundaries of that cession.'\n\n The pertinent article of the cession is copied below. \n2\n The court also said (13 How. 411, 412): \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 644]\n\u00a0\n 'We further learn that the adjustment with South Carolina left in Georgia the Chattahoochee river from its source to the thirty-first degree of north latitude, a Georgia had claimed her limits to be, since the king's patent to Sir James Wright, in 1764.\n'In other words, that the Chattahoochee, from its source to that point, was at all times after that patent within Georgia, with the right of soil and jurisdiction, when its unsettled territory was ceded to the United States. This fact being so, it gives us a key from the laws of nations to aid us in the interpretation of its cession as to the boundary between Georgia and Alabama, which must prevail, as it would in all other cases, where there may be a transfer by one nation of a part of its territory to another, with a river for its boundary, without an express stipulation for the relinquishment of the rights of soil and jurisdiction over the bed of such river.\n\n'The rule jure gentium, to which we refer, is not now for the first time under the consideration of this court. We are relieved, then, from its discussion, by citations from Vattel and other writers upon the laws of nations, to show what it is; but it will be found in the 22d chapter of Vattel. Among the writers after him it is not controverted by any one of them. Besides, it is according to what had been anciently the practice of nations, substantiated by an adherence to it down to our own times. In Handly's Lessee v. Anthony, 5 Wheat. 379, this court said, \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 645]\n\u00a0\n by its organ, Chief Justice Marshall, 'When a great river is the boundary between two nations or states, if the original property is in neither, and there be no convention about it, each holds to the middle of the stream. But when, as in this case, one state is the original proprietor, and grants territory on the one side only, it retains the river within its domain, and the newly created state extends to the river only.' The river, however, is its boundary.\n\n'Georgia was certainly the original proprietor of the river Chattahoochee to 31 degrees north, when her territory west of it was ceded to the United States, and that cession must be understood to have been made under the rule, unless by terms in her grant to the United States it was taken out of it, with the view to give to the new state which was to be formed out of the cession, a coequality of soil and jurisdiction in the river which was to separate them.'\n\n And applying what it deemed the applicable rule, the court held: The boundary in question is:\n'A line to run up the [Chattahoochee] river on and along its western bank, and that the jurisdiction of Georgia in the soil extends over to the line which is washed by the water, wherever it covers the bed of the river within its banks. The permanent fast land bank is referred to as governing the line. From the lower edge of that bank, the bed of the river commences, and Georgia retained the bed of the river from the lower edge of the bank on the west side. And where the bank is fairly marked by the water, that water level will show at all places where the line is.'\n\n The well-established rule, approved and attempted to be applied in Howard v. Ingersoll, has no application to the present controversy where independent nations undertook to settle a long standing boundary dispute. Moreover, the treaty contains important and, I think, controlling \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 646]\n\u00a0\n provisions not found in the Georgia grant. Although much relied on, that case does not decide the point here presented-it arose out of wholly different circumstances and the opinion rests upon a rule of interpretation declared to be generally inapplicable to compacts of settlement between independent nations.\n In Handly's Lessee v. Anthony (1820), supra, the court ruled that, under the grant by Virginia of all her right to the territory 'situate, lying, and being to the northwest of the river Ohio,' the boundary was at low water on the north side. The considerations which led to that conclusion, I think, are sufficient to require a like result here. Moreover, the treaty of 1819 contains provisions not found in the cession of the Northwest Territory which point to the low-water mark of the Red iver.\n That the Spanish government wittingly assented to a boundary by which a narrow strip of foreign territory was interposed between its citizens and waters essential to their welfare seems highly improbable. The convenience of the population must have been in contemplation. Nor do I find adequate reason for thinking that the United States desired this strip of barren land-then without value to their citizens-with the consequent obligations and serious difficulties. In 1819 troublesome problems incident to marking the boundary between this country and Canada were pending. Considering them, it is easy to understand why the United States desired to fix the boundary at the low-water mark of Red river, reserving the islands to themselves. But, obviously, ownership of the barren strip south of that line would entail unfortunate consequences to them and interfere with the orderly development of Spanish territory. Surely, neither government expected such a result.\n\"In case of doubt,' says Vattel, 'every country, lying upon a river, is presumed to have no other limits but the river itself; because nothing is more natural, than to take \n\n[260 U.S. 606, 647]\n\u00a0\n a river for boundary, when a state is established on its borders; and wherever there is a doubt, that is always to be presumed which is most natural and most probable.\" Handly's Lessee v. Anthony, supra, 5 Wheat. 379, 380 (5 L. Ed. 113). \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The boundary follows only a portion of each river-the upper reaches of the Arkansas, the middle part of the Red, and the lower section of the Sabine. No rights were given to Spanish subjects in respect of the waters of these rivers, except along the boundary. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'The state of Georgia cedes to the United States all the right, title, and claim, which the said state has to the jurisdiction and soil of all the lands situated within the boundaries of the United States, south of the state of Tennessee, and west of a line beginning on the western bank of the Chattahoochee river, where the same crosses the boundary line between the United States and Spain, running thence, up the said river Chattahooche and along the western bank thereof, to the great bend thereof, next above the place where a certain creek or river called Uchee (being the first considerable stream on the western side above the Cussetas and Coweta towns), empties into the said Chattahoochee river; thence in a direct line to Nicajack, on the Tennessee river; thence crossing the said last-mentioned river, and thence running up the said Tennessee river, and along the western bank thereof to the southern boundary line of the state of Tennessee.' \n\n\n\n\n","182":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF OKLAHOMA v.

STATE OF TEXAS(1923)\nNo. 18\nArgued: Decided: March 12, 1923\n\n\n Supplement to Partial Decree of June 5, 1922.\n On consideration of the several stipulations, suggestions and supporting briefs relating to the entry of a further decree to supplement the partial decree entered June 5, 1922, under the opinion delivered May 1, 1922.\n It is ordered, adjudged and decreed:\n\n 1. \nThis supplemental decree relates only to the bed of the Red river, and to lands bordering on the north side of the same, between the ninety- eighth meridian of west longitude and the mouth of the North fork.\n\n 2. \nThe several interveners who, under patents or Indian allotments by the United States, own lands bordering on the north side of the river are severally the owners of so much of the bed of the river as lies in front of their lands and north of the medial line of the river, except as is otherwise stated herein.\n\n 3. \nWhere, under grants from the United States, the state of Oklahoma owns lands bordering on the north side of the river the state has the same riparian rights in \n\n[261 U.S. 345, 346]\n\u00a0\n the river bed that an individual owning the same lands under a patent or Indian allotment would have.\n\n 4. \nThe full title and ownership of so much of the bed of the river as lies south of its medial line are in the United States.\n\n 5. \nIn the sense intended herein, the medial line of the river is a line drawn midway between the northerly and southerly banks of the river, commonly called cut banks, save that, under a stipulation between the parties affected, to which full effect must be given, this line, in so far as it reaches and is in contact with patented or allotted tracts which are within what is now the bed of the river, shall be regarded and treated as falling no farther north than the southerly line of such tracts as the same were represented by the official survey according to which they were patented or allotted.\n\n 6. \nWhere tracts on the north side of the river, which were not riparian when surveyed, were patented or allotted after they had become riparian, such disposals carried the title to the medial line of the river, unless other tracts between them and that line had been disposed of theretofore, in which event the later disposals did not carry any right in, or affect the title to, such intervening tracts.\n\n 7. \nWhere tracts on the north side, which had come to be in the river bed after survey and before disposal, were patented or allotted as if they were upland, while the adjacent land behind them which was then actually riparian was as yet unsold and unallotted, such disposals carried the title to the medial line of the river, unless other tracts between them and that line had been disposed of theretofore, in which event the later disposals did not carry any right in, or affect the title to, such intervening tracts.\n\n 8. \nThe patenting and allotting of lands bordering on the north side of the river did not carry or give any right to islands in the river which were in existence at that time. \n\n[261 U.S. 345, 347]\n\u00a0\n 9. The patent issued for lot 1 of section 35 in township 4 south of range 14 west, under which the intervener E. Everett Rowell is now claiming, carried the right and title to the river bed between such lot and the medial line of the river.\n 10. The patent issued for lots 1 and 2 of section 8 in township 5 south of range 14 west, under which the interveners A. E. Pearson et al. are now claiming, carried the right and title to the river bed between such lots and the medial line of the river.\n 11. The patent issued for the northeast quarter of the northeast quarter of section 7 in township 5 south of range 14 west, under which the interveners A. E. Pearson et al. are now claiming, invested the patentee with the full ownership of the land within the limits of that tract as shown on the plat of the official survey, but did not carry any right or title to any part f the river bed as an incident to the disposal of that tract.\n 12. The patent issued for lots 6 and 7 of section 7 in township 5 south of range 14 west, under which the interveners Robert L.

Harvey F. Carr, of Camden, N. J., and Jackson H. Ralston, Jr., for petitioner.\n Mr. Robert H. McCarter, of Newark, N. J., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill to quiet title to land in Atlantic City, New Jersey, brought primarily at lease under a statute of that state. 4 Compiled Stat. p. 5399 (P. L. 1870, p. 20). The suit was begun by Samuel F. Nirdlinger and now is maintained by his executors and trustees (the respondents). He owned a parcel lying to the east of New Hampshire Ave ue, which runs north and south, and to the north of Oriental Avenue which crosses the other avenue at right angles. The defendant owns an adjoining parcel on the other side of New Hampshire Avenue and the land in controversy is a triangular tract having its apex in the southwestern corner of the complainants' lot \n\n[262 U.S. 266, 268]\n\u00a0\n and spreading south of Oriental Avenue and east of New Hampshire Avenue to the sea. It has been formed by accretion in recent years. The defendant claims title by a former adjudication and by a riparian grant from the State. The District Court entered a decree for Nirdlinger after an elaborate discussion, 262 Fed. 591, and its opinion was adopted and the decree affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 273 Fed. 1022\n\n\n The former adjudication relied upon by the defendant was in a suit in the State Court brought against him under the same statute for the same purpose as the present one, by Nirdlinger and the Dewey Land Company from which Nirdlinger afterwards purchased a part of his land. The statute allows a person in peaceable possession of lands, claiming to own the same, whose title is disputed, to bring a suit in chancery against any person claiming an interest, calling upon him to set forth his title. After the issues are tried the decree is to settle the rights of all parties and to be conclusive. The complainants in the chancery suit alleged possession and claimed ownership, at first by accretion but by amendment by virtue of two deeds only. The defendant, as here, set up his riparian grant and a claim by accretion. The Chancellor held that the grant from the State could not be impeached collaterally and dismissed the bill. The Court of Errors and Appeals held this to be error but affirmed the decree on the ground that the complainants showed no title; that the deeds did not give the right claimed and that 'all claim by accretion is waived.' Dewey Land Co. v. Stevens, 83 N. J. Eq. 314, 316, 90 Atl. 1040; Id., 83 N. J. Eq. 656, 91 Atl. 934. It would have been intelligible if the Court had held that the complainants' statement of title was immaterial and that it was enough that they showed possession and a claim of ownership. But it being established that, notwithstanding the claim, if the title disclosed is defective the bill must be dismissed, we think that until the \n\n[262 U.S. 266, 269]\n\u00a0\n Court of Errors and Appeals decides otherwise it must be assumed that the decree is conclusive between the parties that at that time the complainants did not own the land. We cannot imagine that the statute contemplated a series of suits based on coexisting titles produced one after another, and especially when the one now relied upon was waived in the earlier case. We assume that the usual rule applies, and that if the claim to own must be justified, all justifications then existing are in issue. It follows that the plaintiffs' bill must be dismissed.\n But plainly the claim of the defendant was not established in the former suit. That appears from the nature of the decree, from the opinion of the Court of Errors and Appeals, and from the admitted fact that it subsequently refused to amend its remittitur so as to establish the defendant's right. See also Dewey Land Co. v. Stevens, 85 N. J. Eq. 374, 96 Atl. 362. Therefore the defendant took a proper step and did not waive the benefit of the former decree when in the present case he made a counterclaim and asked that his rights be adjudicated to be paramount. Upon this matter the discussion of the District Court was adequate and convincing, so that the unsatisfactory result will be that neither party can get a declaration of title and the complainants will be left to stand upon their possession alone.\n The first ground of the defendant's claim is a grant from the State to the defendant's predecessors in title of land flowed by tidewater at the date of the deed, June 28, 1900, which included the strip in controversy. There seems to be no doubt from the decision of the Court of Errors and Appeals that this grant put an end to the right of the complai ants to build wharves or otherwise to encroach upon the granted land, that being regarded as merely a license, revoked by the grant. The defendant contends that the effect was greater still, and relies upon a statement in the decision referred to, that:- \n\n[262 U.S. 266, 270]\n\u00a0\n 'If the land was formerly fast land [as this was said to have been], and the title was lost by erosion, it became the property of the State, not merely as long as it remained under water, but, if the State made a riparian grant, absolutely.'\n This form of statement remained unchanged notwithstanding the criticism in a concurring opinion by White, J., 83 N. J. Eq. 656, 91 Atl. 934. But we agree with the District Court that it means no more than we have stated, and is shown to mean no more not only by the authority cited but by the following words in the opinion:\n'The title lost by erosion was then lost forever, unless it was regained by accretion, and the right of accretion was the compensation of the former owner, for his loss.'\n\n We presume from this language that in New Jersey as elsewhere by the common law the right of accretion is not like the permissive right to use land still under water, but is a right as against the State as well as its grantees, when as here the grantees have not filled in the land. In some countries that inherit the Roman law the rule may be different. Ker v. Couden, \n223 U.S. 268\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 284. We conclude that the conveyance by the State did not give the defendant a title to land added by accretion to the complainants' premises, and that it does not matter that this conveyance was by metes and bounds. The boundaries however indicated were good until changed by the gradual work of the ocean and then were modified in accordance with what we believe to be the common law. Banks v. Ogden, 2 Wall. 57.\n The defendant's other contention is that as the former seashore was convex the dividing lines should spread outward like a fan, and not continue the north and south divisions indicated by the extension of New Hampshire Avenue to the present or recent high water mark. Without going into the details elaborated by the District Court we agree that since a plan was made in 1852 \n\n[262 U.S. 266, 271]\n\u00a0\n showing New Hampshire Avenue as extending farther south even than at present the existing street system was adopted and recognized New Hampshire Avenue as the dividing line as well for accretions as for the fixed land. The result is that both the bill and the cross-bill must be dismissed.\n Decree reversed.\n Bill and cross-bill dismissed. \n\n\n\n","185":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTOCKLEY v. U S(1923)\nNo. 74\nArgued: November 20, 1922Decided: January 2, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 532, 533]\n\u00a0\n Mr. S. L. Herold, of Shreveport, La., for appellants.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Riter, for the United States.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 532, 536]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in equity brought by the United States, as plaintiff, against the appellants, as defendants, by which a decree was sought adjudging the plaintiff to be the owner of a tract of land in the parish of Caddo, La., enjoining all interference therewith, and requiring the defendants to account for the value of oil and gas extracted by them therefrom.\n The United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, upon the report of a master, found for the plaintiff and entered a decree in accordance with the prayer of the bill ordering a restoration of possession and awarding damages against some of the defendants, including Stockley, for about $62,000.\n The case comes to this court by appeal from the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals affirming the decree of the District Court. 271 Fed. 632.\n The defendants denied plaintiff's title and alleged that the land was the property of the defendant Stockley by virtue of his compliance with the homestead laws of the United States.\n The conceded facts are that in 1897 Stockley took possession of the land and on November 13, 1905, made a preliminary entry thereof as a homestead. He complied with the provisions of the homestead laws, submitted final proof, including the required nonmineral affidavit, paid the commissions and fees then due, and on January 16, 1909, obtained the receiver's receipt therefor. Prior to that time, viz. on December 15, 1908, a large body of public lands, embracing within its boundaries the land in question, was withdrawn by an order of the President of the United States from all forms of appropriation. The withdrawal order was expressly made 'subject to existing valid claims.' The receiver  receipt, omitting unnecessary matter, is in the following words: \n\n[260 U.S. 532, 537]\n\u00a0\n 'Received of Thomas J. Stockley ... the sum of three dollars and one cent in connection with Hd. Final, Serial 0188 for [ lands described] 71.25 acres. ...'\n On March 17, 1910, Stockley leased the property in question to the defendant the Gulf Refining Company, which company subsequently drilled wells and developed oil. The rights of the other defendants are wholly dependent upon the title asserted on behalf of Stockley.\n On July 16, 1910, after the report of a special agent confirming Stockley's claim of residence upon and cultivation and improvement of the lands, the Commissioner of the General Land Office ordered the case 'clear- listed and closed as to the Field Service Division.' Subsequently, and more than three years after the issuance of the receiver's receipt, viz. on February 27, 1912, a contest was ordered by the Commissioner of the General Land Office before the local register and receiver upon the charge that the land was mineral in character, being chiefly valuable for oil and gas, and that when Stockley made his final proof he knew or, as an ordinarily prudent man, should have known this fact. After a hearing, the register and receiver decided in favor of Stockley, but the Commissioner of the General Land Office reversed the decision and ordered the entry canceled. The Secretary of the Interior affirmed the Commissioner, with a modification allowing Stockley to obtain a patent for the surface only, under the provisions of the Act of July 17, 1914, c. 142, 38 Stat. 509 ( Comp. St  4640a-4640c).\n The defendants contended that the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the Secretary of the Interior were without authority to entertain this contest because prior thereto full equitable title had vested in Stockley and he had become entitled to a patent by virtue of the provisions of section 7 of the Act of March 3, 1891, c. 561, 26 Stat. 1095, 1099 (Comp. St.  5113). That section, so far as necessary to be stated, provides: \n\n[260 U.S. 532, 538]\n\u00a0\n 'That after the lapse of two years from the date of the issuance of the receiver's receipt upon the final entry of any tract of land under the homestead, timber culture, desert land, or pre-emption laws, or under this act, and when there shall be no pending contest or protest against the validity of such entry, the entryman shall be entitled to a patent conveying the land by him entered, and the same shall be issued to him; but this proviso shall not be construed to require the delay of two years from the date of said entry before the issuing of a patent therefor.'\n The court below rejected defendants' contention, holding that the receipt issued to Stockley was not a 'receiver's receipt upon the final entry' for the reason that, in the view of that court, a final entry could not become effective until the issuance of the certificate of the register. In other words, it was the opinion of the lower court that in order to constitute a final entry within the meaning of the statute above quoted, there must be an adjudication upon the proofs and the issuance of a final certificate, evidencing an approval thereof.\n We think the language of the statute does not justify this conclusion. It must be assumed that Congress was familiar with the operations and practice of the Land Department and knew the difference between a receiver's receipt and a register's certificate. These papers serve different purposes. One, as its name imports, acknowledges the receipt of the money paid. The other certifies to the payment and declares that the claimant on presentation of the certificate to the Commissioner of the General Land Office shall be entitled to a patent.\n The evidence shows that prior to the passage of the statute, and thereafter until 1908, the practice was to issue receipt and certificate simultaneously upon the submission and acceptance of the final proof and payment of the fees and commissions. In 1908 this practice was changed, so that the receipt was issued u on the submission \n\n[260 U.S. 532, 539]\n\u00a0\n of the final proof and making of payment, while the certificate was issued upon approval of the proof and this might be at any time after the issuance of the receipt. The receiver and register act independently, the former alone being authorized to issue the receipt and the latter to sign the certificate. The receipt issued to Stockley was after submission of his proof and payment of all that he was required to pay under the law. No certificate was ever issued by the register.\n It is contended by the government that the receiver's receipt named in the statute should be restricted to a receipt issued simultaneously with the register's certificate after approval of final proofs, and that, after the change of 1908 in the practice of the department, a receipt issued before such approval does not come within the meaning of the statute. Such a receipt, it is contended, obtains no validity as a 'receiver's receipt upon the final entry' until after the proof has in fact been examined and approved.\n We cannot accept this conception of the law. A change in the practice of the Land Department manifestly could not have the effect of altering the meaning of an act of Congress. What the act meant upon its passage, it continued to mean thereafter. The plain provision is that the period of limitation shall begin to run from the date of the 'issuance of the receiver's receipt upon the final entry.' There is no ambiguity in this language and, therefore, no room for construction. There is nothing to construe. The sole inquiry is whether the receipt issued to Stockley falls within the words of the statute. In Chotard v. Pope, 12 Wheat. 586, 588 (6 L. Ed. 737), this court defined the term entry as meaning:\n'That act by which an individual acquires an inceptive right to a portion of the unappropriated soil of the country, by filing his claim in the office of an officer known in the legislation of several states by the epithet of an entrytaker, and corresponding \n\n[260 U.S. 532, 540]\n\u00a0\n very much in his functions with the registers of land offices, under the acts of the United States.'\n\n It was in this sense that the term 'final entry' was used in this statute. Having submitted to the proper officials proof showing full compliance with the law, and having paid all the fees and commissions lawfully due, Stockley had done everything which the law required on his part and became entitled to the immediate issuance of the receiver's receipt, and this receipt was issued and delivered to him. No subsequent receipt was contemplated or required. From the date of the receipt the entry may be held open for the period of two years, during which time its validity may be contested. Thereafter the entryman is entitled to a patent and the express command of the statute is that 'the same shall be issued to him.' Lane v. Hoglund, \n244 U.S. 174\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 558; Payne v. United States ex rel. Newton, \n255 U.S. 438\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 368.\n That Stockley's acts constituted final entry is borne out by rulings of the Land Department. Thus in Gilbert v. Spearing, 4 Land Dec. 463, 466, Secretary Lamar said:\n'When the homestead application, affidavit and legal fees are properly placed in the hands of the local land officers, and the land applied for is properly subject to entry, from that moment the right of entry is complete and in contemplation of law the land is entered.'\n\n See, also, Iddings v. Burns, 8 Land Dec. 224, 226.\n We are not at liberty to add to or take from the language of the statute. When Congress has plainly described the instrument from whose date the statute beings to run as the 'receipt upon the final entry,' there is no warrant for construing it to mean only a receipt issued simultaneously with the certificate or one issued after the adjudication on the final proof, which might be-and in this instance was-postponed indefinitely. It was to avoid just such delays for an unreasonable length of time-that is, for more than two years-that the statu e was enacted. Lane v. Hoglund, supra, and Land Department \n\n[260 U.S. 532, 541]\n\u00a0\n decisions cited. The purpose and effect of the statute are clearly and accurately stated by the Commissioner of the General Land Office in Instructions of June 4, 1914, 43 Land Dec. 322, 323, in the course of which it is said:\n'There is no doubt that Congress chose the date of the receiver's receipt rather than of the certificate of the register as controlling, for the reason that payment by the claimant marks the end of compliance by him with the requirements of law. It would be manifestly unjust to make the right to a patent dependent upon the administrative action of the register, subjecting it to such delays as are incident to the conduct of public business and over which the claimant has no control. Payment, of which the receiver's receipt is but evidence, is, therefore, the material circumstance that starts the running of the statute, inasmuch as a claimant is and always has been entitled to a receipt when payment is made.'\n\n It is urged, however, that in any event the receiver exceeded his authority in issuing the receipt, since the Commissioner of the General Land Office, on December 15, 1908, had instructed the register and receiver, among other things, as follows:\n'Applications, selections, entries, and proofs based upon selections, settlements, or rights initiated prior to the date of withdrawal may be received by you and allowed to proceed under the rules up to and including the submission of final proofs. You must not, however, in such cases receive the purchase money or issue final certificate of entry, but must suspend the entries and proofs pending investigation as to the validity of the claims with regard to the character of the land and compliance with the law in other respects.'\n\n These instructions were issued, as shown upon their face, in view of the presidential withdrawal order of the same date. We suggest, without deciding, that, inasmuch as the withdrawal order was expressly made subject to \n\n[260 U.S. 532, 542]\n\u00a0\n existing valid claims, and Stockley's claim was obviously existing and valid, this instruction of the Commissioner was itself without authority, since, as applied to Stockley, it was in conflict with the withdrawal order. This has nothing to do with the question as to whether the lands were, in fact, mineral in character, which is another and different matter dealt with later. However, Stockley, as already shown, did, in act, make final entry and the receiver did, in fact, issue and deliver his receipt thereon. The case, therefore, falls within the terms of the statute and must be governed by it, unless the receipt be held for naught on the ground that it was issued contrary to the Commissioner's instruction. But the very object of the statute was to preclude inquiry upon that or any other matter, except as provided by the statute, after the expiration of two years from the date of the receiver's receipt. In United States v. Winona & St. Peter Railroad Co., \n165 \nU.S. 463, 476\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 368, 371 ( 41 L. Ed. 789) this court had under consideration section 8 of the same act (26 Stat. 1099 [Comp. St.  5114]), limiting the time within which suits by the United States might be brought to annul patents. That section, it was said, recognizes:\n'That when its proper officers, acting in the ordinary course of their duties, have conveyed away lands which belonged to the government, such conveyances should, after the lapse of a prescribed time, be conclusive against the government, and this notwithstanding any errors, irregularities or improper action of its officers therein.'\n\n It was said further:\n'Under the benign influence of this statute it would matter not what the mistake or error of the Land Department was, what the frauds and misrepresentations of the patentee were, the patent would become conclusive as a transfer of the title, providing only that the land was public land of the United States and open to sale and conveyance through the Land Department.'\n\n In United  ates v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co., \n209 \nU.S. 447, 450\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 579, 580 (52 L. Ed. 881), this section of the act was again under \n\n[260 U.S. 532, 543]\n\u00a0\n consideration. A patent was attacked as void for the alleged reason that the land which it purported to convey had been reserved for public purposes, and upon that ground the application of the statute was denied, but this court said:\n'It is said that the instrument was void and hence was no patent. But the statute presupposes an instrument that might be declared void. When it refers to 'any patent heretofore issued,' it describes the purport and source of the document, not its legal effect. If the act were confined to valid patents it would be almost or quite without use.'\n\n To hold that the receipt here under consideration falls outside the terms of the statute would be to defeat the purpose of the statute and perpetuate the mischief which it sought to destroy. Prior to the decision in the case of Jacob A. Harris, 42 Land Dec. 611, 614 (quoted with approval in Lane v. Hoglund, supra), it had been held that the statute did not affect the conduct or action of the Land Department in taking up and disposing of final proof of entrymen after the lapse of the two-year period (Mertie C. Traganza, 40 Land. Dec. 300), but this view was sharply challenged and overruled in the Harris Case, where it was said:\n'Passed, primarily, to rectify a past and to prevent future abuses of the departmental power to suspend entries, the proviso is robbed of its essential purpose and practically repleaded by the decision in the Traganza Case.'\n\n The effective character of the receiver's receipt being established, the question, after the lapse of the two-year period, as to whether the land was mineral bearing, was no longer open. Inquiry upon that ground was then foreclosed, along with all others. Payne v. United States ex. rel. Newton, supra.\n The bar of the statute likewise prevails, notwithstanding the executive withdrawal of December 15, 1908. The validity of that order is, of course, settled by the decision \n\n[260 U.S. 532, 544]\n\u00a0\n in United States v. Midwest Oil Co., \n236 U.S. 459\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 309, but, as already stated, there is excepted from the operation of the order 'existing valid claims.' Obviously this means something less than a vested right, such as would follow from a completed final entry, since such a right would require no exception to insure its preservation. The purpose of the exception evidently was to save from the operation of the order claims which had been lawfully initiated and which, upon full compliance with the land laws, would ripen into a title. The effect of a preliminary homestead entry is to confer upon the entryman an exclusive right of possession, which continues so long as the entryman complies in good faith with the requirements of the homestead law. Stearns v. United States, 152 Fed. 900, 906, 82 C. C. A. 48; Peyton v. Desmond, 129 Fed. 1, 12, 63 C. C. A. 651. Since it is conceded that Stockley made such an entry in 1905 and his compliance with the requirements of the homestead law prior to the withdrawal order is not questioned, it follows that he had, when that order was issued, an existing valid claim, within the meaning of the exception. The action of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, therefore, in directing a contest against Stockley's entry three years after the issuance to him of the receiver's receipt was unauthorized and void.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court, with directions to dismiss the bill of complaint. \n\n\n\n","186":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTREET v.

Sullivan, and Warren Olney, all of San Francisco, Cal., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case is displayed by the complaint of appellant (he was plaintiff in the court below) as follows: He is a native-born resident of California, and a seaman, and has been engaged in interestate and foreign commerce by sea upon vessels plying between ports on the Pacific Coast, and between such ports and foreign ports, and is desirous of continuing to work on such vessels.\n He is associated by and through an unincorporated association of persons called the International Seamen's Union of America, with over 10, 000 other persons working as seamen, and he brings this action in his own behalf and theirs, the acts of which he complains being a matter of common and general interest to him and them.\n The Shipowners' Association of the Pacific Coast is a California corporation having its place of business in the city of San Francisco, it being a membership corporation under the laws of the state, composed of every person, firm, corporation, or association owning or acting as managing owner of every vessel engaged in interstate and foreign commerce documented in the different offices of \n\n[263 U.S. 334, 338]\n\u00a0\n the different collectors of United States customs on the Pacific Coast.\n The Pacific American Steamship Association is a voluntary unincorporated association of individuals and corporations owning and operating vessels flying the American flag and engaged in the merchant service between Pacific Coast ports and foreign ports. It has its place of business in San Francisco.\n It and the Shipowners' Association control every vessel engaged in the merchant service between such ports and collectively employ all seamen engaged in that service.\n On the 1st day of January, 1922, the defendants combined to restrain the freedom of appellant and all other seamen on the Pacific Coast to engage in such service, and to compel and seamen who desire to engage in such interstate and foreign trade and commerce to register and take a number, and take his turn for employment according to such number, which frequently prevents seamen of good qualifications and well known from obtaining employment at once, when, owing to their being well known among the masters and other officers of vessels and owing to their good qualifications as seamen, they could and would obtain work at once, and as a condition of such employment the associations also compel and seamen to take and carry a book upon which is printed, among other things, the following:\n'Employment Service Bureau.\n\n'Pacific American Steamship Association, Shipowners' Ass'n of the Pacific Coast,\n\n San Francisco, California.\n'This certificate and discharge is issued under the authority of the Pacific American Steamship Association and the Shipowners' Association of the Pacific Coast, and no person will be employed by these associations unless he is registered at their employment offices and has in his possession this certificate and discharge. \n\n[263 U.S. 334, 339]\n\u00a0\n 'The lawful holder of this certificate will deliver it to the master of the vessel when he signs articles of agreement and the master will retain the same in his possession until the seaman is discharged or has left the employment.\n\n'To Seamen:\n\n'When you receive this book you will be given a registered number which will be placed in the back of this book. When you leave your ship you must report to the Employment Service Bureau and get a new registered number. This registration number is given you when you apply for a job and has nothing to do with the number printed on the book. A fee will be charged for this book sufficient to cover the cost of the same.'\n\n In addition to the foregoing there is required to be written therein certain particulars of identification and the total years of the seaman's experience. His photograph is also required to be attached to the book.\n The said matters are regulations of commerce among the several states and with foreign nations, in violation of subdivision 3 of section 8, of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States, and have been fully provided for by the Congress of the United States in the Act of June 7, 1872 (17 Stat. 262), commonly known as the Shipping Commissioners' Act, and the various acts of Congress amendatory and supplemental thereto, in so far as it is necessary to such commerce that they should be provided for.\n The regulations are humiliating to all seamen and the best seamen refuse to abide by them and are leaving the seafaring calling. Appellant refuses to engage in such commerce thereunder and is suffering loss and damage because he cannot obtain employment without obeying them. The associations threaten to and will continue to enforce the regulations unless restrained. The taking of turns in employment by seamen or being employed according \n\n[263 U.S. 334, 340]\n\u00a0\n to number is destructive of competition among those who wish to engage as seamen, and the regulations trench upon the exclusive right of the Congress of the United States to make such regulations.\n Neither appellant nor any other seaman has an adequate remedy at law and an injunction is prayed against the enforcement of the regulations.\n The appellee associations each filed a motion to dismiss, which expressed in various ways the insufficiency of the complaint to constitute a cause of action, and also that the court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the suit.\n The motions were granted. The court expressed the opinion that the defendants' regulations did not violate the Shipping Commissioners' Act ( section 4501 et seq., R. S. [Comp. St.  8287 et seq.]), nor the Anti- Trust Law (38 Stat. 730), and held besides that appellant 'is not shown to have any standing entitling him to seek in court the general relief for which he prays,' and further said:\n'He is not in a position to vindicate general governmental policies, nor is he 'the agency to establish the public welfare.\"\n\n A decree was entered dismissing the complaint, to review which this appeal was obtained, and is prosecuted.\n The assignment of errors attacks the decree with detail of particulars, affirming the sufficiency of the complaint and the grounds of relief which it expresses.\n This appeal is direct from the District Court, and we encounter at the outset the question of our jurisdiction, which is presented by a motion to dismiss the appeal. According to section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), appeal or error may be prosecuted from the District Courts when their jurisdiction is in issue; in prize cases; in any case that involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States; in any case in which the constitutionality of any law of the United States, or the validity or construction of any treaty is drawn in question; in \n\n[263 U.S. 334, 341]\n\u00a0\n any case in which the Constitution or law of a state is claimed to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States.\n It is manifest that the present case falls as an exercise of the power, which it the regulations of the associations be regarded as an exercise of the pwoer, which it is contended Congress alone possesses, or which has been conferred upon the Shipping Commission, or be regarded as violations of the Anti-Trust Law.\n If, however, appellant received a justiciable injury from the regulations which the judgment of the District Court did not recognize, review of that action must be through the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and, therefore, in compliance with section 238(a) of the Judicial Code1 (42 Stat. 837), the case must be transferred to that court.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'If an appeal or writ of error has been or shall be taken to, or issued out of, any Circuit Court of Appeals in a case wherein such appeal or writ of error should have been taken to or issued out of the Supreme Court; or if an appeal or writ of error has been or shall be taken to, or issued out of, the Supreme Court in a case wherein such appeal or writ of error should have been taken to, or issued out of, a Circuit Court of Appeals, such appeal or writ of error shall not for such reason be dismissed, but shall be transferred to the proper court. ...' \n\n\n\n\n","187":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSUPERIOR WATER, LIGHT & POWER CO. v.

All general laws or special acts enacted under the provisions of this section may be altered or repealed by the Legislature at any time after their passage.'\n Chapter 359, Private and Local Laws of Wisconsin of 1866, incorporated plaintiff in error's predecessor, the Superior Water Works Company, and empowered it to make--\n'any agreements, contracts, grants and leases for the sale, use and distribution of water as may be agreed upon between said company and any person or persons, associations and \n\n[263 U.S. 125, 127]\n\u00a0\n corporations, and with the town of Superior, or neighboring towns; or the said company itself may take and use the surplus water for manufacturing or other purposes; which said agreements, contracts, grants and leases shall be valid and effectual in law.'\n\n On October 15, 1887, in order to provide fire protection and secure pure and wholesome water, and in consideration of benefits to accrue therefrom, the village of Superior, a municipal corporation, by ordinance, granted to Superior Water Works Company, its successors and assigns, for a period of 30 years, the privilege of establishing, maintaining, and operating a complete system of waterworks. The ordinance specified the duties and obligations of the parties, and, among other things, provided that the village would abstain for 30 years from granting the right to lay water pipes in its streets to any other party and that the main source of water should be Superior Bay; but if the village at its expense should secure an indefeasible right to lay pipes across Minnesota Point in the state of Minnesota, etc., the company would take water from Lake Superior, and further that--\n'at the expiration of the said thirty years, should the said village refuse to grant to the said Superior Waterworks Company, its successors or assigns, the right to continue and maintain said system of water works for another term of thirty years, upon the said terms and conditions as may exist between the said village or city and the said Superior Waterworks Company, at the expiration of the first thirty years, in and upon the public grounds and streets of the said village and to supply the said village and the inhabitants thereof with water on reasonable terms, then and in such case, the village shall purchase from said Superior Waterworks Company, its successors or assigns, said system of water works and the property connected therewith, at a fair valuation as provided for in section XIII.' \n\n[263 U.S. 125, 128]\n\u00a0\n Section XIII provided for arbitrators to determine the actual value of the plant, exclusive of privileges granted by the village, not to exceed what it would cost to construct the same, etc. Section XIV:\n\n'Within thirty days after the passage of this ordinance said Superior Waterworks Company may file with the village clerk its acceptance thereof, duly acknowledged before some authorized officer and from and after the filing of said acceptance this ordinance shall have the effect of and be a contract between the village of Superior and the Superior Waterworks Company and shall be the measure of the rights and liabilities of said village as well as of said company, and in case such acceptance is not so made and filed within thirty days after the passage of this ordinance, the village board shall have the right to repeal the same.'\n\n The corporation accepted the ordinance, constructed the plant and many extensions, spent large sums in connection therewith, and long continued to operate it.\n In March, 1889, the territory constituting the village of Superior was incorporated as the city of Superior. The charter declared that--\n'All franchises heretofore granted, or contracts entered into, by the village of Superior, shall continue and remain in force in accordance with the terms thereof, as if the same had been granted or entered into by said city of Superior.' Chapter 152, p. 432, Laws 1889\n\n\n\n It further empowered the city--\n'to provide for the purchase, construction, maintenance and operation of waterworks for the supply of water to the inhabitants of the city, and to supply such city with water for fire protection and other purposes; and to secure the erection of waterworks, said city may, by contract or ordinance, grant to any person, persons, company or corporation, the full right and privilege to build and own such waterworks, and to maintain, operate and regulate the same; and in doing so, to use the streets, alleys and bridges of the city in laying and maintaining the necessary pipe lines and hydrants for such term of years and on such conditions as may be prescribed \n\n[263 U.S. 125, 129]\n\u00a0\n by such ordinance or contract; and may also, by contract or ordinance, provide for supplying from such waterworks, the city with water for flre protection and for other purposes, and also the inhabitants thereof with water for such term of years, for such price, in such manner, and subject to such limitations as may be fixed by said contract or ordinance.' Chapter 152, pp. 369, 370.\n\n October 1, 1889, with the express assent of the Superior Waterworks Company and in consideration of the waiver of certain rights by the latter, the city of Superior amended section XIII Ordinance of October 15, 1887, so as to provide that, if purchased, the price to be paid for the waterworks plant should be ascertained by capitalizing the net earnings of the preceding year at 5 per centum. \n1\n Sections II and III of this ordinance follow: \n\n[263 U.S. 125, 130]\n\u00a0\n 'Section II. This ordinance is passed upon the consideration to the city of Superior that the said city is hereby released and relieved from the duty, cost and expense of procuring, for said Superior Waterworks Company, the valid and indefeasible right to extend and lay its pipes across the bay of Superior and across Minnesota Point, to the shores of, and into Lake Superior, as provided in section II of said ordinance number one of the General Ordinances of the village of Superior and that all that part of said section No. II, commencing with the word 'provided' in the twentieth line thereof, down to and including the word 'completed' in the sixty-second line thereof, \n\n[263 U.S. 125, 131]\n\u00a0\n is hereby repealed. And this said ordinance is passed upon the further consideration to the city of Superior, that by the acceptance hereof the said Superior Waterworks Company binds itself, its successors and assigns, to obtain at its own expense an adequate supply of good and wholesome water for domestic and public purposes from said Lake Superior and to furnish the same to the inhabitants of said city and to said city as provided in said ordinance number one as hereby amended within two years from the acceptance of this ordinance by said Superior Waterworks Company.\n'Section III. This ordinance is passed with the consent of the Superior Waterworks Company and upon filing a written acceptance by it with the city clerk of the said city of Superior the said ordinance with all other ordinances of said city or the village of Superior granting to the said Superior Waterworks Company any rights or franchises shall be and become and is hereby made a binding contract as so amended and modified.'\n\n In compliance with the foregoint ordinance and agreement the supply lines of the water system were extended across Minnesota Point, in the state of Minnsota, and into Lake Superior. The company also acquired a parcel of land on that point and there installed wells, machinery and equipemtn which became an essential part of the system.\n On November 1, 1889, the Superior Waterworks Company sold and transferred its plant with all appurtenant rights and privileges to plaintiff in error, the Superior Water, Light & Power Company. Three ordinances amended the grant of 1887 (in ways not now necessary to detail) in 1889, 1896, and 1899. Two of these provided for and received express acceptance by plaintiff in error.\n In 1907 the Wisconsin Legislature enacted the Public Utility Law ( chapter 499, Laws 1907; Sections 1797m-1 to 1797m-109, Wis. Stat. 1919), which created the Railroad Commission, \n\n[263 U.S. 125, 132]\n\u00a0\n a regulatory body, and authorized public utilities to surrender existing franchises and accept in lieu thereof 'indeterminate permits.' Chapter 596, Laws 1911, repealed the optional feature of the statute of 1907 and directed that every license, permit or franchise granted by the state or by any town, village or city to any corporation authorizing the latter to operate a plant for furnishing heat, light, water or power, etc., etc.--\n'is so altered and amended as to constitute and to be an 'indeterminate permit' within the terms and meaning of sections 1797m- 1 to 1797m-108, inclusive of the statutes, ... and subject to all the terms, provisions, conditions, and limitations of said sections 1797m-1 to 1797m-108, inclusive and shall have the same force and effect as a license, permit, or franchise granted after July 11, 1907, to any public utility embraced in and subject to the provisions of said sections 1797m-1 to 1797m-108, inclusive, except as provided by section 1797m-80.'\n\n One of the provisions to which reference is made gives the municipality the right to purchase upon terms to be fixed by the State Railroad Commission.\n The statute (section 1797m-1) declares the term--\n\"indeterminate permit' ... shall mean and embrace every grant, directly or indirectly, from the state, to any corporation, company, individual, association of individuals, their lessees, trustees or receivers appinted by any court whatsoever, of power, right or privilege to own, operate, manage or control any plant or equipment or any part of a plant or equipment within this state for the production, transmission, delivery or furnishing of heat, light, water or power, either directly or indirectly, to or for the public, which shall continue in force until such time as the municipality shall exercise its option to purchase as provided in sections 1797m-1 to 1797m-109, inclusive, or until it shall be otherwise terminated according to law.'\n\n Plaintiff in error has not voluntarily submitted to the Public Utility Law. \n\n[263 U.S. 125, 133]\n\u00a0\n On October 15, 1917, the prescribed 30-year limitation expired and plaintiff in error requested the city of Superior either to grant further right to mantain the system of water works or to purchase the same as provided by the ordinance of 1887 as amended in 1889. The city failed to make the grant, denied its obligation to purchase, and took steps under provisions of sections 1797m-1 to 1797m-109, Wisconsin Statutes, to condemn the entire plant. Thereupon plaintiff in error instituted the present cause against the city, its mayor and councilmen. The complaint sets out the foregoint facts, alleges repudiation of the obligation to purchase and the steps taken for condemnation, and asks a decree requiring the city specifically to perform its agreement, for an injunction restraining further efforts to condemn and for general relief.\n The trial court overruled a general demurrer but this action was reversed by the Supreme Court (174 Wis. 257, 181 N. W. 113, 183 N. W. 254), which held that the act of 1907 (chapter 499), as amended in 1911, was permissible under the reserved power to alter, amend or repeal acts providing for formation or creation of corporations, and that it had substituted an 'indeterminate permit' for the rights granted to the plaintiff in error by the municipality. 'A new franchise was therefore granted to the defendant in lieu of its original franchise by the enactment of chapter 596, Laws 1911. Thereafter its franchise was that of the indeterminate permit, and it was subject to the provisions of the Public Utility Law. This also was its franchise on October 1, 1917, when it is claimed its original franchise expired. The Public Utility Law had superseded everything of a franchise nature embodied in the original ordinance granted to it by the village of Superior and the subsequent and succeeding amendments thereto.' And also that it was immaterial whether or not a contract between the city and the water company resulted from the clause of the original \n\n[263 U.S. 125, 134]\n\u00a0\n ordinance providing for extension of the grant or purchase after thirty years, because 'even though it be considered as a contract, we think it gives rise to no obligation on the part of the city to purchase the plant according to its terms.'\n The court further said (174 Wis. 288, 181 N. W. 124):\n'The manifest purpose of the provision was to assure the water company one of two things: either a renewal of its franchise for another period of thirty years or a sale of its property in case such franchise be not renewed. The franchise called for was one having 'the same terms and conditions as may exist between the said village or city and the said Superior Waterworks Company at the expiration of the first thirty years.' The franchise which it had at that date was the indeterminate permit. That was either its franchise or it had none. That was a continuing franchise. It was indeterminate as to time. It was not limited to thirty years or any other period. Consequently there was no occasion for the city to 'grant to the said Superior Waterworks Company, its successors or assigns, the right to continue and maintain said system of waterworks.' It already had that right. There was therefore no breach of this part of the alleged contract on the part of the city. Until there was a breach of this provision of the contract, no obligation on the part of the city to purchase according to the terms of the contract arose. It seems plain that the position of the water company is not helped by construing this provision of the ordinance as a contract made by the city in its proprietary capacity. The conditions precedent to an obligation on the part of the city to buy under the terms of the contract have not come to pass, and the city has in no manner become obligated to carry out the feature of the contract which is sought to be enforced in this action.'\n\n Considering the opinions of this court, it seems clear enough that a valid contract resulted from the dealings \n\n[263 U.S. 125, 135]\n\u00a0\n between the city of Superior and plaintiff in error whereby each became obligated to do certain specified things. The company agreed to construct, maintain and operate an adequate waterworks system. The city obligated itself to recognize the company's exclusive right to maintain and operate the system for a definite period, 30 years, and also to purchase the entire plant at a price fixed in the manner specified if at the conclusion of such period it should refuse to grant an extension. The rights so acquired by plaintiff in error were property. Pearsall v. Great Northern Ry., \n161 U.S. 646\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 705; Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' St. Ry. Co., \n184 \nU.S. 368, 384\n, 22 S.

Columbus, \n249 \nU.S. 399, 407\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 349, 6 A. L. R. 1648.\n Concerning the relation between the parties the court below declared:\n'The franchise of the water company, which enables it to pursue its business of supplying water to the city of Superior and its inhabitants, is a contract between it and the state.'\n\n But it held the Legislature had power to change this contract under the reservation permitting alterations, in section 1, art. 11, of the state Constitution, and that the act of 1911 did modify the contract by substituting for rights thereby secured an 'indeterminate permit.'\n Through its contract with the city the water company acquired valuable property rights. They were not directly created by any statute enacted under section 1, art. 11, of the state Constitution, but were the outcome of agreement \n\n[263 U.S. 125, 136]\n\u00a0\n with a fully empowered corporation. They did not arise from the mere exercise of a governmental function legislative in character, but from contract expressly authorized by the Legislature. None of the decisions of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin prior to 1889 to which we have been referred2 construes the reservation in the state Constitution as having the extraordinary scope accorded to it below, and certainly, in the absence of some very clear and definite pronouncement, we cannot accept the view that it then had the meaning now attributed to it.\n As late as 1909, in State ex rel. Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Railroad Commission, 140 Wis. 145, 157, 121 N. W. 919, 932, that court announced:\n'The right to alter or repeal existing charters is not without limitation when the question of vested property rights under the charter is involved. The power is one of regulation and control, and does not authorize interference with property rights vested under the power granted. ... The reserve power stops short of the power to divest vested property rights, and is embodied in the state Constitution for the purpose of enabling the state to retain control over corporations, and must be construed in connection with the other provision of the Constitution to the effect that private property shall not be taken for public use without compensation. It follows, therefore, 'that where, under power in a charter, rights have been acquired and become vested, no amendment or alteration of the charter can take away the property or rights which have become vested under a legitimate exercise of the \n\n[263 U.S. 125, 137]\n\u00a0\n powers granted.' Comm. v. Essex Co., 13 Gray, 239.'\n\n See, also, Water Power Cases, 148 Wis. 124, 136, 134 N. W. 330, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 526.\n The integrity of contracts-matter of high public concern-is guaranteed against action like that here disclosed by section 10, art. 1, of the federal Constitution, 'No state shall ... pass any ... law impairing the obligation of contracts.' It was beyond the competency of the Legislature to substitute an 'indeterminate permit' for rights acquired under a very clear contract. Vicksburg v. Vicksburg Waterworks Co ., \n206 U.S. 496\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 762; Detroit United Ry. v. Michigan, \n242 \nU.S. 238, 253\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 87. The erroneous conclusion concerning this federal question led to the decree below. Accordingly it must be set aside and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section. I. Ordinance No. 5 of the General Ordinances of the village (now city) of Superior, entitled 'A ordinance amending and re- enacting section XIII of an ordinance authorizing the Superior Waterworks Company, its successors or assigns, to construct, operate and maintain a system of water works in the village of Superior, Douglas county, Wisconsin, and contracting with said company for a supply of water for the use of said village and the inhabitants thereof, and defining their rights, privileges and powers,' is hereby amended by striking out of said ordinance all of said ordinance after the words 'section XIII,' where the said words 'section XIII' occur, in the thirteenth line thereof and inserting in lieu thereof the following: This ordinance is passed upon the express condition that at the expiration of twenty years after the date of the passage of this ordinance and of every fifth year thereafter, the city of Superior may, at its option, purchase from the said Superior Waterworks Company, its successors or assigns, the entire plant of the said Superior Waterworks Company, its successors or assigns, and including all franchises theretofore granted to said Superior Waterworks Company, its successors or assigns, by the village or city of Superior, by paying therefor, in cash, an amount of money, of which the net earnings of said Superior Waterworks Company, for the next year preceding the purchase thereof, by said city, shall be five per centum. Such purchase shall be made in the following manner, to wit: The common council at its first regular meeting after the expiration of said twenty years, or of any fifth year thereafter, may pass an ordinance declaring its intention to purchase said plant and franchises appropriating the necessary funds therefor and directing the city clerk of said city, to serve upon said Superior Waterworks Company, its successors or assigns, a copy of said ordinance, together with a notice that at the expiration of one year from the date of the service of said notice, the said city will pay to said Superior Waterworks Company, its successors, or assigns, the price of said plant and franchises, determined as by this ordinance provided, and will assume possession of said plant and franchises. Commencing with the day following the date of the service of such notice, the said Superior Waterworks Company, its successors or assigns, shall keep an accurate account of all receipts and disbursements of said company, in a set of books kept expressly for that purpose and for no other, which said books shall at the expiration of each quarter year thereafter be open to the inspection of the city comptroller of said city. At the expiration of one year from the date of the service of the notice above provided for, the said Superior Waterworks Company, its successors or assigns, shall submit to the comptroller of said city, the said books of account, and the price to be paid for said plant and franchises shall be determined therefrom, as hereinbefore provided and upon the payment, in full, of said price, the said Superior Waterworks Company, its successors or assigns, shall surrender to said city its plant and franchises complete. The words 'net earnings' as used in this ordinance, shall mean the gross earnings of said waterworks, less the actual operating expenses thereof. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Madison, Watertown & Milwaukee Plankroad Co. v.

THOMPSON(1923)\nNo. 29\nArgued: Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 197, 198]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James B. Howe, of Seattle, Wash., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 197, 205]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Lindsay L. Thompson, of Olympia, Wash., for appellee.\n\n\n[263 U.S. 197, 211]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellants brought this suit to enjoin the Attorney General of Washington from enforcing the Anti-Alien Land Law of that state (chapter 50, Laws 1921), on the grounds that it is in conflict with the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, with the treaty between the United States and Japan, and with certain provisions of the Constitution of the state.\n The appellants are residents of Washington. The Terraces are citizens of the United States and of Washington. Nakatsuka was born in Japan of Japanese parents and is a subject of the emperor of Japan. The Terraces are the owners of a tract of land in King county which is particularly adapted to raising vegetables, and which for a number of years had been devoted to that and other agricultural purposes. The complaint alleges that Nakatsuka is a capable farmer and will be a desirable tenant of the land, that the Terraces desire to lease their land to him for the period of five years, that he desires to accept such lease, and that the lease would be made but \n\n[263 U.S. 197, 212]\n\u00a0\n for the act complained of; and it is alleged that the defendant, as Attorney General, has threatened to and will take steps to enforce the act against the appellants if they enter into such lease, and will treat the leasehold interest as forfeited to the state, and will prosecute the appellants criminally for violation of the act; that the act is so drastic and the penalties attached to its violation are so great that neither of the appellants may make the lease even to test the constitutionality of the act; and that, unless the court shall determine its validity in this suit, the appellants will be compelled to submit to it, whether valid or invalid, and thereby will be deprived of their property without due process of law and denied the equal protection of the laws.\n The Attorney General made a motion to dismiss the amended complaint upon the ground that it did not state any matters of equity or facts sufficient to entitle the appellants to relief. The District Court granted the motion and entered a decree of dismissal on the merits. The case is here on appeal from that decree.\n Section 331 of article 2 of the Constitution of Washington prohibits the ownership of land by aliens other than those who in good faith have declared intention to become citizens of the United States, except in certain \n\n[263 U.S. 197, 213]\n\u00a0\n instances not here involved. The act2 provides in substance that any such alien shall not own, take, have or hold the legal or equitable title, or right to any benefit of any land as defined in the act, and that land conveyed to or for the use of aliens in violation of the state constitution or of the act shall thereby be forfeited to the state, and it is made a gross misdemeanor, punishable by fine or imprisonment or both, knowingly to transfer land or the right to the control, possession or use of land to such an alien. It is also made a gross misdemeanor for any such alien having title to such land or the control, possession or use thereof, to refuse to disclose to the Attorney General or the prosecuting attorney the nature and extent of his interest in the land. The Attorney General and the prosecuting attorneys of the several counties are charged with the enforcement of the act. \n\n[263 U.S. 197, 214]\n\u00a0\n 1. The Attorney General questions the jurisdiction of the court to grant equitable relief even if the statute be unconstitutional. He contends that the appellants have a plain, adequate and speedy remedy at law; that the case involves but a single transaction, and that, if the proposed lease is made, the only remedy which the state has, so far as civil proceedings are concerned, is an escheat proceeding in which the validity of the law complained of may be finally determined; that an acquittal of the Terraces of the criminal offense created by the statute would protect them from further prosecution, and that Nakatsuka is liable criminally only upon his failure to disclose the fact that he holds an interest in the land.\n The unconstitutionality of a state law is not of itself ground for equitable relief in the courts of the United States. That a suit in equity does not lie where there is a plain adequate and complete remedy at law is so well understood as not to require the citation of authorities. But the legal remedy must be as complete, practical and efficient as that which equity could afford. Boise Artesian Water Co. v. Boise City, \n213 \nU.S. 276, 281\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 426; Walla Walla v. Walla Walla Water Co., \n172 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 12 S., 19 Sup. Ct. 77. Equity jurisdiction will be exercised to enjoin the threatened enforcement of a state law which contravenes the federal Constitution wherever it is essential in order effectually to protect property rights and the rights of persons against injuries otherwise irremediable; and in such a case a person, who is an officer of the state is clothed with the duty of enforcing its laws and who threatens and is about to commence proceedings, either civil or criminal, to enforce such a law against parties affected, may be enjoined from such action by a Federal court of equity.

Los Angeles, \n189 \nU.S. 207, 217\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 498.\n The Terraces' property rights in the land include the right to use, lease and dispose of it for lawful purposes (Buchanan v. Warley, \n245 \nU.S. 60, 74\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 16, L. R. A. 1918C, 210, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1201), and the Constitution protects these essential attributes of property (Holden v. Hardy, \n169 \nU.S. 366, 391\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 383), and also protects Nakatsuka in his right to earn a livelihood by following the ordinary occupations of life (Truax v. Raich, supra; Meyer v. State of Nebraska, \n262 U.S. 390\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 625). If, as claimed, the state act is repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, then its enforcement will deprive the owners of their right to lease their land to Nakatsuka, and deprive him of his right to pursue the occupation of farmer, and the threat to enforce it constitutes a continuing unlawful restriction upon and infringement of the rights of appellants, as to which they have no remedy at law which is as practical, efficient or adequate as the remedy in equity. And assuming, as suggested by the Attorney General, that after the making of the lease the validity of the law might be determined in proceedings to declare a forfeiture of the property to the state or in criminal proceedings to punish the owners, it does not follow that they may not appeal to equity for relief. No action at law can be initiated against them until after the consummation of the proposed lease. The threatened enforcement of the law deters them. In order to obtain a remedy at law, the owners, even if they would take the risk of fine, imprisonment and loss of property must continue to suffer deprivation of their right to dispose of or lease their land to any such alien until one is found who will join them \n\n[263 U.S. 197, 216]\n\u00a0\n in violating the terms of the enactment and take the risk of forfeiture. Similarly Nakatsuka must continue to be deprived of his right to follow his occupation as farmer until a land owner is found who is willing to make a forbidden transfer of land and take the risk of punishment. The owners have an interest in the freedom of the alien, and he has an interest in their freedom, to make the lease. The state act purports to operate directly upon the consummation of the proposed transaction between them, and the threat and purpose of the Attorney General to enforce the punishments and forfeiture prescribed prevents each from dealing with the other. Truax v. Raich, supra. They are not obliged to take the risk of prosecution, fines and imprisonment and loss of property in order to secure an adjudication of their rights. The complaint presents a case in which equitable relief may be had, if the law complained of is shown to be in contravention of the federal Constitution.\n\n 2. \nIs the act repugnant to the due process clause or the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\n Appellants contend that the act contravenes the due process clause in that it prohibits the owners from making lawful disposition or use of their land, and makes it a criminal offense for them to lease it to the alien, and prohibits him from following the occupation of farmer; and they contend that it is repugnant to the equal protection clause in that aliens are divided into two classes,-those who may and those who may not become citizens, one class being permitted, while the other is forbidden, to own and as defined.\n Alien inhabitants of a state, as well as all other persons within its jurisdiction, may invoke the protection of these clauses. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356, 369\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 1064; Truax v. Raich, supra, \n239 U.S. 39\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 7, L. R. A. 1916D, 545 Ann. Cas. 1917B, 283. The Fourteenth Amendment, as against the arbitrary and capricious or unjustly discriminatory action of the state, protects the owners in their \n\n[263 U.S. 197, 217]\n\u00a0\n right to lease and dispose of their land for lawful purposes and the alien resident in his right to earn a living by following ordinary occupations of the community, but it does not take away from the state those powers of police that were reserved at the time of the adoption of the Constitution. Barbier v. Connolly, \n113 \nU.S. 27, 31\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 357; Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623, 663\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 273; Powell v. Pennsylvania, \n127 \nU.S. 678, 683\n, 8 S. Sup.

Ct. 370; Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 622\n, 623 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 140. And in the exercise of such powers the state has wide discretion in determining its own public policy and what measures are necessary for its own protection and properly to promote the safety, peace and good order of its people.\n And, while Congress has exclusive jurisdiction over immigration, naturalization and the disposal of the public domain, each state, in the absence of any treaty provision to the contrary, has power to deny to aliens the right to own land within its borders. Hauenstein v. Lynham, \n100 \nU.S. 483, 484\n, 488 S.; Blythe v. Hinckley, \n180 \nU.S. 333, 340\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 390; Mr. Justice Field, speaking for this court ( Phillips v. Moore, \n100 U.S. 208\n, at page 212), said:\n'By the common law, an alien cannot acquire real property by operation of law, but may take it by act of the grantor, and hold it until office found; that is, until the fact of alienage is authoritatively established by a public officer, upon an inquest held at the instance of the government.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[263 U.S. 197, 218]\n\u00a0\n State legislation applying alike and equally to all aliens, withholding from them the right to own land, cannot be said to be capricious or to amount to an arbitrary deprivation of liberty or property, or to transgress the due process clause.\n\n This brings us to a consideration of appellants' contention that the act contravenes the equal protection clause. That clause secures equal protection to all in the enjoyment of their rights under like circumstances. In re Kemmler, supra; Giozza v. Tiernan, \n148 \nU.S. 657, 662\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 721. But this does not forbid every distinction in the law of a state between citizens and aliens resident therein. In Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 U.S. 312\n, at page 337, 42 Sup. Ct. 124, at page 131 (66 L. Ed. 254), this court said:\n'In adjusting legislation to the need of the people of a state, the legislature has a wide discretion and it may be fully conceded that perfect uniformity of treatment of all persons is neither practical nor desirable, that classification of persons is constantly necessary . ... Classification is the most inveterate of our reasoning processes. We can scarcely think or speak without consciously or unconsciously exercising it. It must therefore obtain in and determine legislation; but it must regard real resemblances and real differences between things, and persons, and class them in accordance with thier pertinence to the purpose in hand.'\n\n The rights, privileges and duties of aliens differ widely from those of citizens; and those of alien declarants differ substantially from those of nondeclarants. Formerly in many of the states the right to vote and hold office was extended to declarants, and many important offices have been held by them. But these rights have not been granted to nondeclarants. By various acts of Congress,4 \n\n[263 U.S. 197, 219]\n\u00a0\n declarants have been made liable to military duty, but no act has imposed that duty on nondeclarants. The fourth paragraph of article 1 of the treaty (37 Stat. 1504), invoked by the appellants, provides that the citizens or subjects of each shall be exempt in the territories of the other from compulsory military service either on land or sea, in the regular forces, or in the national guard, or in the militia; also from all contributions imposed in lieu of personal service, and from all forced loans or military exactions or contributions. The alien's formally declared bona fide intention to renounce forever all allegiance and fidelity to the sovereignty to which he lately has been a subject, and to become a citizen of the United States and permanently reside therein5 markedly distinguishes him from an ineligible alien or an eligible alien who has not so declared.\n By the statute in question all aliens who have not in good faith declared intention to become citizens of the United States, as specified in section 1(a), are called 'aliens,' and it is provided that they shall not 'own' 'land,' as defined in clauses (d) and (b) of section 1 respectively. The class so created includes all, but is not limited to, aliens not eligible to become citizens. Eligible aliens who have not declared their intention to become citizens are included, and the act provides that unless declarants be admitted to citizenship within seven years after the declaration is made, bad faith will be presumed. This leaves the class permitted so to own land made up of citizens and aliens who may, and who intend to, become citizens, and who in good faith have made the declaration required by the naturalization laws. The inclusion of good faith declarants in the same class with citizens does not unjustly discriminate against aliens who are ineligible or \n\n[263 U.S. 197, 220]\n\u00a0\n against eligible aliens who have failed to declare their intention. The classification is based on eligibility and purpose to naturalize. Eligible aliens are free white persons and persons of African nativity or descent. \n6\n Congress is not trammeled, and it may grant or withhold the privilege of naturalization upon any grounds or without any reason, as it sees fit. But it is not to be supposed that its acts defining eligibility are arbitrary or unsupported by reasonable consideration of public policy.\n The state properly may assume that the considerations upon which Congress made such classification are substantial and reasonable. Generally speaking, the natives of European countries are eligible. Japanese, Chinese and Malays are not. Appellants' contention that the state act discriminates arbitrarily against Nakatsuka and other ineligible aliens because of their race and color is without foundation. All persons of whatever color or race who have not declared their intention in good faith to become citizens are prohibited from so owning agricultural lands. Two classes of aliens inevitably result from the naturalization laws-those who may and those who may not become citizens. The rule established by Congress on this subject, in and of itself, furnishes a reasonable basis for classification in a state law withholding from aliens the privilege of land ownership as defined in the act. We agree with the court below (274 Fed. 841, 846) that:\n'It is obvious that one who is not a citizen and cannot become one lacks an interest in, and the power to effectually work for the welfare of, the state, and, so lacking, the state may rightfully deny him the right to own and lease real estate within its boundaries. If one incapable of citizenship may lease or own real estate, it is within the \n\n[263 U.S. 197, 221]\n\u00a0\n realm of possibility that every foot of land within the state might pass to the ownership or possession of noncitizens.'\n\n And we think it is clearly within the power of the state to include nondeclarant eligible aliens and ineligible aliens in the same prohibited class. Reasons supporting discrimination against aliens who may but who will not naturalize are obvious.\n Truax v. Raich, supra, does not support the appellants' contention. In that case the court held to be repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment an act of the Legislature of Arizona making it a criminal offense for an employer of more than five workers at any one time, regardless of kind or class of work, or sex of workers, to employ less than 80 per cent. qualified electors or native-born citizens of the United States. In the opinion it was pointed out that the legislation there in question did not relate to the devolution of real property, but that the discrimination was imposed upon the conduct of ordinary private enterprise covering the entire field of industry with the exception of enterprises that were relatively very small. It was said that the right to work for a living in the common occupations of the community is a part of the freedom which it was the purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment to secure.\n In the case before us, the thing forbidden is very different. It is not an opportunity to earn a living in common occupations of the community, but it is the privilege of owning or controlling agricultural land within the state. The quality and allegiance of those who own, occupy and use the farm lands within its borders are matters of highest importance and affect the safety and power of the state itself.\n The Terraces, who are citizens, have no right safeguarded by the Fourteenth Amendment to lease their land to aliens lawfully forbidden to take or have such lease. \n\n[263 U.S. 197, 222]\n\u00a0\n The state act is not repugnant to the equal protection clause and does not contravene the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n 3. \nThe state act, in our opinion, is not in conflict with the treaty7 between the United States and Japan. The preamble declares it to be 'a treaty of commerce and navigation,' and indicates that it was entered into for the purpose of establishing the rules to govern commercial intercourse between the countries.\n The only provision that relates to owning or leasing land is in the first paragraph of article 1, which is as follows:\n'The citizens or subjects of each of the high contracting parties shall have liberty to enter, travel and reside in the territories of the other to carry on trade, wholesale and retail, to own or lease and occupy houses, manufactories, warehouses and shops, to employ agents of their choice, to lease land for residential and commercial purposes, and generally to do anything incident to or necessary for trade upon the same terms as native citizens or subjects, submitting themselves to the laws and regulations there established.'\n\n For the purpose of bringing Nakatsuka within the protection of the treaty, the amended complaint alleges that, in addition to being a capable farmer, he is engaged in the business of trading, wholesale and retail, in farm products and shipping the same in intrastate, interstate and foreign commerce, and, instead of purchasing such farm products, he has produced, and desires to continue to produce, his own farm products for the purpose of selling them in such wholesale and retail trade, and if he is prevented from leasing land for the purpose of producing farm products for such trade he will be prevented from engaging in trade and the incidents to trade, as he is authorized to do under the treaty. \n\n[263 U.S. 197, 223]\n\u00a0\n To prevail on this point, appellants must show conflict between the state act and the treaty. Each state, in the absence of any treaty provision conferring the right may enact laws prohibiting aliens from owning land within its borders. Unless the right to own or lease land is given by the treaty, no question of conflict can arise. We think that the treaty not only contains no provision giving Japanese the right to own or lease land for agricultural purposes, but, when viewed in the light of the negotiations leading up to its consummation, the language shows that the high contracting parties respectively intended to withhold a treaty grant of that right to the citizens or subjects of either in the territories of the other. The right to 'carry on trade' or 'to own or lease and occupy houses, manufactories, warehouses and shops,' or 'to lease land for residential and commercial purposes,' or 'to do anything incident to or necessary for trade' cannot be said to include the right to own or lease or to have any title to or interest in land for agricultural purposes. The enumeration of rights to own or lease for other specified purposes impliedly negatives the right to own or lease land for these purposes. A careful reading of the treaty suffices in our opinion to negative the claim asserted by appellant that it conflicts with the state act.\n But if the language left the meaning of its provisions doubtful or obscure, the circumstances of the making of the treaty, as set forth in the opinion of the District Court (supra, 274 Fed. 844, 845), would resolve all doubts against the appellants' contention. The letter of Secretary of State Bryan to Viscount Chinda, July 16, 1913, shows that, in accordance with the desire of Japan, the right to own land was not conferred. And it appears that the right to lease land for other than residential and commercial purposes was deliberately withheld by substituting the words of the treaty, 'to lease land for residential and commercial purposes,' for a more comprehensive clause \n\n[263 U.S. 197, 224]\n\u00a0\n contained in an earlier draft of the instrument, namely, 'to lease land for residential, commercial, industrial, manufacturing and other lawful purposes.'\n\n 4. \nThe act complained of is not repugnant to section 33 of article 2 of the state Constitution.\n That section provides that 'the ownership of lands by aliens ... is prohibited in this state. ...' Appellants assert that the proposed lease of farm land for five years is not 'ownership,' and is not prohibited by that clause of the state Constitution and cannot be forbidden by the state Legislature. That position is untenable. In State v. O'Connell, 121 Wash. 542, 209 Pac. 865, a suit for the purpose of escheating to the state an undivided one-half interest in land, or the proceeds thereof, held in trust for the benefit of an alien, a subject of the British empire, decided since this appeal was taken, the Supreme Court of Washington held that the statute in question did not contravene this provision of the Constitution of that state. The question whether or not a state statute conflicts with the Constitution of the state is settled by the decision of its highest court. Carstairs v. Cochran, \n193 \nU.S. 10, 16\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 318. This court 'is without authority to review and revise the construction affixed to a state statute as to a state matter by the court of last resort of the state.' Quong Ham Wah Co. v.

Head, of Texarkana, Ark., Otis Wing, of De Queen, Ark., and Henry Moore, Jr., of Texarkana, Ark., for appellants.\n Messrs. S. W. Moore, of New York City, and James B. McDonough, of Ft. Smith, Ark., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Legislature of Arkansas created, by a special law, the Little River drainage and levee district of Sevier county, No. 1, a body corporate, and defined its boundaries. Act 186 of Acts of 1915, p. 747, amended by Act 79 of Acts of 1917, p. 348. This suit was brought in the federal court for the Western District of Arkansas, Texarkana Division, by two railroad companies to restrain enforcement of a tax levied in the year 1918 under that act. The defendants below were the district, its officers, and the sheriff and collector of Sevier county. The statute (section 4) named a board of directors, imposed upon it the duty of constructing drainage works, empowered it to raise the necessary money by construction notes and an issue of bonds to the amount of $100,000, and directed it--\n'to assess and levy annually a tax upon the valuation as it shall appear each year on the assessment book of Sevier county, Arkansas, upon all lands and ... upon the railroad tracks of companies in said district, as appraised by the Board of Railroad Commissioners ; ... not to exceed, however, in any one year, the sum of six per cent. of the assessed valuation of the said property within the district.'- \n\n[261 U.S. 481, 483]\n\u00a0\n\n\n The estimated cost of the improvement was about $75,000. For the purpose of defraying a part of this cost the directors levied in the year 1918, a tax of $7,346.12, being 6 per cent. of the assessed value of all real estate within the district. Of this amount it levied upon the railroads $4,194.60, being 6 per cent. of the assessed value of their property. Upon the 12,000 acres of land, being all the other real estate in the district, the directors laid, in the aggregate, taxes of $3,151.52, being 6 per cent. of its assessed value. Thus 57 per cent. of the burden was imposed upon the railroads, and 43 per cent. upon the owners of all the other real estate. Plaintiffs claimed that the tax was v id. After a hearing, at which much evidence was introduced, the District Court entered a decree for a permanent injunction. Its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, on the ground that the facts reveal an instance of discrimination so palpable and arbitrary as to amount to a denial of equal protection of the laws. 277 Fed. 708. The case is here on appeal.\n The applicable rules of law are settled. The Legislature of a state may, if consistent with its Constitution, establish a drainage district, may set the boundaries, and may apportion the burden by fixing the basis of assessment and of taxation. The Legislature's determination that lands will be benefited by a public improvement for which it authorizes a special tax is ordinarily conclusive. Its action in so doing cannot be assailed under the Fourteenth Amendment, unless it is palpably arbitrary or discriminatory. Houck v. Little River Drainage District, \n239 \nU.S. 254, 262\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 58; Valley Farms Co. v. County of Westchester, No. 136, \n261 U.S. 155\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 261, 67 L. Ed. --, decided February 19, 1923. A proportion of the franchise of a railroad may, consistently with the federal Constitution, be included as real estate within the district. To justify an assessment upon property, the benefit from the improvement need not be a direct one. It may, in case of a railroad, consist of gains derived from increased traffic. \n\n[261 U.S. 481, 484]\n\u00a0\n Branson v. Bush, \n251 U.S. 182\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 113. But vague speculation as to future increased traffic receipts will not justify a basis of taxation which necessarily produces manifest inequality. Compare Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Road Improvement District No. 6, \n256 \nU.S. 658, 661\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 604. In the case at bar the lower courts concurred in their findings of controverted facts. We accept these findings. Dun v. Lumbermen's Credit Association, \n209 U.S. 20\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 335, 14 Ann. Cas. 501. The question for decision is whether facts, admitted and found, establish that the tax levied upon plaintiffs violates rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The district is wholly rural. Little river bounds it on the west and south. It contains about 12,000 acres of rich land. Only one-tenth is under cultivation. The rest is wild and untillable, because marshy or subject to overflow. The aggregate assessed value of the 12,000 acres was in 1918 only $52,525.33. The lands were then worth from $8 to $40 an acre. The proposed improvement would increase their value at least $250,000. Along the northerly part of its western boundary the district is traversed for a distance of about two miles, by a singletrack railroad. The total length of track within the district, including a detour line and sidings, is 3.61 miles. The railroad is owned by the Texarkana & Ft. Smith, and is operated by the Kansas City Southern, as part of its line from Missouri to the Gulf. The railroad property is 40.43 acres in area, and is assessed at $ 69,910. It would derive no direct benefit from the construction of the ditches and embankment designed to drain and to protect the district from overflow, because the tracks are laid upon a fill or dump (with the exception of one trestle) and are above flood level. The railroad would derive some measure of indirect benefit, because the drained land would doubtless be cultivated, and more extensive cultivation would probably increase traffic over the line. \n\n[261 U.S. 481, 485]\n\u00a0\n The tax laid imposes upon the railroad, which can receive no direct or immediate benefit, a very heavy burden, and the lands, which will receive a large direct (and possibly immediate) benefit, are required to bear only a very small part of the burden, The market value of the 12,000 acres may increase largely before any additional land is cultivated, or even before the improvement is made. The railroad can derive the indirect benefit, through increased traffic, only after the drainage of the wild lands has been effected and the reclaimed lands are being cultivated. The ork of reclamation had not even begun. Obviously there could not be any increase in traffic receipts during the year 1918, in which the tax is laid. Appellants argue that the assessed valuation of the lands would probably be greatly raised in later years, that the assessment upon the railroad property would probably not be raised, that the proportion of the annual burden imposed upon the railroad would diminish from year to year, and that, in course of time, the aggregate of the taxes levied upon each piece of property would be thus adjusted, so as to correspond to the benefits received. This argument is relied upon to save the scheme of apportionment. But it rests wholly upon prophecy. The fact is that the tax levied is grossly discriminatory. The best that can be said of the scheme of taxation (so far as it concerns the railroad) is that the burdens imposed will grow less, as its ability to bear them grows greater.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","190":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTOLEDO SCALE CO. v. COMPUTING SCALE CO.(1923)\nNo. 339\nArgued: March 16, 1923Decided: April 9, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[261 U.S. 399, 400]\n\u00a0\n This case comes here by writs of certiorari granted to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit to review the proceedings of that court in enforcement of a final decree in a suit to enjoin infringement of a patent and for an accounting of profits. The patent had expired pending the litigation, but the accounting resulted \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 401]\n\u00a0\n in a decree of the District Court for Northern Illinois for profits of more than $400,000 in favor of the Computing Scale Company against the Toledo Scale Company. The Circuit Court of Appeals, which had sustained the patent (208 Fed. 410, 125 C. C. A. 622), affirmed the decree for profits (279 Fed. 648), but stayed the mandate to permit an application to this court for a writ of certiorori, which was denied January 9, 1922 (\n257 U.S. 657\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 184). On the same day, the Toledo Company, a corporation of New Jersey, filed a bill in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio against the Computing Company, a corporation of Ohio, to enjoin it from enforcing the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit on the ground that it was obtained by fraud. The Computing Scale Company filed an answer, raising first a special plea to the jurisdiction and then responding on the merits, denying fraud, and pleading res judicata. The bill also made parties defendant the sureties on the supersedeas bond in the Circuit Court of Appeals, the Fidelity Deposit Company and the United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company, both corporations of Maryland, as well as three Toledo banks, citizens of Ohio, which held money deposited to the credit of the surety companies by the Toledo Company as indemnity, and asked that they all be enjoined from in any way satisfying or aiding to satisfy the decree. The Computing Company then filed in the Circuit Court of Appeals a petition for a rule against the Toledo Company, to show cause why it should not be enjoined from maintaining the bill in Ohio, and why a summary decree should not issue against the sureties. Pending a hearing as to this rule, the Ohio court granted a temporary injunction restraining the Computing Scale Company, and the sureties and the banks as prayed by the Toledo Company. The Circuit Court of Appeals thereafter heard the petition for the rule to which the Toledo Com- \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 402]\n\u00a0\n pany had made answer, in which by way of exhibit to its averments it set up as a defense the complete record in the injunction suit in Ohio. The Circuit Court of Appeals then made the order which is here for review. It reads as follows:\n'We now receive from the Computing Company the certified copy of the Supreme Court's order denying Toledo Company's petition for writ of certiorari, and we direct the clerk to file it in this cause.\n\n'Unless the mandate which we now formulate be stayed on Toledo Company's motion filed within five days, the clerk is directed to issue and transmit to the court below the following mandate:\n\n'(1) Enter of record our affirmance of the final decree on accounting.\n\n'(2) Enjoin Toledo Company from further maintaining its Ohio bill and from filing elsewhere any similar bill.\n\n'(3) Enter summary decree against the sureties on the supersedeas bonds for the amount due upon the accounting decree, including all costs in both courts, but not exceeding the penalties of the bonds.\n\n'(4) Ascertain Computing Company's expenses in this matter, including reasonable attorney's fees, paid or incurred since the Supreme Court's denial of the petition for writ of certiorari on January 9, 1922, and enter summary decree therefor against Toledo Company, but not against the sureties on the supersedeas bonds.'\n\n 281 Fed. 488.\n The patent, the subject of controversy in this case, was for an automatic computing scale, issued to one Smith in September, 1895, and reissued April 28, 1896. It related to improvements in weighing scales, wherein the weight and selling price could be seen by the weigher at a glance without mental calculation. It consisted of a pan weighing device attached to an indicator drum inside of a casing with a slot through which the figures on the drum as it \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 403]\n\u00a0\n revolved in response to the effect of the weight would so co-ordinate with figures on the casing as to show the weight and correct price on the same line. The patentee in his specifications admitted that the general combination was an old one, but said that the object of his improvement was to provide scales, extraordinarily sensitive to weights of small amount, and accurately registering them. He explained that an essential feature of the indicator drum in his improvement was that it should be made of very light material because scales of this kind theretofore would not weigh alike successively, due to the inertia of the revolving drum, the force required to operate it, and the difficulty of stopping, and so he had constructed his drum of a skeleton frame of aluminum with a periphery of a thin sheet of paper.\n The claims in controversy were:\n'5. An indicator drum for weighing mechanism consisting of a spindle provided with a plurality of skeleton frames of light material and secured to said spindle, and having secured to their periphones a sheet of paper forming a cylinder.\n\n'6. An indicator drum for weighing mechanism consisting of a spindle provided with a plurality of skeleton disks or frames of thin aluminum, having a sheet of paper extending around and secured to their periphones to form a cylinder.'\n\n The Computing Scale Company and the Toledo Scale Company were competitors in business. The former had acquired the Smith patent by the purchase of the assets of the Boston Computing Scale Company, and before 1906 was manufacturing scales using the Smith cylindrical drum in competition with scales of the Toledo Company having a fan-shaped registering dial. There had been patent suits between them concerning other parts of the weighing mechanism than the indicator. Each had other patents in this field. In 1906, the Toledo Company \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 404]\n\u00a0\n did not give up its fan-shaped scales, but began the manufacture of scales with an indicator drum of skeleton aluminum frame and paper periphery, and so increased its sales of them, so that they ultimately constituted the larger part of its business. T is led to two suits by the Computing Scale Company in 1907 against the Toledo Company in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Nothing was done with them until the suit at bar was brought in the District Court for Northern Illinois in 1910. Then, as a condition of getting extension of time to take evidence herein, the Computing Scale Company was required by the court to dismiss the Ohio suits. In its answer to the bill in this case, filed in August, 1910, the Toledo Company alleged that the Smith patent and the claims 5 and 6 had been anticipated by a patent granted to one Phinney in 1870 and further averred anticipation 'by reason of prior public use and sale by various persons at various places and among others at Pawtucket by William H. Phinney, then and now, as defendant is informed and believed residing at said Pawtucket.'\n On the trial, the Toledo Company's expert testified that he had built a Phinney scale following the patent to Phinney, but that he could not get it to stop twice within an ounce of the same weight, and that a scale which would not weigh within a very small fraction of an ounce was not an instrument of precision and not a commercial article at all. It should be said that the specifications of the Phinney patent made no reference to the material of which the cylinder of the scales was to be made or its weight, or the importance of those features. The District Court held that the fourth and fifth claims of the Smith patent were valid, and this was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, April 15, 1913 (208 Fed. 410, 413, 125 C. C. A. 622), holding that Smith had put in the hands of the world's vendors of commodities the first usable computing scale; \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 405]\n\u00a0\n that long before the 'paper' art, including a patent to Phinney in 1870, had proposed to teach practical scale makers how to build automatic computing scales, but all attempts to make them were failures, that in the 25 years between Phinney and Smith the brightest and most skillful men had sought the necessarily tremendous commercial success of a reliable computing scale, but had not found it until Smith had the happy conception that the lightest possible drum would secure the required accuracy of revolution and stopping.\n On May 14, 1913, the Toledo Company made a motion in the Circuit Court of Appeals that the court include in its mandate, affirming the decree of the District Court for an accounting leave to rehear the cause and to permit the Toledo Company to introduce proof that computing scales had been made and sold and introduced into use by the patentee Phinney of Pawtucket, R. I., which had a cylinder drum of light wood skeleton covered with thin paper and anticipated the drum of Smith. Three Phinney scales and 13 supporting affidavits were introduced. These included one of the son of Phinney, the patentee, who had been with his father during his manufacture and sale of the scales until his death and who still lived at Pawtucket, of Phinney's widow, and also those of residents of Pawtucket who said they had bought and used the scales. The affidavits also disclosed that in a suit against the Federal Company for infringement of the Smith patent brought by the Computing Scale Company in Philadelphia, which never came to trial, all this evidence had been taken and was on file. The three Phinney scales which were exhibits there had been in the custody of Church & Church who had been counsel for the Computing Scale Company in Philadelphia. It was also shown that the Computing Scale Company had three or four of these scales and drums in their possession at Dayton. It also appeared from young Phin- \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 406]\n\u00a0\n ney's affidavit that the Boston Computing Company, which owned the Smith patent and which subsequently was bought out by the complainant Computing Scale Company, was trying to buy the scales which Phinney had. The evidence tended to show that only 20 scales had been made by Phinney, and that no scales were made after 1895. The president of the Toledo Company in his affidavit excused failure earlier to discover this evidence by saying that the company made every effort to learn of prior use. His counsel explained that he had been led away from investigation into manufacture of Phinney scales at Pawtucket, which was not visited by agents of the Toledo Company till after June, 1912, by the fact that the model of the Phinney patent at the Patent Office was only a small one of solid wood and not of light material, and that he only acquired knowledge of Phinney's manufacture and use of scales with indicator drums by accident after June, 1912, from counsel for defendant in a suit brought by the Computing Company against the Standard Company in 1911. There was no direct charge in these 1913 affidavits that the Computing Scale Company was purchasing and gathering in these Phinney scales to conceal them, but there were averments in the affidavits which were only relevant to sustain such a charge and were evidently inserted for that purpose. The 1913 motion for a rehearing was overruled by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The case went back for an accounting, and in 1917 the Toledo Company took depositions of the witnesses whose affidavits had been filed in 1913, and sought to use the evidence to reduce the damages by showing what kind of a scale might have been constructed by the Toledo Company without infringing the Smith patent, but the evidence was not given weight for that purpose. The expert of the Toledo Company in these depositions said he did not test the Phinney scales of wood and paper cylinders \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 407]\n\u00a0\n when they were in the custody of the Toledo Company, because he did not think they would weigh properly. The District Court confirmed the master's report of the accounting and made a decree accordingly for $420,000. This was carried on appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed it in October, 1921. 279 Fed. 648.\n The Toledo Company at the same time again made a motion for leave to open up the case that it might introduce the evidence contained in the affidavits presented in May, 1913, and the depositions taken in 1917, and retry the issue of validity of the patent and show its invalidity by reason of the Phinney prior manufacture, sale and use. In brief of counsel urging the granting of this motion for the Toledo Company, it was said:\n'To refuse to consider the evidence in the present record respecting the Phinney scale, as affecting the validity of the patent in suit, would be to permit the plaintiff to take advantage of essential facts known to it and unknown to the defendant or the court and its consequent imposition on both.'\n\n In the subsequently filed petition for certiorari to this court, counsel for the Toledo Company, in discussing this same issue, said:\n'The affidavits further showed that plaintiff had full knowledge of the Phinney scales for more than 10 years, that evidence and numerous samples of them had been introduced in a suit which plaintiff had brought at Philadelphia 10 years earlier upon the reissued patent here in suit, that the prosecution of said suit had been abandoned because of such evidence, and that plaintiff had suppressed and concealed such fact from the court and defendant throughout the litigation in the present cause.'\n\n The motion to reopen the case was denied by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 279 Fed. 674. An application to review this October, 1921, decree by certiorari was made and was denied by this court January 9, 1922. \n257 U.S. 657\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 184. \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 408]\n\u00a0\n At once, the Toledo Company filed its bill in the United States Court for the Northern District of Ohio, which is summarized by the Circuit Court of Appeals in its opinion. 281 Fed. 488, 491. It charged that since 1901 the Computing Company had formed a conspiracy with certain of its officers and agents to monopolize the computing scale business of the country, and to put the Toledo Company out of business; that in 1902 it built and sold a dishonest scale that the Toledo Company exposed in circulars, which the Computing Company sought, but failed, to enjoin, which increased its malicious hatred toward the Toledo Company; that then the Toledo Company was making a fan scale, which on the strength of patents held by it the Computing Company sought unsuccessfully to enjoin, but dismissed the suits without a trial; that in 1901 the Computing Company brought suit in the Eastern Pennsylvania District to enjoin the Federal Company from infringing the Smith patent, and introduced three Phinney scales as exhibits in evidence and depositions already referred to; that the suit was dismissed, because the Computing Company was advised by counsel that the Phinney defense was dangerous, and that the exhibits were by stipulation retained by counsel for the Federal Company, who lent them to counsel for Computing Company, in whose custody they were until after the issue of validity had been decided in Chicago in favor of the Computing Company; that a suit brought against one Randall in Pennsylvania in 1901, and against the Standard Company in Wisconsin in 1911, on the Smith patent, by the Computing Company, had been dismissed after production of similar evidence of the Phinney prior use; that after 1906 the Computing Company secretly purchased and took into its possession all the Phinney scales it could get, being all of the 20 which Phinney ever made, except one or two then in the hands of users, and except those in the Federal, Randall, and Standard \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 409]\n\u00a0\n suits; that these purchases were made in pursuance of the conspiracy, secretly and fraudulently, for the purpose of preventing the Toledo Company and the District Court of Northern Illinois and the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit from learning of the Phinney commercial practice; that the Toledo Company made diligent effort and investigation to find the Phinney commercial practice, and also evidence of the Computing Company's fraudulent suppression of evidence thereof; that, while Toledo Company had had knowledge of the Phinney commercial practice since 1913, it had no knowledge of Computing Company's fraudulent suppression thereof until December 20, 1921, which was after the affirmance of the accounting decree. The bill further averred that counsel for the Computing Company in 1913, in their brief on appeal from the District Court in this case, said that Phinney had never made a successful scales or put it on the market, which the Computing Company knew to be false, and that this deceived the Toledo Company and its counsel into damaging admissions in the Circuit Court of Appeals as to the material of which Phinney's scales were actually made.\n This bill was supported by the same evidence used in the Seventh Circuit applications of 1913 and 1921, and also by the affidavit of one Koehne, who said that he was a patent lawyer and solicitor, and had been in the employ of the Computing Company for a number of years; that he was privy to the conspiracy charged in the bill and a participant in it, but that the counsel employed to defend the various patent suits referred to in the bill were not; and that the agents and managers of the Computing Company with whom he worked and talked were dead.\n Messrs. Frederick P. Fish, of Boston, Mass., Geo. D. Welles, of Toledo, Ohio, and H. \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 410]\n\u00a0\n K. Tenney, of Chicago, Ill., for Toledo Scale Co.\n\n\n[261 U.S. 399, 417]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles Markell, of Baltimore, Md., for Fidelity & Deposit Co. of Maryland.\n Mr. John M. Zane, of Chicago, Ill., for Computing Scale Co.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n It is insisted by counsel for the petitioner that it is within our power, and it is our duty on this writ, to go into the merits of the issue of the validity of the Smith patent and of the correctness of the money decree for profits. We were asked to do this by an application for writ of certiorari, which we denied January 9, 1922. \n257 U.S. 657\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 184. The decree then sought to be reviewed was entered in October, 1921. The application for this second writ of certiorari, which we are now considering, was not made until May 22, 1922, more than three months after \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 418]\n\u00a0\n the final decree in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the payment of profits. Section 6 of Act of September 6, 1916 (chapter 448, 39 Stat. 726, 727 [Comp. St.  1228a]), directs:\n'That no writ of error, appeal, or writ of certiorari intended to bring up any cause for review by the Supreme Court shall be allowed or entertained unless duly applied for within three months after entry of the judgment or decree complained of.'\n\n This deprives us of jurisdiction to consider the merits of the decree of October, 1921\n\n\n The case of Hamilton Shoe Co. v. Wolf Brothers, \n240 U.S. 251\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 269, is cited to sustain a contrary view, but it fails to do so. In that case, a writ of certiorari had been applied for to this court to review an interlocutory decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals and denied. The case went back to the District Court for a final accounting for infringement of a trade-mark, and after a final decree for profits came again to the Circuit Court of Appeals and was affirmed. Then a second application was made for a certiorari and it was allowed. The respondent centended that this court could not review the whole case, including the merits of the interlocutory decree because of the denial of the first application for certiorari. We held that the denial constituted no bar because the decree sought then to be reviewed was not final. Our power to grant writs of certiorari extends to interlocutory as well as final decrees, and a mere denial of the writ to an interlocutory ruling of the Circuit Court of Appeals does not limit our power to review the whole case when it is brought here by our certiorari on final decree. In the case before us, the decree of October, 1921, which we declined to review in January, 1922, was a final decree, and we are expressly denied power to review it after three months.\n What we are to consider on this writ is whether the Circuit Court of Appeals on the petition for a rule against \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 419]\n\u00a0\n the Toledo Company had anything presented to it in the record in the Ohio court which required it to stay its hand in using available process to enforce its final decree. We are very clear that it had not. It has been necessary to make an elaborate statement to show the complicated facts; but when they are arrayed in order so as to be understood, there is no escape from the conclusion that the action of the Ohio court could not, and should not, interfere with or stay the due course of proceedings of enforce the Seventh Circuit decree.\n The application to the Circuit Court of Appeals in 1913 to frame its mandate, so as to permit that court to rehear the issue on the merits of the validity of the patent already found and affirmed by both courts, was addressed to the discretion of that court, and it was exercised to deny the application, presumably because the application showed on its face a lack of the due diligence in not producing the alleged newly discovered evidence in time to have presented it to the trial court at the hearing on the merits in June, 1912. The Toledo Company had been advised of the claim of its infringement of the Smith patent within a year after it began to make and sell the alumimum cylinder scale in 1906 by two suits of the Computing Scale Company, and its attention had been directed to the necessity of preparing for a defense. This was further stimulated by the Chicago suit, the one at bar, in 1910, in which the Toledo Company filed an answer averring, among other defenses, that the Smith patent had been anticipated, not only by the Phinney patent itself, but by prior manufacture, sale, and commercial use by Phinney of scales which embraced the device whose invention was claimed by Smith, and that this prior use was at Pawtucket, R. I.\n In spite of this, the agents and counsel of the Toledo Company never visited Pawtucket before the hearing on the v lidity of the Smith patent in June, 1912. The only \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 420]\n\u00a0\n reason for this failure is the suggestion that the model of the cylinder deposited by Phinney in the Patent Office with his application was a small solid wooden cylinder, not full size, which led counsel to think that no practice under the patent would show lightness of material and weight. It was a matter of equitable discretion for the Circuit Court of Appeals to determine whether this was sufficient excuse. Hopkins v. Hebard, \n235 U.S. 287\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 26. Certainly it was not an abuse of its discretion to hold that it was not a good one. The natural and obvious course of one tracing out evidence of prior commercial use of Phinney which was formally averred in the Toledo Company's bill to have taken place at Pawtucket, would have been to go to Pawtucket and look up Phinney, or, if dead, his family and successors. Had this course been pursued, Phinney's widow and son would have been found there, and several of those whose affidavits and depositions are now produced, who say that they bought and used the Phinney scales made with light wood and paper cylinders. From those witnesses, too, the investigator would have been led directly to the proceedings in Federal Company suit in Philadelphia, the record of which contained all this evidence, and he would have found without difficulty the three original Phinney scales that were exhibits in that case. Nor can we say that it was an abuse of discretion for the Circuit Court of Appeals to refuse a similar application, made in October, 1921, to open up the case to permit a rehearing of an issue, settled 9 years before, when the evidence as to the lack of diligence of the Toledo Company was just the same.\n It is unnecessary to determine whether the applications of 1913 and 1921 come within the proper definition of a bill of review in a court of chancery. It is enough to say that whether they were merely motions for rehearing, like a motion for new trial at law, or were applications in the nature of a bill of review, they were addressed to the \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 421]\n\u00a0\n sound discretion of the court, and based as they were upon the ground of newly discovered evidence, the indispensable condition of their being granted was that the failure to discover the evidence in time for the trial was not due to a lack of diligence on the part of the applicant. That condition precedent was not fulfilled.\n Do the additional facts averred in the bill filed in the Ohio court change the situation? It is said they show extrinsic fraud committed by the Computing Scale Company upon proof of which a court of equity, although in another jurisdiction, having jurisdiction of the parties, may enjoin the one guilty of the fraud from profiting by a decree so obtained. There has been much discussion as to whether extrinsic fraud is here alleged, and the case of United States v. Throckmorton, \n98 U.S. 61\n, is cited and numerous other authorities since that case. We do not find ourselves obliged to enter upon a consideration of the sometimes nice distinctions made between intrinsic and extrinsic frauds in the application of the rule, because in any case to justify setting aside a decree for fraud whether extrinsic or intrinsic, it must appear that the fraud charged really prevented the party complaining from making a full and fair defense. If it does not so appear, then proof of the ultimate fact, to wit, that the decree was obtained by fraud fails. That is the case here.\n The allegations of the bill and of the affidavits are of a conspiracy by the inner circle of the Computing Scale Company's agents commenced in 1902, years before the Toledo Company began to make and sell cylinder drum scales, to monopolize the business of making and selling scales, to put the Toledo Company out of business, and after it began to make cylinder scales, to prevent it from so doing by suits brought on the Smith patent, which it knew to be invalid because of the Phinney prior use. In pursuance of the c nspiracy it is charged that it proceeded to buy up and keep from the Toledo Company knowledge \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 422]\n\u00a0\n of, and access to, the Phinney scales. Proof is adduced to show that the Computing Scale Company did buy up as many of the Phinney scales as it could secure. But there is not anywhere in the record, which we can find, or which has been pointed out to us, any real evidence that the Toledo Company was, in the slightest degree, interfered with by acts of the Computing Company in its search for evidence of the Phinney prior use. Had the Toledo Company found, as it might easily have done, the witnesses in Pawtucket, it would have found the oral evidence as to the existence of the Phinney scales, and would have been led directly to the Philadelphia suit, where it would have found the cylinders it did find after June, 1912. Moreover, there were the Randall suit in Philadelphia in 1901 and the Standard suit in Wisconsin, where other Phinney scales were also exhibits and open to inspection by the Toledo Company before 1912. There is not a scintilla of evidence to show any effort on the part of the Computing Scale Company to induce any witnesses not to testify, or to spirit them away from contact with the Toledo Company. There is nothing to show that, if the Computing Scale Company had not bought the Phinney scales, the Toledo Company would have found them any earlier. The passages in the brief on behalf of the Computing Company in the first hearing of the case on appeal in the Circuit Court of Appeals, which stated that Phinney had not made scales for commercial use, had reference, of course, to the record before the court, were made after the trial in the District Court, and so could not have misled the Toledo Company in its preparation for that trial. The conclusion is unavoidable that the only cause of the failure of the Toledo Company to produce this Phinney evidence was the mistake of the counsel for the Toledo Company in assuming that an inadequate model in the Patent Office filed by Phinney showed no relevant prior use by him, and the failure of the Toledo Company's agents \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 423]\n\u00a0\n to take the ordinary and obvious course to make adequate inquiry at Pawtucket as to the prior use which it had averred in the bill. Certainly the Computing Scale Company was not responsible for the inadequacy of Phinney's model or for the failure of the Toledo Company to make the inquiry before June 1912. The averments as to conspiracy to monopolize, and to drive the Toledo Company out of business, and the details of the purchase of Phinney scales, are all irrelevant because they are not shown to have had any causal connection with the failure of the Toledo Company to find out earlier what it did stumble on in 1913.\n We do not understand it to be contended that there was any relation between the Computing Scale Company and the Toledo Company, which made it the duty of the former to furnish evidence to the latter to weaken its own case, or that silence in respect to the Phinney scales constituted that kind of fraud which would invalidate the decree, unless it was accompanied by acts which actually prevented the Toledo Company's finding and availing itself of such evidence. Clearly there is no such rule of law in a case like this.\n Another aspect of this record leads to the same conclusion. However nice the distinction between extrinsic and instrinsic fraud, we have been cited to no case where it has been held that fraud is extrinsic when the court rendering the decree attacked had before it the same issue of fraud on the same facts, only a little more elaborated as to the motive of the party charged with committing it. The necessary inference from the affidavits filed in May, 1913, by the Toledo Company, and its depositions in 1917, and its motion and briefs in 1921, in the Circuit Court of Appeals, was that the Computing Scale Company had been securing Phinney scales with a view of concealing them from the Toledo Company, and these were all before the Circuit Court of Appeals when it finally refused \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 424]\n\u00a0\n to open the decree on its merits in 1921 to let in the evidence. It did not add to the weight of that evidence, for the purpose for which it could be used in either court, that this was the result of a conspiracy to monopolize trade, or that it grew out of malicious feeling toward the Toledo Company. What the District Court for Northern Ohio was doing in hearing the injunction suit and issuing a temporary injunction was merely reviewing the discretion of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit in dealing with the same ultimate facts and reaching a different conclusion. This was beyond its province. Embry v. Palmer, \n107 \nU.S. 3, 11\n, 2 S. Sup. Ct. 25; Telford v. Brinkerhoff, 163 Ill. 439, 443, 45 N. E. 156; Marine Ins. Co. v. Hodgson, 7 Cranch, 332.\n It is pressed upon us that the amount of this decree, which by reason of growing interest will considerably exceed half a million dollars, is such that its enforcement may be ruinous to the Toledo Company, and yet that company has never had an opportunity to bring to a hearing this evidence of the Phinney prior commercial use which on the showing and argument is clearly a complete defense to a suit prosecuted by an unscrupulous competitor, conscious all the time of its falsity and injustice. This view of the case is not a fair one. The Toledo Company had a chance to make a defense of the Phinney prior use and failed to do so because of its own lack of diligence. As it did not secure a hearing of the Phinney defense, its opponent had no change to meet it, as possibly it might have done by showing that the use relied on was a futile one because the Phinney scale as made was not practical, or did not weigh accurately, or accomplish the purpose of the Smith patent. The fact that but 20 machines were made, and that these ceased to be used years ago or were destroyed, suggests the probability of such an answer. We cannot know what the result of the hearing would have been on this \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 425]\n\u00a0\n issue if tried, because only one side is presented. We are prevented from knowing it by a most salutary rule of law which, after parties have had a full and fair opportunity to prepare their case, refuses to permit them to drag out litigation by bringing in new evidence which with due diligence they ought to have discovered before the hearing. The apparent hardship of particular cases should not and cannot weigh against the application of this sound principle. As Mr. Justice Story remarked in Ocean Insurance Co. v. Fields, 2 Story, 59, 18 Fed. Cas. No. 10,406;\n'It is for the public interest and policy to make an end to litigation, or, as was pointedly said by a great jurist, that suits may not be immortal, while men are mortal.'\n\n The surety companies object to the order of the Circuit Court of Appeals, directing the District Court to enter summary judgment against them for the amount due on the decree, because it causes them to pay a decree which the Toledo Company, their principal, deposited in Toledo banks enough money to their order to pay, but which a court of competent jurisdiction enjoins them from paying, or from using this money to pay. They say they are to be ground between the upper and the nether millstones. They say they are indifferent between the parties, and only wish to be protected. The order which the Circuit Court of Appeals directed against them was within its jurisdiction. Pease v. Rathbun-Jones Engineering Co., \n243 \nU.S. 273, 278\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 283, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 1147. It was right, was final, and they must obey it. They can appeal from the order of the Ohio court. Indeed, we are advised that the cause is now pending on appeal in the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit. If they satisfy the decree of the Seventh Circuit, they can be reasonably confident that they will not be required to suffer a double burden. The Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit is not likely to ignore the ruling of this court in the premises, and the cause pending in the Sixt Circuit can be brought within the jurisdiction of this court at any time by certiorari. \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 426]\n\u00a0\n It is objected that the Circuit Court of Appeals had no power to direct the District Court to enjoin the Toledo Company from further maintaining its Ohio bill or from filing elsewhere any similar bill. It is also objected that it cannot direct the District Court to assess the Computing Company's expenses including a reasonable attorney's fee in the matter of the Ohio bill and to enter a summary decree therefor. We think these orders were within the power of the Circuit Court of Appeals. This Ohio proceeding was instituted to halt and defeat the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, while that decree was still in that court to be enforced by mandate to the lower court. Under section 262 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1239), that court had the right to issue all writs not specifically provided for by statute which might be necessary for the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. It could therefore itself have enjoined the Toledo Company from interfering with the execution of its own decree, Merrimack River Savings Bank v. Clay Center, \n219 \nU.S. 527, 535\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 295, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 513; or it could direct the District Court to do so, as it did, Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur v. Cauble, \n255 U.S. 356\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 338; Steel Co. v. R. R. Supply Co., \n244 \nU.S. 294, 299\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 506; Kessler v. Eldred, \n206 U.S. 285\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 611, 51 Ed. 1065. Moreover, when the character of the proceeding initiated by the Toledo Company, a party before it, to stop the execution of its decree, was disclosed on a full hearing on the petition for a rule against the Toledo Company, it had jurisdiction to determine whether the filing and maintenance of the bill was in contempt of its jurisdiction, New Orleans v. New York S. S. Co., 20 Wall. 387, 392; Swift v. Black Panther Oil & Gas Co., 244 Fed. 20, 29, 156 C. C. A. 448; and finding it to be so, to punish it by a compensatory imposition, Merrimack River Savings Bank v. Clay Center, \n219 \nU.S. 527, 535\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 295, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 513; or to remand it to the District Court to do so.\n What we are considering here is the rightful course of a court which having entered a final decree is proceeding \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 427]\n\u00a0\n upon the application of the successful party in the decree to put it into lawful execution. It is advised by this party that the quasi parties, the sureties who have made themselves directly liable upon summary process for prompt payment of the decree, have been enjoined from complying with their obligation to the court by a court of another jurisdiction, that the successful party has also been enjoined from seeking enforcement of the decree, and all this at the suit of the party condemned in the decree to pay and on the ground of fraud exercised upon the court itself in obtaining the decree. If the successful party, though thus enjoined, is willing to risk punishment for contempt by the enjoining court, and applies for enforcement of the decree, the court, whose decree it is, is clearly not ousted of jurisdiction to proceed to execute it. The proceeding in the enjoining court is solely in personam, and does not affect the power or functions of the court whose decree is in question. If advised that there is real ground for impeachment of its decree, it may in its discretion stay its hand until the issue is determined in another court of competent jurisdiction; but if, upon examination, it finds no such ground advanced, it may properly proceed to secure to the successful party the fruits of his litigation. If the defeated party in his suit in another jurisdiction only seeks to restrain the successful party from prosecuting his decree to payment, there should be unusual circumstances of disrepect to the court entering the decree to justify punishment for contempt. But when he unites in his new suit for an injunction the sureties who, as quasi parties, a e obliged to respond to the decree in the course of execution, he puts himself in contempt of the court whose decree it is, and may be punished for it. In the former case he is merely restraining a party who, without disobedience or disrespect to any obligation to the court making the decree, has full discretion and liberty to withhold his hand in pressing it to \n\n[261 U.S. 399, 428]\n\u00a0\n execution. In the latter case, he is obstructing the process of the court in a proceeding in which its action has been properly and lawfully invoked. The degree of punishment for contempt in such case is in the discretion of the court whose dignity has been offended and whose process has been obstructed. New Orleans v. New York Steamship Co., 20 Wall. 387. Certainly it was not an abuse of discretion in this case to impose as a penalty, compensation for the expenses incurred by the successful party to the decree in defending its rights in the Ohio court.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","191":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTULSIDAS v.

Supp. 1919,  4289 1\/4 a et seq.]), being merchants.1- \n\n[262 U.S. 258, 260]\n\u00a0\n Petitioners arrived at Manila, September 26, 1919, and were taken before a board of special inquiry formed by the insular collector of customs, constituted of three officers of the bureau of customs, duly designated and qualified to serve on such board at the port of Manila in accordance with law, to determine whether petitioners should be allowed to land, or should be deported.\n The right of petitioners to land was considered by the board separately and decided separately, but for convenience we have considered their applications and the proceedings thereon as joint, and therefore it is only necessary, in representation of the applications and the proceedings, to say that the board after consideration of the applications and the testimony given in support thereof, decided as to Tulsidas that it appeared that he had no business in India, and none in the Philippines, that his passport showed that he was only a salesman, and that it was clear that he was 'not a merchant within the meaning of the immigration law, and therefore not an exempt and entitled to land.' He was refused landing.\n The board also refused landing to Lekhraj and Sukhrani, deciding that they were salesmen-not industrial partners, as they claimed to be, of Wassiamall Assomall & Co., but salesmen in that store. The board further decided that they had no business of their own, and that industrial partners were not merchants within the meaning of the immigration law.\n From the decisions of the board, petitioners prosecuted appeals to the insular collector of customs and it appearing to him, as he said, that the decisions of the \n\n[262 U.S. 258, 261]\n\u00a0\n board, were 'reasonable and proper,' in that petitioners, being natives of India, failed to show that they belonged to any of the exempted classes under the provisions of section 3 of the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, he refused them landing and ordered that they be 'returned to their port of embarkation in accordance with law.'\n It will be observed, therefore, that the officers on whom was imposed the duty of administering the immigration law and passing upon the right of an alien applicant to admission into the United States decided that the petitioners were of the class excluded from admission, and refused them landing.\n In question of the legality of that ruling, proceedings were instituted in the court of first instance by a petition for habeas corpus. To the petition, the Attorney General of the islands, as representatives of the insular collector of customs, and in his official capacity, opposed the decision rendered by the board of special inquiry and the insular collector of customs, and denied the allegations of the petition, 'except as same may be admitted in, or appear to be true from, the proceedings of the immigration officials in the case.'\n The court of first instance reversed the rulings of the immigration officials and 'definitely ordered that the petitioners be placed at liberty.'\n The court assigned especially probative force to the partnership agreement introduced in the case, 'the genuineness of which' the court said was not questioned, according to which the court further said, 'the petitioners were admitted as industrial partners of said par nership, the first having a right to 15 per cent. of the profits, the second 10 per cent., and the third 5 per cent.' And the court was of the view that 'industrial partners' were as much merchants as 'capitalist partners.'\n The Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands to which the case was appealed, revoked the granting of the writ \n\n[262 U.S. 258, 262]\n\u00a0\n of habeas corpus, and ordered and decreed that the judgment of the department of customs ordering deportation of petitioners be affirmed.\n The court based its decision on two grounds: (1) Granting that appellees (petitioners) are merchants, they did not present as proof of the fact the certificate issued under section 6 of the Act of Congress of May 6, 1882, as amended by section 6 of the Act of July 5, 1884 (Comp. St .  4293), which, it is provided, shall be the sole evidence permissible to establish the exemption of an alien from the prohibition of the immigration law. (2) The court considered that independent of the requirement, appellees (petitioners) had failed to show that they were merchants in the country from which they had come, and that was necessary because the law did 'not contemplate that aliens who claim to belong to an exempted class, or aliens otherwise prohibited from entering the United States, shall be permitted to enter the territory of the United States to become merchants.' And the court construed the partnership agreement as creating a condition or status after landing in Manila,2 and concluded that:\n'There is absolutely nothing in the record which shows that the department \n\n[262 U.S. 258, 263]\n\u00a0\n of customs abused its powers, authority or discretion in the slightest degree.'\n\n The conclusion has pertinent signification, for counsel admit that 'under the express provisions of the statute (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  4289 1\/4 ii, the decision of a board of special inquiry, such as that now under consideration is final when affirmed on administrative appeal,' and only to be reviewed upon habeas corpus when the administrative officers have manifestly abused the power and discretion conferred upon them.\n It would seem, therefore, as if something more is necessary to justify review than the basis of a dispute. The law is in administration of a policy which, while it confers a privilege, is concerned to preserve it from abuse, and therefore has appointed officers to determine the conditions of it, and speedily determine them, and on practical considerations, not to subject them to litigious controversies, and disputable, if not finical, distinctions. Keeping in mind the admonition of this, we pass to the consideration of the rulings of the officials and the courts.\n In the ruling of the Supreme Court that a 'section 6 certificate,' as the court and counsel call it, is the prescribed evidence for admission under the immigration law, we do not concur, but in the ruling of the court that an applicant for admission as a merchant must be such at the time of his application we do concur. \n\n[262 U.S. 258, 264]\n\u00a0\n The law defines the classes of aliens which shall be excluded from admission to the United States, but provides that the exclusion shall not apply to persons having the 'status or occupations' of 'merchants.' This means, necessarily, having the 'status' at the time admission is sought, not a status to come, or to be established. If the latter, what indulgence of time is to be given for its attainment, and how is detriment to the policy of the law while the status is attaining to be prevented, and how terminate the indulgence and the detriment, and execute the law? There can be no answer to those questions consistent with the denial that the status of merchant must exist at the time of application for admission.\n The petitioners testified, and upon considering the testimony, we encounter some anomalies-anomalies that strain belief in its truth, certainly repel from acceptance-pretensions which are based upon the confusion of established distinctions between occupations. We have seen the assertion is that petitioners are industrial partners, and as such Lekhraj testified he was absent from Manila over 3 years, but was an industrial partner in the store of Wassiamall Assomall & Co., during that time-he 'only took a rest.' Sukhrani put his absence at 16 months. At the time of his testimony, he said he was 'a salesman,' but was to become manager.\n May we not wonder, in some disbelief, how a salesman or manager, whether his compensation be a salary or a percentage of profits, could have been indulged in absences of such duration?\n The confounding of occupations-that of salesman or manager with that of merchant-cannot be accepted. A merchant is the owner of the business; a salesman or manager, a servant of it; and especially so under the immigration law. The policy of the law must be kept in mind. It is careful to distinguish between the status of a merchant \n\n[262 U.S. 258, 265]\n\u00a0\n and those below that status. A merchant is fixed in it and made constant to it by his financial interest, a salesman or manager is but an employee, however else he may be denominated, and may withdraw from his employment at any moment of time and become a competitor in the ranks of labor, using the word in the sense the law implies. So particular is the law in regard to its distinctions and policy that if a merchant descends from his status he shall be 'deemed to be within the United States contrary to law and shall be subject to deportation.' And induced, no doubt, by such consideration as well as the distinction in occupations, the insular officials adjudged that petitioners were not merchants, so adjudged from their knowledge of the conditions obtaining in the Philippines, so adjudged from contact with petitioners, and in estimate of their pretensions. And, necessarily, we should not view the spoken word, nor even the partnership agreement produced in support of the spoken word separate from that contact and that estimate. And in accepting the adjudication, we do not share the alarm of counsel that it will result in admitting only petty tradesmen, in excluding 'the managing partners and directors of great mercantile enterprises.' We think, rather, it will leave the administration of the law, where the law intends it should be left, to the attention of officers made alert to attempts at evasion of it, and instructed by experience of the fabrications which will be made to accomplish evasion.\n Counsel themselves seem conscious of the exaggeration which made managers and industrial partners of petitioners in a great enterprise, made especially such of a boy 19 years of age. As to him (Tulsidas) counsel say, though asserting his right to admission, that 'there is substantial ground for a contention' that--\n'The writ [habeas corpus] should not issue because of the lack of sufficient affirmative evidence in the record in support \n\n[262 U.S. 258, 266]\n\u00a0\n of his claim that he is a merchant, and as such entitled to admission to American territory.'\n\n And further:\n'As a newcomer to the islands, something more than his own uncorroborated statements as to his status in the country from which he came may fairly and reasonably have been required of him.'\n\n We concur with counsel as to Tulsidas, and extend the requirement to the other petitioners, and hold that instead, as counsel urge, the insular officers should have sought confirmation or denial of petitioners' testimony, they, the petitioners, should have produced something more than their own statements of their status as merchants. It was for them to establish their exemption from the prohibition of the law; for them to satisfy the insular officials charged with the administration of the law. If they left their exemption in doubt and dispute, they cannot complain of a decision against it.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'That the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from admission into the United States: ...

BILOKUMSKY v. TOD(1923)\nNo. 92\nArgued: October 19, 1923Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 149, 150]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Walter Nelles, of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. George Ross Hull, of Washington, D. C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Bilokumsky is said to have entered the United States in 1912. In May, 1921, he was arrested in deportation proceedings upon a warrant of the Secretary of Labor as being an alien within the United States in violation of law. The specific ground was having in his possession for the purpose of distribution printed matter which advocated the overthrow of the government of the United States by force or violence. Act Oct. 16, 1918, c. 186,  1, 2, 40 Stat. 1012, as amended by Act June 5, 1920, c. 251, 41 Stat. 1008. After a hearing, granted to enable him to show cause why he should not be deported, a warrant of deportation issued. While in the custody of the \n\n[263 U.S. 149, 151]\n\u00a0\n Commissioner of Immigration at the Port of New York, he filed in the federal court his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. That court heard the case upon the return and a traverse thereto, dismissed the writ, remanded the relator to the custody of the Commissioner, allowed an appeal, and stayed deportation until further order. The case is here under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), the claim being that the relator was denied rights guaranteed by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the federal Constitution.\n Prior to the application for the warrant of arrest in the deportation proceedings, Bilokumsky was confined to Moyamensing Prison, Philadelphia, on charges made by city authorities that he had violated the state sedition law. While there he was sworn and interrogated by an immigration inspector, who took a stenographic report of the examination. In answer to questions so put, he admitted that he was an alien, but denied that he had done anything which rendered him liable to deportation. There is nothing in the examination which suggests that Bilokumsky made his statement because of threats or promises of favor, and there was no evidence that the statement was an involuntary one, unless compulsion is to be inferred from the fact that he was at the time in custody, that city and federal authorities were then co-operating 'with a view to ridding this country of undesirables,' that the prosecution under the state law was dropped soon after the institution of the deportation proceedings, that he was not then represented by counsel, and that he was not apprised by the inspector, either that he was entitled to be so represented or that he was not obliged to answer.\n At the hearing under the warrant of the Secretary of Labor all facts necessary to establish that Bilokumsky had in his possession for purpose of distribution printed matter which advocated the overthrow of the govern ment \n\n[263 U.S. 149, 152]\n\u00a0\n were proved by evidence to which there was no objection. To prove alienage the inspector called Bilokumsky as a witness. He was sworn, but, when questioned by the immigration inspector, under advice of counsel, stood mute, refusing even to state his name. After his refusal to answer, the report of his examination in Moyamensing Prison was introduced, although duly objected to by counsel. He did not testify on his own behalf; nor did he, or his counsel, make the claim, at the hearing, that he is a citizen of the United States. The rules then in force dealing with the conduct of such hearings are copied in the margin. \n1\n So far as appears these were fully complied with. It is conceded that, if the fact of alienage was legally established, there was both probable cause for issuing the original warrant of arrest and ample evidence at the hearing to justify a finding that relator was within the United States in violation of law. The contention is that there was no legal evidence of alienage.\n If, in the deportation proceedings, Bilokumsky had claimed that he was a citizen and had supported the claim by substantial evidence, he would have been entitled to have his status finally determined by a judicial, as distinguished from an executive, tribunal. Ng Fung Ho v. \n\n[263 U.S. 149, 153]\n\u00a0\n White, \n259 \nU.S. 276, 281\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 492. But he made no such claim at that time; nor does he now contend, by allegation in his petition for habeas corpus, or otherwise, that he is a citizen of the United States. He rests his claim to relief on an entirely different ground. He asserts that, because of the manner in which the evidence of alienage was procured, the warrant of deportation is a nullity. He argues that alienage is essential to jurisdiction; that the government has the burden of establishing the fact; that it can be established only by legal evidence; that his examination while in prison is the only evidence introduced for that purpose; that its procurement involved both an unlawful search and seizure and a violation of the rules of the Department; that since it was illegally procured it was not legal evidence; and, hence, that the order is void. Its nullity is urged on three grounds. Because the order is unsupported by legal evidence; because the hearing was unfair; and because the original warrant issued without probable cause.\n It is true that alienage is a jurisdictional fact; and that an order of deportation must be predicated upon a finding of that fact. United States v. Sing Tuck, \n194 \nU.S. 161, 167\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 621. It is true that the burden of proving alienage rests upon the government. For the statutory provision which puts upon the person arrested in deportation proceedings the burden of establishing his right to remain in this country applies only to persons of the Chinese race and in other cases. See Ng Fung Ho v. White, supra, \n259 U.S. 283\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 492. Compare Immigration Rules of May 1, 1917, rule 8. It is also true that, if the Department makes a finding of an essential fact which is unsupported by evidence, the court may intervene by the writ of habeas corpus. Zakonaite v. Wolf, \n226 \nU.S. 272, 274\n, 275 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 31. But it is not true that, if the report of Bilokumsky's examination be eliminated there was no evidence of alienage at the hearing. Conduct which forms a basis for inference is evidence. Silence \n\n[263 U.S. 149, 154]\n\u00a0\n is often evidence of the most persuasive character. Runkle v. Burnham, \n153 \nU.S. 216, 225\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 837; Kirby v. Tallmadge, \n160 \nU.S. 379, 383\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 349. Compare Quock Ting v. United States, \n140 \nU.S. 417, 420\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 733, 851. Bilokumsky was present at the hearing, personally and by counsel. The ground for deportation involved a charge of acts which might have been made the basis of a serious criminal prosecution. Criminal Code,  6 (Comp. St.  10, 170). If Bilokumsky was a citizen, inquiry into the facts was immaterial; and the whole proceeding must have fallen. He, presumably, knew whether or not he was a citizen. Since alienage is not an element of the crime of sedition, testifying concerning his status could not have had a tendency to incriminate him. There was strong reason why he should have asserted citizenship, if there was any basis in fact for such a contention. Under these circumstances his failure to claim that he was a citizen and his refusal to testify on this subject had a tendency to prove that he was an alien.\n Conduct is often capable of several interpretations; and caution should be exercised in drawing inferences from it. But there is no rule of law which prohibits officers charged with the administration of the immigration law from drawing an inference from the silence of one who is called upon to speak. Deportation proceedings are civil in their nature. Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 698, 730\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 1016; Bugajewitz v. Adams, \n228 \nU.S. 585, 591\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 607. Neither statute nor rule requires that matter alleged in the warrant of arrest shall, in the absence of an express admission, be taken to be denied. A person arrested on the preliminary warrant is not protected by a presumption of citizenship comparable to the presumption of innocence in a criminal case. There is no provision which forbids drawing an adverse inference from the fact of standing mute. It is not unreasonable to assume that one who may wish to challenge the executive's jurisdiction in the \n\n[263 U.S. 149, 155]\n\u00a0\n courts will not refrain from asserting in the proceedings before the executive the facts on which he relies. To defeat deportation it is not always enough for the person arrested to stand mute at the hearing and put the government upon its proof. Compare United States v. Sing Tuck, \n194 \nU.S. 161, 169\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 621. Since the proceeding was not a criminal one, Bilokumsky might have been compelled by legal process to testify whether or not he was an alien. \n2\n The government was not obliged to adopt that course.\n The introduction of Bilokumsky's examination as evidence did not render the hearing unfair. The specific grounds urged for holding it so are that the evidence was obtained by an illegal search and seizure and in violation of the rules of the Department. Both contentions are unfounded. It may be assumed that evidence obtained by the Department through an illegal search and seizure cannot be made the basis of a finding in deportation proceedings. Compare Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, \n251 U.S. 385\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 182; Gouled v. United States, \n255 U.S. 298\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 261. But mere interrogation under oath by a government official of one lawfully in confinement is not a search and seizure. It may be assumed that one under investigation with a view to deportation is legally entitled to insist upon the observance of rules promulgated by the Secretary pursuant to law. \n3\n But no rule is shown which prohibits interrogation without apprising the person under investigation that he is entitled to refuse to answer \n\n[263 U.S. 149, 156]\n\u00a0\n and to have counsel. The examination here complained of was conducted before there was an application for the warrant of arrest. There is neither in rule 22, subdivision 3, which relates to the application for a warrant,4 nor elsewhere in the rules, any provision which deals with interrogation prior to the hearing. Rule 22, subdivision 5 (a) and (b), apply only to the proceedings after an arrest has been made. The careful provision which the rules make to ensure to the person arrested the benefit of counsel and access to the government's evidence at the hearing leads to the conclusion that the omission of any similar provision governing earlier stages in the proceeding was intentional. In the absence of a rule forbidding interrogation, or requiring the presence of counsel, mere examination in his absence does not render the hearing unfair. Low Wah Suey v. Backus, \n225 \nU.S. 460, 470\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 734\n\n\n It is urged that the admission of Bilokumsky's examination renders the hearing unfair because it is inconsistent with fundamental principles of justice embraced within the conception of due process of law. The argument is that if a judgment of deportation is to rest upon admissions attributable to the person to be deported, the admissions must have been made by him as a free agent and under circumstances which raise no doubt whether they were in fact made. Deportation is a process of such serious moment that on all controverted matters the executive officers should consider the evidence with close scrutiny. But here there was no denial of alienage; and a landing certificate was introduced by the government which, when connected with the statement in Bilokum sky's \n\n[263 U.S. 149, 157]\n\u00a0\n examination, tended in some respects to corroborate it. Moreover, the statement that one is an alien is not the confession of a crime. Except in case of Chinese, or other Asiatics, alienage is a condition, not a cause, of deportation. So far as appears, there was nothing in the circumstances under which Bilokumsky was examined which would have rendered his answer inadmissible even in a criminal case. The mere fact that it was given while he was in confinement would not make it so.5 And since deportation proceedings are in their nature civil, the rule excluding involuntary confessions could have no application. Newhall v. Jenkins, 2 Gray (Mass.) 562. Moreover, a hearing granted does not cease to be fair, merely because rules of evidence and of procedure applicable in judicial proceedings have not been strictly followed by the executive; or because some evidence has been improperly rejected or received. \n6\n Tang Tun v. Edsell, \n223 \nU.S. 673, 681\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 359. To render a hearing unfair the defect, or the practice complained of, must have been such as might have led to a denial of justice, or there must have been absent one of the elements deemed essential to due process. Chin Yow v. United States, \n208 U.S. 8\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 201. Kwock Jan Fat v. White, \n253 \nU.S. 454, 459\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 566. Compare Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 185. \n\n[263 U.S. 149, 158]\n\u00a0\n What has been said disposes also of the broader contention that the whole deportation proceeding was void ab initio, because without the report of Bilokumsky's examination there was lacking probable cause for issuance of the warrant of arrest. Irregularities on the part of the government official prior to, or in connection with, the arrest would not necessarily invalidate later proceedings in all respects conformable to law. 'A writ of habeas corpus is not like an action to recover damages for an unlawful arrest or commitment, but its object is to ascertain whether the prisoner can lawfully be detained in custody; and if sufficient ground for his detention by the government is shown, he is not to be discharged for defects in the original arrest or commitment.'

N. Whitehouse, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n\n[261 U.S. 106, 109]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover fifty-two thousand dollars, being one per centum of the value of gold carried from Constantinople to New York upon the steamship Laub, a destroyer in the Navy, of which the plaintiff, the defendant in error, was commanding officer at the time. There was a trial in the District Court in which, after the evidence was in, both sides moved for the direction of a verdict and the Court directed a verdict for the defendant. The judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 279 Fed. 244, and the facts not being in dispute, judgment was ordered for the plaintiff on motion of the defendant in order to secure an earlier review here.\n By Rev. Sts.  1624 (Comp. St.  2961 et seq.), establishing Articles for the Government of the Navy, in article 8, subd. 13 (Comp. St.  2969), the receiving on board of gold, silver, or jewels, and the demand of compensation for carrying them are excepted from the general prohibition there contained. Article 1510 of the Navy Regulations (1913) provides that when gold, etc., shall be placed on board any ship for freight or safe keeping the commanding offic r shall sign bills of lading for the amount and be responsible for the same; that the usual percentage shall be demanded from the shippers, one-fourth of which goes to the commander in chief if he signifies to the commander of the ship in writing that he unites with the latter in the responsibility for the care of the treasure. In that case the commander of the ship gets one-half, otherwise two-thirds. By Rev. Sts.  1547 (Comp. St.  2805), the Regulations adopted with the approval of the President, as the foregoing was, shall be recognized as the Regulations of the Navy, 'subject to alterations adopted in the same manner.' The plaintiff founds his claim upon these laws and rules. Naturally, therefore, he does not question the defendant's right to bring the case to this Court. Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231 (Judicial \n\n[261 U.S. 106, 110]\n\u00a0\n Code)  241, 128 (Comp. St.  1218, 1120); Spiller v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., \n253 \nU.S. 117, 121\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 466; Howard v. United States, \n184 \nU.S. 676, 681\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 543.\n The defendant, although in form a trading corporation organized under the laws of Delaware, was formed in pursuance of an Executive Order dated August 14, 1917, as an agency to enable the United States Food Administration to buy, store and sell wheat, among other things. The stock, except the shares necessary to qualify seven directors, was all subscribed for and owned by the United States. Even the directors' shares were held by the United States, endorsed in blank. The stock ultimately was $500,000, 000. By an Executive Order of June 21, 1918, the defendant was designated an agency of the United States under the control of the United States Food Administrator, Mr. Hoover, to buy, hold and sell wheat. These orders were issued under the war powers conferred upon the President by the Act of August 10, 1917, c. 53, 40 Stat. 276 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8e-3115 1\/8r). A later Act of February 25, 1919, c. 38, 40 Stat. 1161 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  7706a), made a large appropriation to furnish foodstuffs for the relief of populations outside of Germany, German-Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey, etc. This was carried out by an Executive Order of March 1, to the effect that the furnishing should be conducted under the direction of Mr. Hoover, who was authorized to establish the American Relief Administration to that end, and particularly to employ the Food Administration Grain Corporation as an agency for transporting and distributing foodstuffs and supplies to the populations requiring relief. Finally, an Act of March 4, 1919, c. 125, 40 Stat. 1348 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8kk\n\n[261 U.S. 106, 1]\n\u00a0\n-3115 1\/8kk\n\n[261 U.S. 106, 7]\n\u00a0\n), to protect the United States against undue enhancement of its liabilities under its guaranties of the prices of wheat, etc., authorized the President to make necessary orders and to utilize any department or agency of the Government including the Food Administration Grain Corporation. Pursuing this Act, on May 14, 1919, \n\n[261 U.S. 106, 111]\n\u00a0\n the President authorized the defendant to buy and sell wheat of the crops of 1918 and 1919, and reciting that the defendant was formed as an agency of the United States and that its functions would be substantially complete on June 30, 1919, ordered it to close its books and make a complete report as of that date, change its name to that which it now bears, and to perform such duties thereafter as the President might direct.\n We mention these details to show that the defendant although in form a private corporation and liable to be sued as such, was organized and owned by the United States as an agency for public service, was not engaged in ordinary merchandising, but under Mr. Hoover's directions was performing public functions arising out of the war and its sequels. The Western Maid, \n257 \nU.S. 419, 432\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 159. This being its relation to the Government it made a contract with Bulgaria for the sale of wheat under which Bul aria forwarded the gold in question by a naval vessel of the United States to Constantinople for the defendant. On August 8, 1919, Admiral Knapp, the ranking naval officer of the United States in South European waters, cabled to the Secretary of the Navy that the Relief Administration desired to ship about five millions gold to the United States, and was willing to release the captain from all responsibility except that usually incumbent for care of public property. He asked if the Department would suspend the mandatory provisions of Article 1510 Navy Regulations including percentage charge, and direct that shipment be received for transportation as desired. On August 16 the Secretary answered that the Department suspends the above mentioned provisions with release for commanding officer and the United States, as offered. On September 10, 1919, the plaintiff was ordered by Captain Greenslade, his senior in rank, to take the gold in question on board from the United States Ship Galveston where it then was, and to transport it to New York. At the \n\n[261 U.S. 106, 112]\n\u00a0\n same time he was informed of the Secretary's cable. On the 15th the plaintiff took the gold on board the Laub. On the same day, Major Galbraith purporting to act under authority of Mr. Hoover offered the plaintiff a release in the above terms with a copy of the Secretary's cable. The plaintiff handed back a written reply addressed to Major Galbraith, 'Officer in Charge, U. S. Food Administration, Constantinople,' saying that he could not accept the release and that he took full responsibility for the gold. On the same day the plaintiff received from Admiral Bristol, in command in Turkish waters, an order purporting to direct the plaintiff to proceed to New York and to authorize him to receive the gold, stated to be the 'property of the United States Food Administration (Grain Corporation).' The order added that in accordance with Article 1510, Navy Regulations, the Admiral assumed joint responsibility with the Commanding Officer, but called attention to the cable from the Secretary which was attached.\n On the facts thus abridged the plaintiff argues that it is entitled to judgment as matter of law. Some preliminary objections may be dispatched in few words. It is said that the Secretary's order did not apply to this gold, because the request to him spoke of the Relief Association as wishing to ship; that the Relief Association had no power to sell to Bulgaria, that country being excepted in the Act of February 25, 1919, which we have mentioned; that the release by Mr. Hoover, United States Food Administrator, was inadequate, and that the authority of Major Galbraith did not appear. We agree with the District Judge that the authority of Major Galbraith was fully established. Whether the sale to Bulgaria was ultra vires or not the gold belonged to the defendant as fully as any other money received by it, and the relations between the defendant and the Relief Association were such that it did not matter whether the one or the other \n\n[261 U.S. 106, 113]\n\u00a0\n was named to the Secretary of the Navy. But these questions are immaterial in our view and we deem it apparent that the plaintiff's refusal had no reference to any of them, but was intended and purported politely to repudiate the Secretary's authority no matter how accurately given. We gather that the Admiral and the Captain meant to try a fall with the Secretary, on the supposed authority of the law.\n The plaintiff's position at the time probably was the same that he takes now and that prevailed with the Circuit Court of Appeals. He took the order of the Secretary according to its face as an attempt to suspend the Regulation and thought that it was invalid without the actual approval of the President. It is suggested also that it was an unauthorized diminution of the plaintiff's compensation as established by the law. United States v. Symonds, \n120 U.S. 46\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 411. But in our opinion the view taken by the District Judge was more accurate. The plaintiff did not stand as a private person making a private contract with a business corporation. He was an officer of the United States charged with duties as such. In substance the gold was the property of the United States. It is true that the legal title was in the Corporation, that the property of the Corporation might have been taken to pay a judgment against it, and that in other ways the difference of personality would be recognized. Sloan Shipyards Corporation v. United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation (May 1, 1922) \n258 U.S. 549\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 386. But for purposes like the present imponderables have weight. When as here the question is whether the property was clothed with such a public interest that the transportation of it no more could be charged for by a public officer than the carrying of a gun, we must look not at the legal title only but at the facts beneath forms. The facts we have indicated in stating the case. The very existence of the \n\n[261 U.S. 106, 114]\n\u00a0\n Corporation was created to carry on activities required by the war. Its property was held for that and no other end. It was admitted at the argument, and of course could not be denied, that if the United States had been the legal owner of the gold the plaintiff would have been acting only in the course of his duty in carrying it. We are of opinion that the same thing is true here. The order of the Secretary embodied no suspension of the Regulation but only a recognition of the fact that this was not a service for which the plaintiff was entitled to charge. His acceptance of the characterization of his act by the cable that he answered did not change the legal effect. It simply accepted a wrong reason for a right result.\n Judgment reversed.\n Judgment of the District Court affirmed. \n\n\n\n","194":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S SHIPPING BOARD EMERGENCY FLEET CORPORATION v.

C., for petitioner and plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Samuel Scoville, Jr., of Philadelphia, Pa., for defendant in error and respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Claiming to have been injured (October, 1918) while employed by the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation as a motor truck driver, defendant in error Sullivan presented a claim for compensation to the Workmen's Compensation Bureau, Pennsylvania \n\n[261 U.S. 146, 147]\n\u00a0\n Department of Labor and Industry. The corporation answered; denied that the injury was of a permanent nature, and asserted that it was not liable for the further reason 'that claimant was a direct employee of the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, and accordingly is a civil employee of the United States of America, and will be compensated for injury under the federal Workmen's Compensation Act, subject to sustaining proof of disability.'\n The referee found that, while employed by the Fleet Corporation as a chauffeur, Sullivan suffered injuries from a collision in Philadelphia; that neither party had served notice rejecting article 3 of the Compensation Act (Pa. St. 1920,  21924-21927); and awarded compensation.\n The Bureau heard the matter de novo, and affirmed the referee's findings of fact and conclusions of law and dismissed the appeal. It said:\n'In the case at bar there is no evidence that claimant was a civil employee of the United States or that he received his wages through the United States Treasury. We cannot infer that such was the case . ... While it might be difficult to draw the exact line of demarcation as to when the defendant is acting as a private corporation or is acting for the United States, the burden would be on the defendant to prove if it were acting for the United States that it would be exempt-there is no defense of this kind interposed in this case. We only have the question of law raised by defendant that the Pennsylvania workmen's compensation board has no jurisdiction. We cannot agree with this. In conclusion we hold: That we have jurisdiction, on the ground that the defendant doing business as a corporation in the state of Pennsylvania, an employer of labor in the state of Pennsylvania, is liable for compensation to the claimant in this case under our act. It is neither our duty nor privilege \n\n[261 U.S. 146, 148]\n\u00a0\n to make a collateral investigation as to the ownership of the defendant's capital stock.'\n\n Successive appeals, limited by statute to matters of law, were dismissed by the court of common pleas and the Superior Court of Pennsylvania. Sullivan v. United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, 76 Pa. Super. Ct. 30. The latter court-the highest where decision in the proceeding could be had-said--\n'In the present case, the workmen's compensation board and the court are bound to take judicial notice of acts of Congress and executive orders and regulations authorized by acts of Congress which have the force of statutes (Caha v. United States, \n152 U.S. 211\n), as well as general acts of assembly affecting the defendant. Anything else must be averred and proved as by any other litigant. ...\n\n'On its face we have here a claim for workmen's compensation presented against a corporation of the District of Columbia, doing business in this state, engaged in performing certain important matters committed to it by the Shipping Board relative to the purchase, construction, equipment, etc., of merchant vessels in the commerce of the United States, and answer made that it is not liable because the injured man was a civil employee of the United States. No evidence was presented to support this answer. ... As the case was presented before the referee and the board, we are satisfied that the award was fully justified, and it is accordingly confirmed and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.'\n\n The writ of error (No. 124) must be dismissed. The record fails affirmatively to disclose that there was drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under, the United States, or the validity of a statute of or an authority exercised under any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States within the requirements of section 237 of the Judicial Code, as amended \n\n[261 U.S. 146, 149]\n\u00a0\n by the Act of September 6, 1916 (Comp. St.  1214).1 Considering the whole record, it is clear that there was no controversy over the validity of any treaty, statute, or authority, federal or state. Plaintiff in error by its answer claimed a right or immunity under the Constitution and laws of the United States.

Thomas W. Miller, as Alien Property Custodian, \n262 U.S. 51\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 486, 67 L. Ed. --, just decided. It is a petition for leave to intervene in the latter suit instituted (as we have seen) by Francis P. Garvan, then Alien Property Custodian, Miller subsequently succeeding him. That suit is here on appeal from the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, this suit is here on appeal from the District Court of the United States for the District of New Jersey, a constitutional question being, it is contended, involved. 'The District Court,' the assertion is, 'months after peace had been declared, denied Wesche's petition to intervene, \n\n[262 U.S. 58, 59]\n\u00a0\n and awarded conveyance and delivery of what was admittedly his separate property, to the Custodian.'\n In support of these contentions and their pertinency and control, counsel's comment is that the Custodian made two demands for the property, but--\n'that these demands were both made while the act forbade recourse by any claimant to any Court to review any seizure thereunder by the Custodian, save the United States District Court for the district in which the claimant resided. The amendment permitting suit in the Supreme Court for the District of Columbia was added nly by the Act of July 11, 1919 (41 Stat. 35). And Wesche, a neutral, separate owner of part of the property, and custodian of it all, resided in Switzerland, and Ahrenfeldt, an American citizen, separate owner of part of the property, was residing throughout the war in England, France or Switzerland.'\n\n And the further argument is that 'seizure under such circumstances was undonstitutional' and that 'mere demands' by the Custodian 'did not constitute constructive capture, and even constructive capture was not completed before peace cane.'\n This statement is enough preliminarily to the understanding and appreciation of Wesche's fundamental contentions which are that the conditions of the act were not complied with before suit and suit, therefore, was not justified. And the unconstitutionality of the act as applied to his case is also urged, and that the defenses were available to him in the suit. The court therefore, is the contention, in denying his petition to intervene, committed error.\n The case, it will be observed, is identical in legal aspects with Commercial Trust Co. of New Jersey v. Miller, Alien Property Custodian, \n262 U.S. 51\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 486, 67 L. Ed. --. Here as there, Wesche's interest is asserted in the property, here by himself, there by the Trust Company. Here, as there, the conditions of suit were asserted not to have been performed; here, perhaps with more emphasis, as there, the \n\n[262 U.S. 58, 60]\n\u00a0\n unconstitutionality of the act is argued; here, as there, it is urged that these contentions constituted defenses that could be made in the suit, and that relief was not only through the 'filing of a claim and instituting proceedings as provided by section 9 of the Trading with the Enemy Act' ( Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/2 e).\n We repeat, therefore The cases are identical, and upon the authority of that case, the order of the District Court denying Wesche's petition for intervention is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","196":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. ALLEN(1923)\nNo. 232\nArgued: March 1, 1923Decided: March 12, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Seymour, for the United States.\n Mr. George A. King, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Action for $600, based on the claim of Allen, who was a yeoman in the Coast Guard, for pay at the rate fixed by law for a chief yeoman in the Navy from April 6, 1917, \n\n[261 U.S. 317, 318]\n\u00a0\n to May 28, 1919, under the following provisions of the Act of May 22, 1917 ( 40 Stat. 84):\n'An act to temporarily increase the commissioned and warrant and enlisted strength of the Navy and Marine Corps, and for other purposes.'\n\n Section 15: '... That during the continuance of the present war, warrant officers, petty officers and enlisted men of the United States Coast Guard shall receive the same rates of pay as are or may hereafter be prescribed for corresponding grades or ratings and length of service in the Navy.' Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  2856a.\n Section 13: 'Nothing contained in this act shall operate to reduce the rank, pay or allowances that would have been received by any person in the Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard except for the passage of this act.' Section 2483n.\n Judgment was rendered for $486.32, to review which this appeal is prosecuted.\n The question presented is not the absolute rank of Allen, but the correspondence of his duties and his emolument to those of chief yeoman in the Navy.\n The Commandant of the Coast Guard submitted, June 5, 1917, to the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation of the Navy Department a tabular statement showing the several grades or ratings in the Navy to which the Coast Guard grades or ratings corresponded. This tabular statement was arranged on the basis of the duties and responsibilities of the several ratings.\n In this table a ship's writer was put down as corresponding to a yeoman, first class, in the Navy, and a yeoman in the Coast Guard to a chief yeoman in the Navy. October 10, 1917, the Secretary of the Navy issued a general order giving the corresponding grades in which both ship's writers and yeomen in the Coast Guard were tabulated as corresponding to yeoman, first-class, in the Navy, instead of chief yeoman in the Navy. The tabulated statement by the Commandant of the Coast Guard was in many other respects changed by the Navy Department. \n\n[261 U.S. 317, 319]\n\u00a0\n The action of the Navy Department was carried out by a circular letter from the Coast Guard headquarters, and, according to it, pay of all petty officers and nearly all enlisted men in the Coast Guard was higher than the pay in the Navy, thus giving to such officers no benefit of section 15 of the Act of May 22, 1917\n\n\n Allen, during the time covered by his claim, was paid as a yeoman in the Coast Guard, $1,783.80; as chief yeoman in the Navy, he would have received $2,270.12, a difference of $486.32.\n The finding of the court was that he was entitled to recover the sum of $486.32 more than that which he did receive, and it awarded him judgment for that amount, rejecting the contention of the government that:\n'The fact that Congress did not expressly provide what grades and ratings of the Coast Guard should be considered 'corresponding' to the grades and ratings in the Navy left that fact to be determined by the Secretary of the Navy.'\n\n The finding and judgment of the court are in accordance with a table of grades and ratings submitted by the Commandant of the Coast Guard, pursuant to section 15 of the Act of May 22, 1917, above referred to. To this table of ratings, and the action of the Commandant, the United States opposes the order of the Secretary of the Navy, No. 329, and maintains that it was the duty of the latter, under the Act of May 22, 1917, in order to standardize the pay of the Coast Guard and Navy, to determine what were the corresponding grades or ratings. 'That preliminary question was required to be settled before any pay could be fixed or allowed.' And further:\n'The Secretary of the Navy, acting in his administrative capacity, and within his discretionary powers, promulgated a table of grades and ratings under which the claimant (Allen) was paid.'\n\n To these contentions the court gave attentive and elaborate consideration, and determined that they were contrary \n\n[261 U.S. 317, 320]\n\u00a0\n to the purpose of the Act of May 22, 1917, fixing the pay of petty officers and enlisted men during the continuance of the war with Germany so that they should receive the same pay prescribed for corresponding grades and ratings in the Navy. It held that the test of correspondence or equality was the duties and responsibilities of yeomen in the Coast Guard and yeomen in the Navy. In other words, it was the judgment of the court, that as the duties and qualifications of the officers were of duties is a question of fact, not a matter of deference to the judgment of of duties is a question of fact, the Secretary of the Navy.\n The court said:\n'The statute [Act of May 22, 1917] was passed by Congress for the purpose of equalizing as far as possible the pay of officers of the Coast Guard with that of officers of the Navy. The act attempted to assimilate the pay, and the court in construing the act will, so far as conditions admit, put such a construction upon it as will carry out the intent of Congress. In the case at bar a Coast Guard officer renders similar service to that rendered by a naval officer, has the same duties to perform, and possesses the same qualifications; the pay of the Coast Guard officer can be assimilated to the pay of the officer of the Navy, and therefore we think that the plaintiff is entitled to receive the pay prescribed for chief yeoman in the Navy.'\n\n The conclusion was that the purpose of the act was 'to establish uniformity in the pay of like officers in the Coast Guard and Navy,' and that it could not be defeated by an administrative order of the Secretary of the Navy. Hence, the further conclusion was that Allen was entitled to recover the sum of $486.32, and it was so ordered.\n We concur, and affirm the judgment.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","197":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Debevoise, of New York City, for appellees.\n\n\n[262 U.S. 371, 379]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By an original bill filed June 30, 1920, the United States charged that appellees-defendants below-were parties \n\n[262 U.S. 371, 380]\n\u00a0\n to a combination in restraint of interstate trade and commerce forbidden by the Sherman Act, and asked that they be enjoined from continuing therein. The court below held the combination lawful and dismissed the bill. 275 Fed. 939.\n The defendants are 12 corporations, commonly referred to as 'crushers,' with principal places of business in six different states, which manufacture, sell, and distribute linseed oil, cake, and meal, and Julian Armstrong, who operates at Chicago under the name 'Armstrong Bureau of Related Industries.' This bureau conducts a so-called 'exchange,' through which one subscribing manufacturer may obtain detailed information concerning the affairs of others doing like business. The defendant 'crushers' constitute one of the groups who contract for this service. They manufacture and distribute throughout the Union a very large part of the linseed products consumed therein, and prior to the challenged combination were active, unrestrained competitors. Some time in September or October, 1918, each of them entered into an identical written 'subscription agreement' with the Armstrong bureau, and a year thereafter signed another, not essentially different. The latter is summarized and quoted from below.\n After stating that 'the matter contained herein is for the exclusive and confidential use of the subscriber,' the agreement recites that it and other 'crushers' of flaxseed desire promptly and economically to secure from and through the bureau the following things, 'which will promote better and more safe, sane, and stable conditions in the linseed oil, cake, and meal industry and increase its service to the commonwealth': Comprehensive data as to market, trade, and manufacturing conditions in the linseed oil industry; economies in manufacture and sale, by frank exchange of accurate information; the latest authentic information concerning the credit of buyers; a \n\n[262 U.S. 371, 381]\n\u00a0\n broader market for cake and meal; establishment of uniform cost accounting systems; fair and just freight tariffs and classifications; definite standardization of the products of the industry; economies in the development of foreign markets and increase of sales therein; stabilization of the flaxseed market so far as lawful; shipment of cake and meal to the consumer from the nearest point of production.\n The contracting 'crusher' agrees:\n To subscribe for the bureau's service for 12 months, and thereafter from year to year, subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 days' notice, and pay therefor a sum reckoned upon the amount of flaxseed milled by it, but not less than $1,100 annually.\n That all information reported or received shall be purely statistical and relevant to past operations, and no part of the bureau's machinery will be used to fix prices, divide territory, limit sales, production, or manufacture, or control competition.\n That it will 'promptly make, have made, forward, and have sent in and to said bureau, as and in the form required y this agreement, full, accurate, complete, signed, and certified reports of all said sales, quotations, and offerings or other information required by the bureau, and full, correct replies or answers to any and all inquires concerning the same or seeking any information in regard thereto.'\n That upon request it will 'at once turn and have turned over to the bureau's auditor for examination all vouchers, books of account, correspondence, and such other evidence or documents as he may request, or, in lieu of the same, or any part thereof, such abstracts therefrom as he may designate, verified under oath and certified by a certified public accountant in good standing.'\n That, 'if any subscriber considers that it has good cause to question the report made by any other subscriber, then \n\n[262 U.S. 371, 382]\n\u00a0\n it may request an investigation or audit to be made by the bureau, and, if considered proper by the bureau, it will be so made,' the incident expense to be paid by the party found in error.\n That it will deposit with the bureau not less than $1,000 nor more than $10,000 of Liberty Bonds, according to its milling capacity.\n That, 'should the undersigned subscriber fail, in any manner whatsoever, to comply with any of the terms of this agreement, or with any and all reasonable requirements of said bureau, then it shall and does hereby forfeit to said bureau, at its election, all money paid for services and all further benefits and rights under this agreement, which forfeiture, for just cause, may be declared by said bureau, evidenced by written notice thereof mailed to said offender by United States registered mail, and such subscriber shall thereby forfeit all further right, title, or interest in and to said bonds [so on deposit] in whole or in part,' subject to the right of appeal to a council, of three subscribers, which shall have power to review the entire matter, reinstate the offender, or take such other final action as seems proper. No fine shall exceed the deposit with the bureau.\n That it will (a) 'immediately, and when and as hereafter issued, deposit with the bureau all public price lists of the undersigned covering raw and boiled linseed oil, cake, and meal; (b) also to report to the bureau by prepaid telegraph, and further confirm by mail, duplicate of all quotations made at variance with above price lists, giving better terms to the contemplated purchaser than those quoted; (c) with all reports made in compliance with the above paragraph 'b' of quotations which amount to one carload or more of oil, cake, or meal there shall also be reported at the same time and in the same manner the prospective buyer's name, address, and f. o. b. point of shipment; (d) in so far as the above reports 'a,' \n\n[262 U.S. 371, 383]\n\u00a0\n 'b,' and 'c' do not disclose the following, the undersigned 'subscriber' agrees to give the following information in connection therewith, that is: The exact prices, terms, and discounts, and whether made to the jobber, dealer, or consumer, and in what quantities, carload or less than carload, and warehouse or mill prices; (e) also to promptly report all changes in and alterations or withdrawals of the above, of every kind whatsoever, that may be made; (f) also to promptly report by prepaid telegraph, and further confirm by mail, all orders received by the undersigned subscriber in response to special quotations made as above provided in paragraph 'c,' designating the quotation which is the basis of such order and any variance therefrom.'\n That 'directly at the close of each day's business each subscriber shall mail by special delivery to the bureau a complete report of all its carload sales for that day of oil, cake, or meal, not covered by its previous daily sales reports, which report shall disclose the quantity and kind, price, and terms, and whether for immediate or future delivery, and, if no sale has been so made, this fact shall be likewise reported.'\n That for the purpose of compiling a weekly sales report 'a map of the United States shall be divided int zones as agreed upon by all of the subscribers to this service, and each subscriber at the conclusion of the week shall send to the bureau by special delivery, not later than the following Monday night, a compiled report of all its sales of oil, cake, or meal into each zone made during the period covered by such report, and not previously so reported, specifically setting forth the following: (a-a) Total gallons of oil sold into each zone, also showing the total gallons and price per gallon received for such oil sold; (b-b) total tonnage of cake and meal sold into each zone, also showing total weight and price received per ton for such cake or meal sold; (c-c) sales reports on both \n\n[262 U.S. 371, 384]\n\u00a0\n oil, cake, and meal shall differentiate spot and future delivery, giving period of such futures.'\n That before the 10th day of each calendar month it will report to the bureau the number of gallons of oil and the total tons of meal or cake on hand not covered by sale or contract.\n That all information received from the bureau or any meeting of subscribers will be treated as confidential.\n The bureau undertakes, 'with the help of each and every subscriber':\n That it will use its best efforts to organize the linseed oil, cake, and meal industry of the United States.\n That it will afford its full statistical service for the exchange of information concerning quotations, sales, shipments, production, and terms; also the service of its credit reporting department, will suggest from time to time the means for broader service; and will supply additional service whenever required, the rate to be agreed upon.\n That the statistical service furnished shall be accomplished and provided by the use of special report forms conveying information on past transactions which may be modified, changed, and others provided, as experience suggests or as called for by the subscribers in any of their meetings and approved by the bureau.\n That the market information received by the bureau will be cleared and relayed promptly to subscribers in good standing.\n That it will send to subscribers, in the form of market letters 'news clippings' of interest to the industry and in accordance with the object and terms of the agreement.\n It is agreed by all:\n That 'monthly meetings will be held of all subscribers hereto at some convenient center,' with a representative of the bureau, as secretary, who shall present the matters pertaining to the industry, to be therein openly discussed. Subscribers may send in notice of matters and \n\n[262 U.S. 371, 385]\n\u00a0\n topics for discussion, and if they accord with the agreement and object of the service the bureau shall cause the same to be docketed and presented. 'All subscribers shall report at these meetings on all matters and conditions within their knowledge affecting the industry and within the limits of this agreement, that they may be there discussed for mutual benefit.' 'Any subscriber failing to attend in person or by said representative at each of these meetings, and be in punctual and continued attendance thereon, shall be subject to a fine of $25 for each offense, the same to be collected by and payable to the bureau. This fine may be remitted by a majority vote of the members present at the meeting where it is incurred.'\n That 'any subscriber who has made offerings or quotations to a prospective buyer, and is advised by such buyer that it is not to be awarded such business, shall have the right to immediately advise the bureau of such unsuccessful offering or quotation, giving all details of such bid or offering, and may then request the bureau to bulletin all of its subscribers asking specific information regarding any quotation or sale to such prospective buyer by any of the other subscribers, and the bureau, on receipt of such request, will immediately bulletin all subscribers asking therefor, and on receipt of replies will send out a compilation report thereof to all subscribers, together with the details of sale, if such a sale has been reported, so that a l subscribers, including the original inquirer, will have a complete report of this transaction. On receipt of a request for such specific information from the bureau, the undersigned subscribers will immediately reply to same, giving full information as to any quotation or sale which it may have made to such a buyer, and, if it has made none, so report.\n That each subscriber will furnish the bureau, upon request, information pertaining to any buyer of linseed \n\n[262 U.S. 371, 386]\n\u00a0\n oil, cake, and meal, and may request the bureau to secure like information from all other subscribers, whenever it shall have an order, or an account with, or an inquiry from, the buyer, and this information will be promptly relayed to all interested subscribers.\n When an adequate number of subscriptions had been obtained (September, 1918), the organization began vigorously to function according to letter and spirit of the agreement. It will suffice to state a few of the steps taken:\n The United States were divided into eight zones for price quoting, and it was stipulated that each member should quote a basic price for zone No. 1, and should add thereto 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 11 cents, respectively, for the others. At subscribers' meetings regularly held 'matters pertaining to the industry' were discussed; members were 'put on the carpet' and subjected to searching inquiry concerning their transactions. A meeting held October 29, 1919, adopted the following rule:\n'In order to provide that the daily market information as relayed by the bureau shall at all times contain the fullest measure of news value, it is agreed that hereafter no council member shall dispatch changes in his prices as last filed with the bureau to more than one buyer, without instantly thereafter telegraphing such full and complete information to the bureau as, and in the form, required by the service contract.'\n\n Another meeting--\n'resolved that it now be recorded that the recommended terms of this council for the sale of oil be 1 per cent. discount for cash settlement in 10 days, or 30 days net trade acceptance, from date of shipment, and in order that a specific list of the terms of sale of all the council members may now be compiled and distributed, it is further resolved that all council members shall send to the bureau, not later than January 27th, a full explanation of the terms of sale as quoted by them to their trade.' \n\n[262 U.S. 371, 387]\n\u00a0\n The bureau displayed great industry in making inquiries, collecting information, investigating the smallest derelictions, and giving immediate advice to subscribers. Hundreds of so-called 'market letters,' relating to divers transactions, were sent to subscribers. A sale of two barrels of oil below schedule was deemed worthy of special attention. Also from time to time it gave counsel concerning 'unfair merchandising' and the necessity for establishing sound policy by constructive co-operation. The following letters-224 and 245-dated February 5 and 12, 1919, are characteristic:\n\n Will all council members please reply promptly and fully through the bureau whether or not they made the sale in question to the following?\n New York, N. Y., Feb. 3, 1919\n\n\n Armstrong Bureau of Related Industries, Chicago.\n Gentlemen: Our Chicago manager advises us that under date of February 1st the Enterprise Paint Mfg. Co. informed him that they had bought 10 barrels linseed oil at less than $1.46 from another crusher in the Chicago territory. Will you kindly bulletin the subscribers with a view to finding out if any of the crushers sold this lot under their published price?\n Yours very truly,\n American Linseed Company.\n In the file of replies to-day completed, 11 subscribers state, in effect, that they have neither quoted nor sold the Enterprise Paint Mfg. Co. The sale was apparently made by subscriber No. 6, whose letter follows:\n Minneapolis, Minn., Feb. 6, 1919.\n Armstrong Bureau of Related Industries, Chicago.\n Gentlemen: Replying to your market letter No. 224, we sold Enterprise Paint M nufacturing Company on February 3d five barrels of bleached linseed oil at $1.50, delivered their plant. This is our price in the Chicago market at the present time.\n Yours truly,\n Midland Linseed Products Co.\n The prices of oil became more stable. \n\n[262 U.S. 371, 388]\n\u00a0\n Defendants continued with meticulous care actively to carry out the several provisions of the agreement amongst them, and that they intended further to pursue the plan unless restrained is not denied.\n The obvious policy-indeed, the declared purpose-of the arrangement was to submerge the competition theretofore existing among the subscribers, and substitute 'intelligent competition,' or 'open competition'; to eliminate 'unintelligent selfishness' and establish '100 per cent. confidence'-all to the end that the members might 'stand out from the crowd as substantial co-workers under modern co-operative business methods.'\n In American Column & Lumber Co. v. United States, \n257 U.S. 377\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 114, 21 A. L. R. 1093, we considered a combination of manufacturers got up to effectuate this new conception of confidence and competition, and held it within the inhibition of the Sherman Act ( Comp. St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830), because of inevitable tendency to destroy real competition, as long understood, and thereby restrain trade. Our conclusion there cannot be reconciled with the somewhat earlier opinion and judgment of the court below. They are in direct conflict.\n The Sherman Act was intended to secure equality of opportunity, and to protect the public against evils commonly incident to monopolies, and those abnormal contracts and combinations which tend directly to suppress the conflict for advantage called competition-the play of the contending forces ordinarily engendered by an honest desire for gain.\n'The statute did not forbid or restrain the power to make normal and useful contracts to further trade by resorting to all normal methods, whether by agreement or otherwise, to accomplish such purpose. ... The words 'restraint of trade' should be given a meaning which would not destroy the individual right to contract and render difficult if not impossible any movement of trade in the channels of interstate commerce- the free movement of which it was the purpose of the \n\n[262 U.S. 371, 389]\n\u00a0\n statute to protect.' United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n221 \nU.S. 106, 179\n, 180 S., 31 Sup. Ct. 632; Ramsay v. Associated Bill Posters, \n260 U.S. 501\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 167, 67 L. Ed. --, January 2, 1923; Federal Trade Commission v. Sinclair Refining Co., \n261 U.S. 463\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 450, 67 L. Ed. --, April 9, 1923.\n\n Certain it is that the defendants are associated in a new form of combination and are resorting to methods which are not normal. If, looking at the entire contract by which they are bound together, in the light of what has been done under it, the court can see that its necessary tendency is to suppress competition in trade between the states, the combination must be declared unlawful. That such is its tendency, we think, must be affirmed. To decide otherwise would be wholly inconsistent with the conclusion reached in American Column & Lumber Co. v. United States, supra.\n The record discloses that defendants, large manufacturers and distributors, powerful factors in the trade, of commodities restricted by limited supplies of raw material (linseed), located at widely separated points, and theretofore conducting independent enterprises along customary lines, suddenly became parties to an agreement which took away their freedom of action by requiring each to reveal to all the intimate details of its affairs. All subjected themselves to an autocratic bureau, which became organizer and general manager, paid it large fees, and deposited funds to insure their obedience. Each subscriber agreed to furnish a schedule of prices and terms and adhere thereto, unless more onerous ones were obtained, until prepared to give immediate notice of departure therefrom for relay by the bureau. Each also agreed, under penalty of fine, to attend a monthly meeting and report upon matters of interest to be there discussed, to comply with all reasonable requirements of the bureau, and to divulge no secrets.\n With intimate knowledge of the affairs of other producers, and obligated as stated, but proclaiming them selves \n\n[262 U.S. 371, 390]\n\u00a0\n competitors, the subscribers went forth to deal with widely separated and unorganized customers necessarily ignorant of the true conditions. Obviously they were not bona fide competitors; their claim in that regard is at war with common experience, and hardly compatible with fair dealing.\n We are not called upon to say just when or how far competitors may reveal to each other the details of their affairs. In the absence of a purpose to monopolize, or the compulsion that results from contract or agreement, the individual certainly may exercise great freedom; but concerted action through combination presents a wholly different problem, and is forbidden when the necessary tendency is to destroy the kind of competition to which the public has long looked for protection. The situation here questioned is wholly unlike an exchange, where dealers assemble and buy and sell openly, and the ordinary practice of reporting statistics to collectors stops far short of the practice which defendants adopted. Their manifest purpose was to defeat the Sherman Act, without subjecting themselves to its penalties.\n The challenged plan is unlawful, and an injunction should go against it, as prayed by the original bill. The cause will be remanded to the court below, with instructions to issue such an injunction, and promptly to take any further action necessary to carry this opinion into effect.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","198":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. BENEDICT(1923)\nNo. 394\nArgued: January 23, 1923Decided: March 5, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. C. J. Nehrbas, of New York City, for plaintiff in error City of new york.\n The Attorney General, for the United States. \n\n[261 U.S. 294, 295]\n\u00a0\n Mr. R. E. T. Riggs, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n\n[261 U.S. 294, 296]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Relying upon the Lever Act-40 Stat. 276, 279 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 ii)-the United States took possession of certain land along new York Bay, April 6, 1918, and, as surviving trustee under the will of Langley, defendant in error, Benedict, instituted this proceeding to recover its value. The tract had been platted into blocks and trustees holding the title had undertaken to convey to New York City the beds of Sixty-First, Sixty-Second and Sixty-Third streets from designated avenues 'to New York Bay,' as laid down on the commissioners' map. The city was made defendant to the amended complaint because of possible interest arising out of this conveyance. No right of recovery against it was suggested. It answered rather vaguely, but claimed title to 'the lands included within the limits of Sixty-First street, Sixty-Second street and Sixty-Third street from the westerly side of First avenue to the New York Bay,' and stated that 'the \n\n[261 U.S. 294, 297]\n\u00a0\n area of said streets is 81,120 square feet.' It asked that the complaint be dismissed. Later it moved, without success, to amend the answer and set up ownership to the beds of Sixty-First, Sixty-Second and Sixty-Third streets to the pierhead line.\n The cause was tried by the court without a jury. The United States stipulated that defendant in error had good title to all the tract, upland and submerged, except such as lay within Sixty-First, Sixty-Second and Sixty-Third streets to high-water mark. Among the findings of fact which the city proposed is this--\n That on April 25, 1899, the said trustees duly executed and delivered to John Whalen, the then corporation counsel of the city of New York, a deed granting and conveying to the city of New York the fee, impressed with a trust for street purposes, of the lands inclu ed within the limits of Sixty-First street, Sixty-Second street and Sixty-Third street from the westerly side of First avenue to the New York Bay.\n Judgment went against the United States for a sum equal to $2 per square foot of the whole area, with interest, less cash originally paid. The trial court held the trustees' deed to the streets invalid, but, if valid, that the recovery nevertheless should be for the same amount as streets were essential to enjoyment of the property. 271 Fed. 714.\n Writs of error from the Circuit Court of Appeals were sued out by both defendants. The city assigned as error-among others-the trial court's refusal to dismiss the complaint. By opinion dated January 18, 1922-280 Fed. 76-the court ruled that the city had good title to the streets, that the judgment of the District Court was erroneous and a new trial would be awarded, unless out of the recovery defendant in error should assign to it $ 162,240-$2 per square foot for the platted streets up to New York Bay, 81, 120 square feet as stated \n\n[261 U.S. 294, 298]\n\u00a0\n by the answer. January 28th the trustees so assigned $162,240, with interest from April 6, 1918, and on January 31st the contested judgment was formally affirmed.\n In the Circuit Court of Appeals the city entered no objection to the arrangement suggested by the opinion. Its counsel here claim that--\n'The judgment should be modified by requiring defendant in error to assign to the city of New York an additional portion of the judgment recovered against the United States, representing the compensation, with interest, awarded for the portions of the streets between the high-water line and the pierhead line, to wit, the sum of $589,731.82.'\n\n The situation is a peculiar one. The city asked, not for recovery, but to be dismissed. Of its own motion and off the record, the court proposed a method of settlement which the trustee adopted in preference to reversal. These unusual circumstances required the city to act promptly if it did not approve. After nearly three months it took a writ of error, and now seeks to reverse the judgment because a greater sum was not awarded. We think it may not deny voluntary acceptance of the assignment and full assent to the arrangement which defendant in error carried out with the obvious purpose of ending the controversy between them. It cannot hold what it accepted and demand more. The final judgment must be treated as though entered upon its express consent, and its writ of error is accordingly dismissed.\n The United States object to the judgment because interest was allowed from date of the taking. This point has been discussed and determined in Seaboard Air Line Railway Co. et al. v. United States, \n261 U.S. 299\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 354, 67 L. Ed. --, decided today, and needs no further elaboration. As to the United States, the judgment below is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","199":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. CARVER(1923)\nNo. 402\nArgued: December 6, 1922Decided: January 2, 1923\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Norman B. Beecher, of New York City, for the United States. \n\n[260 U.S. 482, 483]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. Curtis Rouse, of New York City, for Carver and Morrell.\n\n\n[260 U.S. 482, 487]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a libel in personam against the United States and the receiver of State Steamship Corporation, a company of the State of Delaware, bankrupt, to charge the United States for supplies furnished to the steamships Clio and Morganza. Act of March 9, 1920, c. 95, 41 Stat, 525. The United States owned the vessels, but they were in the possession of the corporation under charters by which the corporation was to pay all costs and expenses incident to the use and operation of the vessels, and 'will not suffer nor permit to be continued any lien, incumbrance, \n\n[260 U.S. 482, 488]\n\u00a0\n or charge which might have priority over the title and interest of the owner in said vessel.' It was stipulated further that in any event within fifteen days the charterer would make adequate provision for the satisfaction or discharge of every claim that might have priority over the title, &c., or would cause such vessel to be discharged from such lien in any event within fifteen days after it was imposed. Supplies or necessities were furnished to the Clio upon the orders of the corporation's port captain who was charged with the duty of procuring them. The libellants did not know any facts tending to show that the corporation did not own the vessel, and so far as appears made no inquiry or effort to sustain what the facts might be. The case of the Morganza is similar except that before furnishing some of the supplies the libellants' agent who dealt with the corporation knew facts putting the libellants upon inquiry but preferred to avoid making it. The liability of the corporation is admitted. That of the vessels is asserted under the Act of June 23, 1910, c. 373, 36 St. 604 (Comp. St.  7783-7787), and the Ship Mortgage Act, being section 30 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920; Act of June 5, 1920, c. 250,  30, subsections P. Q, and R, 41 Stat, 988, 1000, 1005\n\n\n The questions certified are whether a maritime lien would have arisen against (1) the Clio or (2) the Morganza, if they had been privately owned ; (3) if yes, whether the United States is liable for the amount of what would have been the lien; and (4) whether the United States is liable for the personal indebtedness of the State Steamship Corporation for supplies in respect of which no maritime lien would have arisen if the vessel had been privately owned.\n We take up first questions 1 and 2. The Act of 1910 by which the transactions with the Clio were governed after enlarging the right to a maritime lien and providing who shall be presumed to have authority for the owner to \n\n[260 U.S. 482, 489]\n\u00a0\n procure supplies for the vessel, qualifies the whole in section 3 (Comp. St.  7785) as follows:\n'But nothing in this Act shall be construed to confer a lien when the furnisher knew, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence could have ascertained, that because of the terms of a charter party, agreement for the sale of the vessel, or for any other reason, the person ordering the repairs, supplies, or other necessaries was without authority to bind the vessel therefor.'\n\n We regard these words as too plain for argument. They do not allow the materialman to rest upon presumptions until he is put upon inquiry, they call upon him to inquire. To ascertain is to find out by investigation. If by investigation with reasonable diligence the material man could have found out that the vessel was under charter, he was chargeable with notice that there was a charter; if in the same way he could have found out its terms he was chargeable with notice of its terms. In this case it would seem that there would have been no difficulty in finding out both. The Ship Mortgage Act of 1920 repeats the words of the Act of 1910.\n But it is said that the charter party if known would have shown that the master at least, if not the agent who ordered the supplies, had authority to impose a lien, since the charter party contemplated the possibility of one being created and provided for its removal. The South Coast, \n251 U.S. 519\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 233, is cited as establishing the position. But there is a sufficient difference in the language employed there and here to bring about a different result. In The South Coast the contract went no farther than to agree to discharge liens within a month. Here the primary undertaking was that 'the charterers will not suffer nor permit to be continued any lien,' etc. We read this as meaning will not suffer any lien nor permit the same to be continued. Naturally there are provisions for the removal of the lien if in spite of the primary undertaking one is imposed or claimed. But the primary undertaking \n\n[260 U.S. 482, 490]\n\u00a0\n is that a lien shall not be imposed. We are of opinion that the libellants got no lien upon the Clio, and a fortiori that the Morganza was free. The denial of a writ of certiorari imports no expression of opinion upon the merits of the case, as the bar has been told many times. Therefore it is unnecessary to consider whether the libellants' argument is supported by the decisions to which they refer. The Yankee, sub nom. Rivers & Harbors Imp. Co. v. Latta, \n243 U.S. 649\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 476; The Oceana, sub nom. Morse Dry Dock & Repair Co. v. Conron Bors. Co., \n245 U.S. 656\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 13.\n As the libellants disclaim the contention that the United States is liable even if the vessels would not have been subject to a lien it is unnecessary to answer the fourth question.

Herold, of Shreveport, La., for appellees in Nos. 160, 161, 162, and 163, and respondents in No. 191.\n Mr. Elias Goldstein, of Shreveport, La., for appellees in No. 192.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These suits involve claims of title on the part of the United States, hereinafter called the plaintiff, to various parcels of land lying along the border of Ferry Lake, a navigable body of water in Caddo parish, La. Answering these claims, the defendants in the respective cases averred that plaintiff, long before the bringing of the suits, had conveyed by patents to private persons certain fractional subdivisions b rdering on the lake; that these fractions were represented on the official plat of the government survey, made by one Warren in 1839 and duly approved and filed, as bounded on the lake side by the waters of the lake; that in each of the cases the land in controversy was a small tract, lying along the edge of the lake and constituting part of the particular fractional subdivision so conveyed; and that, consequently, plaintiff had divested itself of whatever title it originally had.\n Certain alternative defenses, based upon the alleged ownership of the lands by the state of Louisiana, were pleaded, but, in view of the conclusions we have reached, it is not necessary to consider them. The District Court entered decrees for the plaintiff which the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed (274 Fed. 145, 290), and the cases are here upon appeal except the Loucks Case, which comes on certiorari. The foregoing averments of fact contained in the answers are established by the record. \n\n[260 U.S. 662, 664]\n\u00a0\n 1916-1917, nearly 80 years after the Warren survey-the lands in the meantime having become valuable for their deposits of oil and gas-a new survey was made under the direction of the General Land Office. This survey shows that the line run by Warren, purporting to meander the shore of the lake, did not in all instances coincide precisely with the water's edge. In the four cases first named in the title, the parcels of land lying between the meander line and the lake are of small extent. The meander line throughout its length approximately conforms to the sinuosities of the shore, sometimes, however, running for short distances inland, and sometimes for short distances into and through the water. In the first-mentioned suit the Warren survey indicates a fractional subdivision containing 26.80 acres; the new survey adds 5.67 acres. In the second suit the Warren survey indicates 23 acres; the new survey adds 12. 72 acres. In the third suit the Warren survey indicates 155 acres; the new survey adds 27.87 acres. In the fourth suit the Warren survey indicates 114.80 acres; and the new survey adds 11.49 acres.\n The lands in question are all in township 20, the first mentioned being in section 3, the second in section 10, the third in section 13, and the last in section 24. Following the meander line of the Warren survey the distance from the first of these tracts to the last is about five miles. Leaving out of consideration the large tract involved in Producers' Oil Co. v. Hanzen, \n238 U.S. 325\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 755, and the large tract involved in Jeems Bayou Fishing & Hunting Club v. United States (decided January 2, 1923) \n260 U.S. 561\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 205, 67 L. Ed . --, the aggregate of the various parcels lying outside the meander line is about 70 acres, and the aggregate of the various areas of water included within the meander line is about 44 acres. The facts bring the cases fairly within the rule announced by this court in Mitchell v. Smale, \n140 U.S. 406\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 819, 840, and not within the exception which was followed in the Jeems \n\n[260 U.S. 662, 665]\n\u00a0\n Bayou Case. So far as the instant cases are concerned, there is nothing in the circumstances to suggest the conclusion that any fraud was committed or palpable mistake made by Warren. At the time of his survey the lands were of such little value, the locality so wild and remote, and the attendant difficulties so great that the expenditure of energy and money necessary to run the lines with minute regard to the sinuosities of the lake would have been quite out of proportion to the gain. We are of opinion that the survey of 1839, except as to the two large tracts just mentioned, is not open to challenge. The precisely accurate survey of 1916- 1917 would probably never have been made, but for the greatly increased value of the lands due to the discovery of oil and gas therein. It is unnecessary to do more than quote the language of this court in Mitchell v. Smale, supra:\n'The pretense for making such surveys, arising from th fact that strips and tongues of land are found to project into the water beyond the meander line run for the purpose of getting its general contour, and of measuring the quantity to be paid for, will always exist, since such irregular projections do always, or in most cases, exist. The difficulty of following the edge or margin of such projections, and all the various sinuosities of the water line, is the very occasion and cause of running the meander line, which by its exclusions and inclusions of such irregularities of contour produces an average result closely approximating to the truth as to the quantity of upland contained in the fractional lots bordering on the lake or stream. The official plat made from such survey does not show the meander line, but shows the general form of the lake deduced therefrom, and the surrounding fractional lots adjoining and bordering on the same. The patents when issued refer to this plat for identification of the lots conveyed, and are equivalent to and have the legal effect of a declaration that they extend to and are \n\n[260 U.S. 662, 666]\n\u00a0\n bounded by the lake or stream. Such lake or stream itself, as a natural object or monument, is virtually and truly one of the calls of the description or boundary of the premises conveyed; and all the legal consequences of such a boundary, in the matter of riparian rights and title to land under water, regularly follow.'\n\n While the facts are somewhat different and the extent of the omission somewhat greater, we think the general rule should, likewise, be applied in the remaining two cases. The Warren survey and plat here indicate an area of about 271 acres in the fractional subdivisions conveyed. The lands added by the new survey constitute a compact body of 97.64 acres-65.77 acres of which are involved in the Greene Case and 14.13 acres in the Loucks Case-having the outline of a long and rather irregular crescent, with the outer curve next to the water. The inner boundary, running between the two points of the crescent, is made up of a series of straight lines, with intervening angles conforming to the outlying curve only to a roughly approximate degree. The length of the tract is nearly 4.000 feet and the extreme width about 1,200 feet. Running back from the shore there are numerous ravines, creating, in and along the outer rim of the tract, a series of alternating points and indentations. The evidence justifies the conclusion that in 1839, and especially in time of high water reaching back into the ravines, the establishment of a line precisely coincident with the water's edge would have been a matter of expense and difficulty wholly disproportionate to the then value of the omitted acreage. As in the four cases first discussed, the Warren plat of the survey referred to in the patent represents the lake as the boundary. The survey, taken as a whole, with the exception of the two large tracts already mentioned, follows with a fair degree of accuracy the contour of the lake, and the evident purpose was to include in it all the land to the water's edge. Considering \n\n[260 U.S. 662, 667]\n\u00a0\n the circumstances in respect to the character and value of the lands, the wildness and remoteness of the region, and the difficulties surrounding the work of the surveyors, the failure to run the lines with more particularity was not unreasonable, and we are constrained to agree with the lower court in holding that the waters of the lake, and not the traverse line, constitute the boundary.\n The decrees of the Circuit Court of Appeals in all the cases are therefore\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","201":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. LUSKEY(1923)\nNo. 371\nArgued: April 10, 1923Decided: April 23, 1923\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. James A. Fowler, of Knoxville, Tenn., for the United States.\n Mr. George A. King, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The findings of fact of the Court of Claims are in substance, these: ( 1) Luskey was a machinist's mate in the Navy. He was by proper authority detailed for duty involving actual flying in aircraft, September 15, 1915, and continued in that duty until after February 1, 1917. He made actual flights, one of which was in September, 1916, and two others in December, 1916, and was at all times capable of flying, if so ordered. (2) He received the sum of $329, being 50 per cent. additional pay allowed him by the Act of March 3, 1915, for duty involving actual flying for the entire period from July 1, 1916, to January 31, 1917, a period of 7 months. At a later period the amount was deducted from his pay. He was paid a certain amount for the month of December, 1916. \n\n[262 U.S. 62, 63]\n\u00a0\n If entitled to additional pay for aviation duty for the entire period, July 1, 1916, to January 31, 1917, less pay received for December, 1916, he would receive $279.95.\n Upon the facts found, the court concluded 'as a matter of law' that he was entitled to recover, and 'adjudged and ordered that' he 'recover of and from the United States the sum of two hundred and seventy-nine dollars and ninety-five cents ($279.95).'\n The United States, by this appeal, disputes the conclusion and judgment. Its contention is that, 'to entitle an officer designated to such service to the extra compensation,' he must 'be actually engaged in flying, and that, when an unreasonable time elapses during which he makes no actual flight, he is not entitled to extra pay for such period.' Expressing its contention in other words, it, in effect, is that it is not the detail, but the flying, not the possibility of a risk, but the actual risk, that vests the right to the additional pay.\n To sustain the contention, emphasis is put upon, and insistence made of, the words of the act (38 Stat. 939 [Comp. St.  2823]) that compensation is awarded to the officer 'while lawfully detailed for duty involving actual flying in aircraft.'\n To the conten ion, and rejecting it, the court replied, after quoting the statute:1\n'The word 'involving,' used in the statute, may be inept, but its meaning in the connection in which it is used is plain and not to be mistaken, and that is, that the pay is not made dependent upon the number of flights while on such duty, but is made dependent on the detail to such duty. When, therefore, the plaintiff was lawfully detailed to duty involving flying in \n\n[262 U.S. 62, 64]\n\u00a0\n aircraft, he must be regarded and treated as entitled to the consequences of such detail and to the pay provided for such duty.'\n\n We concur in the conclusion and judgment. The meaning of the statute 'is plain.' If Congress had intended to provide a detail to intermittent duty with intermittent pay, Congress would have specifically so provided, not left repulsion to it the advantage of ambiguity. If it intended to regard 'the possibility of a risk or the actual risk' in flying as determination of compensation or as a factor in compensation, as the United States urges, care would have been taken, not, we will say, against its abuse, but against its use, putting the officer's life in peril many times a day. If that were reasonable in expectation, the other contention is condemned; that is, that the officer is entitled to compensation only when he engages in flights and for reasonable intervals between them. The contention gives no animation to prepare for the duty and its hazards.\n Congress naturally supposed that there would be no detail to aircraft duty, unless there was requirement or use for it, and, when either ceased, the detail would be revoked; but, if made, and not revoked, its duration constituted a service for which the officer must keep prepared, and to which, therefore, the compensation was by the statute assigned.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Hereafter enlisted men in the Navy and Marine Corps, while detailed for duty involving actual flying in aircraft, shall receive the pay, and the permanent additions thereto, including allowances, of their rating and services or rank and service, as the case may be, plus fifty per centum increase thereof.' \n\n\n\n\n","202":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

NEW RIVER COLLIERIES CO(1923)\nNo. 316\nArgued: Decided: May 21, 1923\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Assistant Attorney General Riter, for the United States. \n\n[262 U.S. 341, 342]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ira Jewell Williams, of Philadelphia, Pa., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On various dates between September 17, 1919, and February 1, 1921, at Hampton Roads, Va., the United States requisitioned from defendant in error upwards of 60,000 tons of bituminous coal for use of the Navy. The taking was under section 10 of the Lever Act. 40 Stat. 276 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 ii. The President, acting through the Navy Department, fixed certain prices as just compensation. These were not satisfactory to the owner. The United States paid 75 per cent. of the amount fixed, or, under stipulation of the parties is to be considered as having paid it, in accordance with the act. The owner sued in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey for a sum which added to the 75 per cent. would make just compensation. Three actions were consolidated and tried as one. There was no controversy as to the quantity or quality of the coal taken. Judgment was entered in accordance with the verdict of a jury, fixing prices in excess of those allowed by the President. The government took the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and to review its judgment, affirming that of the District Court, brings the case here on writ of error.\n When the coal was taken, there was at Hampton Roads a market for coal for export and also a domestic market. The business of the defendant in error was chiefly in the export trade. During the period in question, it produced about 907,000 tons and sold nearly two-thirds of it for export. Many producers shipped coal there, which, with the coal of defendant in error, went into a common pool. There was a strong demand for export coal. There \n\n[262 U.S. 341, 343]\n\u00a0\n were many buyers and export prices fluctuated. About 36,000,000 tons were sold in the open market. Supply and demand were controlling factors, affecting market prices which prevailed in both the export and domestic markets. The prices for export coal were considerably higher than for domestic coal. If the coal had not been taken by the United States, it could have been sold by the owner at export market prices. The market prices for export coal were shown by a number of witnesses of long experience and familiar with the market, by excerpts from leading trade journals, and by a statement of prices actually received by defendant in error for export coal during that period. On that point the United States offered no opposing evidence. The court held market prices for export coal constituted just compensation, and left to the jury the ascertainment thereof.\n The United States contends that the court erred in refusing, under the circumstances disclosed, to allow it to introduce evidence of the 'real' value of the coal as distinguished from its market value, and in holding that spot export prices controlled in determining just compensation, and further that, even if such market prices are taken, it was error to exclude evidence of domestic prices.\n Section 10 of the Lever Act, in obedience to the Fifth Amendment, provides for just compensation. The war, or the conditions which followed it, did not suspend or affect these provisions. United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., \n255 \nU.S. 81, 88\n, 41 S. Sup. Ct. 298, 14 A. L. R. 1045.1 The owner was entitled to the full money equivalent of the property taken, and thereby to be put in as good position pecuniarily as it would have occupied, if its property had not been taken. Seaboard Air Line Railway Co. v. United States, \n261 U.S. 299\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 354, 67 L. Ed. --, decided March 5, 1923, and cases cited. The ascertainment of compensation is a \n\n[262 U.S. 341, 344]\n\u00a0\n judicial function, and no power exists in any other department of the government to declare what the compensation shall be or to prescribe any binding rule in that regard. Monongahela Navig tion Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312, 327\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 622. Where private property is taken for public use, and there is a market price prevailing at the time and place of the taking, that price is just compensation. L. Vogelstein & Co., Inc., v. United States, \n262 U.S. 337\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 564, 67 L. Ed. --, decided this day; United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53, 80\n, 81 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 667; Boom Co. v. Patterson, \n98 U.S. 403\n, 407. More would be unjust to the United States, and less would deny the owner what he is entitled to.\n The United States admits that market value is usually the basis for ascertaining the pecuniary equivalent, but suggests that sometimes an article has no market price, and that in such case 'proof of real value' is admissible, and that therefore 'market value' and 'just compensation' are not necessarily synonymous. The court below excluded evidence offered by the United States to show the owner's cost of production and a reasonable profit. This ruling was right, because it was shown beyond controversy that there were market prices prevailing when and where the coal was taken. The United States had the right to take the coal on payment of these prices; the owner was not entitled to more, and could not be required to take less. The owner's cost, profit, or loss did not tend to prove market price or value at the time of taking, and was therefore immaterial.\n The United States offered evidence of prices specified for domestic coal in contracts for future deliveries (current at the time of the taking ), as distinguished from prices for spot coal; i. e., coal for immediate delivery. These contract prices were rightly excluded. They could be given no weight as against current market prices, and would have no tendency to prove what such market prices were. \n\n[262 U.S. 341, 345]\n\u00a0\n The facts bring this case within the rule stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals (276 Fed. 690, at page 692):\n'If it be an article commonly traded in on a market, and it is shown that at the time and place it was taken there was a market in which like articles in volume were openly bought and sold, the prices current in such a market will be regarded as its fair market value, and likewise the measure of just compensation for its requisition.'\n\n The lower courts rightly held that market prices prevailing at the times and place of the taking constitute just compensation.\n Nor was it error to exclude evidence of the market prices of coal for domestic use, and to hold that market prices for export coal controlled. The owner cannot be required to suffer pecuniary loss. Upon an examination of the record we agree with the statement of the Circuit Court of Appeals ( 276 Fed. 690, 691) that, if the coal had not been taken by the United States, it could have been sold at the market price for export coal prevailing for spot deliveries at the time of the taking.\n The owner was entitled to what it lost by the taking. That loss is measured by the money equivalent of the coal requisitioned. It is shown by the evidence that every day representatives of foreign firms were purchasing, or trying to purchase, export coal. Transactions were numerous and large quantities were sold. Export prices for spot coal were controlled by the supply and demand. These facts indicate a free market. The owner had a right to sell in that market, and it is clear that it could have obtained the prices there prevailing for export coal. It was entitled to these prices. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, also, C. G. Blake Co. v. United States (D.

C., for appellee. \n\n[261 U.S. 363, 364]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Nelson W. Rider, the plaintiff below, was a first class private in the Aviation Section of the Signal Enlisted Reserve Corps from the date of his enlistment, November 29, 1917, until September 13, 1918, when he accepted a commission as a second lieutenant in Air Service Aeronautics. His suit is for pay additional to that received by him while he was a first-class private. He asked in his petition for a judgment for $381.42. The Court of Claims gave him judgment for $326.22. He was paid from February 9, 1913, until June 30, 1918, at the rate of $100 a month, from July 1 to September 13, 1918, at the rate of $49.50 a month; i. e., $33.00 as base pay and $16.50 as additional pay for flight duty. He began flight duty on May 12, 1918. Rider claims, first, $100 a month down to September 13, 1918, when he became an officer; second, 50 per cent. of that sum in addition while on flight duty, from May 12, 1918, until September 13; and, third, $6 additional pay per month from February 9 to September 13, and 50 per cent. of that in addition on flight duty from May 12 to September 13. This third claim was disallowed by the Court of Claims, and, as Rider has taken no appeal from this ruling, we need not consider it.\n On the peace establishment first-class privates of the Signal Corps received $18 a month. Act May 11, 1908, 35 Stat. 109. This was increased when we entered the war, so as to make the pay $33. Act May 18, 1917 (40 Stat. 82; Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  2044j). The Aviation Section of the Army was established as a branch of the Signal Corps by the Act of July 18, 1914 (38 Stat. 514, 516; Comp. St. ( 1867c), and by its terms the officer in command could instruct 12 enlisted men in the art of flying, but no enlisted man could be assigned to duty as a flyer against his will, except in time of war, and while on flight duty he was to receive an increase of 50 per \n\n[261 U.S. 363, 365]\n\u00a0\n centum in his pay. This increased the pay of enlisted men on flight duty at that time from $18 to $27 monthly, and when we entered the war in 1917 from $33 to $49.50. By the National Defense Act of June 3, 1916 (39 Stat. 166, 174, 175), the Secretary of War under the provisions for the Signal Corps, was authorized to cause as many enlisted men to be instructed in the art of flying as he deemed necessary.\n To understand how the pay of the plaintiff herein became $100 a month as an enlisted man, we must revert to the history of the training camps. In 1915, the War Department, responding to a popular agitation for preparedness, on its own initiative and without legislative authority, organized training camps, where civilians were given military instruction. Those who attended were required to pay transportation and subsistence, to buy their uniforms, and to serve without pay. Legislative authority was given for these camps in section 54 of the National Defense Act of June 3, 1916 (39 Stat. 194; Comp. St.  3071b). This provided transportation, uniforms, and subsistence, but no pay. The Army Appropriation Act of August 29, 1916 (39 Stat. 648), gave funds for future camps for the fiscal year 1917, and authorized reimbursement for transportation and subsistence to persons who had attended camps prior to the Act of June 3, 1916. See 23 Comp. Dec. 217. Such was the state of legislation when the war began, April 6, 1917. At this time, civilians and enlisted men of the regular army and of the National Guard in federal service were being sent to training camps to become officers. The civilians received no pay. The enlisted men received the pay of their respective grades. By the Appropriation Act of May 12, 1917 (40 Stat. 69, 70) an appropriation of more than $3,000,000 was made to enable the Secretary of War to pay to civilians designated by him for training as officers not exceeding $100 a month as pay, provided they would agree to \n\n[261 U.S. 363, 366]\n\u00a0\n accept appointment in the Officers' Reserve Corps in such grade as might be tendered.\n In the Act of June 15, 1917 (40 Stat. 188), there was, under the heading of 'Enlisted Men of the Line,' the following:\n'For pay of enlisted men of all grades, including recruits, and pay at $100 per month for enlisted men in training for officers of the Reserve Corps, $226,882,560.'\n\n This, as said, was a deficiency appropriation, and therefore did not authorize pay at the rate of $100 beyond June 30, 1918. It was obviously passed to put enlisted men on a level with civilians going through the same training for commissions in the Reserve Corps.\n The training camps for officers to which this appropriation then applied had been established by War Department Special Regulations, No. 49, and included only training for commissions in the infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Training schools for the Aviation Section were not included within those regulations. In such schools, satisfactory students were recommended for commissions by the Chief Signal Officer; but they were not embraced under No. 49, and were likely not to be paid the $100 a month provided by the Act of June 15, 1917. The Chief Signal Officer and the Adjutant General brought this discrimination to the attention of the Secretary of War (26 Comp. Dec. 117) who then directed by order of July 13, 1917, that enlisted men of the Signal Enlisted Reserve Corps, admitted to the Signal Corps Aviation Schools, should be considered as designated for training as officers of the army and put on the same footing as to pay and allowances as enlisted men detailed to training camps for commissions in the infantry, cavalry and artillery.\n After we had been a year in the war, and a draft act had been passed, no further necessity existed for inducement to civilians to train as officers, and no further provision after June 30, 1918, was made for pay to them. \n\n[261 U.S. 363, 367]\n\u00a0\n Training camps were continued until November 11, 19 8, but the appropriations for them were only for arms and ordinance equipment. Army Appropriation Act July 9, 1918, 40 Stat. 876.\n This recital has been necessary to show the surrounding circumstances in view of which this provision for the $100 monthly pay for enlisted men training for commissions should be construed. It makes clear that this legislation of June 15, 1917, was enacted merely to abolish the discriminating difference between civilians and enlisted men who were all training for the same commissions in the same camps, the former receiving three times the pay of the latter. It was a temporary leveling up. It was not the fixing of base pay. It was not a pay to which the 50 per cent. addition for flight duty could reasonably attach. Enlisted men under the act of 1914 training in flight duty to become officers, before this act of June 15, 1917, received $49.50; i. e., $33 plus $16.50. This increased the pay to $100 on a level with that of civilians engaged in the same duty and training. Such civilians, if any, were not entitled to 50 per cent. increase for flight duty. Why should it be assumed, therefore, that it was intended to pay these enlisted men $50 more a month than civilians in a statute plainly designed to secure uniformity? But it is said that this is to repeal the act of 1914 giving additional pay for flight duty to enlisted men, and repeals by implication are not favored. This is not to repeal the act. It is merely to hold that it is not applicable to a temporary provision or bonus for a particular purpose. In reaching this conclusion, we are confirmed by the departmental construction of these acts and by that of the accounting officers of the Treasury. We cannot agree with the Court of Claims, therefore, that the 50 per cent. addition to the regular pay of the enlisted aviation student applies to the $100 monthly pay allowed by the Deficiency Act of June 15, 1917. \n\n[261 U.S. 363, 368]\n\u00a0\n But the Court of Claims went further and held that the $100 a month pay for such enlisted men continued beyond June 30, 1918, to which the Act of June 15, 1917, carried it. This conclusion is based on certain general provisions of two statutes. The first is the act approved July 24, 1917 ( 40 Stat. 243; Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  1867f-1867o), to authorize temporary increase of the Signal Corps, to purchase and make airships and to appropriate for the same. That act put the temporarily enlisted men in the Signal and Aviation Corps on the same footing as to pay, allowances and pensions as enlisted men of the same grade in the regular army, made an appropriation of $640,000,000 for the purposes of the act and provided that enlisted men of the aviation section of the Signal Corps should be paid from funds transferred to their credit from Signal Corps appropriations. The second act relied on is that of July 9, 1918 (40 Stat. 850), in which it was provided that the $640,000,000 appropriated in the foregoing act, and the funds appropriated in the Act of May 12, 1917 (40 Stat. 69, 70), entitled an act making appropriations for the support of the army for the fiscal year 1918, should be made available until June 30, 1919. These statutes do not sustain the conclusion of the Court of Claims because the $100 pay for enlisted men in training was not provided for in either of these acts but in the Deficiency Act of June 15, 1917, which is not continued in effect until June 30, 1919. It is true that the Act of May 12, 1917, gives the Secretary of War the authority to pay civilians in training for reserve commissions $100 a month, but by the Act of July 9, 1918, no funds are appropriated to enable him to order such pay, and, as a matter of fact, after June 30, 1918, no such pay was allowed to civilians training for commissions. We are unable to see, therefore, in the acts relied on any legislative authority for paying $100 a month to enlisted men in training for commissions after that date. The situation reverted to that preceding the Act of June 15, 1917, and \n\n[261 U.S. 363, 369]\n\u00a0\n the enlisted men in the Aviation Section became entitled to $33 a month pay and to $49.50 a month while engaged on flight duty.\n The plaintiff below thus received all the pay which he was entitled to receive.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","206":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. SLAYMAKER(1923)\nNo. 87\nArgued: October 18, 1923Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Lovett, for the United States.\n Mr. George A. King, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Slaymaker, upon his enrollment during the War with Germany, as an officer of the Naval Reserve Force, was paid the sum of $150, as a gratuity for the purchase of a uniform. He was subsequently commissioned as an officer of the regular Navy and that sum was checked against his account and deducted from his pay as such officer. This action is brought to recover that amount.\n The Court of Claims gave judgment for Slaymaker, following the ruling, it said, of Price v. United States, 55 \n\n[263 U.S. 94, 95]\n\u00a0\n Ct. Cl. 499. To review and reverse its action the government (there is convenience in so designating the United States) prosecutes this appeal.\n The difference between it and the court, and the latter's decision turns upon an act of Congress passed August 29, 1916, 39 Stat. 589 (Comp. St.  2900 1\/2 a[21, 22]). The act provides that:\n'Members of the Naval Reserve Force shall, upon first reporting for active service for training during each period of enrollment, be credited with a uniform gratuity of $50 for officers and $30 for mem.\n\n'Upon reporting for active service in time of war or national emergency the uniform gratuity shall be $150 for officers and $60 for men: ... Provided, that should any member of the Naval Reserve Force sever his connection with the service without compulsion on part of the government before the expiration of his term of enrollment, the amount so credited shall be deducted from any money that may be or may become due him.'\n\n We are confronted at the outset with the word 'service' and its definition, in the provision 'should any member of the Naval Reserve Force sever his connection with the service.' (Italics ours.) The word 'service' is an ambiguous one. It has many senses. In the first paragraph of the act of Congress it has a limited and immediately understood meaning. It has manifestly a larger meaning in the second paragraph, but how much larger is open to dispute-is disputed in this case. Does it mean the Naval Service in the most comprehensive sense of that designation, or the branches or departments of that service, or more narrowly, the functions in those branches or departments? We are inclined to pronounce for the most comprehensive sense, though we feel the strength of the considerations which urge against it.\n The allowance is called a 'gratuity' but it has useful design. It is intended to attract ability to the work and purposes of the government. It is a reward and accorded \n\n[263 U.S. 94, 96]\n\u00a0\n necessarily at the enrollment of the ability which continued in utility upon whatever objects or for whatever purposes exerted. It grew the greater as it was exercised in experience and we cannot ascribe to Congress the intention to visit with the same consequence-penalty, we may say-a continuation of service having such result as a cessation of service. There was prompting and inducement to the reverse-prompting and inducement to the policy and practice of giving assurance to officers and men that the promotions they deserved and received would not be regarded as of no benefit to the government-no more benefit than though they-officers and men-were disconnected from government.\n The government contests this construction and the judgment of the Court of Claims. Its contention is that Slaymaker's resignation from the Naval Reserve Force was a severance of his connection 'with the service' within the meaning of the Act of August 29, 1916, supra, and that it was 'without compulsion on the part of the government,' it being not only voluntary but under the admonition that the gratuity that had been granted him would have to be refunded since he was 'leaving the Reserve Force of his own volition and not by compulsion on the part of the Navy Department.'\n If the contention were relevant under our construction of the act we should be reluctant to hold that his action was voluntary and incurred the return of the gratuity.\n July 1, 1918 (40 Stat. 711 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  2900 1\/2 a( 22 4\/5)]), Congress passed an act containing the following provision:\n'That no part of the clothing gratuity credited to members of the Naval Reserve Force shall be deducted from their accounts where said members accept or have accepted temporary appointments in the Navy in time of war or other national emergency.'\n\n This act was passed after the deduction from Slaymaker's pay. The Court of Claims considered the act as \n\n[263 U.S. 94, 97]\n\u00a0\n a declaration of the meaning of the Act of August 29, 1916. The court strongly supports its holdings. We however, may rest our decision on the meaning we have assigned to the Act of August 29, 1916\n\n\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","207":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. WALTER(1923)\nNo. 20\nArgued: Decided: October 22, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[263 U.S. 15, 16]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General James M. Beck, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n Mr. John W. Dodge, of Jacksonville, Fla., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an indictment in three counts. The first charges a conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States by making and presenting for payment a fraudulent claim against the United States Emergency Fleet Corporation, a corporation formed under the laws of the District of Columbia, of which the United States owned all the stock. The second count charges a like conspiracy to obtain the payment of fraudulent claims against the same corporation. The third count charges a conspiracy to defraud the United States. All the counts are based upon the same facts, and the first two are brought under the Act of October 23, 1918, c. 194, 40 Stat. 1015, amending section 35 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  10199), and \n\n[263 U.S. 15, 17]\n\u00a0\n taken with section 37, making it a crime to conspire to present for, or to obtain, payment of a fraudulent claim against 'any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder.' The third count is based upon section 37 of the Criminal Code, Act of March 4, 1909, c. 231, 35 Stat. 1088 (Comp. St.  10201), punishing conspiracy 'to defraud the United States in any manner or for any purpose.' A demurrer to all the counts was sustained by the District Court on the grounds that the Act of 1918 must be taken literally, as embracing any corporation in which the United States owned a single share of stock, and so construed went beyond the power of Congress, and that under United States v. Strang, \n254 U.S. 491\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 165, the fraud alleged was not a fraud upon the United States.\n Taking up first the Act of 1918, it was enacted after Congress contemplating the possibility of the war that ensued had authorized the formation of the Fleet Corporation under laws deriving their authority from earlier statutes of the United States. We are not informed whether at that time the United States owned stock in corporations other than the instrumentalities created with reference to the needs of that war, but we cannot doubt that the act was passed with a special view to them. United States v. Bowman, \n260 \nU.S. 94, 101\n, 102 S., 43 Sup. Ct. 49. The United States can protect its property by criminal laws, and its constitutional power would not be affected if it saw fit to create a corporation of its own for purposes of the Government, under laws emanating directly or indirectly from itself, and turned the property over to its creature. The creator would not be subordinated to its own machinery. That is the case before us. If the law in terms dealt only with the Emergency Fleet Corporation it would be beyond question. See United States Grain Corporation v. Phillips, \n261 \nU.S. 106, 113\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 283. It is said however that the words 'any corporation in which \n\n[263 U.S. 15, 18]\n\u00a0\n the United States is a stockholder' are too clear to be cut down. Butts v. Merchants' Transportation Co., \n230 \nU.S. 126, 136\n, 137 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 964. But against the cases that decline to limit the generality of words in order to save the constitutionality of an act are many others that imply a limit, and, when the circumstances permit, the latter course will be adopted. Language as absolute as that before us was limited in The Abby Dodge, \n223 \nU.S. 166, 172\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 310, 311 (56 L. Ed. 390): Any 'sponges taken ... from the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Straits of Florida.' See Texas v. Eastern Texas R. R. Co., \n258 \nU.S. 204, 217\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 281. We are of opinion that the Act of 1918 should be construed to refer only to corporations like the Fleet Corporation that are instrumentalities of the government and in which for that reason it owns stock. In United States v. Bowman, \n260 U.S. 94\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 49, the present objection was not raised by counsel or by the Court.\n As to the third count, while it is true that the corporation is not the United States, United States v. Strang, \n254 U.S. 491\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 165, the contemplated fraud upon the corporation if successful would have resulted directly in a pecuniary loss to the United States, and even more immediately would have impaired the efficiency of its very important instrument. We are of opinion that it was within the words of section 37 'defraud the United States in any manner' and that on this as on the other point the decision below was wrong. Haas v. Henkel, \n216 \nU.S. 479, 480\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 249, 17 Ann. Cas. 1112; United States v. Barnow, \n239 \nU.S. 74, 79\n, 36 S. Sup.

Is a high-caste Hindu, of full Indian blood, born at Amritsar, Punjab, India, a white person within the meaning of section 2169, Revised Statutes? \n\n[261 U.S. 204, 207]\n\u00a0\n\n'2. Does the Act of February 5, 1917 (39 Stat. 875,  3), disqualify from naturalization as citizens those Hindus now barred by that act, who had lawfully entered the United States prior to the passage of said act?'\n\n\n The appellee was granted a certificate of citizenship by the District Court of the United States for the District of Oregon, over the objection of the Naturalization Examiner for the United States. A bill in equity was then filed by the United States, seeking a cancellation of the certificate on the ground that the appellee was not a white person and therefore not lawfully entitled to naturalization. The District Court, on motion, dismissed the bill (In re Bhagat Singh Thind, 268 Fed. 683), and an appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals. No question is made in respect of the individual qualifications of the appellee. The sole question is whether he falls within the class designated by Congress as eligible.\n Section 2169, Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  4358), provides that the provisions of the Naturalization Act 'shall apply to aliens being free white persons and to aliens of af ican nativity and to persons of African descent.'\n If the applicant is a white person, within the meaning of this section, he is entitled to naturalization; otherwise not. In Ozawa v. United States, \n260 U.S. 178\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 65, 67 L. Ed. --, decided November 13, 1922, we had occasion to consider the application of these words to the case of a cultivated Japanese and were constrained to hold that he was not within their meaning. As there pointed out, the provision is not that any particular class of persons shall be excluded, but it is, in effect, that only white persons shall be included within the privilege of the statute. 'The intention was to confer the privilege of citizenship upon that class of persons whom the fathers knew as white, and to deny it to all who could not be so classified. It is not enough to say that the framers did not have in mind the brown or yellow races of Asia. It is necessary to go farther and be able to say that had these particular \n\n[261 U.S. 204, 208]\n\u00a0\n races been suggested the language of the act would have been so varied as to include them within its privileges'-citing Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 644. Following a long line of decisions of the lower Federal courts, we held that the words imported a racial and not an individual test and were meant to indicate only persons of what is popularly known as the Caucasian race. But, as there pointed out, the conclusion that the phrase 'white persons' and the word 'Caucasian' are synonymous does not end the matter. It enabled us to dispose of the problem as it was there presented, since the applicant for citizenship clearly fell outside the zone of debatable ground on the negative side; but the decision still left the question to be dealt with, in doubtful and different cases, by the 'process of judicial inclusion and exclusion.' Mere ability on the part of an applicant for naturalization to establish a line of descent from a Caucasian ancestor will not ipso facto to and necessarily conclude the inquiry. 'Caucasian' is a conventional word of much flexibility, as a study of the literature dealing with racial questions will disclose, and while it and the words 'white persons' are treated as synonymous for the purposes of that case, they are not of identical meaning-idem per idem.\n In the endeavor to ascertain the meaning of the statute we must not fail to keep in mind that it does not employ the word 'Caucasian,' but the words 'white persons,' and these are words of common speech and not of scientific origin. The word 'Caucasian,' not .means clear, and the use of it in its scientific probably wholly unfamiliar to the original framers of the statute in 1790. When we employ it, we do so as an aid to the ascertainment of the legislative intent and not as an invariable substitute for the statutory words. Indeed, as used in the science of ethnology, the connotation of the word is by no means clear, and the use of it in its scientific sense as an equivalent \n\n[261 U.S. 204, 209]\n\u00a0\n for the words of the statute, other considerations aside, would simply mean the substitution of one perplexity for another. But in this country, during the last half century especially, the word by common usage has acquired a popular meaning, not clearly defined to be sure, but sufficiently so to enable us to say that its popular as distinguished from its scientific application is of appreciably narrower scope. It is in the popular sense of the word, therefore, that we employ is as an aid to the construction of the statute, for it would be obviously illogical to convert words of common speech used in a statute into words of scientific terminology when neither the latter nor the science for whose purposes they were coined was within the contemplation of the framers of the statute or of the people for whom it was framed. The words of the statute are to be interpreted in accordance with the understanding of the common man from whose vocabulary they were taken. See Maillard v. Lawrence, 16 How. 251, 261.\n They imply, as we have said, a racial test; but the term 'race' is one which, for the practical purposes of the statute, must be applied to a group of living persons now possessing in common the requisite characteristics, not to groups of persons who are supposed to be or really are descended from some remote, common ancestor, but who, whether they both resemble him to a greater or less extent, have, at any rate, ceased altogether to resemble one another. It may be true that the blond Scandinavian and the brown Hindu have a common ancestor in the dim reaches of antiquity, but the average man knows perfectly well that there are unmistakable and profound differences between them to-day; and it is not impossible, if that common ancestor could be materialized in the flesh, we should discover that he was himself sufficiently differentiated from both of his descendants to preclude his racial classification with either. The question for determination \n\n[261 U.S. 204, 210]\n\u00a0\n is not, therefore, whether by the speculative processes of ethnological reasoning we may present a probability to the scientific mind that they have the same origin, but whether we can satisfy the common understanding that they are now the same or sufficiently the same to justify the interpreters of a statute-written in the words of common speech, for common understanding, by unscientific men-in classifying them together in the statutory category as white persons. In 1790 the Adamite theory of creation-which gave a common ancestor to all mankind-was generally accepted, and it is not at all probable that it was intended by the legislators of that day to submit the question of the application of the words 'white persons' to the mere test of an indefinitely remote common ancestry, without regard to the extent of the subsequent divergence of the various branches from such common ancestry or from one another.\n The eligibility of this applicant for citizenship is based on the sole fact that he is of high-caste Hindu stock, born in Punjab, one of the extreme northwestern districts of India, and classified by certain scientific authorities as of the Caucasian or Aryan race The Aryan theory as a racial basis seems to be discredited by most, if not all, modern writers on the subject of ethnology. A review of their contentions would serve no useful purpose. It is enough to refer to the works of Deniker ( Races of Man, 317), Keane (Man, Past and Present, 445, 446), and Huxley ( Man's Place in Nature, 278) and to the Dictionary of Races, Senate Document 662, 61st Congress, 3d Sess. 1910-1911, p. 17.\n The term 'Aryan' has to do with linguistic, and not at all with physical, characteristics, and it would seem reasonably clear that mere resemblance in language, indicating a common linguistic root buried in remotely ancient soil, is altogether inadequate to prove common racial origin. There is, and can be, no assurance that the so-called \n\n[261 U.S. 204, 211]\n\u00a0\n Aryan language was not spoken by a variety of races living in proximity to one another. Our own history has witnessed the adoption of the English tongue by millons of negroes, whose descendants can never be classified racially with the descendants of white persons, notwithstanding both may speak a common root language.\n The word 'Caucasian' is in scarcely better repute. \n1\n It is at best a conventional term, with an altogether fortuitous origin,2 which under scientific manipulation, has come to include far more than the unscientific mind suspects. According to Keane, for example (The World's Peoples, 24, 28, 307, et seq.), it includes not only the Hindu, but some of the Polynesians3 (that is, the Maori, Tahitians, Samoans, Hawaiians, and others), the Hamites of Africa, upon the ground of the Caucasic cast of their features, though in color they range from brown to black. We venture to think that the average wellinformed white American would learn with some degree of astonishment that the race to which he belongs is made up of such heterogeneous elements. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[261 U.S. 204, 212]\n\u00a0\n The various authorities are in irreconcilable disagreement as to what constitutes a proper racial division. For instance, Blumenbach has 5 races; Keane following Linnaeus, 4; Deniker, 29.5 The explanation probably is that 'the inumerable varieties of mankind run into one another by insensible degrees,'6 and to arrange them in sharply bounded divisions is an undertaking of such uncertainty that common agreement is practically impossible.\n It may be, therefore, that a given group cannot be properly assigned to any of the enumerated grand racial divisions. The type may have been so changed by intermixture of blood as to justify an intermediate classification. Something very like this has actually taken place in India. Thus, in Hindustan and Berar there was such an intermixture of the 'Aryan' invader with the darkskinned Dravidian. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n In the Punjab and Rajputana, while the invaders seem to have met with more success in the effort to preserve \n\n[261 U.S. 204, 213]\n\u00a0\n their racial purity,8 intermarriages did occur producing an intermingling of the two and destroying to a greater or less degree the purity of the 'Aryan' blood. The rules of caste, while calculated to prevent this intermixture, seem not to have been entirely successful. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n It does not seem necessary to pursue the matter of scientific classification further. We are unable to agree with the District Court, or with other lower federal courts, in the conclusion that a native Hindu is eligible for naturalization under section 2169. The words of familiar speech, which were used by the original framers of the law, were intended to include only the type of man whom they knew as white. The immigration of that day was almost exclusively from the British Isles and Northwestern Europe, whence they and their forebears had come. When they extended the privilege of American citizenship to 'any alien being a free white person' it was these immigrants-bone of their bone and flesh of their flesh-and their kind whom they must have had affirmatively in mind. The succeeding years brought immigrants from Eastern, Southern and Middle Europe, among them the Slavs and the dark-eyed, swarthy people of Alpine and Mediterranean stock, and these were received as unquestionably akin to those already here and readily amalgamated with them. It was the descendants of these, and \n\n[261 U.S. 204, 214]\n\u00a0\n other immigrants of like origin, who constituted the white population of the country when section 2169, re-enacting the naturalization test of 1790, was adopted, and, there is no reason to doubt, with like intent and meaning.\n What, if any, people of Primarily Asiatic stock come within the words of the section we do not deem it necessary now to decide. There is much in the origin and historic development of the statute to suggest that no Asiatic whatever was included. The debates in Congress, during the consideration of the subject in 1870 and 1875, are persuasively of this character. In 1873, for example, the words 'free white persons' were unintentionally omitted from the compilation of the Revised Statutes. This omission was supplied in 1875 by the act to correct errors and supply omissions. 18 Stat. c. 80, p. 318. When this act was under consideration by Congress efforts were made to strike out the words quoted, and it was insisted upon the one hand and conceded upon the other, that the effect of their retention was to exclude Asiatics generally from citizenship. While what was said upon that occasion, to be sure, furnishes no basis for judicial construction of the statute, it is, nevertheless, an important historic incident, which may not be altogether ignored in the search for the true meaning of words which are themselves historic. That question, however, may well be left for final determination until the details have been more completely disclosed by the consideration of particular cases, as they from time to time arise. The words of the statute, it must be conceded, do not readily yield to exact interpretation, and it is probably better to leave them as they are than to risk undue extension or undue limitation of their meaning by any general paraphrase at this time.\n What we now hold is that the words 'free white persons' are words of common speech, to be interpreted in accordance with the understanding of the common man, synonymous with the word 'Caucasian' only as that \n\n[261 U.S. 204, 215]\n\u00a0\n word is popularly understood. As so understood and used, whatever may be the speculations of the ethnologist, it does not include the body of people to whom the appellee belongs. It is a matter of familiar observation and knowledge that the physical group characteristics of the Hindus render them readily distinguishable from the various groups of persons in this country commonly recognized as white. The children of English, French, German, Italian, Scandinavian, and other European parentage, quickly merge into the mass of our population and lose the distincitive hallmarks of their European origin. On the other hand, it cannot be doubted that the children born in this country of Hindu parents would retain indefinitely the clear evidence of their ancestry. It is very far from our thought to suggest the slightest question of racial superiority or inferiority. What we suggest is merely racial difference, and it is of such character and extent that the great body of our people instinctively recognize it and reject the thought of assimilation.\n It is not without significance in this connection that Congress, by the Act of February 5, 1917, 39 Stat. 874, c. 29,  3 (Comp.

This not only constitutes conclusive evidence of the congressional attitude of opposition to Asiatic immigration generally, but is persuasive of a similar attitude toward Asiatic naturalization as well, since it is not likely that Congress would be willing to accept as citizens a class of persons whom it rejects as immigrants.\n It follows that a negative answer must be given to the first question, which disposes of the case and renders an answer to the second question unnecessary, and it will be so certified.\n Answer to question No. 1, No. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Dictionary of Races, supra, p. 31. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 2 Encyclopaedia Britannica (11th Ed.) p. 113: 'The ill-chosen name of Caucasian, invented by Blumenbach in allusion to a South Caueasian skull of specially typical proportions, and applied by him to the so- called white races, is still current; it brings into one race peoples such as the Arabs and Swedes, although these are scarcely less different than the Americans and Malays, who are set down as two distinct races.

MERRIAM(1923)\nNo. 67\nArgued: Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. Solicitor General Beck, of Washington, D. C., for the United states.\n\n\n[263 U.S. 179, 182]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Roy C. Gasser, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are actions brought by the United States against the respective defendants, to recover the amount of additional income taxes assessed against them under the Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16, 38 Stat. 114, 166. The pertinent provisions of the statute are:\n'A. Subdivision 1. That there shall be levied, assessed, collected and paid annually upon the entire net income arising or accruing from all sources in the preceding \n\n[263 U.S. 179, 183]\n\u00a0\n calendar year to every citizen of the United States, whether residing at home or abroad, and to every person residing in the United States, though not a citizen thereof, a tax of one per centum ... upon such income. ...\n\n'B. That, subject only to such exemptions and deductions as are hereinafter allowed, the net income of a taxable person shall include gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service of whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or from professions, vocations, businesses, trade, commerce, or sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in real or personal property, also from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any lawful business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever, including the income from but not the value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise or descent. ...'\n\n The taxes were assessed upon certain legacies bequeathed to the defendants by the will of the late Alfred G. Vanderbilt. The provisions of the will which give rise to the controversy are as follows:\n'Eleventh: I give and bequeath to my brother Reginald C. Vanderbilt, five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000); to my uncle Frederick W. Vanderbilt, two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000): to Frederick M. Davies, five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000); to Henry B. Anderson, two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000); to Frederick L. Merriam, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000); to Charles E. Crocker, ten thousand dollars ($10,000), and to Howard Lockwood, one thousand dollars ($1,000).\n\n ...\n'Sixteenth. I nominate and appoint my brother, Reginald C. Vanderbilt, my uncle, Frederick W. Vander bilt, \n\n[263 U.S. 179, 184]\n\u00a0\n Henry B. Anderson, Frederick M. Davies, and Frederick L. Merriam executors of this my will and trustees of the several trusts created by this my will. ... The bequests herein made to my said executors are in lieu of all compensation or commissions to which they would otherwise be entitled as executors or trustees.'\n\n The defendants qualified as executors and letters testamentary were duly issued to them prior to the commencement of these actions. The legacies were received by the respective defendants during the year 1915-$ 250,000 by Merriam and $200,000 by Anderson.\n Demurrers to the complaints were overruled by the District Court and judgments rendered against defendants. Upon writs of error from the Circuit Court of Appeals these judgments were reversed. Merriam v. United States, 282 Fed. 851. The government contends that these legacies are compensation for personal service within the meaning of paragraph B, quoted above.\n The cases turn upon the meaning of the phrase which describes net income as 'including the income from but not the value of property acquired by ... bequest. ...' The word 'bequest' is commonly defined as a gift of personal property by will; but it is not necessarily confined to a gratuity. Thus, it was held in Orton v. Orton, *42 N. Y. 486, that a bequest of personal property, though made in lieu of dower, was nevertheless, a legacy, the court saying:\n'Every bequest of personal property is a legacy, including as well those made in lieu of dower, and in satisfaction of an indebtedness as those which are wholly gratuities. The circumstance whether gratuitous or not, does not enter into consideration in the definition. ... And when it is said that a legacy is a gift of chattels, the word is not limited in its meaning to a gratuity, but has the more extended signification, the primary one given by Worcester in his Dictionary, 'a thing given, either as a gratuity or as a recompense.\" \n\n[263 U.S. 179, 185]\n\u00a0\n Without now attempting to formulate a precise definition of the meaning of the word as used in this statute, or deciding whether it includes an amount expressly left as compensation for service actually performed, it is enough for present purposes to say that it does include the bequest here under consideration since, as we shall presently show, actual service as a condition of payment is not required. A bequest to a person as executor is considered as given upon the implied condition that the person named shall, in good faith, clothe himself with the character. 2 Williams on Executors (6th Am. Ed.) 1391; Morris v. Kent, 2 Edw. Ch. 175, 179. And this is so whether given to him simply in this capacity or for care and trouble in executing the office. Id. And it is a sufficient performance of the condition if the executor prove the will or unequivocally manifests an intention to act. Lewis v. Mathews, L. R. 8 Eq. Cas. 277, 281; Kirkland v. Narramore, 105 Mass. 31, 32, 7 Am. Rep. 497; Scofield v. St. John, 65 How. Pr. (N. Y.) 292, 294-296; Morris v. Kent, supra; Harrison v. Rowley, 4 Vesey, 212, 215.\n\n In Morris v. Kent, supra (page 179), it is said:\n'A legacy to an executor, even expressed to be for care and pains, is not to be regarded in the light of a debt or as founded in contract, or to be governed by the principles applicable to contracts. ... When a legacy is given to a person in the character of executor, so as to attach this implied condition to it, the question generally has been upon the sufficient assumption of the character to entitle the party to the same. The cases establish the general rule that it will be a sufficient performance of the condition, if the legatee prove the will with a bona fide intention to act under it or unequivocally manifest an intention to act in the executorship, as, for instance, by giving directions about the funeral of the testator, but is prevented by death from further performing the duties of his office.' \n\n[263 U.S. 179, 186]\n\u00a0\n Decisions are cited in the government's brief which, it is said, establish a contrary rule. These decisions, however, we are of opinion, are clearly differentiated from the case under consideration. Some of them are with reference to testamentary provisions specifically fixing the amount of compensation for services to be rendered while others deal with the question whether the executor is entitled to receive statutory compensation in addition to the amount named in the will. In Matter of Tilden, 44 Hun, 441, for example, the will directed that:\n\n'In lieu ... of all other commissions and compensation to my executors for performing their duties under this will ... I authorize them to receive from my estate the following commissions, namely.'\n\n The court, construing this provision, said:\n'The provisions in the will were intended to be as compensation for services rendered, to be in no respect a gift, but an authority to charge for their services a certain sum.'\n\n Again, in Richardson v. Richardson, 145 App. Div. 540, 129 N. Y. Supp. 941, the will was interpreted as directing the payment of compensation. Especial stress was laid upon the fact that the will did not purport to 'give' or 'bequeath' to the executors the amounts fixed, and, adopting the language of the court in the Tilden Case, it was said that the provisions of the will were intended as an--\n\"authority to charge for their services a certain sum.' The compensation provided by the will is not a legacy, and does not abate with the legacies, but is compensation, carefully determined by the testator and directed to be paid for the services to be rendered, and is therefore to be paid in full.'\n\n It is obvious that in this class of cases the right depends upon the actual performance of the service, and the amount fixed is in no sense a legacy, but is purely compensative.\n In Renshaw v. Williams, 75 Md. 498, 23 Atl. 905, the court held that where a bequest had been made in lieu of commissions \n\n[263 U.S. 179, 187]\n\u00a0\n in a sum larger than the commissions would amount to, it must be treated as full compensation for the entire administration of the estate by the same person, though part of it passed through his hands as administrator pendente lite and part as executor.\n In Connolly v. Leonard, 114 Me. 29, 95 Atl. 269, a devise was made 'in lieu of any payment for services as executor or trustee,' with the provision that it was so to be accepted and understood. The court held that in view of this language, the executor was not entitled to commissions in addition to the property devised.\n The foregoing are illustrative of the cases relied upon, and, apart from some general language, which we are unable to accept as applicable to the present case, none of them, in principle, are in conflict with the conclusion we have reached. The distinction to be drawn is between compensation fixed by will for services to be rendered by the executor and a legacy to one upon the implied condition that he shall clothe himself with the character of executor. In the former case he must perform the service to earn the compensation. In the latter case he need do no more than in good faith comply with the condition in order to receive the bequest; and in that view the further provision that the bequest shall be in lieu of commissions is, in effect, nothing more than an expression of the testator's will that the executor shall not receive statutory allowances for the services he may render.\n The word 'bequest' having the judicially settled meaning which we have stated, we must presume it was used in that sense by Congress. Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100, 124\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 797, 1 Ann. Cas. 655; The Abbotsford, \n98 U.S. 440\n, 444.\n On behalf of the government it is urged that taxation is a practical matter and concerns itself with the substance of the thing upon which the tax is imposed rather than with legal forms or expressions. But in statutes levying taxes the literal meaning of the words employed is most \n\n[263 U.S. 179, 188]\n\u00a0\n important for such statutes are not to be extended by implication beyond the clear import of the language used. If the words are doubtful, the doubt must be resolved against the government and in favor of the taxpayer. Gould v. Gould, \n245 \nU.S. 151, 153\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 53. The rule is stated by Lord Cairns in Partington v. Attorney General, L. R. 4 H. L. 100, 122:\n'I am not at all sure that in a case of this kind-a fiscal case-form is not amply sufficient; because, as I understand the principle of all fiscal legislation, it is this: If the person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law, he must be taxed, however great the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be. On the other hand, if the crown, seeking to recover the tax, cannot bring the subject within the letter of the law, the subject is free, however apparently within the spirit of the law the case might otherwise appear to be. In other words, if there be admissible in any statute what is called an equitable construction, certainly such a construction is not admissible in a taxing statute, where you can simply adhere to the words of the statute.'\n\n And see Eidman v. Martinez, \n184 \nU.S. 578, 583\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 515.\n We are of opinion that these bequests are not taxable as income under the statute, and the judgment below is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","210":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. SISCHO(1923)\nNo. 76\nArgued: April 23, 1923Decided: May 7, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 165, 166]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Alfred A. Wheat, of New York City, for the United States.\n Mr. John M. Woolsey, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the United States to recover a penalty of $ 6,400 from the defendant for bringing into this country one hundred five- tael tins of opium prepared for smoking purposes without including the same in the ship's manifest. The defendant was master of the vessel in which the opium was imported and was charged by the Collector of Customs with a liability for the above sum, that being the price paid by the defendant for the goods. By Rev. Sts.  2809 (Comp. St.  5506):\n'If any merchandise is brought into the United States in any vessel whatever from any foreign ports ... which shall not be included or described in the manifest ... the master shall be liable to a penalty equal to the value of such merchandise not included in such manifest; and all such merchandise not included in the manifest belonging or consigned to the master, mate, officers, or crew of such vessel, shall be forfeited.'\n\n The District Court, sitting without a jury, held that opium prepared for smoking purposes was not merchandise within the meaning of section 2809 and that being outlawed by the statutes it had no value; and gave judgment for the defendant. 262 Fed. 1001. The judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, one Judge dissenting, on the former ground. 270 Fed. 958. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n256 U.S. 688\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 624. It was stated below that the defendant had been convicted of smuggling; but the \n\n[262 U.S. 165, 167]\n\u00a0\n record does not disclose the fact, if material, and nothing turns upon it. The points mentioned are the only ones to be discussed.\n The collection of duties is not the only purpose of a manifest, as is shown by the requirement of one for outward bound cargoes and from vessels in the coasting trade bound for a port in another collection district, Rev. Sts.  4197, 3116 (Comp. St.  7789, 5828), and more clearly by the plain reason of the thing. A government wants to know, without being put to a search, what articles are brought into the country, and to make up its own mind not only what duties it will demand but whether it will allow the goods to enter at all. It would seem strange if it should except from the manifest demanded those things about which it has the greatest need to be informed-if in that one case it should take the chance of being able to find what it forbids to come in, without requiring the master to tell what he knows. It would seem doubly strange when at the same time it required any other person who had knowledge that the forbidden article was on the vessel to report the fact to the master. Act of January 17, 1914, c. 9,  4, 38 Stat. 275, 276 (Comp. St.  8801b). It is not an answer to say that if the master knows that he has contraband goods on board he is subject to a penalty for that and probably will lie. The law naturally, one would think, would put the screws on to make him tell the truth, and in that way diminish the chance of his carrying contraband and help him to show his innocence if he has made a mistake. Harford v. United States, 8 Cranch, 109. We are of opinion that this policy, which has been expressed in terms in later statutes (Act of May 26, 1922, c. 202,  3, 42 Stat. 596, 598; Tariff Act of September 21, 1922, c. 356,  401[c], 431, 584, 42 Stat. 858, 948, 950, 980), governs also in the statutes to be construed here. There is less contradiction between the requir ment of the manifest and the prohibition of the import than there is between such a \n\n[262 U.S. 165, 168]\n\u00a0\n prohibition and a tax. United States v. Remus, \n260 U.S. 477\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 197, 67 L. Ed. --, January 2, 1923\n\n\n The main foundation of the decision below is Rev. Sts.  2766 (Comp. St.  5462):\n'The word 'merchandise' as used in this Title [the Title including section 2809 upon which this suit is based], may include goods, wares and chattels of every description capable of being imported.'\n\n It is argued that this is a definition; that 'capable of being imported' must be taken to mean capable of being imported lawfully as otherwise the phrase hardly would do more than exclude chattels real, and would want the poignant significance attributed to every word of legislation; and that therefore the merchandise to be included in the manifest does not embrace opium for smoking which the law has done all it can to exclude. Act of January 17, 1914, c. 9, 38 Stat. 275. Yet this very act of 1914 provides that whenever there shall be found upon a vessel arriving at any port of the United States opium 'or any preparations or derivatives thereof' 'which is not shown upon the vessel's manifest, as is provided by sections twenty-eight hundred and six and twenty-eight hundred and seven of the Revised Statutes, such vessel shall be liable for the penalty and forfeiture prescribed in section twenty-eight hundred and nine of the Revised Statutes.' Section 8 (Comp. St.  8801f). We see no adequate reason for not taking these words in their natural sense as including smoking opium and as meaning that it must be included in the manifest, or for limiting them to forfeiture of the vessel. We rather should read them as showing that, at least for the future and at least so far as derivatives from opium are concerned, the language quoted from Rev. Sts.  2766, was also to be taken in its natural sense as meaning physically capable of being imported.\n The language under consideration was an insertion in the Revised Statutes. That volume was primarily a condification of the general statutes then in force and is \n\n[262 U.S. 165, 169]\n\u00a0\n not lightly to be read as making a change, although of course it may do so. The words on their face indicate rather an extension than a restriction. 'May include' seems to point to the removal of a doubt as to whether previously 'merchandise' might include all that is mentioned. It is a most unnatural way of saying that henceforth it shall not include something that otherwise might have been included. To give it the latter meaning we have again to read 'capable of being imported' in an artificial sense instead of taking the phrase simply for what it says to a plain mind. The only objection to reading it in the natural way is that it is thought to add nothing to what was contained in 'goods, wares and chattels of every description.' But there is no canon against making explicit what is implied and adding a little emphasis to the endeavors to make the proposition broad. The doubts that have been felt show that the endeavor was not very successful, but we believe that it was made. There can be little doubt that before the insertion of section 2766 goods that could not be imported lawfully were merchandise within the meaning of the statutes. It was held in Harford v. United States, 8 Cranch, 109, that the unlading of such goods without a permit was an offense subjection them to forfeiture, upon reasoning that applies to the requirement that they should be entered on the manifest, with equal force.\n What we have said sufficiently disposes of the suggestion that the requirement was repealed by the opium act that we have cited. That is merely saying in another way that a manifest is not necessary for goods forbidden to enter the country. All that remains is the suggestion that smoking opium has no value. But assuming it to be established that the statutes require the manifest to disclose prohibited articles the penalty imposed implies that such articles may have value and oes not require the Courts to set up a technical rule in face of the plain truth. \n\n[262 U.S. 165, 170]\n\u00a0\n So the provision that smoking opium shall be forfeited implies that however evil it may be it has an owner. Act of January 17, 1914, c. 9,  4, 38 Stat. 275; Act of May 26, 1922, c. 202,  3, 42 Stat. 596, 598. In the circumstances we see no objection to taking the foreign value as evidence, in accordance with the rulings of the Treasury Department. Treas. Dec. No. 32083, December, 1911; 21 T.

STAFOFF(1923)\n\nArgued: November 29, 1922Decided: January 2, 1923\n\n\n\n Chris Elioff Stafoff, alias Chris Elioff, was indicted with another for having in possession a still intended for the production of distilled spirits for beverage and commercial purposes, without having registered it, and for having unlawfully manufactured on premises other than an authorized distillery a mash fit for the production of distilled spirits. A demurrer to both counts was sustained (268 Fed. 417), and the United States brings error. Affirmed.\n James L. Brooks was convicted of having in possession a still, and of manufacturing a mash, and of having carried on the business of a distiller without having given th bond required by law, and he brought error to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which certified to the Supreme Court questions as to whether the statutes on which the indictment was based had been repealed by the National Prohibition Act, and as to whether defendant could be sentenced under the National Prohibition Act. Questions as to the repeal answered 'Yes,' and question as to the sentence answered 'No.'\n George Remus and others were indicted for having carried on the business of a liquor dealer and rectifier without having paid the special tax required by law. A demurrer to the indictment was sustained as to six of the seven counts of the indictment (283 Fed. 685), and the United States brings error. Judgment on counts 2, 4, and 6 affirmed, and that on counts 3, 5, and 7 reversed. \n\n[260 U.S. 477, 478]\n\u00a0\n Mrs. Assistant Attorney General Willebrandt, for the United states.\n Samuel Herrick, of Washington, D. C., for Brooks.\n E. N. Zoline, of New York City, for Remus and others.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In the first of these cases Stafoff was indicted with another for having had in their possession a still intended for the production of distilled spirits for beverage and commercial purposes, without having registered it with the Collector of Internal Revenue, as required by Rev. St.  3258 (Comp. St.  5994), and in a second count for having unlawfully manufactured on premises other than an authorized distillery a mash fit for the production of distilled spirits, to wit, whisky, contrary to Rev. St.  3282 (Comp. St.  6022). A demurrer to these counts was sustained ( 268 Fed. 417), and the United States brings the case here under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246 (Comp. St.  1704).\n The case of Brooks comes here on a certificate from the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Brooks was convicted under the above mentioned sections 3258 and 3282, and also under Rev. St.  3281 (Comp. St .  6021), for having \n\n[260 U.S. 477, 479]\n\u00a0\n carried on the business of a distiller without having given bond as required by law. The third and fourth counts under section 3282 respectively charged the making of a mash as above and the separating by distillation of alcoholic spirits from a fermented mash. The questions certified are whether the three sections mentioned are repealed by the National Prohibition Act of October 28, 1919, c. 85, 41 Stat. 305, and whether if they are repealed the cause should be remanded with directions to enter judgment and impose sentence under the last-named act.\n In the third case Remus and his associates were charged in six counts with having carried on the business of a wholesale liquor dealer, that of a retail liquor dealer, and that of a rectifier, without having paid the special tax as required by law. Rev. St.  3242 (Comp. St.  5965). A demurrer to these counts was sustained. 283 Fed. 685. The United States took a writ of error under the Criminal Appeals Act.\n In United States v. Yuginovich, \n256 U.S. 450\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 551, it was decided that sections 3281 and 3282 were repealed by the later law, at least as to the production of liquor for beverage purposes. Since that decision and with reference to it, as appears from the House Report, No. 224, 67th Congress, 1st Session, and the debates, 61 Cong. Record, part 3, pp. 3095, 3096, the Act Supplemental to the National Prohibition Act was passed. Act of November 23, 1921, c. 134,  5, 42 Stat. 222, 223. By section 5 of this statute:\n'All laws in regard to the manufacture ... of and traffic in intoxicating liquor, and all penalties for violations of such laws that were in force when the National Prohibition Act was enacted, shall be and continue in force, as to both beverage and non-beverage liquor, except such provisions of such laws as are directly in conflict with any provision of the National Prohibition Act or of this act.'\n\n But if an act violates both the former and the latter a conviction under one is a bar to rosecution under the \n\n[260 U.S. 477, 480]\n\u00a0\n other. This section is not declaratory even in form. It does not purport to construe the National Prohibition Act as leaving in force what this Court has declared to have been repealed. It could not in this way give a retrospective criminality to acts that were done before it was passed and that were not criminal except for the statutes held to have been repealed. Ogden v. Blackledge, 2 Cranch, 272, 277; Koshkonong v. Burton, \n104 U.S. 668\n. Of course a statute purporting to declare the intent of an earlier one might be of great weight in assisting a court when in doubt, although not entitled to control judicial action. But that is not this case. The decision in United States v. Yuginovich must stand for the law before November 23, 1921. In that case, besides what we have mentioned, it was held also that the penalty imposed by Rev. St.  3257 (Comp. St.  5993), on a distiller for defrauding the United States of the tax on the spirits distilled by him was repealed. So far as the Liquor is for beverage purposes the same reasoning must apply to the penalty in section 3242 for carrying on the business of rectifier or wholesale or retail liquor dealer without having paid the special tax imposed by law.\n But the Supplemental Act that we have quoted puts a new face upon later dealings. From the time that it went into effect it had the same operation as if instead of saying that the laws referred to shall continue in force it had enacted them in terms. The form of words is not material when Congress manifests its will that certain rules shall govern henceforth. Swigart v. Baker, \n229 \nU.S. 187, 198\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 645. Of course Congress may tax what it also forbids. \n256 U.S. 462\n.1 For offenses committed after the new law, United States v. Yuginovich cannot be relied upon. Three counts in the Remus Case charge carrying on the business mentioned up to April 1, 1922, and therefore are governed in part by the Supplemental Act. So far as the decision of the Court below neglected this distinction \n\n[260 U.S. 477, 481]\n\u00a0\n it was wrong. The decision in Stafoff's Case dealt with conduct before the date of the Supplemental Act and was right. The keeping of a still to make liquor for beverage purposes contrary to section 3258 is within the principle of the Yuginovich Case, and the addition of the words 'and commercial' to the statement of the purposes does not seem to us enough to take it out. The reference to this section in title 3, section 8, of the Prohibition Act may have been inserted simply for greater caution. It is one of several considerations tending to a different conclusion in United States v. Yuginovich, but as they did not prevail then they cannot prevail now.\n There remain the questions certified in Brooks v. United States. They are somewhat broader than we indicated in our summary statement, as they include the Revenue Laws generally as well as the sections 3258, 3281 and 3282. The general question manifestly is too broad to require an answer. From the summary given of the indictment we infer that what we have said is sufficient with regard to the sections named. The fourth question, whether, in view of what we have decided, the case should be remanded for judgment and sentence under the National Prohibition Act must be answered, No. The indictment plainly purported to be drawn under the old law and it would be unjust to treat the conviction as covering an offense under a law of fundamentally different policy if facts could be spelled out that might fall within the latter, although alleged with no thought of it or any suggestion to the accused that he must be prepared to defend against the different charge. \n No. 26.\n Judgment affirmed.\n No. 403.

STATE OF OKLAHOMA(1923)\nNo. 25\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[261 U.S. 253, 254]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Riter, for the United States.\n Mr. Wm. H. Zwick, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for the State of Oklahoma.\n\n\n[261 U.S. 253, 256]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit commenced in this court by the United States against the state of Oklahoma to establish priority in favor of the United States under section 3466 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  6372), and to have a debt owing by the State Bank of Guthrie, Okl., paid before any distribution of the assets of the bank.\n The case was heard on the motion of the state to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the allegations thereof are not sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\n The facts as set forth in the complaint are in substance the following. The bank was organized under the laws of Oklahoma, and was engaged in a general banking business at Guthrie until, October 26, 1921, it was found insolvent under the state law and unable to pay its debts and unable to continue as a going banking concern. The United States, under various acts of Congress, is guardian of certain incompetent and restricted Indians residing within Oklahoma, and as such guardian caused to be deposited in that bank certain sums of money received by the United States, through the office of the Superintendent of the Five Civilized Tribes in Oklahoma, on account of certain individual members and allottees of such tribes, who were incompetent and restricted and wards of the United States. Before such deposit was made the bank, pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior, delivered t the United States a bond with the Fidelity & Casualty Co. of New York as surety thereon to secure the payment of such funds, and that bond is in \n\n[261 U.S. 253, 257]\n\u00a0\n force. On October 26, 1921, the sum so deposited and due the United States amounted to not less than $42,000, with interest. October 7, 1921, a state bank examiner made an examination of the bank and found that it was insolvent under the Oklahoma law, and unable to pay its debts and to continue as a going banking concern, and so reported to the bank commissioner, who, on October 26, 1921, adjudged the bank insolvent and took charge and possession of its assets, books, and records for the purposes specified in the state depositors' guaranty fund law. The assets of the bank so taken and now in the possession of the bank commissioner are in excess of the amount claimed by the United States, and the United States claims to be entitled to have its debt first satisfied in full out of such assets, before other creditors are paid anything. Demand for such prior payment was made by the United Stated and refused by the state.\n The claim of priority asserted by the United States is based upon section 3466 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (Comp. St.  6372), which provides:\n'Whenever any person indebted to the United States is insolvent, or whenever the estate of any deceased debtor, in the hands of the executors or administrators, is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased, the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied; and the priority hereby established shall extend as well to cases in which a debtor, not having sufficient property to pay all his debts, makes a voluntary assignment thereof, or in which the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed, or absent debtor are attached by process of law, as to cases in which an act of bankruptcy is committed.'\n\n The applicable provisions of the Oklahoma statutes are found in chapter 6 of the Revised Laws of Oklahoma of 1910. A state banking board is created and given the supervision and management of depositors' guaranty fund, created by levying assessments against the capital stock of each bank and trust company. \n\n[261 U.S. 253, 258]\n\u00a0\n The provision of section 302, under which possession of the bank and its assets were taken, is as follows:\n'Whenever any bank or trust company organized or existing under the laws of this state shall voluntarily place itself in the hands of the bank commissioner, or whenever any judgment shall be rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, adjudging and decreeing that such bank or trust company is insolvent, or whenever its rights or franchises to conduct a banking business under the laws of this state shall have been adjudged to be forfeited, or whenever the bank commissioner shall become satisfied of the insolvency of any such bank or trust company, he may, after due examination of its affairs, take possession of said bank or trust company and its assets, and proceed to wind up its affairs and enforce the personal liability of the stockholders, officers and directors.'\n\n The state asserts a lien superior to the priority rights of the United States, under section 303, which is as follows:\n'In the event that the bank commissioner shall take possession of any bank or trust company, which is subject to the provisions of this chapter, the depositors of said bank or trust company shall be paid in full, and when the cash available or that can be made immediately available of said bank or trust company is not sufficient to discharge its obligations to depositors, the said banking board shall draw from the depositors' guaranty fund and from additional assessments, if required, as provided in section 300, the amount necessary to make up the deficiency; and the state shall have, for the benefit of the depositors' guaranty fund, a first lien upon the assets of said bank or trust company, and all liabilities against the stockholders, officers and directors of said bank or trust company and against all other per ons, corporations or firms. Such liabilities may be enforced by the state for the benefit of the depositors' guaranty fund.'\n\n The United States, asserting that it is not bound first to proceed on the bond of the surety company (citing \n\n[261 U.S. 253, 259]\n\u00a0\n Lewis, Trustee, v. United States, \n92 U.S. 618\n), invokes jurisdiction of this court on the ground that, when the bank and its assets were taken over by the state through its bank commissioner, the state acquired title to the same and is therefore the proper party to be sued. State v. Cockrell, 27 Okl. 630, 112 Pac. 1000; Lankford v. Platte Irom Works Co., \n235 U.S. 461\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 173; American Water Co. v. Lankford, \n235 U.S. 496\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 184; Farish v. State Banking Board, \n235 U.S. 498\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 185. No objection to jurisdiction is made by the state, and the state does not deny that the United States is entitled to priority on account of money deposited by it as guardian of the Indians to the same extent as in the case of any other deposit. The state's contentions are that section 3466 properly construed does not give the United States priority; that the state has a lien on the bank's assets, and that the priority rights (if any) of the United States are subject thereto; and that priority rights under the act do not apply where a sovereign state has a lien against its debtor.\n Section 3466, relied on by the government, is a re-enactment and extension of section 65, Act of March 2, 1799, 1 Stat. 676; and the same or equivalent language, so far as the question here involved is concerned, is found in earlier statutes. Act of March 3, 1797,  5, 1 Stat. 515; also Act of May 2, 1792,  18, 1 Stat. 263; Act of August 4, 1790,  45, 1 Stat. 169; Act of July 31, 1789,  21, 1 Stat. 42. It has been considered in a number of cases in this court. The claim of the United States to the asserted priority rests exclusively upon the statute. No lien is created by it. It does not overreach or supersede any bona fide transfer of property in the ordinary course of business. It established priority which is limited to the particular state of things specified. The meaning of the word 'insolvent,' used in the act, and of the insolvency therein referred to, is limited by the language to cases where 'a debtor not having sufficient \n\n[261 U.S. 253, 260]\n\u00a0\n property to pay all his debts shall make a voluntary assignment,' etc. Mere inability of the debtor to pay all his debts in ordinary course of business is not insolvency within the meaning of the act, but it must be manifested in one of the modes pointed out in the latter part of the statute which defines or explains the meaning of insolvency referred to in the earlier part. United States v. State Bank of North Carolina, 6 Pet. 29, 35; United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch, 358, 390; United States v. Hooe et al., 3 Cranch, 73, 90; Prince v. Bartlett, 8 Cranch, 431, 433; Conard v. Atlantic Insurance Co., 1 Pet. 386, 439; Brent v. Bank of Washington, 10 Pet. 596, 611; Field et al. v. United States, 9 Pet. 182, 201. Where the debtor is divested of his property in one of the modes specified in the act, the person who becomes divested with the title is made trustee for the United States and bound first to pay its debt out of the debtor's property. Beaston, Garnishee, v. Farmers' Bank of Delaware, 12 Pet. 102, 133-135. The priority given the United States cannot be impaired or superseded by state law. If priority in favor of the United States attaches at all, it takes effect immediately upon the taking over of the bank. The state has no lien on the assets of the bank before the taking of such possession by the bank commissioner.\n Does section 3466 apply? It requires that there shall be an insolvent debtor 'not having sufficient property to pay all his debts.' The complaint does not allege that the bank's assets were not sufficient to pay al its debts. After stating that the bank examiner found that it was insolvent and unable to pay all its debts and unable to continue as a going banking concern, and that the bank commissioner pursuant to the authority vested in him by the laws of the state adjudged the bank insolvent and thereupon took charge and possession of its assets for the purposes of liquidation, the complaint does allege that the bank was and is insolvent. But the word 'insolvent' is used in \n\n[261 U.S. 253, 261]\n\u00a0\n different senses. Section 3466 makes it apply only in cases where the debtor 'not having sufficient property to pay all his debts. ...' The Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541,  1, 30 Stat. 544 (Comp. St.  9585), provides:\n'A person shall be deemed insolvent within the provisions of this act whenever the aggregate of his property, exclusive of any property which he may have conveyed, transferred, concealed or removed, or permitted to be concealed or removed, with intent to defraud, hinder, or delay his creditors, shall not, at a fair valuation, be sufficient in amount to pay his debts.'\n\n In section 302 of the Oklahoma law, the meaning of 'insolvency' of a bank is not so limited, and, when regard is had to other provisions of the Oklahoma state depositors' guaranty fund law and its object-the full and prompt payment of depositors in banks unable to carry on as going banking concerns-it is clear that the meaning there intended is not the same as in section 3466 or in the Bankruptcy Act. The bank commissioner under the Oklahoma law properly may 'become satisfied' of the insolvency of a state bank whenever it is unable to pay its depositors in ordinary course of business and is unable to continue as a going banking concern, even though it has sufficient property to pay all its debts and is not insolvent within the meaning of section 3466 or the federal Bankruptcy Act. This view is in harmony with the meaning of insolvency as defined by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma:\n'Independent of statute, it may generally be said that insolvency, when applied to a person, firm, or corporation engaged in trade, means inability to pay debts as they become due in the usual course of business. The definition is one generally accepted by both the state and federal courts.' Oklahoma Moline Plow Co. v. Smith, 41 Okl. 498, 503, 139 Pac. 285, 287.\n\n The allegations of the complaint do not show the debtor to be insolvent within the meaning of section 3466 or of the Bankruptcy Act. \n\n[261 U.S. 253, 262]\n\u00a0\n It remains to be considered whether an act of bankruptcy was committed. In order to give the priority specified in section 3466, there must be a case of an insolvent debtor who makes a voluntary assignment of his property, or a case in which the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed or absent debtor are attached by process of law, or a case in which an act of bankruptcy is committed. In this case it is not alleged that the Oklahoma state bank voluntarily placed itself in the hands of the bank commissioner under section 302 or that it made a voluntary assignment of its property, but it is alleged that the bank commissioner adjudged it insolvent and took charge and possession of its assets. No action on the part of the bank was necessary, and none is alleged. And it is plain that the case is not within the absconding, concealed or absent debtor clause.\n The complaint does not expressly allege that the bank committed any act of bankruptcy or state any facts as constituting an act of bankruptcy. But it is claimed that the position of the bank commissioner in taking charge of the bank's affairs under section 302 is analogous to that of a receiver or a trustee in bankruptcy, or that of an assignee for the benefit of creditors. The facts set forth in the complaint do not constitute an act of bankruptcy as defined by the federal Bankruptcy Act ( section 3a [Comp. St.  9587]). There is not alleged any conveyance to defraud, or preference through transfer or through legal proceedings, or general assignment for the benefit of creditors. Nor is t e case within the meaning of the last clause of section 3a(4):\n'Or because of insolvency a receiver or trustee has been put in charge of his property under the laws of a state. ...'\n\n The allegtions do not show insolvency within the meaning of section 3466 or of the Bankruptcy Act. The insolvency contemplated by section 302 of the state law is not the same or equivalent condition. The bank commissioner does not take possession because of the existence of insolvency, \n\n[261 U.S. 253, 263]\n\u00a0\n within the meaning of these federal laws. He is not a receiver or trustee put in charge because of any such insolvency. He acts as an arm or instrumentality of the state in the exercise of its police powers to effect the purpose of the law for the protection of depositors. It would defeat the purpose of that law to require that the bank must be insolvent within the meaning defined in section 3466 or in the Bankruptcy Law before the benefit of the state law can be made available to depositors. A primary purpose of his possession is the prompt payment of depositors by the use of the state guaranty fund to the extent necessary, and the case is to be distinguished from that defined in the Bankruptcy Act, and the commissioner is not a receiver or trustee within its meaning. The legislation of Oklahoma, so far as banks are concerned, does not define acts of bankruptcy or deal with bankrupt or insolvent banks otherwise than by the state law herein referred to.\n As insolvency within the meaning of section 3466 was not necessary for the taking of possession by the bank commissioner and is not shown to exist, and as no act of bankruptcy as defined by applicable federal legislation on the subject of bankruptcies or as defined by any law of Oklahoma is shown to have been committed, and as the debtor bank was not divested of its assets in one of the modes specified in section 3466, the case is not within that section.\n The state's motion to dismiss the complaint is granted.\n Bill dismissed. \n\n\n\n","213":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVALLEY FARMS CO. OF YONKERS v. WESTCHESTER COUNTY(1923)\nNo. 136\nArgued: January 24, 1923Decided: February 19, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. Robt. C. Beatty, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.[ Valley Farms Co of Yonkers v. Westchester County \n261 U.S. 155\n (1923) ]\n\n\n[261 U.S. 155, 158]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. A. Davidson, of Port Chester, N. Y., and Charles M. Carter, of White Plains, N. Y., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error, a New York corporation, seeks cancellation of an assessment of taxes upon its real property to pay for construction and operation of the Bronx Valley sewer. Westchester county, a necessary party under the local statute, demurred to the complaint upon the ground that it states no cause of action. The trial court over ruled \n\n[261 U.S. 155, 159]\n\u00a0\n the demurrer. The Appellate Division reversed the judgment (Valley Farms Co. of Yonkers v. City of Yonkers, 193 App. Div. 433, 184 N. Y. Supp. 300), and the Court of Appeals affirmed this action, without opinion (231 N. Y. 558, 132 N. E. 887).\n The complaint alleges--\n Plaintiff in error owns certain designated lands in Westchester county assessed for taxes for the year 1918 for the benefit of the Bronx Valley sewer.\n That under chapter 646, New York Laws of 1905, entitled 'An act to provide for the construction and maintenance of a sanitary trunk sewer and sanitary outlet sewer in the county of Westchester, and to provide means for the payment therefor,' and sundry amendments thereto, especially chapter 646, Laws of 1917, the Legislature attempted to designate the area benefited by the trunk and outlet sewers and to provide for taxing all property therein. The trunk sewer is 11 3\/4 miles long; the outlet sewer 3 miles. Both are wholly within Westchester county. The former lies along the Bronx river. At a point near the south line of the county it connects with the outlet sewer, which extends thence westwardly under two high ridges and across Tibbetts Valley to the Hudson river.\n That the sewer system carries house drainage only-no surface water, and throughout its entire course the grade is downward. The sewage flows by gravity. There are no pumping stations.\n That east of and near Hudson river a high ridge runs north and south. Immediately east of this lies Tibbetts Valley; further east there is a second north and south ridge; then comes Bronx Valley, shut in on the east by a third ridge. The natural drainage of Bronx Valley is southerly into East river; Tibbet  Valley also drains southerly, but into Harlem river. No natural drainage connection exists between the two valleys; they are separated throughout their entire length by the second ridge.\n That the outlet sewer, through which the whole system discharges, extends from the trunk sewer in Bronx Valley \n\n[261 U.S. 155, 160]\n\u00a0\n under the second ridge a great depth below the surface, thence across Tibbetts Valley and under the first ridge, also at great depth, to the Hudson river. Any connection with this sewer from Tibbetts Valley must be made therein, and lands there cannot be connected at all with the trunk sewer.\n That about 2,500 acres-Lincoln Park section-of Tibbetts Valley is now connected with the outlet sewer; no other lands therein can use it, unless and until a connecting line, 4 miles long, is constructed, at a probable cost of $300,000.\n That notwithstanding this limited possible use Tibbetts Valley is assessed to meet the cost of the entire system, just as the lands in Bronx Valley. Taxes for construction and maintenance are based wholly upon assessed valuations for general purposes. Each lot is taxed according to value and irrespective of benefits received. No power is conferred to reduce assessments in one section not benefited equally with others.\n That the district was defined by the amendment of 1917, 12 years after the original act and 5 years after completion of the sewers. The first act limited the total cost to $2,000,000 and provided that commissioners should determine the benefited area after opportunity for hearings. Amendments have changed these fundamental provisions; the total cost exceeds $3,250,000, and the boundaries have been designated without notice to owners.\n That the challenged assessments are upon valuations of both land and improvements and disproportionate to benefits. The board of supervisors is required to adopt a budget, which includes unconstitutional and unlawful items-among them cost of litigation and contingent fund for deficiencies.\n That the act as amended prohibits assessments against lands within the sewer district when also in Mt. Vernon, but directs that a corresponding sum shall be \n\n[261 U.S. 155, 161]\n\u00a0\n paid by levy upon all property, real and personal, within that city.\n That plaintiff's lands have been illegally assessed. The act as amended violates the Fourteenth Amendment, by depriving plaintiff of property without due process of law and without just compensation, and by denying it equal protection of the laws. The assessments are a cloud upon plaintiff's title and greatly depreciate market values. There is no adequate remedy at law.\n The prayer is for a decree declaring the assessments void, directing their cancellation and restraining collection, and for general relief.\n Counsel for plaintiff in error states that:\n'The question here involved is whether the statutes of the state of New York, under which the Bronx Valley sewer assessments were imposed over a large area of many square miles, in Westchester county, New York, are in contravention of due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n The argument proceeds thus--\n The sewer system, intended for house drainage only, consists of a trunk sewer 11 3\/4 miles long, in the Bronx Valley, connected with an outlet sewer extending westward 3 miles to the Hudson river. The act of 1905-chapter 646-provided that commissioners should prepare a map of the assessment district after notice to owners and opportunity to be heard. The supplemental act of 1917-chapter 646-disregards this map, substitutes definite boundaries and directs assessments upon all lands therein according to value, including improvements; all parcels to be treated alike.\n That such assessments disregard the difference in conditions, locations, and benefits, and no notice or opportunity for hearing concerning the apportionments to particular parcels is provided for. \n\n[261 U.S. 155, 162]\n\u00a0\n That plaintiff's Tibbetts Valley lands are so situated that they can never utilize any par of the sewer system, except the lower portion of the outlet sewer, and this will be possible only through costly connections not yet planned.\n That the statutes are unconstitutional, in that they provide for no notice of hearing upon apportionment of the assessments; they direct assessments of all parcels of land according to values fixed for general taxation purposes irrespective of relation to the sewer, street frontage, depth or shape; they include improvements in assessed values and thereby adjoining lots of equal size are taxed for different sums. And they are \" of such a character that there is no reasonable presumption that substantial justice generally will be done, but the probability is that the parties will be taxed disproportionately to each other and to the benefit conferred,' so that such legislative action is 'palpably arbitrary or a plain abuse.\"\n Myles Salt Co., Ltd., v.

Co. v. Road Improvement District No. 6, \n256 U.S. 658\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 604, are cited and relied upon; but we think it clearly appears, upon examination of those cases in connection with Wagner v. Baltimore, \n239 \nU.S. 207, 217\n, 218 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 66, Houck v. Little River District, \n239 \nU.S. 254, 262\n, 265 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 58, and Miller & Lux v. Sacramento Drainage District, \n256 U.S. 129\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 404, that the allegations of the complaint are insufficient to bring this cause within the doctrine which plaintiff invokes.\n The courts below have upheld that assessment under the Constitution and laws of the state. We are concerned only with application of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n In Houck v. Little River District, the owners of a large area sought to enjoin collection of a tax of 25 cents per acre levied generally upon lands in \n\n[261 U.S. 155, 163]\n\u00a0\n the district to pay preliminary expenses. They alleged that the lands varied greatly in value and that no benefits would accrue to theirs, some of which would be condemned and others damaged. The judgment of the state courts sustaining a demurrer to the petition was affirmed here. Speaking through Mr. Justice Hughes, this court declared:\n'In view of the nature of this enterprise it is obvious that, so far as the federal Constitution is concerned, the state might have defrayed the entire expense out of state funds raised by general taxation or it could have apportioned the burden among the counties in which the lands were situated and the improvements were to be made. County of Mobile v. Kimball, \n102 \nU.S. 691, 703\n, 704 S.. It was equally within the power of the state to create tax districts to meet the authorized outlays. ... And with respect to districts thus formed, whether by the Legislature directly or in an appropriate proceeding under its authority, the Legislature may itself fix the basis of taxation or assessment, that is, it may define the apportionment of the burden, and its action cannot be assailed under the Fourteenth Amendment unless it is palpably arbitrary and a plain abuse. ...\n\n'When local improvements may be deemed to result in special benefits, a further classification may be made and special assessments imposed accordingly, but even in such case there is no requirement of the federal Constitution that for every payment there must be an equal benefit. The state in its discretion may lay such assessments in proportion to position, frontage, area, market value, or to benefits estimated by commissioners.'\n\n In Miller & Lux v. Sacramento Drainage District, supra, we said:\n'Since Houck v. Little River Drainage District (1915) \n239 U.S. 254\n, the doctrine has been definitely settled that in the absence of flagrant abuse or purely arbitrary action a state may establish drainage districts \n\n[261 U.S. 155, 164]\n\u00a0\n and tax lands therein for local improvements, and that none of such lands may escape liability solely because they will not receive direct benefits.'\n\n Myles Salt Co., Ltd., v. Board of Commissioners, Gast Realty & Investment Co. v. Schneider Granite Co., and Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Road Improvement District No. 6, supra, present facts deemed sufficient to show action 'palpably arbitrary and a plain abuse' of power. Here the allegations make out no such situation. All lands within the district ultimately may be connected with some portion of the sewer and we cannot say they derive no benefits therefrom or that any were included arbitrarily of for improper purposed.\n It was unnecessary for the Legislature to give notice and grant hearings to owners before fixing the boundaries of the district so as to include their lands, and prescribing the method of taxation. And it is unimportant that the sewer had been completed before the boundaries of the present district were established. Wagner v. Baltimore, supra.\n The state courts held that, as the rolls of local assessors are adopted for taxing property within the district, the right of owners to be heard as to values is adequately protected; and we think that under the circumstances they can demand no more.\n The judgment of the court below is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","214":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVANDENBURGH v.

The patent is for a reinforcing bar to be used in concrete construction.\n The patent, since reissue, has been the subject of litigation in the Second, Third, and Sixth circuits. In all the circuits, the first and second claims of the reissue have been held void, because too broad, and because secured nine years after the original issue, for the purpose of covering intervening devices. In the Second circuit, Judge Hough, sitting on the District Court, found that claim 3 must be so narrowly construed that defendant's device did not infringe. The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the third claim and found infringement, reversing the District Court's decree, and sent the case back for assessment of profits, which have been found to be about $15,000.

The Circuit Court of Appeals (277 Fed. 345) affirmed the action of the District Court on the ground that, if valid, claim No. 3 must be so narrowly construed that the defendant did not infringe.\n The drawings accompanying the specifications of the patent are the same in the reissue and appear below:\n The specifications say:\n'The invention has for an object to provide a reinforcing bar with one or more spirally disposed coils secured to \n\n[261 U.S. 6, 8]\n\u00a0\n the bar, so as to provide an extended area of contact adapted to resist strain longitudinally and laterally of the bar and to form a tr  within the body of concrete or other plaster material which provides the maximum of supporting strength in the arch or surface to be formed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Other and further objects and advantages of the invention will be hereinafter set forth, and the novel features thereof defined by the appended claims. \n\n[261 U.S. 6, 9]\n\u00a0\n 'In the drawings, Figure 1 is a vertical section showing the bar applied to supporting girders or beams. Figure 2 is an enlarged vertical section on the line 2-2, Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is a detailed perspective of the primary and secondary coils shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 4 is a similar view of a modified form using one coil. Fig. 5 is a detailed plan of the form shown in Fig. 3, and Fig. 6 is an elevation of the two meshing coils used for girder and column construction.\n\n'The bar may be provided with a primary coil 6, extending in one direction, as shown in Fig. 4, which is sufficient in light construction; but when a heavier construction is to be used a secondary coil 7 is provided, which extends in the opposite direction to the coil 6 and through the same, so as to cross beneath the coil 6 at a point directly above the bar, thus providing a construction in which all lateral pull or strain of the coil is avoided, owing to the equalization thereof by the oppositely extending coils and the tendency of the coils to move or flatten toward the face of the bar resisted. This preferred construction is shown in Figs. 1 and 3, and it is also desirable that both of the coils be deflected away from the center of the bar, as shown in Fig. 1, as the greatest supporting strain carried by the arch is at the center thereof, and this deflection therefore resists such strain and tends to draw the coils upward into a position at right angles to the bar.\n\n'As a preferred means of securing the coils to the bar I have shown a series of kerfs 8 in one face of the bar inclined away from the center of the bar toward the opposite ends thereof, and the coils are seated within these kerfs and held therein by means of the integral spurs 9, which are forced downward upon the coils when inserted and permanently retain them in position. \n\n[261 U.S. 6, 10]\n\u00a0\n 'In Fig. 6 a modified application of the invention is shown where two of the bars are disposed parallel to each other, with their coils intermeshing, for use in column or girder construction, wherein such a construction provides the maximum of strength with the minimum of weight in the reinforcing material.\n\n'In the operation of the invention it will be seen that the bar supporting the coil resists any movement thereof longitudinally of the bar and provides the necessary strength upon which the truss structure formed by the coils is carried.'\n\n The first four claims of the original patent were as follows:\n\n 1. \nIn a reinforcing bar, a spiral coil rigidly secured thereto at two points in each convolution thereof and extended beyond and free of said bar at the opposite side therefrom to the securing point.\n\n 2. \nIn a reinforcing bar, a spiral coil rigidly secured thereto at two points in each eonvolution thereof and extended beyond and free of said bar at the opposite side therefrom to the securing point, said coils being deflected in opposite directions from the center of the bar toward the ends thereof.\n\n 3. \nA reinforcing bar provided upon one end with a series of kerfs each having an integral overlapping spur, and a coil disposed in said kerfs, each convolution thereof being retained beneath one of said spurs.\n\n 4. \nA reinforcing bar provided upon one edge with a series of kerfs disposed diagonally to the length of the bar each having an overlapping integral spur projected toward the center of the bar, and a coil disposed in said kerfs and retained beneath said spurs.\n The first and second claims of the reissued patent were as follows:\n\n 1. \nA concrete reinforcing consisting of a bar having a plurality of integral spurs, and a spiral coil permanently \n\n[261 U.S. 6, 11]\n\u00a0\n secured thereto by having the spurs bent down on th several coils, the coils extending beyond and free of the bar at the opposite side therefrom to the securing point.\n\n 2. \nA concrete reinforcing consisting of a bar having integral means to secure a coil thereto, and a spiral coil permanently secured to the bar in each convolution and extended beyond and free of said bar at the opposite side therfrom to the securing point.\n The third and fifth claims of the reissue patent were the same as the third and fourth of the original.\n The defendant makes and sells a collapsible spiral, or cylindrical helix, used in strengthening concrete columns or pillars. It consists of a cylindrical spiral of steel wire fitted to two T-bars or spacers. Each convolution of the spiral engages the leg or outside edge of the T-spacers at regular intervals. The engagement is loose-fitting, so that this construction, which is normally stovepipeshaped, can be made flat for shipment by moving the metal rods or spacers longitudinally in opposite directions. The method by which the spiral is attached to the spacer bar is a rectangular notch in the edge of the T-bar with one or both corners peened or hammered down so as to retain and loosely hold the spiral. This is said to infringe the claims of plaintiff's reissued patents Nos. 1 and 2 and also claims 3 and 5, which were in the reissue as in the original patent, except that in claim 3 the word 'end' was changed to 'edge' to correct an obvious error.\n ...\n Messrs. O. Ellery Edwards, of New York City, and Carlos P. Griffin, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Mr. W. F. Guthrie, of Youngstown, Ohio, for Truscon Steel Co.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The expansion and improvement of the art of reinforcing concrete began several decades ago. There were two \n\n[261 U.S. 6, 12]\n\u00a0\n different needs, one was for strengthening concrete beams, and the other for strengthening concrete columns. The term 'reinforcing bar' is usually applied in the art to a rod or bar used to reinforce a concrete beam against the tension longitudinal of the beam itself. The concrete itself has great power of resisting compression, but it has not tensile strength, and its weakness manifests itself in cracking along the lower half of the beam. A steel bar placed below the middle of the beam furnishes the useful tensile resistance. But it was found that certain diagonal cracks developed in the beam toward the respective ends of the beam, and it was sought to prevent these by minor auxiliary rods attached to the main reinforcing bar. This was the field which Vandenburgh entered and devised an arrangement, shown in Figure 1 of his drawings, of a reinforcing bar imbedded in the lower part of the beam with transverse loops or spirals, part on one side of the center of the bar and part on the other and fitted rigidly into the bar so that those on each side leaned at an angle away from the center and in an opposite inclination from those on the other. In strong construction, these spiral loops were doubled by a second spiral which meshed with the first. Now, as the specifications show, this arrangement of the bar and opposing spirals was to apply the truss principle to the strengthening of the beam, and to give it the tensional resistance along the lower part of the beam and against the diagonal tensions near the ends of the beam. No one can read the specifications and examine the drawings without perceiving that this was the gist of the Vandenburgh invention. Reference is made to the use of the plan for column construction, but the only use of it for that purpose is shown in Figure 6, which discloses two upright reinforcing bars with their spirals meshing, but connected in no other way.\n The truss formation was not especially adapted to the needs and strains of the concrete column. The history of \n\n[261 U.S. 6, 13]\n\u00a0\n that field in the art shows that one of the pioneers was a Frenchman named Considere, who some years before the plaintiff's patent had shown that the tendency of concrete in a column was to expand outwardly under the vertical pressure to which it was chiefly exposed and the best way of reinforcing columns was by pouring the liquid concrete into a hooping made of a series of independent hoops, or into a continuous helicoidal spiral or cylindrical helix of a steel wire or rod, of a stovepipe form. After him, column hooping became common in the art as the only practical method of column reinforcing and the convolutions of the spiral were spaced and supported by steel uprights with which they engaged in various ways. In one French patent the convolutions were tied with steel wire to the spacers. It is the form of this engagement between the uprights and the spirals which is the crux of the present suit.\n The preferred form of Vandenburgh for the engagement between his reinforcing bar and the spiral loops of his truss arrangement is by a kerf or cut in the edge of bar, inclined away from its center, in which the coil rod is placed, and held therein by an integral spur forced downward upon the coil when inserted, which permanently retains it in position. The defendant has a rectangular cut in the edge of the T-spacer or upright and retains the spiral rod in it by peening or hammering down the edges of the cut, so as to keep the rod from slipping out, but leaving play enough to permit the collapsing of the spiral and shipment in its collapsed form. Others had adopted a similar form of engagement. Observing this, Vandenburgh, who had not used or exploited his original patent in any way, went back to the Patent Office and secured a reissue in which he was permitted to broaden his first and second claims with respect to the kerfs and spurs, so as to change the word 'rigidly,' used in the original claim, to 'permanently.' Having done this, he \n\n[261 U.S. 6, 14]\n\u00a0\n proceeded to sue in the Second, Third, and Sixth circuits persons using what he insisted were equivalents of his form of engagement in their column hooping reinforcement of concrete columns. All the courts, and there are six of them, have held these changed claims of the reissued patent to be void, and to give him no right to claim infringement in the collapsible feature of the column hooping. The original specifications leave no doubt that the patentee used the word 'rigidly' deliberately and properly, because his truss, as he portrayed it, required rigid connection between the spiral loops and the main reinforcing bar. His making his form of engagement loose was an afterthought, to catch makers who had not been advised in his specifications that there was anything collapsible in his truss formation. The reissue as to the first two claims was in the teeth of the admonitions of this court, speaking though Mr. Justice Bradley in Miller v. Brass Co., \n104 U.S. 350\n. They are therefore void.\n Counsel for the patentee say now that the collapsible feature was only an incidental matter, and that what they now rely on is the combination under claims 3 and 5 of the reinforcing bar provided upon one edge with a series of kerfs, each having an integral overlapping spur and a coil convolution thereof being beneath one of the spurs. We do not think the respondent has this combination. We think the patentee's combination must be limited to a spiral with one bar in the truss formation, or at least one in which the spiral is free at one end and has no second support or spacer such as respondent uses. Patentee relies on Fig. 4 of his drawing, and says that to add another spacer or bar is only the work of a mechanic; but he cannot properly say so, because Fig. 4 is only a detail of Fig. 1 of the drawings, and was intended to be a lighter construction of the same beam, with the same truss combination as shown in Fig. 1. Moreover, it is \n\n[261 U.S. 6, 15]\n\u00a0\n perfectly obvious, from the description and some of the claims, that the spiral of Vandenburgh was intended to be free of all but the bar shown. This is made certain by Fig. 6, which is the only application of the device to column use shown, and in that we have two bars standing upright, each engaged with convolutions of a spiral; the loops of each spiral meshing with those of the other spiral, but free of the other bar. It is clear to us that Vandenburgh, having secured a patent for a truss form of reinforcement and finding it unworkable, for it never has been adopted in the trade or in any structure, is through reissue seeking to expand the paper combination he claims into a field in which it does not belong.\n But it is insisted that Vandenburgh was the first to introduce into the field of concrete reinforcing the kerf and integral spur to clamp the spiral rod, that this involved invention, and that claim No. 3 should be construed to secure him a reward for this. It may be true that in the field of reinforcing concrete the kerf and spur had not been used before as Vandenburgh used it, but the kerf and spur were old in the art in kindred fields. They were old in metal-working art. Exactly the equivalent is shown in sand screens for mixing the materials of concrete and in sustaining fence wires. It is difficult to differentiate the field of metal working from this art of reinforcing concrete, because the problem was only one of spacing firmly the convolutions of the metal spiral, and that was a well-known device for such a need. We do not think the principle of Potts v. Creager, \n155 U.S. 597\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 194, applies in this case. More than this, in the very field itself, there was a prior German patent of Kesserling & Moller, showing the use of the kerf for spacing a spiral in reinforcing concrete. It does not seem to us that it involved real invention merely to add a spur or clamp, or to peen or hammer down the edges of the kerf, so as to fix the spiral rod firmly. We find, therefore, that claims 3 and \n\n[261 U.S. 6, 16]\n\u00a0\n 5 were without merit as involving invention, and that the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","215":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWABASH R. CO. v. ELLIOTT(1923)\nNo. 225\nArgued: January 16, 1923Decided: April 9, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. Frederic D. McKenney, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. M. J. O'Donnell, of Kansas City, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On April 2, 1918, while the railroad of the Wabash Railway Company was in the possession of the United States and operated by the Director General of Railroads, Mern G. Welker, a brakeman on that railroad, was fatally injured and died in circumstances which, under the Employers' Liability Acts of Congress, probably would have made the railway company liable in damages for his \n\n[261 U.S. 457, 458]\n\u00a0\n injury and death, had the company been operating the railroad at the time. His widow became the administratrix of his estate, and as such entered into a contract with Miles Elliott, an attorney at law, under which the latter was to investigate the claim for the injury and death, compromise the same, or enforce it by suit, and have for his service 50 per cent. of all moneys received. Elliott caused a notice, addressed to the railway company and reciting the substance of the contract, to be served on one Stepp, who was the station agent of the Director General at Chillicothe, Mo. The contract was made and the notice given under a statute of Missouri ( section 691, R. S. 1919), which provides that such a contract shall, after the service of notice, give the attorney a lien on the claim and the proceeds for his portion or percentage, and that--\n'Any defendant or defendants, or proposed defendant or defendants, who shall, after notice served as herein provided, in any manner, settle any claim, suit, cause of action, or action at law with such attorney's client, before or after litigation instituted thereon, without first procuring the written consent of such attorney, shall be liable to such attorney for such attorney's lien as aforesaid upon the proceeds of such settlement. ...'\n\n June 5, 1918, Elliott commenced an action by the administratrix against the railway company in the circuit court of Livingston county, Mo., to enforce the claim. Before there was any appearance by the railway company in that case, the Director General, acting through a claim agent in his employ, compromised the claim with the administratrix, paid to her $ 4,000 from the funds of the United States Railroad Administration, and received from her a written instrument acknowledging the receipt of that sum from him, and releasing him and the railway company from all claims and demands by reason of Welker's injury and death. The Director General also paid to her from the same funds the further sum of \n\n[261 U.S. 457, 459]\n\u00a0\n $162.85 to cover funeral and burial expenses. As part of the compromise and settlement, the admi istratrix and the claim agent acting for the Director General entered into a stipulation, bearing the title of the action against the railway company, reciting that the subject-matter of the action had been fully settled between the parties, and consenting that the action be dismissed at defendant's costs. This stipulation was presented and filed in the circuit court by counsel acting for the Director General. The settlement and the stipulation for a dismissal were without the consent of Elliott, and no part of the sum paid to the administratrix was paid by her to him.\n January 11, 1919, Elliott began a proceeding against the railway company in the circuit court of Livingston county, where the action of the administratrix was pending, to enforce a lien under his contract and the state statute. In his petition he set forth the matters before stated, save that, instead of recognizing the federal control and operation of the railroad, he directly charged the railway company with all that was done by the Director General and the representatives, agents, and employees of the latter, and he alleged that as part of the compromise and settlement the company promised the administratrix to pay to him, as his compensation or percentage under the contract, the same amount that was paid to her. His prayer was that his lien be enforced by awarding him a judgment against the company for that sum. In an amended petition he made the Director General a party, charged both the railway company and the Director General with what he had before charged against the company alone, and prayed judgment against both.\n Separate answers were filed, but that of the Director General need not be noticed. The company's answer set up, among other things: (1) That the federal possession, control, and operation of the railroad covered all the dates named in the petition, and there was no possession or \n\n[261 U.S. 457, 460]\n\u00a0\n operation by the company during that period; (2) that the acts charged against the company in the petition, in so far as they had any reality, were solely the acts of representatives, employees and agents of the Director General; and (3) that the suit of the administratrix and the proceeding by Elliott could not be maintained against the company, but only against the Director General. As showing the nature of the federal control and the company's freedom from liability for acts or omissions in the course of such control, the answer directed attention to and invoked the application of the acts of Congress, proclamations of the President, and orders of the Director General according to which that control was exercised.\n On the trial the court found the issues between Elliott and the railway company in favor of the former, and those between Elliott and the Director General in favor of the latter. Judgment was then entered that Elliott recover $4,162.85 from the company and nothing from the Director General. The company appealed to the Kansas City Court of Appeals and it affirmed the judgment. 208 Mo. App. 348, 234 S. W. 520. That court refused to transfer the case to the Supreme Court of the state and the latter denied a petition asking it to review the judgment on writ of certiorari. After the avenues of review within the state were thus exhausted this court granted a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Kansas City Court of Appeals to bring the case here.\n Complaint is made of several rulings, but only one need be considered. Conformably to the local practice the railway company, at the close of the evidence, requested the court to declare that there was no evidence to sustain a finding against it, and therefore the finding and judgment should be in its favor. This request was based in part on what the company claimed was the right construction and application of the congressional enactments, presidential proclamations, and orders of the Director \n\n[261 U.S. 457, 461]\n\u00a0\n General relied on in its answer. The request was refused. We think it plainly should have been granted.\n Affirmatively and without co tradiction the evidence established that at the time of Welker's injury and death, and continually until after Elliott's proceeding was begun, the company's railroad was in the exclusive possession and control of the United States and operated by the Director General of Railroads; that Welker's injury and death were not caused by any act or omission of the company, or any one in its employ; and that the company had nothing to do with the compromise and settlement with the administratrix, and did not promise to pay her attorney. The courts below apparently assumed that the claim agent who effected the compromise and settlement represented the company as well as the Director General; but the assumption was wholly inadmissible. The evidence was directly and positively to the contrary. The claim agent had been in the company's service prior to the federal control, but during that control was only in the service of the Director General. The payment to the administratrix was made by a check drawn by the Director General on funds of the United States Railroad Administration, and the receipt taken from her recited that the payment was by the Director General. Indeed, so far as appeared, the company did not know of the compromise and settlement until after Elliott's proceeding was begun. In all the evidence there were but two matters which, even if separated from the rest, could give any color to what was assumed below. One was the inclusion of the company in the release. But this was explained consistently with the other evidence by an accompanying recital that the sum received by the administratrix from the Director General was the sole consideration for the release, and by the fact that in the circumstances simple justice to the company would suggest its inclusion in the \n\n[261 U.S. 457, 462]\n\u00a0\n release. The other matter was that the claim agent signed the stipulation for a dismissal of the pending suit as attorney for the company. But this was made quite negligible by direct evidence that the claim agent had no authority to act or speak for the company and by the fact that the Director General, during whose operation the claim arose and for whom the claim agent was acting, was free to have himself substituted as a party in the company's place and to assume the defense of that suit. See Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Ault, \n256 U.S. 554\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 593\n\n\n To sustain its asserted freedom from liability in such circumstances the company relied particularly1 on section 10 of the Federal Control Act of March 21, 1918, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 3\/4j), and General Order No. 50 by the Director General of Railroads, U. S. R. R. Administration Bulletin No. 4 (Revised), p. 334. That statute and order were considered at length in Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Ault, supra, and were there construed as contemplating and intending that rights of action arising out of acts or omissions occurring in the course of the federal control of a railroad should be against the Director General and not the company owning the road. That decision was followed and applied in North Carolina R. R. Co. v. Lee, \n260 U.S. 16\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 2, 67 L. Ed. -- (October 16, 1922), and its principle was recognized in Alabama & Vicksburg Ry. Co. v. Journey, \n257 U.S. 111\n, 42 Sup. Ct. 6, and Davis, Director General, v. L. N. Dantzler Lumber Co., \n261 U.S. 280\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 349, 67 L. Ed. -- (February 26, 1923).\n Thus whatever claim the administratrix had for Welker's injury and death was against the Director General, not the company. Elliott's lien, if he had one, was on that claim. The settlement of the claim was strictly an \n\n[261 U.S. 457, 463]\n\u00a0\n act of the Director General done in the course of the federal control. No liability could attach to the company for that act consistently with the federal statute and order just cited. Whether the particular liability defined in the state statute before quoted was of such a nature that it could be applied to the Director General we need not co sider, for there was no appeal from the judgment of the circuit court in his favor. See Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Ault, \n256 U.S. 563\n et seq. 41 Sup. Ct. 593; Norfolk-Southern R. R. Co. v. Owens, \n256 U.S. 565\n, 41 Sup.

A trial before a jury was had, in which evidence was introduced by both sides, and at the close of all the evidence, the court directed a verdict for the plaintiff, and judgment followed for $12,029.50. The Wagner Company appealed from this judgment to the Supreme Court of Missouri, where it was duly assigned for hearing to Division No. 1 of that court under a provision of the Constitution of Missouri that the Supreme Court shall consist of seven judges and shall be divided into two divisions, one to consist of four judges, known as Division No. 1, a majority thereof to constitute a quorum, and its judgments as to causes and matters before it to have the force and effect of law. On January 21st, the appeal was argued before three of the judges of Division No. 1, and printed arguments were filed by both parties. Judgment was subsequently rendered by the four judges (Lyndon v. Wagner Electric Mfg. Co., 285 Mo. 77, 225 S. W. 711), the opinion being written and filed, with the concurrence of the other three judges, by Judge Woodson, of the Division. Judge Woodson had not heard the oral argument. The Wagner Company filed a motion for rehearing, and a motion to transfer the cause to the court in banc, which were denied.\n The Wagner Company then applied to this court for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the Missouri \n\n[262 U.S. 226, 229]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court, which was denied in April, 1921. Wagner v. Lyndon, \n256 U.S. 690\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 449. Thereafter, on a mandate from the Supreme Court of Missouri, the state circuit court issued execution against the Wagner Company on the judgment. The sheriff made a levy on the real property of the Wagner Company, which filed a bill in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, against Lyndon and the sheriff, seeking an injunction against their proceeding with the execution. Application for a preliminary injunction on this bill was denied by the District Court. The Wagner Company then paid the judgment and costs, amounting to $15,015.29, to the sheriff, and at once brought the present bill in the United States District Court against Lyndon and the sheriff, seeking to hold the sheriff as trustee in his custody of the fund, and to enjoin him from paying the money to Lyndon, and Lyndon from receiving it. The jurisdiction was asserted on the ground that the case was one arising under the Constitution of the United States. The District Court heard the case and dismissed the bill. The Wagner Company then appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed the decree of the District Court. 282 Fed. 219.\n The grounds urged in behalf of the relief sought in the District Court, the Circuit Court of Appeals, and this court were, first, that the action of the circuit court of St. Louis, in directing a verdict for plaintiff without evidence to warrant such action, deprived the defendant, the Wagner Company, of its property without due process of law and denied it the equal protection of the laws; second, that the action of Division No. 1 of the Missouri Supreme Court in hearing the case on appeal with three judges and allowing a fourth, who did not hear the oral argument, to take part in the decision and write the opinion, and the refusal of Division No. 1 of the Supreme Court of Missouri to transfer the cause to be heard by \n\n[262 U.S. 226, 230]\n\u00a0\n the Supreme Court in banc, as required by the law of Missouri when a federal question is involved, deprived the Wagner Company of its property without due process of law and denied it the equal protection of the laws.\n Defendant Lyndon moved to dismiss the complaint because the court was without jurisdiction, there being no substantial federal question, and because the bill sought an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court contrary to section 265 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1242). The District Court dismissed the bill on the first ground. No other questions were presented to the District Court. The only appeal from its decision allowed by law was therefore to this court under section 238 (Comp. St.  1215), on the ground that the sole issues involved were those involving the application or construction of the Constitution or the jurisdiction of the District Court.

Such a case could not be taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and, except for legislation enacted by Congress September 14, 1922, it would have been the duty of that court to dismiss it for want of jurisdiction. Except for that legislation, it would now be our duty to reverse the decree of that court, with direction to dismiss the appeal. The Asses ors v. Osborne, 9 Wall. 567, 575; Mansfield, etc., R. R.

Ct. 309.\n The legislation of September 14, 1922, referred to (42 Stat. 837, c. 305), provides that, if an appeal or writ of error has been or shall be taken to, or issued out of, any \n\n[262 U.S. 226, 231]\n\u00a0\n Circuit Court of Appeals in a case wherein such appeal or writ of error should have been taken to, or issued out of, the Supreme Court, such appeal or writ of error shall not for such reason be dismissed, but shall be transferred to the proper court, where it shall be disposed of as if the appeal or writ of error had been properly taken.\n The decree of affirmance in the Circuit Court of Appeals was entered on July 7, 1922, but a petition for rehearing was filed, and that petition was not denied until September 18, 1922, or four days after the passage of the foregoing act. Before the decree of affirmance became finally the act of the Circuit Court of Appeals, this law came into force, and, however that may be, it is in force now to govern us in the direction which we, in reversing the decree of affirmance, should give to that court. That direction should be to transfer the case to this court, to which it should have been brought by direct appeal from the District Court, under section 238 of the Judicial Code.\n The case is here on appeal allowed by a judge of the Circuit Court of Appeals. The case has been submitted to us on the motion to dismiss or affirm, which is a hearing on the merits. All parties have filed briefs. Is it necessary for us to go through the idle form of remanding it to the Circuit Court of Appeals, to enable that court to transfer it back to us for a second consideration? Certainly such unnecessary consumption of time and labor is not in the spirit of the Act of September 14, 1922. Having the case here, and having heard it on the merits, we think we may properly consider that done which ought to have been done, treat the case as here by appeal from the District Court, and dispose of it, as we would do if the Circuit Court of Appeals had formally transferred it to us.\n The only grounds urged by the appellant for a reversal of the decree dismissing the bill of complaint are frivolous and without merit. The first involves the proposition that in a collateral attack upon the validity of a judgment \n\n[262 U.S. 226, 232]\n\u00a0\n in a state court, a federal court can examine the evidence to see whether a direction by the court to a jury to find a verdict was justified by the evidence. This would be to make such an attack serve the purpose of a writ of error. More than this, even if it were held that the direction deprived the defendant of the right of trial by jury (a holding shown to be erroneous by Treat Manufacturing Co. v. Standard Co., \n157 U.S. 674\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 718), still the deprivation of a right of trial by jury in a state court does not deny the parties due process of law under the federal Constitution (Walker v. Sauvinet, \n92 U.S. 90\n; Missouri v. Lewis, \n101 U.S. 22\n, 31; Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 110\n, 111 S., 29 Sup. Ct. 14; Minneapolis & St. Louis R. R. Co. v. Bombolis, \n241 \nU.S. 211, 217\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 595, L. R. A. 1917A, 86, Ann. Cas. 1916E, 505). The second ground is equally unsubstantial. The machinery for review of the judgments of courts of first instance is wholly within the control of the state Legislature- Missouri v. Lewis, \n101 U.S. 22\n, 30-and when the review by four judges is given, and an opinion is rendered by three of them, constituting the quorum, the mere fact that the fourth did not hear the oral argument, but wrote the opinion on the printed arguments, is at most an irregularity, which does not in the slightest degree affect the validity of the judgment. The contention that Wagner was entitled under the Missouri constitution to have the cause heard before a full court, because a federal question was involved, is wholly without merit, because the question of the right to transfer was a question of Missouri law, upon which we are bound to accept the decision of the Missouri courts. Missouri v. Lewis, \n101 U.S. 22\n.\n We are asked by counsel for appellees to impose a penalty on the appellant for delay. The history of the case and the conduct of the Wagner Company leave no doubt that the litigation in the federal jurisdiction and the successive appeals have been prosecuted solely for delay. Have we power to impose damages in this case?- \n\n[262 U.S. 226, 233]\n\u00a0\n Section 1010 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1671) provides as follows:\n'Sec. 1010. Where, upon a writ of error, judgment is affirmed in the Supreme Court or a Circuit Court, the court shall adjudge to the respondent in error just damages for his delay, and single or double costs, at its discretion.'\n\n Section 1012 (Comp. St.  1673) has the effect to make section 1010 applicable to appeals in equity. The second paragraph of the twenty-third rule of this court (32 Sup. Ct. xi) provides that:\n'In all cases where a writ of error shall delay the proceedings on the judgment of the inferior court and shall appear to have been sued out for delay, damages at a rate not exceeding 10 per cent. in addition to interest shall be awarded upon the amount of the judgment.'\n\n The third paragraph is:\n'The same rule shall be applied to decrees for the payment of money in cases in equity unless otherwise ordered by the court.'\n\n An objection to allowing damages in the present case suggesting itself is that the decree appealed from was not a money judgment. It is true that this whole litigation in the federal jurisdiction has been initiated and carried on solely to secure the delay of the payment of a money judgment in the state court, but that is hardly within the exact terms of the twenty-third rule. Sections 1010 and 1012, Revised Statutes, are, however, not so restrictive, and they give this court power to impose just damages upon the affirmance of any judgment or decree, for delay. Gibbs v. Diekma, 131 U. S. Appendix clxxxvi.\n The case should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, because the grounds of appeal are frivolous. In a dismissal on this ground a penalty may be imposed, just as if upon an affirmance. Deming v. Carlisle Packing Co., \n226 \nU.S. 102, 109\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 80.\n We think that damages of $1,500 for delay are not excessive in this case. We therefore direct the dismissal \n\n[262 U.S. 226, 234]\n\u00a0\n of the appeal, with damages of $1,500 and the taxation of costs as upon an affirmance of the decree of the District Court. \n\n\n\n","217":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWALKER v. GISH(1923)\nNo. 135\nArgued: Decided: January 2, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[260 U.S. 447, 448]\n\u00a0\n Mr. S. Herbert Giesy, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Genevieve K. Gish sued Ernest G. Walker in the Municipal Court of the District of Columbia for $150 for the use of a party wall on premises 2327 Ashmead Place, Washington, in that part of the District of Columbia not included in the original federal city, and recovered $144.63. Walker appealed the case to the Supreme Court of the District. That court on the first trial directed a verdict for Walker, the defendant, on the ground that he had not used the wall. On appeal, the Court of Appeals of the District (48 App. D. C. 42) reversed the judgment because the question whether the defendant used the wall was a disputable fact which should have been submitted to the jury. On the second trial, the court submitted the issue to the jury which found for the plaintiff, and fixed \n\n[260 U.S. 447, 449]\n\u00a0\n the value of the use at $85. The Court of Appeals (51 App. D. C. 4, 273 Fed. 366) affirmed the judgment, and the case comes here by writ of error on the issue of the constitutional validity of the building regulations of the District of Columbia, which by the Act of June 14, 1878, 20 Stat. 131, ch. 194, are given the effect of congressional legislation. It is urged that they deprive defendant of his property without due process of law, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The question was seasonably raised by a request for a charge on the trial and by proper assignment of error in the proceedings for review. Judicial Code,  250 (Comp. St.  1227); Smoot v. Heyl, \n227 \nU.S. 518, 522\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 336.\n The history of the law of party walls in Washington is interesting. Its application is not free from difficulty in that part of the present Washington which was not included within the original federal city. The original proprietors of the land in the federal city conveyed it in trust to certain named persons to be laid out in such streets, squares and lots as the President of the United States should approve. Under the trust provisions, the lots to be sold or distributed were to be subject to such terms and conditions as might be thought reasonable by the President for regulating the materials and manner of the buildings and improvements. President Washington issued regulations, one of which is in force to-day. The provided that a person appointed to superintend buildings might enter on the land of any person to set out the foundation and regulate the walls to be built between party and party, as to the breadth and thickness thereof, that the foundations were to be laid equally upon each lot and to be of the breadth and thickness thought proper by the superintendent, that the first builder was to be reimbursed one-half of the cost of the wall, or as much thereof as the next builder might use, but that such use could not begin till he had paid the amount fixed by the superintendent. This has been held to be a condition \n\n[260 U.S. 447, 450]\n\u00a0\n annexed to every house lot in the original Washington. Miller v. Elliot, 5 Cranch, C. C. 543, 17 Fed. Cas. 315, No. 9,568. It has been decided to be the only source of the right of a lot owner in Washington to put his party wall on his neighbor's land. Fowler v. Saks, 7 Mackey, 570, 579, 7 L. R. A. 649.\n By the Act of Congress of 1878, supra, the District Commissioner were authorized to establish building regulations which should have the force of law; but the regulation of General Washington was continued in force by them and applied not only to the federal city, but to the whole of Washington. The question then arose what was the effect of this regulation as applied to the outlying districts of the city which were not included in the lots of the federal city, and which were not affected by the grant upon condition by the original owners of that city. This question was fully considered in the case of Fowler v. Koehler, 43 App. D. C. 349, Ann. Cas. 1916E, 1161, which was a suit like the one at bar for the value of appropriated use of a party wall in the newer part of the city. The Court of Appeals of the District held that, because party walls had in thousands of instances been erected by one of the adjoining owners on the lot of the other in the belief of both that it was the exercise of a lawful right as in the original city, a custom had grown up. So general was this that the court felt justified when erection of a party wall by one owner was without objection by the other, in implying an agreement which would rebut inference of a trespass. Thus there had developed a practical uniformity as to practice in respect of party walls and the law governing them between the lots in the federal city and those outside, except where, in the outlying district, the adjoining owner objected to the erection of the wall at the time of the construction and took measures to prevent it. The court in Fowler v. Koehler further held that where party walls were erected in the outside district under such implied agreements, the same obligation to \n\n[260 U.S. 447, 451]\n\u00a0\n contribute to the cost of the wall arose in the outlying district as against the adjoining owners as in the federal city if they used the party wall, and that the relations between the parties were regulated by the District building regulations.\n We think the reasoning of the court in Fowler v. Koehler sustains its conclusion, and that the Conclusion helps to the solution of an unfortunately difficult matter of much importance. The status of party wall in the case at bar is thus established. There is no evidence of the circumstances under which the party wall was erected and we must presume that it was done by the predecessor in title of the plaintiff below with the consent of a grantor of the defendant below.\n Plaintiff in error says that even if this be true, the effect of the District regulations is equivalent to a statute and deprives him of his property without due process of law. The effect of sections 74 and 56 of those regulations is, shortly stated, this: One of the two adjoining owners may build a two-story house and a party wall 9 inches thick, occupying 4 1\/2 inches of his neighbor's land. If, thereafter, his neighbor wishes to build a house of three stories, that neighbor is required to have his wall 13 inches thick. He can take down the existing party wall, but he can occupy only 4 1\/2 inches of the other's lot, and must pay all the expenses of the change, including the damage done to the owner of the two-story house, so that his party wall will be 8 1\/2 inches on his own land, while he uses but 4 1\/2 inches of his neighbor's. Or he can build a 9-inch wall against the two-story wall, and widen his wall to 13 inches when it reaches the third story, resting on 4 1\/2 inches of the original party wall on his own land. He thus is compelled to occupy with his wall 13 inches of his own lot, and let his neighbor have 4 1\/2 inches of his land without corresponding advantage.\n Counsel for plaintiff in error urges that the fundamental idea in the \n\n[260 U.S. 447, 452]\n\u00a0\n institution of party walls is mutual benefit (Smoot v. Heyl, \n227 \nU.S. 518, 523\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 336), which implies equality of easement of support and of occupation of land between the neighbors, and that to give to the builder of the first wall such great advantage over his neighbors as these regulations give him deprives his neighbor of property without due process of law.\n The questions thus raised might justify discussion if the plaintiff in error were in a position to urge them, and had not used the original party wall of which he complains. His contention below was that he had not used the wall of his neighbor, that he had built a new wall at the side of the original party wall as high as the original wall and then had widened it to 13 inches so as to extend over the original wall without resting on it. The jury found against him on this issue. If he did use the original wall, then he must pay for the value of the use. Fowler v. Saks, 7 Mackey, 570, 581, 7 L. R. A. 649; Fowler v. Koehler, 43 App. D. C. 349, 360, Ann. Cas. 1916E, 1161. In using it, he waived the right to object to the regulations with which he complied without objection, until he was called upon to pay his share of that which he had taken and used.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","218":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWATKINS v. SEDBERRY(1923)\nNo. 248\nArgued: January 19, 1923Decided: April 9, 1923\n\n\n\n\n\n[261 U.S. 571, 572]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. C. Calhoun, of Washington, D. C., and Clarence T. Boyd, of Nashville, Tenn., for petitioners.\n Mr. Norman Farrell, of Nashville, Tenn., for respondents. \n\n[261 U.S. 571, 573]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves fees and expenses of an attorney for a trustee in bankruptcy. Claims therefor are made on a written contract between the trustee and the attorney, Jordan Stokes, Jr. \n1\n The amount claimed for fees is about $49,0002 and for expenses $1,127.28. The debts, existing at the time of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy and since proved and allowed, amount to $21,000 with interest. The services were rendered in the prosecution of a suit brought by the trustee in the state chancery court against the respondents, the bankrupt and his family, to recover a farm and personal property thereon. The suit was successful, and the value of the property is $99,743.01. After the recovery of that judgment, the respondents petitioned in the bankruptcy case for an order, fixing the amount of indebtedness of the bankrupt, as finally allowed, and the expenses of administration, including a reasonable fee for the attorney of the trustee, to the end that all debts and expenses might be fully paid out of money raised by mortgage of the land so recovered, and that the bankruptcy proceedings be dismissed. After hearing the referee decided that the trustee had no authority to contract in advance for the amount to be paid for legal services, and that the attorney be allowed a fee of $10, 000 and $750 for expenses, and that both items be paid out of the property so recovered. The petitioners nad respondents \n\n[261 U.S. 571, 574]\n\u00a0\n both petitioned for review. The District Court held that the contract was invalid; allowed a fee of $7,500 and $750 expenses, and directed that these sums be paid as a part of the expenses of administration of the bankrupt estate before return of surplus to respondents. Both sides petitioned to revise and also appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court (275 Fed. 894) dismissed the appeals and dealt only with the petitions to revise. It held that the attorney's fee should be paid out of the debts-i. e., should be borne by the creditors-and not out of the surplus remaining after the payment of debts in full. The award of the District Judge of $7,500 attorney's fees was vacated, on the ground that the amount of the recovery in the chancery court, which was deemed a material element t be considered in fixing the fee, was in the lower court erroneously taken to be $29,000, instead of $21,500, and the District Judge was left at liberty to use his discretion in again fixing the amount, 'with due regard to the modified character of the recovery, and the change of the source from which payment must be made.'\n The validity of the contract between the trustee and attorney is first to be considered. The bankrupt filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy August 24, 1917. He scheduled unsecured debts amounting to $18, 260. Many years before any of these debts were contracted, he purchased a farm and caused the deed to be made to his wife as 'trustee' for the use and benefit of herself, her husband and their children; on the advice of counsel, he did not schedule it; and he did not schedule any property applicable to the payment of such debts. The trustee made a preliminary investigation and caused the bankrupt and his family to be examined. The attorney, Mr. Stokes, who had for collection two of the largest claims against the bankrupt, acted for the trustee in these matters. On October 24, 1917, the trustee and attorney made the contract; the attorney agreed to institute such suits as might \n\n[261 U.S. 571, 575]\n\u00a0\n be necessary and proceed generally to recover property that he might be able to locate belonging to the bankrupt; he agreed to bear the necessary expenses and to indemnify the trustee against all damages and expenses growing out of his employment; it was provided that any property recovered should be first chargeable with the amounts that the attorney expended in prosecuting the claims and that the balance should be divided equally between the trustee and the attorney. The contract was made without notice to or the authority of the creditors, and without the knowledge of the respondents. On the same day, the trustee presented a petition to the referee, showing that the bankrupt scheduled no property and that none had come to the trustee; that after investigation he believed that a large amount might be recovered for the creditors, and that the attorney was willing to bear all expenses and undertake the matter. The referee made an order authorizing the trustee to enter into a contract of employment with the attorney 'on a contingent basis,' and providing that the attorney should be personally responsible for and pay all expenses incurred in the prosecution of any suits. Neither the petition nor the order disclosed what proportion of the property was agreed to be given to the attorney for his services. The probable value of the property proposed to be recovered was not shown. The amount or kind of professional services required could not be known in advance. The amount of attorney's fees to be charged against the estate as an expense of administration is subject to the examination and approval of the court. Section 62a, Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9646); In re Stotts (D. C.) 93 Fed. 438, 439; W. J. Davidson v. Friedman, 140 Fed. 853, 72 C. C. A. 553; Page v. Rogers, 149 Fed. 194, 195, 79 C. C. A. 153. The trustee was not authorized so to dispose of property of the estate. The amount claimed under the contract is grossly excessive. The contract is invalid.\n The attorney claims compensation on quantum meruit, if recovery under the contract is denied. The respondents \n\n[261 U.S. 571, 576]\n\u00a0\n contend that the contract is champertous and that the attorney is not entitled to any compensation.\n The essential provisions of the contract have been stated. There is no ground for the claim that the attorney had an interest in the proposed litigation that would make it proper for him to pay the expenses of the suit and indemnify the trustee. It is true, as contended by the petitioners, that the severity of the old rule of the English common law against champerty, regarding it as an offense malum in se, has been somewhat relaxed. Burnes v. Scott, \n117 \nU.S. 582, 589\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 865; Roberts v. Cooper, 20 How. 467, 484; Byrne v. Kansas City, etc., Railroad (C. .) 55 Fed. 44, 47; Courtright v. Burnes ( C. C.) 13 Fed. 317, 320.\n No statute of Tennessee authorizes such a contract. Chapter 66, Acts of 1821 (Shannon's Code,  3171-3184), denounced champerty and required the dismissal of suits, whenever it was made to appear they were prosecuted pursuant to champertous arrangements. Heaton v. Dennis, 103 Tenn. 155, 160, 52 S. W. 175; Robertson v. Cayard, 111 Tenn. 356, 367, 77 S. W. 1056; Staub v. Sewanee Coal Co., 140 Tenn. 505, 508, 205 S. W. 320. By chapter 173, Acts of 1899, this requirement was eliminated; but no decision of the Supreme Court of that state has been called to our attention which would sustain this contract. It is champertous under the rule generally prevailing in this country. Peck v. Heurich, \n167 \nU.S. 624, 630\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 927, and cases there cited; Jones v.

Devenney, 72 Kan. 471, 83 Pac. 1097\n\n\n As to the attorney's right to compensation on quantum meruit: It was the duty of the trustee to employ counsel to bring suit to recover the property belonging to the bankrupt. The fact that the contract between him and his attorney was champertous, even if its terms had been known, could not have been interposed by respondents to \n\n[261 U.S. 571, 577]\n\u00a0\n defeat the trustee's suit. Burnes v. Scott, supra; Staub v. Sewanee Coal Co., supra, 140 Tenn. 509, 205 S. W. 320; Robertson v. Cayard, supra, 111 Tenn. 365, 77 S. W. 1056; Boone v. Chiles, 10 Pet. 177, 219. They should have handed over the property to the trustee without suit because, as it was adjudged in that case, the bankrupt was the real owner. After judgment went against them in the chancery court, they petitioned the bankruptcy court to fix a reasonable fee for the trustee's attorney. They did not then know of the existence of the contract, and, while they may successfully oppose payment of the amount therein provided for, they have no standing now to object to a reasonable fee. The attorney rendered valuable services in the prosecution of a proper and legitimate suit. Through his efforts there was recovered more than enough to pay expenses and debts in full. The trustee joins the attorney in asking that a reasonable fee be allowed. The making of the contract was not malum in se. The attorney's right to fair and reasonable compensation is not forfeited.

Lowe, 1 Ala. 246, 248. The respondents cite cases which hold that champerty defeats the attorney's right to recover on quantum meruit,3 but we think that they are not applicable to the facts of this case hereinbefore stated. The District Court held that the attorney's fee should be paid out of the surplus as an expense of administration. It was decided that the suit was not brought under or to enforce the right conferred by the Tennessee stat utes (Shannon's Code,  6097, 6099),4 but was prosecuted under the provisions of section 70 of the Bankruptcy Act, and especially under subsection a (4)5 and (5) being Comp. St.  9654, and that under these provisions the trustee was entitled to recover the entire property for the purpose of administration in the bankruptcy court as general assets of the estate, citing Globe Bank v. Martin, \n236 \nU.S. 288, 304\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 377; Bunch v. Smith, 116 Tenn. 201, 216, 93 S. W. 80. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the payment should be made out of the amount of debts, and thus be borne by the creditors. Its ecision went upon the ground that under the laws of Tennessee- \n\n[261 U.S. 571, 578]\n\u00a0\n (Shannon's Code,  6097, 6099) where a conveyance is set aside as fraudulent to creditors, counsel fees must be paid out of the debts recovered and cannot be charged against the surplus; that the suit was brought under sections 67e6 and 70e of the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9651, 9654), \n\n[261 U.S. 571, 579]\n\u00a0\n conferring upon the trustee the rights of creditors under the state statute, and that where a bankrupt fraudulently conveys property more than four months before bankruptcy, the attorney's fee must be paid out of the debts recovered, and cannot be charged against the surplus, and held the recovery of the trustee in the chancery court so limited.\n That ruling cannot be sustained. The final decree in the suit in the chancery court adjudged and determined that the real title to the land and personal property thereon was and had been in the bankrupt from January 1, 1902, and that upon his bankruptcy it vested in the trustee. It is urged that the decree should be read in the light of the purposes of the suit and the laws of Tennessee, and should be deemed to be a judgment only for the amount of the debts. The purposes of the suit are disclosed by the complaint which, among other things, alleged that on January 1, 1902, the bankrupt procured a conveyance of the farm to be made by one Zellner to the bankrupt's wife, 'Z. C. Sedberry, Trustee'; that there is a provision in the deed to the effect that she was to hold the land for the use and benefit of herself, her husband and their children; that she did not pay any part of the purchase price; that the bankrupt at all times was the owner thereof; that the wife and children were made parties in order to remove all clouds from the title; and the complaint, among other things, prayed judgment \n\n[261 U.S. 571, 580]\n\u00a0\n that the trustee be declared the owner of the property. At the time of the entry of judgment granting relief as prayed, it was stipulated that none of the parties would prosecute an appeal or seek any revision of it. The decree following the allegations and prayer vested in the trustee the property in question, and he holds it for the purposes of administration of the bankrupt estate. It is true that it was alleged that the bankrupt procured the farm to be conveyed on January 1, 1902, to his wife as trustee for the purpose of defrauding his existing and subsequent creditors, and that the complaint contains allegations that would be suitable in an action by creditors to set aside a fraudulent conveyance under the state statute, but these constitute no ground for cutting down the terms of the decree of for limiting the recovery to the amount of the debts, leaving the creditors to pay the attorney's fee for services made necessary by the respondent's failure to turn over to the trustee the property of the bankrupt. The value of the property affected by the decree being in excess of the amount required, the recovery must be deemed to be sufficient to pay all expenses, including a reasonable attorney's fee and the debts in full.\n The evidence is sufficient to support the allowance made in the District Court of $7,500 as reasonable compensation for the services of the attorney for the trustee. The debts, plus the attorney's fee and expenses, amount to $29,000, and, in fixing the attorney's fee, that amount is properly to be regarded as the recovery in the chancery suit.\n The attorney claims $1,127.28 for expenses. The referee held that the statement was not properly itemized, and allowed $750 as a lump sum and gave him opportunity, if unwilling to accept that amount, to furnish a statement properly setting forth the claim in detail. No further statement of the claim was made. The attorney \n\n[261 U.S. 571, 581]\n\u00a0\n failed to establish his right to any greater sum on account of expenses.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and that of the District Court affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The attorneys interested are the petitioners, Jordan Stokes, Jr., oseph R. West, and R. H. Crockett. The contract of employment was between the trustee and Stokes. As authorized by the contract, Stokes employed West and Crockett as assistants. There is no matter here in dispute between the attorneys. The word 'attorney' is used in the opinion to include all the petitioners, other than Watkins, the trustee. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] All figures stated in the opinion are approximate and intended only to identify the sum involved, not to fix it. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Roller v.

O'Brien and Inouye desire to enter into a cropping contract covering the planting, cultivating, \n\n[263 U.S. 313, 321]\n\u00a0\n and harvesting of crops to be grown on the land. They allege that the execution of such a contract is necessary, in order that the owner may receive the largest return from the land, and that the alien may receive compensation therefrom; that the Attorney General and district attorney have threatened to and will enforce the act against them if they execute the contract, and will forfeit or attempt to forfeit the land by an escheat proceeding, and will prosecute them criminally for violating the act. They aver that the act is so drastic, and the penalties for its violation are so great, that neither of them may execute the contract even for the purpose of testing its validity and its application thereto, and that, unless the court shall determine the validity of the act and its application, they will be compelled to submit to it, whether valid or invalid, and to the appellants' interpretation of it, and so be deprived of their property without due process of laws and denied the equal protection of the laws in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Appellees applied for an interlocutory injunction. The matter was heard by three judges, as provided in section 266 of the Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1243). The injunction was granted, and the Attorney General and district attorney appealed.\n O'Brien, who is a citizen, has no legal right to enter into the proposed contract with Inouye, who is an ineligible Japanese alien, unless the latter is permitted by law to make and carry out such a contract. At common law, aliens, though not permitted to take land by operation of law, may take by the act of the parties; but they have no capacity to hold against the state, and the land so taken may be escheated to the state. See Fairfax's Devisee v. Hunter's Lessee, 7 Cranch. 603, 609, 619, 620; Doe ex dem. Governeur's Heirs v. Robertson, 11 Wheat. 332, 355; Phillips v.

In the absence of \n\n[263 U.S. 313, 322]\n\u00a0\n a treaty to the contrary, the state has power to deny to aliens the right to own land within its borders. Terrace et al. v. Thompson, \n263 U.S. 197\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 15, 68 L. Ed. --; Hauenstein v. Lynham, \n100 \nU.S. 483, 484\n, 488 S.; Blythe v. Hinckley, 127 Cal. 431, 59 Pac. 787, affirmed \n180 \nU.S. 333, 340\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 390; In the Matter of Okahara (decided June 28, 1923; Cal. Sup.) 216 Pac. 614. The provision of the act which limits the privilege of ineligible aliens to acquire real property or any interest therein to that prescribed by treaty is not in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment. Terrace et al. v. Thompson, supra; Porterfield v. Webb, \n263 U.S. 225\n, 44 Sup. Ct. 21, 68 L. Ed. --; In the Matter of Okahara, supra. The treaty between the United States and Japan ( 37 Stat. 1504-1509) does not confer upon the citizens or subjects of either in the territories of the other the right to acquire, possess or enjoy lands for agricultural purposes. Terrace et al. v. Thompson, supra; In the Matter of Okahara, supra.\n By the proposed cropping contract, Inouye is given the right for a term of four years to plant, cultivate and harvest crops-berries and vegetables-on the land, and to be free from interference by the owner, who undertakes to protect him during the term against interference by any other person. He is entitled to housing for himself, and is granted the right to employ others to work on the land, and to give to them free ingress and egress and the right to live on the land. He is entitled to one-half of all crops grown on the land during the term, to be divided after they are harvested and before removal from the land, and is given a reasonable time after the expiration of the term to remove his share of the crops. He is required to accept his share of the crops as reimbursement for expenditures made to carry on the farming operations, and as his only return from the undertaking. Assuming that the proposed arrangement does not amount to a leasing or to a transfer of an interest in real property, and that it includes the elements of a contract of employment (In the Matter of Okahara, supra), we are of opinion that it is more than a contract of employment, and that, if executed, it will give to \n\n[263 U.S. 313, 323]\n\u00a0\n Inouye a right to use and to have or share in the benefit of the land for agricultural purposes. And this is so, notwithstanding other clauses of the contract to the effect that the general possession of the land is reserved to the owner, that the cropper shall have no interest or estate whatever in the land, that he is given one-half of all crops grown as compensation for his services and labor, and that division of the crops is to be made after they are harvested and before their removal from the land.\n The treaty grants liberty to own or lease and occupy houses, manufactories, warehouses, and shops, and to lease land for residential and commercial purposes. \n2\n Section 2 of the act extends the privilege to acquire, possess, enjoy, and transfer real property or any interest therein only in the manner and to the extent and for the purposes prescribed in the treaty. The treaty given no permission to enjoy, use, or have the benefit of land for agricultural purposes. The privileges granted by the act are carefully limited to those prescribed in the treaty. The act as a whole evidences legislative intention that ineligible aliens shall not be permitted to have or enjoy any privilege in respect of the use or the benefit of land for agricultural purposes. And this view is supported by the circumstances and negotiations leading up to the making of the treaty. See Terrace et al. v. Thompson, supra; Same v. Same (D. C.) 274 Fed. 841, 844, 845. As applied to this case, the act may be read thus:\n'Ineligible aliens may own or lease houses, manufactories, warehouses and shops, and may lease land for residential and commercial purposes. These \n\n[263 U.S. 313, 324]\n\u00a0\n things, but no possession or enjoyment of land otherwise, are permitted.'\n\n The term of the proposed contract, the measure of control and dominion over the land which is necessarily involved in the performance of such a contract, the cropper's right to have housing for himself and to have his employees live on the land, and his obligation to accept one-half the crops as his only return for tilling the land clearly distinguish the arrangement from one of mere employment. The case differs from Truax v. Raich, \n239 U.S. 33\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 7, L. R. A. 1916D, 545, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 283. In that case, a statute of Arizona making it a criminal offense for an employer of more than five workers, regardless of kind or class of work or sex of workers, to employ less than 80 per cent. native-born citizens of the United States was held to infringe the right, secured by the Fourteenth Amendment, of a resident alien to work in a common occupation-cooking in a restaurant. The right to make and carry out cropper contracts such as that before us is not safeguarded to ineligible aliens by the Constitution. A denial of it does not deny the ordinary means of earning a livelihood or the right to work for a living. The practical result of such contract is that the cropper has use, control, and benefit of land for agricultural purposes substantially similar to that granted to a lessee. Conceivably, by the use of such contracts, the population living on and cultivating the farm lands might come to be made up largely of ineligible aliens. The allegiance of the farmers to the state directly affects its strength and safety. Terrace et al. v. Thompson, supra. We think it within the power of the state to deny to ineligible aliens the privilege so to use agricultural lands within its borders.\n The decision of the Supreme Court of California in In the Matter of Okahara, supra, a habeas corpus case, does not support the appellees' contention. In that case an ineligible Japanese was held on a warrant charging him with conspiracy to effect a transfer of real property in violation \n\n[263 U.S. 313, 325]\n\u00a0\n of section 10 of the Alien Land Law. The gravamen of the offence charged was that Okahara, in furtherance of the conspiracy, executed a contract with another, whereby the latter transferred to him for a term of five years an interest in 20 acres of agricultural land. The only question before the court in that case was whether the contract amounted to a transfer of real property or of an interest therein in violation of section 10. The court said:\n'... The instrument before us cannot be characterized as a lease or transfer of any interest in real property because it lacks many of the essential elements of a lease, while on the other hand it bears all the characteristics of an agreement of hiring. But if it cannot be said to be an agreement of employment pure and simple, it cannot under any rule of construction be held to be more than a cropping contract.'\n\n After referring to the terms of the contract and reviewing authorities, it said:\n'The argument that the law forbids the making of a contract of employment or agreement to till the soil on shares can only be sustained by adopting the theory that the particular agreement under consideration transfers an interest in land.'\n\n The court held that the contract did not violate section 10 and discharged Okahara. The contract in that case differs in important particulars from the one before us; but, in the view we take of this case, we need not determine whether, within the meaning of the act, the contract between O'Brien and Inouye, if executed, would effect a transfer of an interest in real property. The question in this case is not whether the proposed contract is prohibited by section 10, but it is whether appellees have shown that they have a right under the Constitution or treaty to make and carry out the contract, and are entitled to an interlocutory injunction against the officers of the state. A negative answer must be given.\n The privilege to make and carry out the proposed cropping contract, or to have the right to the possession, enjoyment \n\n[263 U.S. 313, 326]\n\u00a0\n and benefit of land for agricultural purposes as contemplated and provided for therein, is not given to Japanese subjects by the treaty. The act denies the privilege because not given by the treaty. No constitutional right of the alien is infringed. It therefore follows that the injunction should have been denied.\n The order appealed from is reversed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS think there is no justiciable question involved and that the case should have been dismissed on that ground.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Initiative Measure Adopted November 2, 1920 (Statutes 1921, p. lxxxiii).\n Section 1.

The superior court may remove the guardian of such an estate whenever it appears to the satisfaction of the court that facts exist which would make the guardian ineligible to appointment in the first instance.\n Section 5(a). The term 'trustee' as used in this section means any person, company, association or corporation that as guardian, trustee, attorney in fact or agent, or in any other capacity has the title, custody or control of property, or some interest therein, belonging to an ineligible alien or to the minor child of such an alien, if the property is of such a character that such alien is inhibited from acquiring, possessing, enjoying or transferring it. ...\n (b).

RAILROAD COMMISSION OF GA.(1923)\nNo. 195\nArgued: January 9, 1923Decided: February 19, 1923\n\n\n\n Messrs. Fitzgerald Hall, of Nashville, Tenn., and Henry C. Peeples, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellant.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit commenced in the District Court by the Western & Atlantic Railroad, against the Railroad Commission of Georgia, its members, its special attorney, and the Attorney General of the state, to restrain and enjoin the enforcement of an order of the commission requiring the plaintiff to construct and put in service a spur or industrial track to the Farmers' Warehouse Company's warehouse abutting the right of way of the railroad at Smyrna, Ga. A law of Georgia (section 2664 of the 1910 Georgia Code) authorizes the commission to prescribe rules with reference to spur tracks and side tracks, and \n\n[261 U.S. 264, 265]\n\u00a0\n with reference to their use and construction, and gives it power to compel service to be furnished warehouses and similar places of business along the line of railroads where practicable and in the judgment of the commission the business is sufficient to justify, and on such terms and conditions as the commission may prescribe. The plaintiff attacks the order as unreasonable and arbitrary because under the circumstances it would deprive the plaintiff of its property without due process of law in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment, interfere with and burden the interstate commerce of the plaintiff and compel it unjustly to discriminate against other shippers in violation of the Act to Regulate Commerce (Comp. St.  8563 et seq.). Before the e piration of the time allowed by the commission for compliance with its order, this suit was commenced and plaintiff gave notice of motion for temporary injunction. The defendants answered and, among other things, denied that the value of the matter in controversy is sufficient to give the court jurisdiction and averred that it does not exceed $3,000. There was a hearing before three judges, as required by section 266 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243), and the application for a temporary injunction was denied upon the sole ground that the requisite amount was not involved. This appeal calls for a review of that ruling. North Pacific S. S. Co. v. Soley, \n257 \nU.S. 216, 221\n, 42 S. Sup. Ct. 87; Gilbert v. David, \n235 \nU.S. 561, 568\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 164.\n The complaint alleges that the matter in controversy exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of $3,000, and by way of detail it is stated, among other things, that the initial cost of the construction of the side track would be $1,266.24; that the interest on the money which plaintiff would have to expend for the construction of the track, depreciation charges, necessary maintenance and operating expenses would exceed $200 a year, and that compliance with the order would hamper and delay the plaintiff in the proper \n\n[261 U.S. 264, 266]\n\u00a0\n operation of its trains and would impose upon it additional costs and expenses, but would not increase its earnings. The affadavit of the plaintiff's general manager supports the allegations of the complaint and states that the patrons of the plaintiff, including the Farmers' Warehouse Company, have adequate trackage and depot facilities, not only to take care of present business but of any probable increase at Smyrna; that the railroad line from Atlanta to Chattanooga is largely single track; that the traffic is very heavy, and that the problem of keeping trains moving promptly is serious and difficult; that, because business does not justify it, the plaintiff does not have a switch engine at Smyrna, and, if the private siding were constructed in accordance with the order of the Railroad Commission, plaintiff would have to delay its freight trains, so that the road engines could switch this additional track, thereby delaying the prompt movement of the trains, and that the track could never be used by others and would be simply an accommodation for one patron, adding nothing to the earnings of the railroad, but considerably increasing its expense. The affidavit of the plaintiff's superintendent also supports the complaint and is in substance to the same effect. Defendants' answer states that in all human probability the business of the warehouse will be permanent, and affidavits of directors of the warehouse company tend to support that statement. The denial of jurisdictional amount in defendants' answer is not supported by any affidavit in their behalf.\n The decision in the District Court states:\n'The propriety of requiring the construction of this particular track is alone in issue. The cost in material and labor is stated in the petition to be but $1,260, and this amount alone is involved. ... The cost of future maintenance is not involved now, because that is an incident of the future use. The maintenance cost for some years will be slight, and if the business done over \n\n[261 U.S. 264, 267]\n\u00a0\n the track does not justify its maintenance, the question of its abandonment will be open then.' 275 Fed. 128.\n\n We are unable to agree that the cost in material and labor is all that is involved in this case. Plaintiff seeks to be relieved, not only from constructing the side track, but also from maintaining it in suitable condition for use and, from the cost and expense of using and operating it for the movement of cars to and from the warehouse. The value of all these is involved. Glenwood Light Co. v. Mutual Light Co., \n239 \nU.S. 121, 125\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 30; Berryman v. Board of Trustees of Whitman College, \n222 U.S. 334\n, 32 Sup.

It is shown that the permanent annual burden on account of interest on such cost, depreciation, maintenance and operating expenses of such side track will exceed $200, and this capitalized at a reasonable rate exceeds $3,000. Laying aside other considerations bearing upon the matter, the amount is shown to be sufficient. This being so, the District Court should have taken jurisdiction, and should have proceeded to determine the merits of plaintiff's application for a temporary injunction, which it did not do.\n Order declining jurisdiction vacated, with directions for further proceedings. \n\n\n\n","221":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILLARD, SUTHERLAND & CO. v.

Day, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought to recover $3,650, being $3.65 per ton for 1, 000 tons of coal furnished the Navy. Appellant \n\n[262 U.S. 489, 490]\n\u00a0\n claims that it is entitled to the market price at the time of delivery, $6. 50 per ton. The United States claims that appellant was bound by contract to furnish it for $2.85 per ton. The Court of Claims made findings of fact, and concluded that appellant was not entitled to recover.\n In the spring of 1916, the Navy Department, being desirous of making contracts for coal for the ensuing fiscal year ending June 30, 1917, issued its invitation for bids in the form of a schedule containing general specifications and conditions and printed forms of proposals for deliveries in stated q antities at 10 different ports or stations. Included therein was a form of proposal for the furnishing of 600,000 tons of coal to be delivered at Hampton Roads, Va. On one of these forms, appellant submitted its bid for coal of the kind and quality described:\n'To be delivered ... at such times and in such quantities as may be required during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1917, ... 10,000 tons steaming coal ... for delivery ... Hampton Roads, Va., per ton $2.85, ... $28,500.'\n\n The general specifications printed on the form contained the following provisions:\n'Quantities Estimated.-It shall be distinctly understood and agreed that it is the intention of the contract that the contractor shall furnish and deliver any quantity of the coal specified which may be needed for the naval service at the places named during the period from July 1, 1916, to June 30, 1917, irrespective of the estimated quantities stated, the government not being obligated to order any specific quantity. The estimated quantities have been arrived at from records of previous purchases. While they represent the best information obtainable as to the quantities which will be required , ... they are estimated only, and are not to be considered as having any bearing upon the quantity which the government may order under the contract.' \n\n[262 U.S. 489, 491]\n\u00a0\n 'Deliveries.-Deliveries to be made promptly, and in lots or quantities specified ... on call and at the prices accepted by the Department. ...'\n\n'Reservations.-The government reserves the right to reject any or all bids and in accepting any bids; ... the right is also reserved to make such distribution of tonnage among the different bidders for suitable and acceptable coals for the naval service as will be considered to be for the best interests of the government.'\n\n'Notes.-Bids on less than the entire quantity of coal specified under each class will be received and considered. Such partial bids must state the amount of tonnage it is proposed to furnish, subject to the other conditions of these specifications.'\n\n Appellant was notified of the acceptance of its proposal, and on June 5, 1916, a contract was made containing the portions of the bid and specifications above referred to.\n March 26, 1917, appellant was informed by the department that the quantity estimated in its contract would be exceeded by ten per cent. Appellant answered that when it had furnished 10,000 tons, it would consider its obligation under the contract discharged, and that it was prepared to furnish the balance. The department cited the provisions of the contract as authority for requiring the additional tonnage, stated that the same requirement was made of other contractors, and expressed the hope that it would not be necessary to resort to extreme measures to accomplish compliance. Later the department informed appellant that the steamer Kennebec had been directed to coal with it, and that the quantity required was 2,180 tons. Appellant answered that the balance due under the contract was 560 tons, which it was ready to supply at any time, and that this amount was all that it was able to furnish. The department insisted that the full cargo assigned to the Kennebec must be furnished. \n\n[262 U.S. 489, 492]\n\u00a0\n Appellant reiterated its position. June 9, the department advised appellant that failure to supply the tonnage ordered would necessitate immediate purchase in the open market for its account. June 12 appellant replied that it had arranged to supply the Kennebec the full quantity required, and that it was 'doing this under protest, which can be straightened out later.' June 14 appellant wrote that it would agree to supply the 2,180 tons ordered, with the understanding that no further assignments would be made to it; that this was 1,620 tons more than it was obligated to deliver; that this excess would be furnished under protest, reserving the right to take the proper steps to recover the difference between the current market price and the contract price; it asked confirmation f om the department and stated that on receipt thereof it would furnish the coal.\n June 15 the department acknowledged appellant's letter of the 14th, but, as found by the Court of Claims, 'not acceding to any proposition therein contained,' directed appellant:\n'Your company will please supply Kennebec with 1,560 tons coal, or such quantity as may be necessary to bring the total tonnage delivered by you under contract 26,492 up to total estimated quantity plus 10 per cent. or total 11,000 tons. Balance Kennebec cargo will be obtained elsewhere.'\n\n\n 1. \nThe language of the contract indicates that the parties intended and understood that, depending on its own choice, the department might call for more or less than 10,000 tons of coal. The forms of bid indicated a purpose to contract in advance for the year's supply and not to buy coal in the open market; they informed bidders that the stated quantities were estimated on the basis of previous purchases and were not to be taken as exact figures, and such forms were suitable to enable the department \n\n[262 U.S. 489, 493]\n\u00a0\n to award one contract for the total estimated quantity or to distribute its requirements among a number of producers as it might determine. Appellant's bid mentioned specifically 10,000 tons (which was only one- sixtieth of the estimated total for Hampton Roads). It provided that:\n'It shall be distinctly understood and agreed that ... the contractor will furnish any quantity of the coal specified (i. e., of the kind and quality specified) that may be needed ... irrespective of the quantities stated, the government not being obligated to order any specific quantity;' ... and that the stated quantities 'are estimated and are not to be considered as having any bearing upon the quantity which the government may order under the contract; ... the right is also reserved to make such distribution of tonnage among the different bidders ... as will be considered for the best interests of the government.'\n\n There is nothing in the writing which required the government to take, or limited its demand to, any ascertainable quantity. It must be held that, for lack of consideration and mutuality, the contract was not enforceable. Cold Blast Transportation Co. v. Kansas City Bolt & Nut Co., 114 Fed. 77, 81, 52 C. C. A. 25, 57 L. R.

Ct. 300, is not inconsistent with the conclusion that the contract here was not enforceable. There, the making and acceptance of the bid consummated the contract, and it was construed to bind the company to furnish and the department to take the envelopes and wrappers specified which the department would need during the period covered by the contract. \n\n[262 U.S. 489, 494]\n\u00a0\n 2. While the contract at its inception was not enforceable, it became valid and binding to the extent that it was performed. St. Louis Hay & Grain Co. v. United States, \n191 \nU.S. 159, 163\n, 24 S.

Ct. 100.\n There was no duress or compulsory taking. The last order was given, as prior orders had been given, with reference to the contract. The failure of the department in the correspondence directly to decline the proposal made by appellant in its letter of June 14 has no significance in favor of appellant. The department did not accept or in any manner acquiesce. Immediately its order was given for 1,560 tons, making a total of 11,000 tons, the exact amount it claimed it was entitled to call for under the contract. The correspondence shows that the department declined to accept appellant's view and refused to entertain i  requests or proposals to leave the matter of price open. Appellant failed further to object and delivered the coal. It is not important whether it was persuaded that the department's interpretation of the writing was correct or, to avoid controversy, decided to fill the order. Its earlier protest is of no avail (see Savage v. United States, \n92 U.S. 382\n), and it must be held voluntarily to have accepted the order for the additional 1,000 tons, and to have furnished it at the price specified in the contract.

Rutter, of New York City, and Gibbs L. Baker, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Rufus S. Day, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought to recover $73,964.48, being $3.70 per ton for 19,990.4 tons of coal furnished the Navy. Appellant seeks to recover the market price at the time of delivery, $6.50 per ton. The United States claims appellant was bound by contract to furnish it for $2.80 a ton, and this has been paid. The Court of Claims made findings of fact and concluded that the appellant was not entitled to recover.\n In the spring of 1916, the Navy Department, being desirous of making contracts for coal for the ensuing fiscal year, ending June 30, 1917, issued its invitations for bids. Appellant submitted a bid and was awarded a contract to furnish a part of the coal required at Hampton Roads, Va. The invitation, form of bid, specifications, and contract \n\n[262 U.S. 495, 496]\n\u00a0\n in this case are the same as in Willard, Sutherland & Co. v. United States, \n262 U.S. 489\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 592, 67 L. Ed. --, decided this day, except that in this case the contract price was $2.80 per ton, and the quantity specifically mentioned was 200,000 tons.\n On March 26, 1917, appellant was informed by the department that the estimated quantity mentioned in its contract would be exceeded by about 10 per cent. Appellant stated that it had not bid on tonnage in excess of 200, 000 tons, and called attention to the heavy curtailment of production at its mines due to shortage of cars and labor. The department cited the provisions of the contract as authority for requiring thereunder additional tonnage, stated that the same requirement was being made of other contractors, and that the contract price must apply to the total requirements during the fiscal year. Appellant then called attention to the provisions of note (b), printed in the margin,1 giving relief in case of shortage of transportation, among other things, and submitted a statement as to the car supply, and maintained that on that basis it was only obliged to deliver 148,357 tons up to April 1, 1917, whereas it had actually delivered to date 160,377 tons, an excess of 12,020 tons, and stated that the total of 220,000 above referred to was subject to the reduction of 12,020 tons, making the actual tonnage deliverable by it under its contract 207,980 tons. The department answered by letter and insisted that the \n\n[262 U.S. 495, 497]\n\u00a0\n 10 per cent. additional must be furnished under the contract, and said \n'It cannot be recognized that you are entitled to any relief on account of such shortage of equipment as may have been experienced, as, in this respect, the Navy is accorded preferential treatment and this department has not failed to obtain the cars required by its suppliers when requests for cars to move Navy tonnage have been received.'\n\n Appellant then limited its claim for reduction on account of shortage of cars to the period prior to January 1, 1917, and stated that on that basis:\n'The total of 220,000 tons requisitioned by the Department under our contract is therefore subject to reduction to the extent of 8,219 tons, making the actual tonnage deliverable under the contract 211, 781 tons.'\n\n April 26, 1917, the department again insisted on the delivery of the additional 10 per cent. May 22, 1917, acknowledging an order of 10,000 tons to be delivered between June 1, and June 10, the appellant stated that 204,430.19 tons had been delivered; that 2,650 tons were assigned to barges, making a total of 207,080.19 tons, and that the 10,000 tons would make a total of 217,080.19 tons, leaving 2,920 tons. June 2, 1917, appellant wired the department, saying:\n'We beg to call attention to department's notice to us under date March twenty-sixth we would be required to deliver contract tonnage plus ten per cent. eighty-two hundred nineteen tons of which by reasons of short car supply we are delivering under protest. With completion of your requisition for ten thousand tons May twenty-first, two hundred and twenty thousand tons will have been delivered, being eighty-two hundred nineteen tons in excess of the tonnage required to complete contract.'\n\n Appellant delivered 219,990.4 tons of coal in all. It billed 211,771 tons at the contract price and 8,219 tons at $6.25 per ton, and protested against accepting the contract \n\n[262 U.S. 495, 498]\n\u00a0\n price therefor, claiming that on account of car shortage it was not bound to deliver it. The Court of Claims found that, when the excess over 200, 000 was delivered, the market price was $6.50 per ton, and that such tonnage-19,990.4-was worth in the market $73,964.48 in excess of the contract price.\n On the authority of the Willard Case, supra, it is held that by the language of the contract it appears that the parties intended that the department might call for more or less than the 200,000 tons mentioned therein, and that because of lack of consideration and mutuality the contract at its inception was not enforceable, but that it became valid and binding to the extent that it was performed.\n On the facts found it must be held that appellant abandoned its claim that it was not bound to furnish more than the 200,000 tons, and acquiesced in the department's interpretation of the contract and accepted and performed its orders. By its billing the appellant conceded that the contract price applied to all except 8,219 tons. The provisions of note (b) have no relation to price. The purpose of that paragraph was to relieve the contractors from liability resulting from their inability to fulfill their contracts on account of causes mentioned therein. The department at all times adhered to its position both as to quantity and price. Appellant's protest against delivery of the 8,219 tons because of car shortage, and against acceptance of the contract price therefor was of no avail. When it sued, the demand made was not in accordance with the billing, and it claimed the market price for all coal delivered in excess of the estimated quantity mentioned in the contract. The case is presented on the same grounds as was the Willard Case, and it must be held that all of the 219,990.4 tons was ordered and delivered under the contract.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '(b) Contractors will not be held responsible for fulfillment of their contracts during any war in which the United States may be engaged and which may affect them, or if prevented from doing so by strikes or combinations of miners, laborers, or boatmen, accidents at the mines, or interruption or shortage of transportation. In such cases the obligation to deliver coal under their contracts will be canceled to an extent corresponding to the extent or duration of such war, strikes, combinations, accidents, interruption, or shortage, and no liability shall be incurred by the contractors for damages resulting from their inability to fulfill their contracts on account of the aforementioned causes.' \n\n\n\n\n","223":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWOODBRIDGE v. U S(1923)\nNo. 51\nArgued: Decided: November 12, 1923\n\n\n\n Mr. H. P. Doolittle, of Washington, D. C., for appellants.\n Mr. Harry E. Knight, of Washington, D. C., for the United States. \n\n[263 U.S. 50, 51]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit in the Court of Claims was brought under the authority of a special act of Congress of March 2, 1901 (31 Stat. 1788), by which the claim of William E. Woodbridge, for compensation from the United States for use of his alleged invention relating to projectiles for rifled cannon, for which a patent was ordered issued by the government, was referred to the Court of Claims to hear and determine, first, whether Woodbridge was the first and original inventor; and, second, to what extent the United States had used it and the amount of compensation which was due in equity and justice therefor, and if it found that Woodbridge was such inventor, to decide the case as if a patent had issued for seventeen years in 1852, the year in which it had been ordered to issue, with the right of appeal as in other causes:\n'Provided, however, that the said court shall first be satisfied that the said Woodbridge did not forfeit, or abandon, his right to a patent, by publication, delay, laches or otherwise, and that the said patent was wrongly refused to be issued by the Patent Office.'\n\n The Court of Claims heard the case, made findings of fact, and held that the petition must be dismissed on two grounds: First, that Woodbridge had forfeited or abandoned his right to a patent by his delay or laches; and, second, that the United States had not used his invention.\n From the findings of fact it appears that Woodbridge was a man skilled in the science of projectiles and an inventor of genius and experience. In February, 1852, he filed an application for a patent for an invention which he described as consisting of--\n'applying to a projectile to be fired from a rifled gun-a rifle, ring or sabot, in the manner hereafter described, for the purpose of giving to the projectile the rifle motion.'\n\n The Patent Office \n\n[263 U.S. 50, 52]\n\u00a0\n advised him that the use of sabots or rings of soft metal applied to iron balls was known for either smooth bore or rifled guns but after discussion allowed him two claims-the first for a smooth ring for a smooth bore cannon, and the second for a ring with exterior projections to fit into the rifled cannon, for the purpose of diminishing windage, and giving the projectile a motion in direction of the axis of the bore.\n In a letter of March 23, 1852, Woodbridge wrote the Patent Commissioner, with the claims amended in the form in which the Patent Office had agreed to allow them, and said:\n'I was informed, in answer to my inquiry, that upon the issue, or order to issue, of a patent, it may be filed in the secret archives of your office (at the risk of the patentee) for such time as he may desire. I wish to avail myself of this privilege when my patent may issue, in order that my ability to take out a patent in a foreign country may not be affected by the publication of the invention. If it is necessary to specify a particular time during which the patent shall remain in the secret archives, you will please consider one year as the time designated by me.'\n\n To this, on April 15, 1852, the Patent Office answered that a patent had been ordered to issue on his application and, in accordance with his request, the papers were filed among the secret archives of the office, subject to his directions as to the time of issuing them. This was done presumably under section 8 of the Act of July 4, 1836 (5 Stat. 121), which contains the following provision:\n'And whenever the applicant shall request it, the patent shall take date from the time of the filing of the specification and drawings, not however exceeding six months prior to the actual issuing of the patent; and on like request, and the payment of the duty herein required, by any applicant, his specification and drawings shall be \n\n[263 U.S. 50, 53]\n\u00a0\n filed in the secret archives of the office until he shall furnish the model and the patent be issued, not exceeding the term of one year, the applicant being entitled to notice of interfering applications.'\n\n After the filing of the papers in the secret archives before April 15, 1852, nothing was done either by Woodbridge or the Patent Office for 9 1\/2 years, when on December 31, 1861, Woodbridge wrote to the Commissioner of Patents calling attention to his invention in 1850 and his application for a patent in 1852, the order of the office to issue the patent, and the filing of the papers in the secret archives. He said:\n'I have allowed it to remain until the present time, it being only lately that any immediate opportunity of rendering it pecuniarily available has occurred.'\n\n The fourth finding of the Court of Claims was as follows:\n'The reason of said Woodbridge for his delay in requesting issue of the patent allowed him was, as stated by him in communications to the Patent Office, that he thought that course best fitted to enable him to avail himself of the value of the patent, as by procuring delay in the issue of the patent the wants of the government might demand the invention before the patent should expire, and that as the invention could be made available only by the necessities and action of the government, he thought the intent of the law that the inventor should have 14 years' exclusive use of his invention could in no other way be so well attained in the case of this particular invention 'as by deferring the issue of the patent to a time when it could be brought into practical use.\"\n\n In the same letter in which Woodbridg asked the issue of the patent, he requested that he be permitted to amend his specifications and claims and broaden them, so as to cover the use in a rifle of the sabot or ring without the projections to fit in the grooves of the bore. Within five days \n\n[263 U.S. 50, 54]\n\u00a0\n the Patent Office replied that the patent would be ordered to issue, but that the defects in his specifications could only be cured by a reissue. On January 29th, before a month had elapsed, the Patent Office wrote Woodbridge another letter, in answer to his letter of December 31, 1861, in which he was informed that the length of time he had allowed his invention to slumber was a bar to the issue of a patent; that for nearly 10 years he had suffered his application to remain locked up, not merely beyond the reach of the public, but beyond even the cognizance of the examiners and other officers of the department; that meantime many patents had issued for the same invention, and yet his only reason for his delay and silence was that he supposed the invention would not prove remunerative until recently. The application was rejected on the ground of abandonment. On April 15, 1862, Woodbridge appealed to the Board of Examiners in Chief and on July 10, 1862, that board affirmed the action of the examiner. Nothing was done by Woodbridge after this until January 7, 1871, when he appealed to the Commissioner of Patents. A day was set for the hearing. Woodbridge did not get the notice. Another day was set. The Commissioner had to postpone it, and told Woodbridge he would give him another date. Nothing was done by anybody till January, 1879, when on Woodbridge's application the case was heard and the Commissioner affirmed the decision by the subordinate tribunals that the facts amounted to abandonment. Woodbridge appealed to the Supreme Court of the District, which affirmed the Commissioner on February 28, 1880\n\n\n The Court of Claims found that Woodbridge was the first and original inventor of the invention involved in the two claims recited above. It also found that the United States had not used the invention. The latter finding as one of fact is attacked, on the ground that the question of infringement is a mixed question of law and fact, and that \n\n[263 U.S. 50, 55]\n\u00a0\n with all the devices used by the United States shown in patents subsequent to Woodbridge, which it is found the United States did use, the question of nonuser is really a question of law which should be reviewed here.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims was chiefly based on the conclusion of law from the facts found that Woodbridge had forfeited or abandoned his right to a patent by his delay and laches. The court also held that the claims of Woodbridge did not cover the devices the United States used.\n The purpose of the clause of the Constitution concerning patents is in terms to promote the progress of science and the useful arts and the plan adopted by Congress in exercise of the power has been to give one who makes a useful discovery or invention a monopoly in the making, use and vending of it for a limited number of years. Under the Act of February 21, 1793 (1 Stat. 318,  1), it was for 14 years. Under the Act of July 4, 1836 (5 Stat. 117, 119,  5), it was 14 years, with a right of extension under certain conditions and a proper showing for 7 years longer (Id. p. 124,  18). Under the Act of March 2, 1861 (12 Stat. 246, 249,  16), the term was made 17 years without extension and this has been the term ever since. It was the legislative intention that the term should run from the date of the issue of the patent, and that at the end of that time, the public might derive, from the full specifications required in the application accompanying the patent, knowledge sufficient to enable it freely to make and use the invention. It is true that a patentee is not obliged either to make, use, or vend his invention during the period of his monopoly. Crown Co. v. Nye Tool Works, \n261 \nU.S. 24, 34\n, 43 S. Sup. Ct. 254; Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co., \n210 U.S. 405\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 748. Congress relies for the public benefit to be derived from the invention during the monopoly on the natural motive for gain in the patentee to exploit his invention and to make, use, \n\n[263 U.S. 50, 56]\n\u00a0\n and vend it or its product or to permit others to do so, for profit. The importance in working out the purpose of Congress of keeping the inventor's monopoly within the term for which the patent is granted is thus shown to be capital. Any practice by the inventor and applicant for a patent through which he deliberately and without excuse postpones beyond the date of the actual invention, the beginning of the term of his monopoly, and thus puts off the free public enjoyment of the useful invention, is an evasion of the statute and defeats its benevolent aim.\n In this case we have a delay of 9 1\/2 years in securing a patent that might have been had at any time in that period for the asking, and this for the admitted purpose of making the term of the monopoly square with the period when the commercial profit from it would be highest. Not until war or fear of war came was there likely to be a strong demand for rifled cannon and their improvement. Hence the inventor, having put his order for the issue of a patent into the secret archives of the Patent Office in 1852, sat down and waited until after the Civil War came on in 1861 before seeking to avail himself of the patent, thus postponing the time when the public could freely enjoy it for nearly 10 years. Meantime other inventors had been at work in the same field and had obtained patents without knowledge of the situation with respect to Woodbridge's invention. This is not a case where evidence has to be weighed as to the purpose of the inventor. He avows his deliberate intention. This is not a case of abandonment. It is a case of forfeiting the right to a patent by designed delay. The special statute makes it a condition of any jurisdiction of the Court of Claims to render a judgment against the United States that the court shall find that claimant had not forfeited his right to a patent by delay or laches or for other reasons. This necessarily implies that there may be forfeiture by delay or laches, \n\n[263 U.S. 50, 57]\n\u00a0\n and this court has said that there may be such a forfeiture. In Kendall v. Winsor, 21 How. 322, 329, Mr. Justice Daniel, speaking for the court, delivered a very clear and forcible opinion on what the inventors who sought patents owed the public. One passage in that opinion is apposite here:\n'It is,' said the Justice, 'the unquestionable right of every inventor to confer gratuitously the benefits of his ingenuity upon the public, and this he may do either by express declaration or by conduct equally significant with language-such, for instance, as an acquiescence with full knowledge in the use of his invention by others; or he may forfeit his rights as an inventor by a willful or negligent postponement of his claims, or by an attempt to withhold the benefit of his improvement from the public until a similar or the same improvement should have been made and introduced by others.'\n\n In the case before us, we have the feature last alluded to. Many inventors were at work in the same field, and had made advances in the art, and the government had used them. When Woodbridge conceived that the time for him had come to assert his monopoly, he became aware of the fact that in his specifications and claims, as allowed, he had not covered the real advance made by his unconscious competitors, and that was the use in a rifled gun of a ring or sabot without projections to fit into the rifling of the bore, which because of the softness of the metal of the ring under the heat and pressure would do so without projections; and so 9 1\/2 years after his patent had been allowed, but not issued, he applied for a change of specifications and claims, so that he might cover the patents of these subsequent inventors.\n Reference is made to the custom of the Patent Office in 1852, and its permission and acquiescence in the consignment of Woodbridge's specifications and order for issue \n\n[263 U.S. 50, 58]\n\u00a0\n of his patent to the secret archives, as an excuse and explanation for his course. But this is no justification. By the terms of his letter directing it to be done, he said he wished to apply for foreign patents and that he would not ask delay for more than a year. Moreover, section 8 of the law of 1836, quoted above, wherein is found the only authority for such a proceeding, limits the possible period of the deposit in the secret archives to one year, for the evident purpose of preparing a model. Here the findings show that the model had been filed before the deposit, and also show that he never applied for a foreign patent. These circumstances only emphasize the truth of his avowal of 1862 that he was deliberately delaying the issue of his patent, so that its term and monopoly would reach forward to include nearly 10 more years of the future and cover a much more commercially lucrative period than if he had obtained his patent when he might and should have requested it. Thus he would have deprived the public of a decade of free use of the patent which the law intended. It is true that, under the special law authorizing this action, Woodbridge's representatives could not recover compensation from the government except for the period of 17 years from 1852. But this feature of the special law is immaterial in considering the jurisdictional question whether by his conduct he forfeited his right to his patent. That must be decided on the facts as they were between 1852 and 1862. Had he taken out his patent in 1852, he would have been entitled to a term of 14 years, with a contingent possibility of an extention for 7 years more. With the change of the law in 1861, had he succeeded in his effort on the last day of that year, he would have secured a patent for 17 years from 1862. To state it in another way, his certain term, if he had been diligent and not sought to evade the law, would have expired in 1866. Had he succeeded in his illegal plan \n\n[263 U.S. 50, 59]\n\u00a0\n and procured a patent in 1862, his term would have ended in 1879. Part of this unconscionable postponement of the end of his monopoly was due to the change of law in 1861, but nearly 10 years, as already said, was the result of his deliberate design.\n No case cited to us presents exactly these facts, but the general principles upon which this court has proceeded in cases of abandonment by conduct and its views of the rights of the public, and the purpose of the constitutional authority to grant patents and of Congress in its legislative execution of that purpose, set forth in those cases, leave no doubt of the conclusion we must reach. Pennock v. Dialogue, 2 Pet. 1; Wyeth v. Stone, 1 Story, 273, 282, Fed. Cas. No. 18,107; Show v. Cooper, 7 Pet. 292; Kendall v. Winsor, 21 How. 322, 329; Planing-Machine Co. v. Keith, \n101 U.S. 479\n, 485; United States Rifle & Cartridge Co. v. Whitney Arms Co., \n118 \nU.S. 22, 25\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 950.\n Of course the conclusion that patents have been abandoned by conduct in such cases are reached by inference that the delay and other circumstances indicated an intention to give up effort to secure a patent. The circumstances usually relied on to show abandonment are a rejection of an application for a patent by the Patent Office and unexplained delay in prosecuting appeal from one of the several executive tribunals to another provided in the procedure of obtaining a patent. From these intent to abandon is presumed. It is urged that such authorities have no application because intent to abandon cannot be inferred from the delay in this case. That is true; but our conclusion rests, not on neglect and intention to give up the patent, but on a deliberate and unlawful purpose to postpone the term of the patent the inventor always intended to secure.\n The case which comes nearer in its facts to this than any other, and is a case of forfeiture rather than abandonment is that of Macbeth-Evans Glass Co. v. General \n\n[263 U.S. 50, 60]\n\u00a0\n Electric Co., 246 Fed. 695, 158 C. C. A. 651. There an inventor of a process for making glass used it in secret for nearly 10 years, selling the product. At the end of that time when the secret was betrayed by an employee, the inventor applied for a patent. It was held by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit in a most satisfactory opinion by Judge Warrington, that the policy of the patent law to secure to the public the full benefit of inventions after expiration of the fixed term deemed sufficient reasonably to stimulate invention, would be defeated if an inventor could withhold his invention from the public for an indefinite time for his own profit, and that the right to preserve a monopoly in an invention by keeping it a trade secret and the right to secure its protection under the patent laws were inconsistent and could not both be exercised by an inventor. The gist of the reason for the conclusion there was the same as here, that the purpose and result of the conduct of the inventor were unduly to postpone the time when the public could enjoy the free use of the invention.\n Mr. Justice Clifford, in Bates v. Coe, \n98 U.S. 31\n, 46, when considering the validity of a reissued patent, used these words:\n'Inventors may, if they can, keep their invention secret; and if they do for any length of time, they do not forfeit their right to apply for a patent, unless another in the meantime has made the invention, and secured by patent the exclusive right to make, use, and vend the patented improvement. Within that rule and subject to that condition, inventors may delay to apply for a patent.'\n\n And in Parks v. Booth, \n102 U.S. 96\n, 105, the same Justice said:\n'Unless inventors keep their inventions secret, they are required to be vigilant in securing patents for their protection.' \n\n[263 U.S. 50, 61]\n\u00a0\n These remarks were not necessary to the conclusion in the case he was describing, and those in Bates v. Coe have given some concern to judges having to consider actual cases of deliberate delay. Chief Justice Alvey, of the Court of Appeals of the District, said of them (In re Appeal of Mower, 15 App. D. C. 144, 152, 153):\n\n'This, doubtless, is a correct general proposition; but, like all general propositions, it may have its exceptions under special and particular circumstances, even where the intervening rights of third parties have not been secured by patent.\n\n'The patent laws are founded in a large public policy to promote the progress of science and the useful arts. The public, therefore, is a most material party to, and should be duly considered in, every application for a patent, securing to the individual a monopoly for a limited time, in consideration for the exercise of his genius and skill. But the arts and sciences will certainly not be promoted by giving encouragement to inventors to withhold and conceal their inventions for an indefinite time, or to a time when they may use and apply their inventions to their own exclusive advantage, irrespective of the public benefit, and certainly not if the inventor is allowed to conceal his invention to be brought forward in some after time to thwart and defeat a more diligent and active inventor, who has placed the benefit of his invention within the reach and knowledge of the public.'\n\n Judge Warrington, in the Macbeth-Evans Case, supra, refers to the same remarks (246 Fed. 705, 158 C. C. A. 661) as follows:\n'We therefore cannot think that the rule laid down in Pennock v. Dialogue and Kendall v. Winsor was intended to be qualified by the remarks of Mr. Justice Clifford in Bates v. Coe. ... We are confirmed in this by the reference made in Bates v. Coe ... to the decision in Pennock v. Dialogue and to the effect of the legislation enacted since, and particularly by the view expressed by \n\n[263 U.S. 50, 62]\n\u00a0\n the same Justice while sitting on the circuit in Jones v. Sewall, 3 Cliff. 563, 592, 593, Fed. Cas. No. 7,495, where, in distinguishing between the intent to be inferred from experimental practice of an invention and practice for gain, he said:\n\n\"Such an inference [of intention to surrender the invention to the public] is never favored, nor will it in general be sufficient to prove such a defense, unless it appears that the use, exercise, or practice of the invention was somewhat extensive, and for the purpose of gain, evincing an intent on the part of the inventor to secure the exclusive benefits of his invention without applying for the protection of letters patent.\"\n\n We concur in these explanations and qualifications of Mr. Justice Clifford's general remarks in Bates v. Coe and for the reasons given. They certainly should not be construed to militate against our conclusion in this case and the reasons upon which it is founded.\n Counsel for the appellant relies chiefly on the cases of Smith v. Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co., \n93 U.S. 486\n, Colgate v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 6 Fed. Cas. 85, and United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., \n167 U.S. 224\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 809, known as the Berliner Case. The first two cases have no bearing on this case. In them the court found as a fact that the delays of the inventor in prosecuting his claims in the Patent Office after rejection were not due to an intention to abandon, but to his necessitous circumstances. In the Berliner Case there was also a question of fact but a different one. The government charged in that case, as it is charged here, that the telephone company, the owner of the invention, deliberately delayed proceedings in the Patent Office for thirteen years in order that when its main Bell patent expired, the patent for the indispensable Berliner device might overlap and continue the monopoly as a whole. A reading of Mr. Justice Brewer's opinion in that case shows that the at tention \n\n[263 U.S. 50, 63]\n\u00a0\n of the court was chiefly directed to the issue whether as a fact the delay was due to the design of the owner of the invention or to circumstances over which it had no control, including the rules of the Patent Office, the delays of the examiners, and the peculiar situation as to applications for patents in that active field of invention. The court found this issue against the government and in favor of the patentee whose patent the government was attempting to cancel for this fraud and could only cancel by clear and convincing proof. In the case at bar the design of the inventor is disclosed by his own avowal, and his plan of nonaction was not in accord with the rules of procedure in the Patent Office, but was in plain violation of the statutory law.\n The conclusion that Woodbridge forfeited his right to a patent by his delay in taking it from 1852 to 1862 makes it unnecessary for us to consider whether he abandoned it by his wholly unexplained delay of 9 more years in prosecuting his appeal from the decision of the Board of Examiners in July, 1862, to the Commissioner of Patents until January, 1871. It also relieves us from going into the question whether the government's use of subsequent patents for improvements in adjusting projectiles for firing from cannon embraced the invention of Woodbridge as contained in his specifications and claims allowed in 1852.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims dismissing the petition is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","224":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWORK v. U S EX REL MCALESTER-EDWARDS COAL CO(1923)\nNo. 258\nArgued: April 12, 1923Decided: May 21, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[262 U.S. 200, 201]\n\u00a0\n The relator, the McAlester-Edwards Coal Company, filed a petition in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, asking for a writ of mandamus to require the Secretary of the Interior and the Governor of the Chickasaw Nation and the Principal Chief of the Choctaw Nation to accept $ 10,360.06, the balance of the purchase price of $12,651.82 ($2,291.76 having already been tendered and accepted) tendered by the coal company in payment for certain surface lands to which under the Act of Congress of February 8, 1918 (40 Stat. 433, c. 12,  4), it claimed a preferential right of purchase, and to require the Governor of the Chickasaw Nation and the Principal Chief of the Choctaw Nation to issue a patent to the coal company for the same and the Secretary of the Interior to approve it.\n The answer of the defendants below admitted all the material facts alleged in the petition, but denied the right of the coal company to the mandamus on the ground that the construction put upon the act of 1918 by the Secretary of the Interior, in the exercise of the discretion vested in him by the statute, did not give to the relator, the coal company, the preferential right asserted. The Supreme Court of the District overruled a demurrer to the answer, and, the relator not pleading further, the petition was dismissed. On review in the Court of Appeals, the judgment of the District Supreme Court was reversed on the ground that the demurrer should have been sustained and the writ asked for should have issued. The cause was remanded to have the writ issue \n\n[262 U.S. 200, 202]\n\u00a0\n.\n The coal company is owner by assignment of a lease approved by the Secretary of the Interior of coal lands in Pittsburg county, Oklahoma, belonging to the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, executed in July, 1899, and running for 30 years. This lease permitted the lessee to use the surface of the land covered by the lease for the purpose of developing its coal mine. The Act of February 19, 1912, (37 Stat. 67, c. 46), authorized the Secretary of the Interior to sell the surface leased and unleased of the segregated mineral land of the Choctaws and Chickasaws, reserved under previous laws, to include the entire estate of the Indians therein except the coal and asphalt reserved. The Secretary was required in the first section, quoted in the margin,1 to classify and have appraised the \n\n[262 U.S. 200, 203]\n\u00a0\n surface so to be sold. The second section, also quoted in the margin,2 gave a perferential right for 60 days to any coal or asphalt lessee to purchase at the appraised value, the surface of the land covered by his mining lease, not exceeding 5 per cent. of the whole surface, which the Secretary might extend to 10 per cent., upon waiver of right by the lessee to use any more of the surface, but \n\n[262 U.S. 200, 204]\n\u00a0\n allowed the Secretary in case of a lessee's failing to purchase to reserve to him as much of the surface as the Secretary might deem proper for his mining used and development.\n Pursuant to this act, the Secretary classified and appraised the surface of the land which included that covered by the lease of the coal company. The coa company, however, did not avail itself of the right to purchase but under the authority of the latter part of the section accepted a reservation by the Secretary of a certain part of the surface for its mining operations.\n The purpose of the Act of February 8, 1918 (40 Stat. 433), already referred to, is shown by its title 'An act providing for the sale of the coal and asphalt deposits in the segregated mineral land in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations Oklahoma.' Before offering the coal and asphalt deposits for sale, the Secretary was to cause them to be appraised, under such regulations as he should prescribe. All deposits sold were to be subject to the rights of existing lessees, and section 4 contained a provision that any lessee of mining rights should have the preferential right to buy them at the highest price offered for them at public auction- at not less than the appraisement-and that after the appraisement of the mining rights and within 90 days thereof such lessee should have the preferential right to buy the surface rights reserved to him by the Secretary as such lessee 'at the appraised value.'\n The relator bought the mining rights and then within due time undertook to exercise its preferential right to buy the surface rights reserved to it by the Secretary under the Act of 1912, and made a payment on account of $2,291.76, on the basis of the appraisement under the Act of 1912, which was accepted by the Superintendent of the Five Civilized Tribes and approved by the Secretary of the Interior, and retained for fourteen months. When this became known to the Choctaw and Chickasaw Na- \n\n[262 U.S. 200, 205]\n\u00a0\n tions, their representatives protested and insisted that there must be a new appraisement under the Act of 1918. There was a hearing before the Secretary who reversed his first ruling and held that the relator was entitled to purchase such surface lands only under an appraisement made subsequently to the Act of 1918, and that the money paid under the appraisement of 1912 should be returned to the relator. An appraisement was then ordered by the Secretary under regulations issued by him, at which the relator had sought to exercise a preferential right was fixed at $ 20,482.60, instead of $9,050.53, whic had been the appraisement under the Act of 1912\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. H. L. Underwood, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. George M. Porter, of McAlester, Okl., and Conrad H. Syme, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Two questions are to be decided in this case. The first is under what appraisement the preferential right conferred on the relator by the fourth section of the Act of 1918 to purchase the surface previously reserved to it by the Secretary of the Interior, was to be exercised. Should it have been under that of the Act of 1912, or under that ordered by the Secretary after the Act of 1918? The second question is whether the construction necessary to determine the first question is vested by the statute in \n\n[262 U.S. 200, 206]\n\u00a0\n the legal discretion of the Secretary which it is not within the power of the Supreme Court of the District by mandamus to control.\n First. We have no doubt that the appraisement referred to in the fourth section of the Act of 1918 under which the preferential right was to be exercised was that provided for in the Act of 1912. It will be observed that the Act of 1912 provided for the sale of the surface lands covering the coal and asphalt deposits of the Choctaws and Chickasaws, and elaborate provisions were made for the appraisement of them. A board of appraisers was to be appointed by the President of the United States, regulations were to be made by the Secretary for the appraisement, and minute requirements were set forth in the first section as to the different classes of such surface lands. More than that, six months' time was allowed for it and $50,000 was appropriated out of the treasury of the Nation to complete the appraisement and sale. By the second section it was attempted to protect the lessees of the minerals in retaining enough surface land to enjoy their leases by giving them short time options to purchase certain percentages of the while surface and if they did not purchase, by an agreed reservation without purchase of what the Secretary might deem necessary. The object of this legislation was the appraisement, offering, sale and disposition of the surface of the mineral land. The Act of 1918 was enacted not to sell the surface. That had been all disposed of except these agreed reservations by the Secretary specifically provided for in the Act of 1912. The later act was to sell outright the coal and asphalt deposits, much of which had been leased until 1929, subject to such leases. That was its chief purpose. Everything else was incidental. As part of this chief purpose, it provided elaborately for an appraisement of the mineral deposits, just as the Act of 1912 had provided for the appraisement of the surface \n\n[262 U.S. 200, 207]\n\u00a0\n land. There is nothing in the Act of 1918 as to the appraisal of the reserved surface land except in the words italicized in the following paragraph, taken from Section 4:\n'Any lessee shall have the preferential right, provided the same is exercised within ninety days after the approval of the completion of the appraisement of the minerals, as herein provided, to purchase at the appraised value any or all of the surface of the lands lying within such lease held by him and heretofore reserved by order of the Secretary of the Interior.'\n\n This paragraph is in the middle of section 4, a section devoted to saving the rights of the lessees of the coal and asphalt deposits from impairment by the sale of such deposits contemplated by the act. It was entirely natural, as such reservation of the surface had been made to preserve the mining opportunities of the lessees under the Act of 1912, that now that it was hoped that the lessees would buy the leased deposits outright under the act, as we may judge from the provision giving them preferential rights to do so contained in the same section, provision should also be made to secure them permanent ownership of that which the Secretary had deemed necessary for their mining under the leases. These privileges extended to the lessees show clearly that this act is in pari materia with all the previous legislation concerning these mineral lands, both as to surface and deposits, and especially with the Act of 1912 as to the surface. This is confirmed by the proviso in section 4 that:\n'Nothing herein contained shall be construed as limiting or curtailing the rights of any lessee or owner of mineral deposits from acquiring additional surface lands for mining operations as provided by the Act of Congress of February 19, 1912.'\n\n There is nothing in the Act of 1918 expressly or impliedly authorizing the Secretary to order a reappraisement \n\n[262 U.S. 200, 208]\n\u00a0\n of the surface land. There is no appropriation for the purpose.\n If by the words quoted from section 4 of the act it was intended to authorize a new appraisement of the surface reservations, the language would not have been 'the' appraisement but 'an' appraisement. The use of the definite article means an appraisement specifically provided for. Such an appraisement of the minerals was provided for in the Act of 1918 and this is mentioned in the same sentence in which \"the appraisement\" of the surface land is referred to. Construing the Acts of 1912 and 1918 together, the appraisement can only refer to that so elaborately provided for in 1912.\n Second. We think that the preferential right of relator conferred by section 4 of the Act of 1918 was not to be left to the legal discretion of the Secretary in the construction of that act. There are no words to qualify that which the lessee has as a right granted by the statute, or to vest in the Secretary the final discretion to determine or define that right.\n Section 7 of the Act of 1918 prov des that when the full purchase price for any property sold hereunder is paid, the chief executives of the two tribes shall execute and deliver, with the approval of the secretary of the Interior, to each purchaser an appropriate patent conveying to the purchaser the property so sold. This is language of command, and brings the case within Lane v. Hoglund, \n244 U.S. 174\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 558, and the many cases cited there, and in which the court quotes from its opinion in Roberts v. United States, \n176 \nU.S. 221, 231\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 376, 379 (44 L. Ed. 443) as follows:\n'Every statute to some extent requires construction by the public officer whose duties may be defined therein. Such officer must read the law, and he must therefore, in a certain sense, construe it, in order to form a judgment from its language what duty he is directed by the statute to perform. But that does not necessarily and in all cases \n\n[262 U.S. 200, 209]\n\u00a0\n make the duty of the officer ... other than a purely ministerial one. If the law direct him to perform and act in regard to which no discretion is committed to him, and which, upon the facts existing, he is bound to perform, then that act is ministerial although depending upon a statute which requires, in some degree, a construction of its language by the officer.'\n\n See, also, Work v. United States ex rel. Mosier, \n261 U.S. 352\n, 43 Sup. Ct. 389, 67 L. Ed. --, decided March 19, 1923.\n The decree of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] That the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized to sell at not less than the appraised price, to be fixed as hereinafter provided, the surface, leased and unleased, of the lands of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations in Oklahoma segregated and reserved by order of the Secretary of the Interior dated March twenty-fourth, nineteen hundred and three, authorized by the act approved July first, nineteen hundred and two. The surface herein referred to shall include the entire estate save the coal and asphalt reserved. Before offering such surface for sale the Secretary of the Interior, under such regulations as he may prescribe, shall cause the same to be classified and appraised by three appraisers, to be appointed by the President, at a compensation to be fixed him, not to exceed for salary and expenses for each appraiser the sum of fifteen dollars per day for the time actually engaged in making such classification and appraisement. The classification and appraisement of the surface shall be by tracts, according to the government survey of said lands, except that lands which are especially valuable by reason of proximity to towns or cities may, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, be subdivided into lots or tracts containing not less than one acre. In appraising said surface the value of any improvements thereon belonging to the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, except such improvements as have been placed on coal or asphalt lands leased for mining purposes, shall be taken into consideration. The surface shall be classified as agricultural, grazing, or as suitable for town lots. The classification and appraisement provided for herein shall be completed within six months from the date of the passage of this act, shall be sworn to by the appraisers, and shall become effective when approved by the Secretary of the Interior: Provided, that in the proceedings and deliberation of said appraisers in the process of said appraisement and in the approval thereof the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations may present for consideration facts, figures, and arguments bearing upon the value of said property. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Sec. 2. That after such classification and appraisement has been made each holder of a coal or asphalt lease shall have a right for sixty days, after notice in writing, to purchase, at the appraised value and upon the terms and conditions hereinafter prescribed, a sufficient amount of the surface of the land covered by his lease to embrace improvements actually used in present mining operations or necessary for futu e operations up to five per centum of such surface, the number, location, and extent of the tracts to be thus purchased to be approved by the Secretary of the Interior: Provided, that the Secretary of the Interior may, in his discretion, enlarge the amount of land to be purchased by any such lessee to not more than ten per centum of such surface: Provided further, that such purchase shall be taken and held as a waiver by the purchaser of any and all rights to appropriate to his use any other part of the surface of such land, except for the purpose of future operations, prospecting, and for ingress and egress, as hereinafter reserved: Provided further, that if any lessee shall fail to apply to purchase under the provisions of this section within the time specified the Secretary of the Interior may, in his discretion, with the consent of the lessee, designate and reserve from sale such tract or tracts as he may deem proper and necessary to embrace improvements actually used in present mining operations, or necessary for future operations, under any existing lease, and dispose of the remaining portion of the surface within such lease free and clear of any claim by the lessee, except for the purposes of future operations, prospecting, and for ingress and egress, as hereinafter reserved. \n\n\n\n\n","225":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWORK v. U S EX REL MOSIER(1923)\nNo. 25\nArgued: Decided: March 19, 1923\n\n\n\n\n[261 U.S. 352, 353]\n\u00a0\n This writ of error brings in review a judgment of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, affirming a judgment of mandamus against the Secretary of the Interior commanding him to pay to the relators all the moneys due their minor children, members of the tribe of Osage Indians of Oklahoma by reason of the distributions made under the Act of June 28, 1906 (34 Stat. 539), including their respective shares of bonus moneys paid the Secretary for oil leases made by the Tribal Council.\n The relators are W. T. Mosier and Louisa Mosier, members of the Osage Tribe of Indians and enrolled as such under the Act of Congress of June 28, 1906 (34 Stat. 539), and are parents of John T. Mosier, Edwin P. Mosier, Luther C. Mosier and Agnes C. Mosier, also enrolled members of the same tribe, who are minors and in the care and keeping of the relators.\n In their petition, after reference to the provisions of the law of 1906 and their history, they allege that the Secretary of the Interior has refused to pay them certain income due them under the statute as parents of these minors, and has imposed on payment thereof conditions and limitations unauthorized by the act and beyond his power to impose. The Secretary answered admitting his refusal, and asserting that under the statute he and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs were vested with a discretion to protect the interest of the minors, and that his refusal was in the exercise of that discretion. The facts are shown in the admissions in the pleadings and by a stipulation. They can be better understood after a state- \n\n[261 U.S. 352, 354]\n\u00a0\n ment of the act whose construction is the subject-matter of the controversy.\n The act of 1906, supra, entitled 'An act for the division of the lands and funds of the Osage Indians in Oklahoma territory, and for other purposes,' provided for the enrollment of the tribe including minors, and for the division of the land between them by selection, the selection for the minors being made by their parents, but forbade the sale of the oil, gas, coal or other minerals covered by the lands, the minerals being reserved to the use of the tribe for a period of twenty-five years, the royalties to be paid to the tribe. The act directed that the gas, oil, coal and other minerals should become the property of the individual owner of the land at the end of that period unless otherwise provided. Section 3 of the act directs the leasing of oil, gas and other mineral rights in these lands by the Tribal Council under such rules and regulations as the Secretary may direct and with his approval, provided 'that the royalties to be paid to the Osage Tribe under any mineral lease so made shall be determined by the President of the United States.' The effect of the act was to give to each member of the tribe three selections of land, part of which was to be a homestead and the remainder surplus land, all to be farmed by him for 25 years and to become his absolute property at the end of that time. Under section 4, funds belonging to the tribe and derived from various sources were to be held by the United States as trustee for 25 years, and the interest as earned thereon was to be divided between the members of the tribe. In addition, under the second paragraph of section 4, the royalty received from oil, gas, coal and other mineral leases and all moneys secured from the sale of town lots a d other lands of the tribe, and from rent of grazing lands, were to be distributed to the members of the tribe as income, payable quarterly. Thus the members of the tribe were \n\n[261 U.S. 352, 355]\n\u00a0\n to share in two kinds of property, first, homesteads and farm lands and their proceeds; and, second, income from the sources above mentioned. So far as minors were concerned, the methods of distribution of the income from the two kinds were described in somewhat different language. The directions as to proceeds from lands is in section 7 as follows:\n'That the lands herein provided for are set aside for the sole use and benefit of the individual members of the tribe entitled thereto, or to their heirs, as herein provided; and said members, or their heirs, shall have the right to use and to lease said lands for farming, grazing, or any other purpose not otherwise specifically provided for herein, and said members shall have full control of the same, including the proceeds thereof: Provided, that parents of minor members of the tribe shall have the control and use of said minors' lands, together with the proceeds of the same, until said minors arrive at their majority: And provided further, that all leases given on said lands for the benefit of the individual members of the tribe entitled thereto, or for their heirs, shall be subject only to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.'\n\n The first paragraph of section 4 prescribes the method of distributing the income from the second kind of property and directs that it shall be paid quarterly to the members entitled except in case of minors, in which case it shall be paid quarterly--\n'to the parents until said minor arrives at twenty one years: Provided, that if the Commissioner of Indian Affairs becomes satisfied that the said interest of any minor is being misused or squandered he may withhold the payment of such interest: And provided further, that said interest of minors whose parents are deceased shall be paid to their legal guardians, as above provided.'\n\n For 10 years, after the act, the sums due the minors were small and were evidently not more than enough to \n\n[261 U.S. 352, 356]\n\u00a0\n furnish reasonable support of the minors by the parents; but thereafter by the increase in the value of the oil and gas properties, the income payable grew to such amounts that Secretary of Interior Lane, who was the first defendant herein, deemed it his duty to take action to prevent a sacrifice of the minors' income and through the Commissioner of Indian Affairs called for accounts from the parents of the manner of the disposition of minors' income paid them. He issued an order that the income should be devoted solely to the care and use of the minor whose income it was, that any other use would be misuse, and that no more than $ 50 a month would be paid to the parents on account of a minor's share, unless a specific showing was made that the funds were being used for the specific benefit of each particular child. As already shown, the royalties on mineral leases were fixed by the President. As the mineral properties became more valuable and after a general lease known as the 'Foster lease' was ended, the practice was initiated with approval of the Secretary of putting up the privilege of leasing particular mineral properties at auction. Large sums as down payments in addition to the royalties as fixed by the President were realized, inuring to the benefit of the tribe. The Secretary held that these sums, called 'bonuses,' were not royalties, but should be deposited in the Treasury as part of the trust funds for the tribe held by the United States, and that only the interest therefrom should be distributed. The Comptroller of the Treasury ruled against this view, at least so far as to hold that there was no authority of law for such an interest bearing deposit in the United States Treasury. 23 Comptroller's Decisions, 483, 486. Nevertheless the Secretary withheld payment of minors' interest therein from the parents. While it was admitted that many of the O ages are idle, wasteful, extravagant, and improvident, it was also admitted that the relators were not so. The stipulation of facts \n\n[261 U.S. 352, 357]\n\u00a0\n showed that at no time prior to the rendition of accounts by the relators under the order of April 26, 1917, had the Indian Commissioner ever determined that the relators had misused or squandered the funds, that relators' accounts theretofore showed that the funds paid them were providently expended for the direct use and benefit of the minors or were invested and retained for their ultimate use and benefit, but that since April 26, 1917, the relators had neglected and refused to render any accounting and the Commissioner had been without information on which to determine whether the funds were being misused or squandered.\n Mr. C. Edward Wright of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. T. J. Leahy, of Pawhuska, Okl., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The questions presented are, first, the proper classification of bonuses under the statute; second, the validity of the conditions imposed by the Secretary on the payment of the minors' incomes to the parents; and third, the propriety of mandamus as a remedy in this case.\n The bonus which was the result of bidding for desirable and profitable oil and gas leases secured for the members of the Osage Tribe the just value of the use of their property which the fixing of royalties in advance by the President was not adapted to give them. It was in effect a supplement to the royalties already determined. It was really part of the royalty or rental in a lump sum or down \n\n[261 U.S. 352, 358]\n\u00a0\n payment. We do not see how it can be classified as anything else. It was income from the use of the mineral resources of the land. Of course, it involved a consumption and reduction of the mineral value of the land, but so does a royalty. This is an inevitable characteristic of income from the product of the mine. What was intended to be distributed to the members of the tribe was the income from the mineral deposits in their lands, and the bonus was part of that. Doubtless Congress had in mind regular annual or quarterly equal payments when it used the word 'royalties,' and did not anticipate such large down payments. But in the unexpected event, we must decide under what head the bonus is to be treated, whether as capital or income, and it seems clear to us that, in view of the entire statute, it is more aptly described by the latter term.\n Nor is the settlement of this question a matter of discretionary construction by the Secretary. The Act of June 28, 1906 (34 Stat. 539), was enacted to make a definite disposition of the Osage Indians' resources. Except those which were sold outright or were kept as tribal lands for grazing, all lands were divided between the members of the tribe, adults and minors, share and share alike, for individual use for every purpose except the production of minerals, and at the end of 25 years the parcels were to vest absolutely in the respective individuals or their heirs. On the other hand, the funds of the tribe were to be kept by the United States in its treasury, and interest thereon was to be paid quarterly to the members, share and share alike. In addition to this interest, there was also to be distributed as they fell due, the royalties from leases of mineral rights, the proceeds of the sale of certain lands already referred to and the rentals from the grazing lands. The question whether bonuses were to be included in royalties is a matter of statutory construction, not finally intrusted to the discretion of the Secretary, \n\n[261 U.S. 352, 359]\n\u00a0\n but determinable in court at the instance of the beneficiaries as of right.\n Having thus determined that the duty of the Secretary to pay this income to the adult members of the tribe is ministerial, we come now to the question how much discretion the statute gives him in withholding payment from minors. In respect to the incom from the distributed lands, the Secretary has no duty whatever. The lands of the minors are given over to the custody and use of the parents, who can cultivate or lease them and apply the proceeds as they see fit. Congress evidently intended to trust to the natural disposition of the parents to look after and care for their children out of the proceeds, and to allow them to treat the proceeds of the inalienable lands as a family fund, to be administered by them until the children should reach their majority. It was probably anticipated that the proceeds of a minor's land from agriculture only would not be large, and could not greatly exceed, if indeed it would equal, the expense his care and support would entail on the family.\n With respect to the payment of income from United States bonds, mineral leases, sale of extra lands, and grazing rents, belonging to minors, Congress seems to have had a similar view; but it did vest in the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, subject to the supervision of the Secretary of the Interior, discretion to see that its confidence in the natural parental feeling as a motive for care of the minors' interest in such income should not be abused, and whenever he found misuse or squandering by the parents of the income he was given authority to withhold payment.\n The record shows that the Secretary enlarged this discretion vested in him and his subordinate into a power to lay down regulations, limiting in advance the amount to be paid to the parents to a certain monthly rate, and declaring that no use of the funds would be permitted which \n\n[261 U.S. 352, 360]\n\u00a0\n did not inure to the separate benefit of the minor. He was led to take this action, which was a departure from the previous practice of the Department during the decade immediately following the passage of the act, because of the sudden increase in the income of the minors resulting from the bonuses given for mineral leases. However desirable such regulations were, in view of the changed circumstances, we think they were in the nature of legislation beyond the power of the Secretary. Congress has since met the need by an amendment to the act of 1906 by the Act of March 3, 1921 (41 Stat. 1249).\n The direction to the Secretary to pay to the parents the income due to the minors is clear and positive. It is that the income 'shall be paid quarterly to the parents until said minor arrives at the age of twenty-one years.' The proviso, 'That if the commissioner of Indian Affairs becomes satisfied that the said interest of any minor is being used or squandered he may withhold the payment,' did not confer on him a power to determine in advance by general limitation a monthly rate in excess of which what was due minors should not be paid to parents, nor did it enable him to require before payment a showing that the income beyond such limited monthly rate was being used for the specific benefit of each child. Congress evidently intended that the Commissioner should through his agents keep track of the conduct of parents in the use of the income of their children and necessarily vested him and the Secretary with power to require an account of how the income was being used; but this was not a regulatory function to be exercised in advance of payment which is positively enjoined. The proviso imposes on the Commissioner the duty of supervising each case and determining from the circumstances whether there has been, in cases of payments made, misuse or squandering, and, if so, of withholding further payment on account of it. No bond is required of the parents as would be in case of a \n\n[261 U.S. 352, 361]\n\u00a0\n guardian to whom the income is to be paid in the absence of parents, and it was the evident purpose of Congress, in view of the then comparatively small amount of the probable income, to allow it when there was a family to go into the family funds for the support of the family and of the minors as part of the family. This was the intent in respect to the annual proceeds from the land allotted to the minors, and the same purpose may be inferred as to the income from the funds and royalties, qualified, of course, by the proviso in order to prevent a perversion or squandering of it which would defeat this purpose.\n We come, then, in our view of the statute, to consider the correctness of the judgment of mandamus of the District Supreme Court as affirmed by the District Court of Appeals. The opinion of the Supreme Court which was adopted by the Court of Appeals, closes as follows:\n'The conclusion is that the second question must be answered to the effect that the respondent cannot limit the amount to be paid to the relators as the parents of their minor children from the moneys distributable to them under the law, but can require from them the submission of periodical statements of accounts showing in detail the expenditure of the moneys so received. With this limitation on the scope of the writ of mandamus prayed for, it will issue as prayed.\n\n'And it is so ordered.'\n\n But the judgment actually entered and affirmed is as follows:\n'Ordered and adjudged that the prayers of the petition be and the same are hereby granted and the writ of mandamus be issued herein directed to the respondent, commanding him to deliver, or cause to be delivered to the plaintiffs all the moneys due their minor children, members of the tribe of Osage Indians of Oklahoma, by reason of the distributions made in virtue of the act of June 28, 1906 (34 Stats. 539), prior to the filing of the bill in \n\n[261 U.S. 352, 362]\n\u00a0\n this cause, including their respective shares of bonus moneys distributable as royalties under said act.'\n\n This is broad and unconditional and cannot be sustained. The relators had refused and neglected to give an accounting of the funds last paid to them for the minors and the Commissioner and Secretary were entitled to withhold future payments until the Commissioner was by such accounting enabled to determine whether in his judgment there was a misuse or squandering of the income then being expended. The fact that in the past the relators had satisfactorily accounted for money received is not sufficient. The Commissioner was entitled to the latest information before acting. The principles governing the issuing of the writ of mandamus in such cases have been much considered by us. Hall v. Payne, \n254 U.S. 343\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 131; Alaska Smoke less Coal Co. v. Lane, \n250 U.S. 549\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 33; Ness v. Fisher, \n223 U.S. 683\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 356; Riverside Oil Co. v. Hitchcock, \n190 U.S. 316\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 698. Subject to the construction we have put upon the statute, the discretion is vested in the Commissioner to determine in each case whether in his judgment there has been misuse or squandering, and, within the same limitation, to decide what is misuse or squandering. Until he has had a full opportunity to exercise this discretion, neither he nor the Secretary can be compelled by mandamus to make the payment, and if in its exercise, he does not act capriciously, arbitrarily or beyond the scope of his authority, the writ will not issue at all.\n Our conclusion is that the petition for the mandamus in this case should be dismissed without prejudice to the filing of another petition after the relators shall have made the requisite accounting of the moneys of the minors paid them down to the date of filing, and shall have submitted the same to the Commissioner, and after the failure, if there be such, of the Commissioner and the Secretary within a reasonable time to exercise the discretion vested in them under the statute as we have construed \n\n[261 U.S. 352, 363]\n\u00a0\n and limited it in the foregoing opinion. The case is therefore reversed and remanded to the Supreme Court of the District, with instruction to dismiss the petition accordingly. \n\n\n\n","226":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWYMAN v.

Molloy, of Yuma, Ariz., for appellants.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Riter, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice sutherland delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Yuma County Water Users' Association is a corporation organized primarily to represent the settlers on the Yuma irrigation project in Arizona in their dealings with the government. The other appellants are shareholders and owners of tracts of land under the project. \n\n[262 U.S. 138, 140]\n\u00a0\n On April 8, 1904, the Secretary of the Interior received the report of a board of consulting engineers, made at his request, giving alternate estimates of the cost of the project, and recommending that $3,000,000 be set aside for construction. This report was followed by a letter from the Director of the Geological Survey, joining in the recommendation and, among other things, saying:\n In general the reports indicate that, by means of construction of a dam across Colorado river and other works, it will be possible to reclaim upwards of 85,000 acres of land at a cost of less than $40 per acre. ...\n'The land is extremely fertile in character, the climate is somewhat tropical, and the products have such value per acre that it is believed that the cost of $40 per acre is not prohibitive.\n\n'There are a large number of alternatives to be considered and difficult problems to be solved, but the matter has developed from the engineering side to a point where it is possible to consider the larger features, and to set aside provisionally a sufficient sum of money to carry out the work, contingent upon satisfactory arrangements being made with the owners of lands and vested rights and the complete solution of other matters now pending.'\n\n The Secretary, on May 10, 1904, replied approving the recommendation. Correspondence ensued between the Water Users' Association and the officials of the Reclamation Service, and on May 28, 1904, a meeting between them was had. It does not seem necessary to give the details of this correspondence or of the meeting. It suffices to say that, throughtout, the officials declared that in their opinion the project would cost at the rate of about $35 per acre, and the water users joined in the enterprise under that belief. True, it was stated that this sum might be increased or lessened as the work progressed, and the opinion was otherwise qualified; but it was evidently thought that the cost would not depart \n\n[262 U.S. 138, 141]\n\u00a0\n from the figures given to any great extent, one way or the other. Thereupon the landowners subscribed for shares in the association, binding themselves to pay the cost of the project in proportion to their interests and pledging their lands as security to that end.\n On May 31, 1906, the association, acting for its shareholders, entered into an agreement with the government by which it was stipulated: That the Secretary should determine the number of acres capable of irrigation under the project; that payments should be divided into not less than ten equal annual installments, the first payable at the time of the completion of the works or within a reasonable time thereafter and after due notice from the Secretary; and that the cost per acre should be equal throughout the district. And the association agrees 'that it will promptly collect or require prompt payment in such manner as the Secretary of the Interior may direct, and hereby guarantees the payments for that part of the cost of the irrigation works, which shall be apportioned by the Secretary of the Interior to its shareholders. ...' The contract is silent as to the amount of the cost and nowhere suggests that it had already been fixed.\n It does not appear that a definite plan of construction was determined upon until after the meeting in 1904; the report of the engineers contains no estimate in respect of the works as they were finally constructed; and no construction contract was made until June, 1905. In the process of construction, great and unexpected difficulties were encountered. The contractors finding themselves unable to proceed, abandoned their contract, and the government was forced to take upon itself the burden of completing the work. The ultimate cost was more than double what had been anticipated. The project was finally completed, as found by both lower courts, on April 6, 1917, and on that date public notice was given \n\n[262 U.S. 138, 142]\n\u00a0\n by the Secretary, imposing upon the water users a construction charge of $ 75 per acre. This notice complies with the provisions of section 4 of the Reclamation Act, 32 Stat. 388, 389, c. 1093 (Comp. St.  4703), printed in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Appellants (plaintiffs) brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona to enjoin the defendants, who were officials of the Reclamation Service, from putting into operation the determination of the Secretary so as to exact a greater sum than $ 5.28 per acre. The court, after a trial, found in favor of the government and dismissed the bill, and its action was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (275 Fed. 885), from whose decree the case comes here by appeal.\n The pleadings are voluminous, much testimony was taken at the trial, and a large number of errors have been assigned. After eliminating from consideration those matters which are clearly immaterial or without merit, two questions remain. They are: \n\n[262 U.S. 138, 143]\n\u00a0\n (1) Whether the report, correspondence and statements made in 1904 constituted an estimate of the cost of the project and a public notice, under the terms of section 4; and, if not, whether the notice of 1917 may be so regarded?\n\n\n (2)\n Whether the project was completed on April 6, 1917, within the meaning of the contract of 1906?\n First. It is contended by appellants that the report of the engineers, the correspondence among the officials and with the Water Users' Association and the statements made at the meeting in 1904, taken together, constitute an estimate of cost binding on the government, and, though informal, a compliance with section 4 as to public notice. That it was the firm belief of the government officials that the cost of the project would not greatly, if at all, exceed $35 and acre, and that their opinion to that effect was given to the Water Users' Association, by the documents and statements referred to, does not admit of doubt. It seems clear that the water users relied upon these expressions of opinion, and it may be assumed that, if they had known in the beginning that the cost was to be as much as $75 per acre, they would not have gone forward with the enterprise. But however confidently these opinions were expressed, and however much they may have influenced the water users, the attendant circumstances, the language employed, and the statutory requirements all preclude the idea that they constitute an estimate of the cost as contemplated by the statute. No element of fraud or bad faith is shown or suggested. The Reclamation Act sets aside all money received from the sale and disposal of public lands in certain states and territories named for the reclamation of the arid lands therein; and this fund is to be kept intact as nearly as possible, by collecting from the water users under each project the estimated cost of the construction thereof. See Swigart v. Baker, \n229 \nU.S. 187, 197\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 645. The extent to which the fund will be preserved, obviously, will depend \n\n[262 U.S. 138, 144]\n\u00a0\n upon the accuracy of the estimate, and this, in turn, will depend upon the care exercised in securing information upon which to base it. Investigation as to the feasibility of any project, opinions of experts, and collection of data relating to the question of cost must precede such an estimate, and section 4, moreover, requires that the charges against water users shall not be assessed until after construction contracts shall have been made, the evident purpose being to put the Secretary in possession of the data furnished by the contracts themselves before he acts in that respect. Prior to the making of the construction contracts, opinions expressed by engineers or officials may be estimates in one sense; but they are tentative and preliminary, and cannot be regarded as constituting the required statutory estimate, though contributing to the basic facts upon which it is made. See Payette-Boise Water Users' Ass'n v. Cole (D. C.) 263 Fed. 734, 738, 739. The statute contemplates a precise and formal public notice which must state the lands irrigable under the project, the limit of area for each entry, the charges to be made per acre, the number of annual installments and the time when the payments, shall commence. The opinions, correspondence, and statements relied upon do not fulfill the statutory requirements, and we must hold that the government is neither bound nor estopped by them. Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 389, 408\n, 409 S., 37 Sup. Ct. 387; Pine River Logging Co. v. United States, \n186 \nU.S. 279, 291\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 920; Whiteside et al. v. United States, \n93 \nU.S. 247, 256\n, 257 S.; The Floyd Acceptances, 7 Wall. 666, 676; Filor v. United States, 9 Wall. 45, 49; Hart v. United States, \n95 U.S. 316\n; Lee v. Munro, 7 Cranch, 366. Moreover, the contract of 1906, made subsequently, expressly provides for payment on the part of the water users 'for that part of the cost of the irrigation works which shall be apportioned by the Secretary of the Interior to its shareholders.' Plainly this looked forward to \n\n[262 U.S. 138, 145]\n\u00a0\n future action on his part, and did not rest upon any action already taken.\n Following the provisions requiring the Secretary to determine the practicability of the project and to make construction contracts the words are 'and thereupon he shall give public notice,' etc. The word 'thereupon' is construed by appellants as an adverb of time, meaning immediately thereafter. But this is only one of its uses. It is employed more frequently to express the relation of cause or of condition precedent. It is in the latter sense that it is used here, and its meaning is that the determination as to the practicability of the project and the making of contracts are precedent conditions to the estimate of cost and public notice. See Porphyry Paving Co. v. Ancker, 104 Cal. 340, 342, 37 Pac. 1050. The notice must follow the coming into existence of the conditions. The time thereafter within which it shall be given is left, and from the nature of the matter must be left, to the discretion of the Secretary, and whether that discretion has been unreasonably exercised will depend upon the circumstances of each case. Here it is made plain that performance of the construction contract became impossible and the same was abandoned. Acting upon its judgment, which so far as the record shows was not unreasonable, the government then itself undertook the completion of the work. Physical conditions not originally foreseen were encountered, presenting difficulties and requiring increased expenditures of great magnitude. It does not appear that these expenditures were made unnecessarily or improvidently; nor is there anything in the record to indicate that the work was not done with reasonable expedition. The uncertainties arising from the newly discovered conditions, the abandonment of the construction work by the contractors, the changes which were necessitated in the original plans, and the unexpected turn of events in other respects, left the question of cost in such doubt as to justify withholding \n\n[262 U.S. 138, 146]\n\u00a0\n the public notice until it could rest on more definite information. The delay, it is true, was long continued but, under all the circumstances, we cannot say as a matter of law, that it was undue or that the Secretary's discretion in respect of time was unreasonably exercised.\n Second. The contract of May 31, 1906, provides that the first installment shall be payable at the time of the completion of the proposed works, and appellants contend that in two respects they were not completed on April 6, 1917, when the public notice was given: (1) That complete drainage for one of the tracts was not provided; and (2) that only one of three tracts which the government promised to reclaim was reclaimed.\n As to the first point, it is sufficient to say that the testimony shows that the contemplated drainage was substantially completed, and fails to show that the small portion left undone detracted in any way from the effectiveness of the system.\n As to the second point, the original plans disclose that it was the intention to reclaim the three tracts mentioned, but the Secretary reserved the right to make such changes 'as further investigations and circumstances may dictate to be requisite for the public welfare.' The elimination, therefore, of the two tracts was within his discretion. Moreover, while these tracts were not reclaimed, other lands of greater area were added to the project which much more than counterbalanced any injury to the water users here concerned that might otherwise have resulted from the omission. The Secretary determined that the project had been completed when the public notice was given and both lower courts concurred in the same finding. These findings will be accepted here in the absence of clear error, which the record before us does not show. Bodkin v. Edwards, \n255 U.S. 221\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 268; Brewer-Elliott, etc., Co. v.
