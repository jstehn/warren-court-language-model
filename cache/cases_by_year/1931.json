States Supreme Court\nABIE STATE BANK v. WEAVER(1931)\nNo. 63\nArgued: January 30, 1931Decided: February 25, 1931\n\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 765, 767]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Leonard A. Flansburg, of Lincoln, Neb., and Frank H. Gaines, of Omaha, Neb., for appellant.\n Messrs. C. A. Sorensen, of Lincoln, Neb., and Charles E. Abbott, of Fremont, Neb., for appellees Bryan, Governor, et al.\n Mr. Wm. J. Hotz, of Omaha, Neb., for intervening appellees Mary E. Gandy et al.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in December, 1928, in the district court of Lancaster county, Neb., by the Abie State Bank on its own behalf and that of several hundred other banks, all chartered under the laws of Nebraska, to enjoin the defendants from collecting special assessments under the Bank Guaranty Law of that state. The plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the statute authorizing the levy of such special assessments, upon the ground that their collection constituted the taking of the plaintiffs' property without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. A number of depositors in the state banks were permitted to intervene. The district court entered a decree in April, 1929, in favor of the complainants, sustaining the contention that the statute providing for such special assessments was, under the facts shown, \n\n[282 U.S. 765, 768]\n\u00a0\n unreasonable and confiscatory, and hence repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment. The decree, which gave a permanent injunction, was reversed by the Supreme Court of Nebraska; the injunction was dissolved and the action dismissed. 119 Neb. 153, 227 N. W. 922. The plaintiffs appeal to this court.\n The Bank Guaranty Law of Nebraska was originally enacted in the year 1909. Laws of Nebraska, 1909, c. 10, p. 87; Compiled Statutes of Nebraska 1922,  8024 et seq. Its purpose was declared to be to provide a guaranty fund for the protection of depositors in banks, and every corporation engaged in the business of banking under the laws of the state was declared to be subject to assessment to be levied and applied in the manner stated. Banks were required to report semiannually to the state banking board, succeeded by the department of trade and commerce, their average daily deposits, and it was made the duty of that department twice each year to levy upon each bank an assessment (after certain prescribed initial payments) in the amount of one-twentieth of 1 per cent. of the average daily deposits reported. By section 8028, as amended in 1923 (Laws of 1923, c. 191, p. 452), it was provided that, if the depositors' guaranty fund should be reduced from any cause to any amount less than 1 per cent. of the average daily deposits, the department of trade and commerce should levy, against the capital stock of the corporations concerned, a special assessment not exceeding one-half of 1 per cent. of said average daily deposits in any one year. In case of noncompliance with the provisions of the statute, the Attorney General was to obtain the appointment of a receiver; and, by an amendment in 1925 (Laws of 1925, c. 30, p. 22) , the department of trade and commerce, if its order was not obeyed, was authorized forthwith to take possession of the property and business of the bank and place it in charge of the guar- \n\n[282 U.S. 765, 769]\n\u00a0\n antee fund commission, established in 1923 for the purpose of assisting in conserving and administering the guaranty fund (Laws of 1923, c. 191). It was further provided that, in case a bank failed, and its assets were insufficient to meet the claims of depositors, the court should determine the amount of the deficiency and direct the department of trade and commerce to draw against the guaranty fund in the amount required to make up the deficiency. Claims of depositors were to be paid according to priority of adjudication.\n Acting under the authority of the statute, the department of trade and commerce for several years made an additional semiannual assessment against the complaining banks of one-fourth of 1 per cent. of the average daily deposits. The result was that the total assessment against each of these banks had become an annual charge in the amount of six-tenths of 1 per cent. of their total average daily deposits.\n This suit was begun immediately after the levy, on December 15, 1928, of a special assessment of one-fourth of 1 per cent. of the average daily deposits of the complaining banks, and the plaintiffs asked for an injunction restraining the collection of that special assessment and of any future special assessment called for by section 8028. The contention of the plaintiffs was that the Bank Guaranty Law no longer bore a rational relation to any public purpose, as the collection of the assessments in question took away from the security of present depositors in going banks in order to pay the depositors in failed banks, and was without hope or tendency of furnishing protection to present depositors. It was insisted that, instead of the challenged assessment creating a fund for the safeguarding of depositors in going banks, as was its purpose, it directly defeated that object, and that its imposition constituted an unconstitutional burden because of its confiscatory character. \n\n[282 U.S. 765, 770]\n\u00a0\n The district court reviewed the results of the operations of the banks in Nebraska under the Bank Guaranty Law. It appeared that there were 1,012 banks in the state in November, 1920, and that the number had been reduced to 726 in December, 1928; that these banks had a total capital of $ 19,001,000 and a total capital and surplus of $24,958,557.62; that for the period of eighteen months preceding June 30, 1928, 570 banks had net earnings and 156 had net deficits; that the total net earnings of both groups for that period amounted to.$1,935,519.40, or 7.9 per cent. of the total capital and surplus; that, during the same period, these banks had paid into the depositors' guaranty fund $2,412,324.78. It also appeared from the testimony of the secretary of the guarantee fund commission (as stated by the Supreme Court of the state) that up to December 31, 1928, 269 state banks had been closed by the state and placed in the hands of the commission, and that the total amount of the adjudicated claims was $ 10,536,518.59, exclusive of interest; and that in 72 state banks, then being operated as going concerns, the amount due depositors was $13,726, 441.26, and the total amount due depositors in banks which were in receiverships, but whose claims were not yet adjudicated, was $2,133,627. 54. The total claims, including both claims adjudicated and those not adjudicated, or the then existing liabilities against the guaranty fund, amounted to $26,400,282.76, and the total amount of assets to be realized would be.$10,451,932.65, leaving a deficit of.$15,948,350.11. The court concluded that 'fully two-thirds of the banks under the existing financial conditions are unable, after paying assessments amounting to 8 per cent. of their capital, to pay compensatory dividends,' and that the Bank Guaranty Law, as originally conceived, was 'no longer serving its purposes.'\n Reversing the decree of the district court in favorof the plaintiffs, the Supreme Court of the state sustained \n\n[282 U.S. 765, 771]\n\u00a0\n the validity of the continued operation of the Bank Guaranty Law and entered judgment stating that 'the levy of a special assessment upon the state banks,' pursuant to the provisions of the applicable statute, 'does not constitute the taking of private property without due process of law.' The grounds of the decision of the Supreme Court of the state, in reversing the judgment of the district court, were thus stated in the syllabus of the opinion:\n'1. 'The banking business, carried on pursuant to a state charter, is quasi public, and, for protection of the public and in its interests, is subject to reasonable regulation by the state.' Citizens' State Bank v. Strayer, 114 Neb. 567, 208 N. W. 662.\n\n'2. It is elementary that it is not within the province of the courts to annul a legislative act unless its provisions so clearly contravene a provision of the fundamental law, or it is so clearly against public policy, that no other resort remains.\n\n'3. Where a state bank has accepted the benefits arising from the deposits of money pursuant to the terms of the bank depositors' guaranty law, such bank should not be heard, in a proper case, to make complaint of a special assessment upon such deposits which has been levied for the benefit of the depositors' guaranty fund.\n\n'4. Where a special assessment has been levied upon the state banks pursuant to the provisions of section 8028, Comp. St. 1922, as amended by section 26, c. 191, Laws 1923, such assessment does not constitute the taking of private property without due process.'\n\n In answer to the jurisdictional statement filed by the appellants, the appellees asserted the want of jurisdiction in this court, upon two grounds: (1) That this court conclusively adjudicated the validity of the Nebraska law against appellant in the suit heretofore brought on its behalf (Shallenberger v. First State Bank of Holstein, \n\n[282 U.S. 765, 772]\n\u00a0\n \n219 \nU.S. 114\n, 31 S. Ct. 189); and (2) that the decision of the Supreme Court of the state, in its ruling with respect to the question of estoppel, rested upon an independent nonfederal ground. The question of jurisdiction was postponed to the hearing on the merits.\n As to the first objection, it is sufficient to say that the Bank Guaranty Law was sustained by this court as a police regulation ( Shallenberger v. First State Bank of Holstein, supra; Noble State Bank v. Haskell, \n219 \nU.S. 104\n, 31 S. Ct. 186, 32 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1062, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 487; Id., \n219 \nU.S. 575\n, 31 S. Ct. 299), and that a police regulation, although valid when made, may become, by reason of later events, arbitrary and confiscatory in operation (Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., \n282 \nU.S. 133, 162\n, 51 S. Ct. 65; Allen v. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Railway Co., \n230 \nU.S. 553, 555\n, 556 S., 33 S. Ct. 1030; Lincoln Gas & Electric Co. v. City of Lincoln, \n250 \nU.S. 256, 268\n, 39 S. Ct. 454). In the Shallenberger Case, the suit was brought immediately upon the enactment of the law, and that decision sustaining the law cannot be regarded as precluding a subsequent suit for the purpose of testing the validity of assessments in the lights of the later actual experience.\n In support of the second objection, and in answer to the contention of the appellants that the findings of fact by the trial court had not been modified by the Supreme Court, the appellees point to the plenary character of the jurisdiction of the latter court in equity cases, and to the statute which makes it necessary for that court to try the case de novo and to 'reach an independent conclusion as to what finding or findings are required under the pleadings and all the evidence.' Section 9150, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska 1922; Colby v. Foxworthy, 80 Neb. 239, 114 N. W. 174; Id., 80 Neb. 245, 115 N. W. 1076. The appellees insist that, reading together the syllabus and the text of the opinion (Old Colony Trust Co. v. Omaha, \n230 \nU.S. 100, 16\n, 33 S. Ct. 967), it appears that the Supreme Court, exercising its proper authority, made an independent finding as to the waiver or estoppel which the appellees had pleaded in defense. \n\n[282 U.S. 765, 773]\n\u00a0\n But the federal ground being present, it is incumbent upon this court, when it is urged that the decision of the state court rests upon a nonfederal ground, to ascertain for itself, in order that constitutional guaranties may appropriately be enforced, whether the asserted nonfederal ground independently and adequately supports the judgment. Enterprise Irrigation District v. Farmers' Mutual Canal Co., \n243 \nU.S. 157, 164\n, 37 S. Ct. 318, 321; Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n248 \nU.S. 67, 69\n, 70 S., 39 S. Ct. 24, 25; Ward v. Board of County Com'rs of Love County, \n253 \nU.S. 17, 22\n, 40 S. Ct. 419; Broad River Power Co. v. South Carolina, \n281 \nU.S. 537, 540\n, 50 S. Ct. 401; Id., \n282 \nU.S. 187\n, 51 S. Ct. 94. As this court said in Enterprise Irrigation District v. Farmers' Mutual Canal Co., supra: 'But where the non-federal ground is so interwoven with the other as not to be an independent matter, or is not of sufficient breadth to sustain the judgment without any decision of the other, our jurisdiction is plain.' See Creswill v. Grand Lodge Knights of Pythias, \n225 \nU.S. 246, 261\n, 32 S. Ct. 822\n\n\n In reaching its conclusion, the Supreme Court of the State referred to the testimony, already mentioned, of the secretary of the guarantee fund commission, with respect to the state of the guaranty fund, and to his further testimony that 'the majority of the losses sustained by the banks resulted from loans made prior to 1923 during the deflation period.' The court said that since 1919 the total amount of bank assessments was $ 14,609,576.65 which had been paid over and become a part of the guaranty fund; that it appeared from the evidence of the president of one of the largest Nebraska state banks 'that he was active in the publication of 2, 000 pamphlets which were distributed generally in respect of the establishment of the guaranty fund,' and that he 'was also chairman of a committee of three bankers by whom this suit was begun'; that in 1926 'full-page newspaper advertisements, attractively featured with pictures and aptly prepared reading matter' were published in one of \n\n[282 U.S. 765, 774]\n\u00a0\n Omaha's leading newspapers, stressing 'the proposed protection that was shortly to be afforded the depositors of money in the state banks'; that it was stated in these advertisements that 336 banks, which were listed, had 'paidtheir pro rata share of the cost of publication'; and that wide circulation was given to the enterprise, 'in practically every town and its suburbs where a state bank was located,' in a manner calculated to attract the favorable attention, and the patronage, of those having money for deposit. \n1\n The court concluded that the evidence clearly showed 'that a majority of the state bankers throughout Nebraska, and many others as well, counted the bank depositors' guaranty fund, in its inception, a valuable asset, and many predicted that this beneficent plan would add greatly to the stability of the state banks.' \n2\n The court referred to the testimony of the cashier of a bank in Lincoln, Neb., that in his opin- \n\n[282 U.S. 765, 775]\n\u00a0\n ion the failure of nearly 300 state banks had been 'caused largely by the general economic condition existing prior to 1928'; that he did not think that 'the bank assessments from 1923 to July 1, 1928, were a contributing factor in the failure of banks during that period'; that 'the guaranty fund law and the assessments collected thereunder had a steadying influence on the deposits of every state bank'; and, further, that 'it is no exaggeration to say it has accounted for at least one hundred million dollars deposited in the state banks of Nebraska which would not otherwise have been made except for the bank guaranty law.' The court cited the opinion of the witness that 'the coniti ons of the banks and their ability to pay the assessment is 'incomparably better than in 1923.\"\n The appellees, in amplification of the matters set forth in the opinion of the state court, urge that the banks continuously, from 1911 to the time of the suit, utilized the Bank Guaranty Law by advertising its adjudicated validity and the obligation of the banks to pay assessments, in order to induce deposits of public and private funds, and that this was accomplished not only 'by continuous and extensive newspaper publicity,' but 'by signs on the interior and exterior of banks, pamphlets, statements on checks and certificates of deposit and on deposit slips, by moving pictures, public speakers, resolutions at bankers' conventions, personal solicitation and argument.'\n So far as the facts summarized in the opinion of the state court, and in argument, may be deemed to oppose the evidence introduced to show the oppressive character of the Bank Guaranty Law, these facts bear upon the question whether the law had become so burdensome as to transcend in its operation the constitutional limits of state power. But if, as the appellants contend, the continued enforcement of the law in the conditions shown \n\n[282 U.S. 765, 776]\n\u00a0\n at the time of the suit did involve unconstitutional exactions, we should not be justified in refusing appropriate relief on the theory that the conduct of the banks in their endeavor to do business under the law and to make the best of the state's policy embodied in it estopped them from asserting constitutional right. The appellees say that, upon the original enactment of the Bank Guaranty Law and the decision of this court sustaining it, the state banks could have done one of three things: (1) Liquidate and invest their capital in some other business; (2) undertake to organize as a national bank; or (3) apply to the state banking department for a certificate of authority to operate under the Bank Guaranty Law. That is, the state banks had to comply with the law in order to continue in business as state banks. 'The fact that a choice was made according to interest does not exclude duress.' Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. Public Service Commission, supra. The fact that the banks, defeated in their attack on the law, fell into line with the policy of the state and proclaimed the purposes of the law and the contemplated advantages which had led to its enactment, cannot be regarded as depriving the banks of the opportunity of subsequently pointing out that the public purpose in view was no longer being served, and that the interests of the banks were being unreasonably sacrificedby confiscatory exactions in an effort the futility of which had been demonstrated. The banks were not bound for all time, regardless of consequences. The principle that a police regulation, valid when adopted, may become invalid because in its operation it has proved to be confiscatory, carries with it the recognition of the fact that earlier compliance with the regulation does not forfeit the right of protest when the regulation becomes intolerable. And we perceive no basis for a different rule because the regulation was extolled while being obeyed. We conclude that the constitutional question was properly raised and \n\n[282 U.S. 765, 777]\n\u00a0\n was decided, and that the judgment under review is not supported by an independent and adequate nonfederal ground. Hence the appeal was properly brought.\n Since the appeal, the situation has been altered by the passage, in March, 1930, by the Legislature of Nebraska, of an act (Laws 1930, Ex. Sess. c. 6) which repealed section 8028 (Compiled Statutes of Nebraska 1922), under which the assessment of December 15, 1928, challenged in this suit, was levied, and modified the provisions of the former Bank Guaranty Law by creating a 'depositors' final settlement fund' and providing for a limitation of future assessments. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[282 U.S. 765, 778]\n\u00a0\n This court takes judicial notice of this legislation. Owings v. Hull, 9 Pet. 607, 625; Hanley v. Donoghue, \n116 \nU.S. 1, 6\n, 6 S. Ct. 242; Lloyd v. Matthews, \n155 \nU.S. 222, 227\n, 15 S. Ct. 70. The \n\n[282 U.S. 765, 779]\n\u00a0\n act provides that the 'Depositors' Final Settlement Fund' shall consist of 'all property, monies, funds, proceeds, rights, credits, accounts and choses in action' arising \n\n[282 U.S. 765, 780]\n\u00a0\n from the assessments, regular and special, theretofore accrued and levied, for the purpose of maintaining or reimbursing what was formerly designated as the depositors' guaranty fund. Among these assessments, and specifically mentioned, are 'the special assessments levied by the Department of Trade and Commerce on or about December 15, 1928, April 17, 1929, and January 2, 1930, and the regular assessments accrued and levied on or about July 1, 1929, and January 1, 1930.' For the future, and for the purpose of providing a fund for depositors in state banks closed prior to the time of the new enactment, there is to be levied upon every state bank 'on the first day of January of each year during the period of ten years, beginning with the year 1931 and ending with the year 1940, inclusive,' an assessment of 'two tenths of one per cent of its average daily deposits during the year ending December 1st last preceding.' The effect of this provision is to reduce assessments for the future from a total annual amount of six-tenths of 1 per cent. of the average daily deposits (that is, including both the original regular assessment of one- tenth of 1 per cent. and the special assessments of five-tenths of 1 per cent.) to a total of two -tenths of 1 per cent. per annum for a period of ten years. \n\n[282 U.S. 765, 781]\n\u00a0\n The depositors' final settlement fund is to be distributed only to depositors in banks closed prior to the taking effect of the statute. The department of trade and commerce has authority to administer the fund and to institute and defend suits involving any claims or rights pertaining thereto. That department may grant, in its sound discretion, to any bank, an extension of time, not exceeding three years, from the date of the passage of the act, within which to pay any of the assessments theretofore levied against it.\n The appellees, who are state officers, urge that by this legislation the case has become moot. The appellants, and the appellees who are intervening depositors, assert the contrary, and we agree with the latter view. Despite the repeal of section 8028, the assessment of December 15, 1928, which was assailed in this suit, is continued in effect, and the amount due thereunder is made a part of the depositors' final settlement fund. The later special assessments, to which the new act refers (those of April 17, 1929, and January 2, 1930), also remain in force. While the repeal of section 8028 prevents further assessments under the old law, still assessments which were enjoined by the district court, and which were sustained by the judgment of the Supreme Court, are to be paid, and the amounts are to be applied as the act of 1930 directs. If, taking into consideration the limitations of the new legislation, the appellants could still be considered to have constitutional grounds for objecting to the collection of the special assessments which were the subject of their petition, they are not deprived of their right by the statute which leaves them with liability for those assessments. It would still be possible for this court to grant appropriate relief. Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Tafoya, \n270 \nU.S. 426, 433\n, 46 S. Ct. 331. See Groesbeck v. Duluth, South Shore & Atlantic Railway Co., \n250 \nU.S. 607, 609\n, 40 S. Ct. 38; Boston v. Jackson, \n260 \nU.S. 309, 313\n, 43 S. Ct. 129.\n\n\n[282 U.S. 765, 782]\n\u00a0\n While the case has not become moot, the questions raised by the appellants must be considered in the light of the modifying legislation, which has restricted in an important degree their liability to assessments, and has provided for what is, in substance, a liquidation of the guaranty scheme. The appellees, intervening depositors, insist that by their deposits in the state banks they acquired contractual rights which cannot be affected by the later legislation. In support of this contention, these appellees refer to the observation of the dissenting opinion in Lankford v. Platte Iron Works, \n235 \nU.S. 461, 487\n, 35 S. Ct. 173, that the Bank Guaranty Law of Oklahoma prescribed a contract between the banks and the depositors and expressed the terms in which it should be made. The point decided in that case was that a suit by a depositor in a bank in Oklahoma against the members of the state banking board and the bank commissioner of Oklahoma to compel payments from, distribution of, and assessments for, the depositors' guaranty fund, was a suit against the state and under the Eleventh Amendment could not be maintained. The view stressed in the remark of the dissenting opinion, to which reference has been made, was not presented in the opinion of the court, and was not essential to the decision. When money is deposited in bank, the contract that is made is between that bank and the depositor. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Bank Guaranty Law, there is, properly speaking, no contract between the depositor and other banks. The Bank Guaranty Law provided for a fund to be raised by assessments upon all the state banks, and, while this was regarded as an important safeguard for all depositors, it was but a police regulation, the sanction of which lay in the constitutional power of the state and not in contract. See Wisconsin & Michigan Railway Co. v. Powers, \n191 U.S. 379\n, 385-387, 24 S. Ct. 107. And this is the view that has been taken by state courts which have had occasion to consider this question in connection \n\n[282 U.S. 765, 783]\n\u00a0\n with legislation by which relief has been sought from the difficulties encountered in the continued operation of bank guaranty plans. Wirtz v. Nestos, 51 N. D. 603, 616, 621, 200 N. W. 524, 529, 531; Standard Oil Co. v. Engel, 55 N. D. 163, 170, 174, 212 N. W. 822, 824, 826; State of South Dakota ex rel. Sharpe, Attorney General, et al. v. Smith, as Superintendent of Banks, 234 N. W. 764, Supreme Court of South Dakota, decided January 30, 1931.\n The origin of rights under the Bank Guaranty Law was wholly statutory- an act of grace by the Legislature, so far as depositors were concerned, with the purpose of promoting the public welfare and with freedom in the Legislature to modify its regulation when the public welfare was deemed to require a change. We see no reason to doubt the power of the Legislature to extricate the banks and the administration of the guaranty fund from the serious plight in which they were found under the operation of the old plan and to exercise a reasonable discretion in seeking this result.\n We return to the contention of the appellants. When the suit was brought, these banks were confronted with a situation which contained no promise of relief from the assessments for which the act, as it then existed, provided, and the cumulative effect of which was alleged to be disastrous. It was the special assessments under the old law that were definitely assailed. Under the modifying act of 1930, only three of these special assessments and two regular assessments remain effective; and, for the future, there is a limitation of theobl igation to a total annual assessment of two-tenths of 1 per cent. of average daily deposits instead of assessments aggregating six-tenths, as were made possible by the previous law. The future assessments, to this restricted amount, are limited to a period of ten years. This obviously is a change of great importance. The appellants sought an injunction, and their petition necessarily related to the assessments in December, 1928, and thereafter, as the pay- \n\n[282 U.S. 765, 784]\n\u00a0\n ments previously made were not in any event recoverable by the banks. Considering the reduction in the extent of the obligation as to future assessments, we are unable to say that the statute in this modified form is confiscatory, or other than a reasonable method of liquidating the guaranty plan. In this view, the judgment of the Supreme Court of the state denying an injunction should be affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Reference was made by the court to the headings of the illustrated pages of these advertisements, as, for example, 'A Story No Other State Can Tell;' 'No Mattress Banks in Nebraska;' 'Strong Banks Make Strong States;' 'In the Hands of Skilled Bankers;' 'State Banks Protect Their Deposits in Nebraska;' 'Nebraska is a Remarkable State;' 'Pushing Your Money Through the Window;' 'All Work Together in Nebraska;' 'Safe through the Slump of Deflation Days;' 'In Nebraska the Guarantee Works Both Ways;' 'The Men Who Told the Story that No Other State Can Tell.' 227 N.

This is a natural feeling as they are in no way responsible for the banks that fail. ... The guaranty fund, so-called, is merely an insurance company whereby the state banks of Nebraska are the members and must pay through an assessment each other's losses up to the maximum amount of six-tenths of one per cent. a year . ...

Depositors' Final Settlement Fund, How Comprised. For the purpose of providing a fair and just settlement of the claims of depositors and others heretofore authorized to be paid out of the Depositors' Guarantee Fund, there is hereby created and established a fund to be known and designated as 'Deosi tors' Final Settlement Fund' which fund shall comprise and consist of the following: (a) All records, accounts, books, documents, property and assets formerly in the possession of or under the control of the Guarantee Fund Commission and now in the possession of the secretary of the Department of Trade and Commerce. (b) All property and assets of every kind and nature, constituting, accruing upon, or derived from what was formerly designated as the Depositors' Guarantee Fund of the State of Nebraska. (c) All property, monies, funds, proceeds, rights, credits, accounts and choses in action, of every kind and nature, constituting, derived from, arising out of, or in any manner connected with, or pertaining to, the assessments, regular and special, heretofore accrued and levied against any and all corporations transacting a banking business in this state for the purpose of establishing, maintaining, or reimbursing what was formerly designated as the Depositors' Guarantee Fund of the State of Nebraska; which assessments, more specifically, are the special assessments levied by the Department of Trade and Commerce on or about December 15, 1928, April 17, 1929, and January 2, 1930, and the regular assessments accrued and levied on or about July 1, 1929, and January 1, 1930.

Depositors' Final Settlement Fund, Assessments, Levy, Amount, When Made. For the purpose of providing a fund for depositors in state banks closed prior to the time this act goes into effect, every corporation engaged in the business of banking under the laws of this state shall be subject to assessment to be levied, kept, collected and applied as in this act provided. On the first day of January of each year during the period of ten years, beginning with the year 1931, and ending with the year 1940, inclusive, the Department of Trade and Commerce shall levy upon every state bank an assessment of two tenths of one per cent. of its average daily deposits during the year ending December 1st last preceding, as shown by the statements required to be made and filed with the department; Provided, any state bank may, at its option, at any time during said ten year period, prepay one or more of said assessments at a discount of five per cent. per annum for the unexpired period aforesaid, in which event the assessments thus prepaid shall be computed upon the average daily deposits in such bank for the period of the three years last preceding such prepayment. All payments of assessments under the provisions of this section shall be made to and become a part of the Depositors' Final Settlement Fund. Nothing in this section shall be construed to bind any corporation transacting a banking business under the laws of this state to pay any assessments accruing or levied after such corporation shall have ceased to do business as a state bank. (1930, Special Session, S. F. 3,  2.) ...\n\n'8-175. Administration, Department of Trade and Commerce, Specific Powers, Enumerated. The Department of Trade and Commerce shall have the power and authority to sell, transfer, convey and exchange any property or assets of the Depositors' Final Settlement Fund; to enter into contracts, and to institute, defend, or other- \n\n wise participate in any suit or proceeding, involving the property or assets of said fund, or any claims, rights, or choses in action therein or pertaining thereto; to compromise and settle suits, claims, choses in action and all other matters and things pertaining to, or affecting said fund, or the administration, maintenance, or distribution thereof; the intent and purpose of this act being that the department shall efficiently and expeditiously liquidate and reduce to cash, or its equivalent, all the property and assets, tangible and intangible, of said fund, and pay out and distribute the same to those entitled thereto, in the manner and form, and according to the plan hereinafter set forth; Provided, nothing in this act shall authorize the Department of Trade and Commerce to reduce any Assessment required to be levied against banks under the provisions of this act, and provided further, the Department of Trade and Commerce may, in its sound discretion, grant to any bank an extension of time, not exceeding 3 years from the date of the passage of this act, within which to pay any of the assessments, regular or special, heretofore made, levied, or accrued against, or payable by such bank, as defined in subsection (c) of Section 1 of this act. (1930, Special Session, S. F. 3,  4.)\n'8-176. Claims, Payment. Only owners and holders of the following described claims and rights shall be entitled to receive payment from the Depositors' Final Settlement Fund and to participate in the benefits thereof, to wit: 1. Unpaid claims of depositors and of others entitled to priority, as by law provided, which shall have been heretofore or hereafter adjudicated against insolvent state banks of this state, including those banks which have heretofore closed and those which hereafter and prior to the time this act goes into effect, shall have been closed by the Department of Trade and Commerce: Provided, such claims have been heretofore certified to the department as claims against the Depositors' Guarantee Fund, or shall have been hereafter certified to the department as claims entitled to the benefits of the Depositors' Final Setlement Fund. ...

That said Sections 7995, 8008, 8028 and 8033, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, as amended; Sections 22 and 23 of Chapter 191, Laws of 1923; and Sections 8024, \n\n 8025, 8026, 8027, 8009 and 8035, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922; as heretofore existing are hereby repealed. (1930, Special Session, S. F. 3,  16.)\n'8-179. Inducement for Passage, Constitutionality, Construction. The inducement for the passage of Section 16 of this Act, which repeals various sections of the statutes relating to the bank depositors guarantee fund and assessments therefor, is the passage of sections 1 to 5, inclusive, of this Act, and if any one or more of said sections 1 to 5, inclusive, of this Act, shall for any reason be held unconstitutional or invalid, in whole or in part, then and in that event said section 16 of this Act shall be invalid and of no force or effect and the sections of the statutes sought to be repealed by said Section 16 shall be in full force and effect.

BURNET(1931)\nNo. 69\nArgued: December 3, 1930Decided: January 5, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 277, 278]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. Leo Austin, of Tulsa, Okl., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Chas. B. Rugg, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On March 30, 1918, Aiken filed his return of income and excess profits taxes for the year 1917. On March 12, 1925, \n\n[282 U.S. 277, 279]\n\u00a0\n the Commissioner made a jeopardy assessment which, upon a claim for abatement, he reduced on October 7, 1926. Aiken thereupon appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals on the grounds that the jeopardy assessment had been erroneously computed, and that both assessment and collection were barred by the statute of limitations. The Commissioner's determination was affirmed by the Board, 10 B. T. A. 553; and its decision was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, 35 F.(2d) 620. This Court granted a petition for certiorari, the argument to be 'limited to the questions concerning the validity and effect of the waivers,' \n281 \nU.S. 713\n, 50 S. Ct. 355\n\n\n The Revenue Act of November 23, 1921, c. 136,  250(d), 42 Stat. 227, 265, provides a five-year period of limitation for the assessment and collection of income and excess profits taxes under earlier Revenue Acts. The five years from the filing of the return expired March 30, 1923. In order to sustain the validity of the assessment and the right of collection, it was necessary to establish a waiver effective March 12, 1925, the date of the jeopardy assessment. Several waivers had been given. The first, which was executed by the taxpayer on February 5, 1921, and filed with the Bureau two days later, was not executed by the Commissioner until after the enactment of the 1921 Revenue Act. That waiver expired April 1, 1924.1 Before that dae, a second waiver had been duly executed, which, by its terms, was to remain in effect for 'one year after the expiration of ... the statutory period of limitation as extended by any waivers already on file with the Bureau, within which assessments of taxes may be made. ...' Thus the jeopardy assessment was made shortly before April 1, 1925, the expiration period of the first waiver as extended by the second; and, in order that this tax may be collected, both waivers must be valid. \n\n[282 U.S. 277, 280]\n\u00a0\n First. It is contended that the waiver of February 5, 1921, is invalid because it was executed prior to the enactment of section 250(d) of the Revenue Act of 1921, which was the first of the Revenue Acts to provide in terms for the giving of waivers. The argument is that prior to the enactment of that section the Commissioner lacked authority to accept waivers of the limitation on the period within which assessment might be made under the acts of 1916 and 1917.2 This contention is not sound. The limitation periods on assessment could be waived by the taxpayer in the same fashion as other statutes of limitations are waived. No reason appears why the Commissioner could not accept such a waiver prior to the act of 1921. Although the government might at that time still have brought suit even though the period for assessment had expired, it was thought desirable to follow the normal and simpler course of assessment and collection by distraint proceedings because of the advantages afforded. \n3\n The Commissioner requested the taxpayer to execute a \n\n[282 U.S. 277, 281]\n\u00a0\n waiver in cases where prolonged re-examination of the return seemed necessary. If authority was needed for the acceptance of such waivers, it may be found in the general broad administrative provisions of the respective acts. \n4\n Even after the Act of 1921, a so-called waiver was not a contract. The requirement in section 250(d) of that act that the Commissioner sign the consent was inserted to meet exigencies of administration, and not as a grant of authority to contract for waivers. See Stange v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 270\n, 51 S. Ct. 145, decided this day; Florsheim Bros. v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 453, 466\n, 50 S. Ct. 215.\n Second. It is contended that the first waiver should not be construed as waiving a limitation prescribed by a statute thereafter enacted. The argument is that section 250(d) of the act of 1921 (42 Stat. 265) superseded this waiver and required a new consent executed subsequent to its enactment and in accordance with its terms. While section 250(d) first specified that a waiver be in writing and signed by the Commissioner, there was nothing in that section which invalidated waivers made prior to its enactment or limited the effect of such instruments on the limitations therein imposed. Compare Florsheim Bros. v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 453, 467\n, 50 S. Ct. 215. The first waiver, by its express terms, embraced 'any and all statutory limitations' upon the assessment of these 1917 taxes. We see no reason for \n\n[282 U.S. 277, 282]\n\u00a0\n restricting this language so as to exclude the limitations subsequently imposed by section 250(d) of the Act of 1921.\n Third. It is contended that the first waiver, even if valid, did not operate to extend the period for the assessment of war profits as distinguished from income taxes. The argument is based on the reference in the waiver, which was prepared by the Commissioner, to 'all Federal taxes imposed by the Act of Congress, approved September 8, 1916, as amended by the Act of Congress, approved October 3, 1917,' and it is contended that the war profits tax was a separate enactment, not an amendment to the 1916 act, and hence not included within the waiver. It is clear that this waiver was intended to embrace all liability under the 1917 return then pending. Moreover, the only statute approved October 3, 1917, was the Revenue Act of that year, chapter 63 (40 Stat. 300), the general object of which was to increase for war purposes the taxes levied by the act of 1916.\n Fourth. The petitioner has argued also that the first waiver did not purport to extend the time for collection. This waiver is identical with that before us in Stange v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 270\n, 51 S. Ct. 145, decided this day, which we held was intended to embrace all the steps necessary for the ultimate collection of the tax. The second waiver expressly included 'determination, assessment, and collection.' Consequently, as the assessment of March 12, 1925, was timely, the right of collection is within section 278(d) and section 280 of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, tit. 2, 43 Stat. 253, 300, 301 (26 USCA  1061 note, 1064 note), which gives six years from the making of the assessment.

UNITED STATES(1931)\nNo. 683\nArgued: March 16, 1931Decided: April 20, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 308, 309]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James Francis Reilly, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Leo A. Rober, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner was convicted, in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, of murder in the first degree, and was sentenced to death. The conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 47 F.(2d) 407. This Court granted a writ of certiorari, \n282 \nU.S. 836\n, 51 S. Ct. 333, 75 L. Ed. -, limited to the question raised by the exception to the ruling of the trial court on the examination on voir dire of prospective jurors.\n The petitioner is a negro, and the deceased was a white man, a member of the police force of the District. The record shows the following proceedings on the examination of jurors on the voir dire:\n The court 'inquired if any of them knew the defendant, Alfred Scott Aldridge, or his counsel, or any of the witnesses whose names have been called. The court further inquired if any of the prospective jurors knew any of the facts in the case or if any of them ever remembered having read of it in the newspaper, or if they had any prejudice or bias against circumstantial evidence, or if any of the prospective jurors had any conscientious scruples against capital punishment. The court further inquired if any prospective juror had formed or exercised an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant, and further inquired whether any prospective juror was acquainted with any member of the Metropolitan Police Force of the District of Columbia, or more particularly those attached to the third precinct.\n\n\n[283 U.S. 308, 310]\n\u00a0\n 'Whereupon, with the consent of the court, counsel for the parties hereto approached the bench and in a whispered tone, out of the hearing of the prospective jurors, the following took place:\n'Mr. Reilly. At the last trial of this case I understand there was one woman on the jury who was a southerner, and who said that the fact that the defendant was a negro and the deceased a white man perhaps somewhat influenced her. I don't like to ask that question in public, but-\n\n'The Court. I don't think that would be a proper question, any more than to ask whether they like an Irishman or a Scotchman.\n\n'Mr. Reilly. But it was brought to our attention so prominently. It is a racial question-\n\n'The Court. It was not this jury.\n\n'Mr. Reilly. No. But it was a racial question, and the question came up-\n\n'The Court. I don't think that is proper.\n\n'Mr. Reilly. Might I, out of an abundance of caution, note an exception.\n\n'The Court. Note an exception.\n\n'Counsel for the defendant requested the court to allow the record to show that the question relative to racial prejudice be propounded to each and every prospective juror, with the exception heretofore noted on behalf of the defendant.'\n\n In accordance with the existing practice, the questions to the prospective jurors were put by the court, and the court had a broad discretion as to the questions to be asked. The exercise of this discretion, and the restriction upon inquiries at the request of counsel, were subject to the essential demands of fairness. We find no reason to doubt the nature of the inquiry which the counsel for the accused desired. It was admitted at the bar of this Court that the members of the jury were white. In ask- \n\n[283 U.S. 308, 311]\n\u00a0\n ing that the question relative to 'racial prejudice' be put to the jurors, it is only reasonable to assume that counsel referred, not to immaterial matters, but to such a prejudice as would disqualify a juror because precluding an impartial verdict. The reference to what cousel had heard as to the attitude of a juror on the previous trial, where the jury had disagreed, indicated the purpose of the question, which was clear enough to invite appropriate action by the court. If the court had permitted the question, it doubtless would have been properly qualified. But the court, interrupting counsel, disposed of the inquiry summarily. The court failed to ask any question which could be deemed to cover the subject. If the defendant was entitled to have the jurors asked whether they had any racial prejudice, by reason of the fact that the defendant was a negro and the deceased a white man, which would prevent their giving a fair and impartial verdict, we cannot properly disregard the court's refusal merely because of the form in which the inquiry was presented.\n The propriety of such an inquiry has been generally recognized. In Pinder v. State, 27 Fla. 370, 8 So. 837, 838, 26 Am. St. Rep. 75, the counsel for the accused sought to have the jurors asked on their voir dire: 'Could you give the defendant, who is a negro, as fair and impartial a trial as you could a white man, and give him the same advantage and protection as you would a white man upon the same evidence?' The Supreme Court of Florida held that the refusal of the court to allow the question was error and reversed the conviction. \n1\n In Hill v. State, 112 Miss. 260, 72 So. 1003, the \n\n[283 U.S. 308, 312]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court of Mississippi held that it was fatal error to refuse to permit a negro on trial for murder to put to prospective jurors on their voir dire the following question: 'Have you got any prejudice against the negro, as a negro, that would induce you to return a verdict on less or slighter evidence than you would return a verdict of guilty against a white man under the same circumstances?' The Supreme Court of North Carolina reversed the conviction of a negro because of the refusal of the trial judge to permit a juror to be asked if 'he believed he could, as a juror, do equal and impartial justice between the State and a colored man.' State v. McAfee, 64 N. C. 339.2 See, also, \n\n[283 U.S. 308, 313]\n\u00a0\n Fendrick v. State, 39 Tex. Cr. R. 147, 45 S. W. 589; State v. Sanders, 103 S. C. 216, 88 S. E. 10.\n The right to examine jurors on the voir dire as to the existence of a disqualifying state of mind has been upheld with respect to other races than the black race, and in relation to religious and other prejudices of a serious character. Potter v. State, 86 Tex. Cr. R. 380, 384, 216 S. W. 886; People v. Reyes, 5 Cal. 347, 349; Watson v. Whitney, 23 Cal. 375, 379; People v. Car Soy, 57 Cal. 102; Horst v. Silverman, 20 Wash. 233, 234, 55 P. 52, 72 Am. St. Rep. 97. In People v. Reyes, supra, Mexicans were charged with assault with intent to commit murder, and conviction was reversed because of the refusal to allow questions to determine whether a prospective juror was a member of the Know Nothing party, and whether he had taken any oath or obligation which resulted in prejudice, or whether independent of such an oath he entertained a prejudice, which would prevent him from giving the accused a fair trial. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[283 U.S. 308, 314]\n\u00a0\n We do not overlook the reference of the Court of Appeals, in support of the ruling of the trial court, to conditions in the District of Columbia 'where the colored race is accorded all the prvileges and rights under the law that are afforded the white race, and especially the ight to practice in the courts, serve on the jury,' etc. But the question is not as to the civil privileges of the negro, or as to the dominant sentiment of the community and the general absence of any disqualifying prejudice, but as to the bias of the particular jurors who are to try the accused. If in fact, sharing the general sentiment, they were found to be impartial, no harm would be done in permitting the question, but if any one of them was shown to entertain a prejudice which would preclude his rendering a fair verdict, a gross injustice would be perpetrated in allowing him to sit. Despite the privileges accorded to the negro, we do not think that it can be said that the posibility of such prejudice is so remote4 as to justify the risk in forbidding the inquiry. And this risk becomes most grave when the issue is of life or death.\n The argument is advanced on behalf of the government that it would be detrimental to the administration of the \n\n[283 U.S. 308, 315]\n\u00a0\n law in the courts of the United States to allow questions to jurors as to racial or religious prejudices. We think that it would be far more injurious to permit it to be thought that persons entertaining a disqualifying prejudice were allowed to serve as jurors and that inquiries designed to elicit the fact of disqualification were barred. No surer way could be devised to bring the processes of justice into disrepute.\n We are of the opinion that the ruling of the trial court on the voir dire was erroneous, and the judgment of conviction must for this reason be reversed.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS (dissenting).\n Our jurisdiction over this case is limited by section 391, Title 28, U. S. Code (28 USCA  391), which provides:\n'All United States courts shall have power to grant new trials, in cases where there has been a trial by jury, for reasons for which new trials have usually been granted in the courts of law. On the hearing of any appeal, certiorari, writ of error, or motion for a new trial, in any case, civil or criminal, the court shall give judgment after an examination of the entire record before the court, without regard to technical errors, defects, or exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.'\n\n The petitioner, a negro, killed a white policeman in the District of Columbia. He was indicted, tried, and found guilty by a jury. He moved for a new trial upon the ground, among others, 'that this court committed error in refusing to examine the jury on their voir dire as to whether any juror may entertain racial prejudice in a matter of homicide where the defendant is a negro and the deceased a white policeman.' This was overruled, and sentence of death followed.\n Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District, the following error, among others, was assigned: 'The \n\n[283 U.S. 308, 316]\n\u00a0\n court's action in refusing the request of the defendant to propound to the jury during the court's examination of the jury on its voir dire as to whether any juror may entertain racial prejudice in the matter of a homicide where the defendant is a negro and the deceased a white policeman.'\n Replying to this that court said:\n'Counsel for defendant assigns as error the refusal of the court to allow him to inquire of the prospective jurors on their voir dire whether they entertained racial prejudice in a case wherein the defendant is a negro and the deceased a white man. We had occasion to consider this same question in the case of Crawford v. United States, 59 App. D. C. 356, 41 F.(2d) 979. We have given the matter further careful consideration in this case, and find no reason to recede from our former decision. In a jurisdiction like the District of Columbia, where the colored race is accorded all the privileges and rights under the law that are afforded the white race, and especially the right to practice in the cours,  erve on the jury, etc., we are of the opinion that there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in refusing to permit the question to be answered by the jurors.'\n\n This Court granted a certiorari to bring up the judgment of affirmance, but limited review to the point raised by the quoted assignment of error.\n It appears that, while the trial judge was examining prospective jurors on their voir dire, counsel for the accused said to him: 'At the last trial of this case I understand there was one woman on the jury who was a southerner, and who said that the fact that the defendant was a negro and the deceased a white man perhaps somewhat influenced her. I don't like to ask that question in public.' The precise nature of 'that question' is unknown to us. The judge thought 'that question' (whatever it was) improper and refused to ask it. Whereupon counsel noted an exception and 'requested the court to allow the \n\n[283 U.S. 308, 317]\n\u00a0\n record to show that the question relative to racial prejudice be propounded to each and every prospective juror, with the exception heretofore noted on behalf of the defendant.'\n Solely because of the refusal of the trial judge to propound an undisclosed question 'relative to racial prejudice' (whatever that may be), we are asked to upset a judgment approved by the judges of both local courts who, it is fair to presume, understand conditions in the District better than we do.\n Nothing is revealed by the record which tends to show that any juror entertained prejudice which might have impaired his ability fairly to pass upon the issues. It is not even argued that considering the evidence presented there was room for reasonable doubt of guilt.\n It does appear that counsel said he understood at a former trial a female juror, a Southerner (whatever that may mean), declared 'the fact the defendant was a negro and the deceased a white man perhaps somewhat influenced her.' And that is the sum of the information to be gathered from the record in respect of any 'race prejudice' which might have so distorted some juror's judgment as to prevent honest and fair consideration.\n How this unidentified woman juror voted, whether she was white or black, whether her prepossessions were right or wrong or materially different from those generally entertained by men of one color towards those of another, we cannot know. But 'perhaps she was somewhat influenced' by the fact that the dead man and the defendant were of different color. Must we therefore decide that 'perhaps' and accordingly some member of the second jury failed to act fairly, intelligently, and without due regard to his oath!\n Two local courts could not conclude that there was adequate reason for holding the accused man had suffered deprivation of any substantial right through refusal by \n\n[283 U.S. 308, 318]\n\u00a0\n the trial judge to ask prospective jurors something relative to racial prejudice. And certainly I am unable to affirm that they were wrong.\n Section 391 of the U. S. Code (28 USCA  391), I think, was intended to prevent escape of culprits from prompt deserved punishment in cases like this. Congress had clear right to put the limitation on courts of review and the enactment should be given effect according to its purpose.\n Unhappily, the enforcement of our criminal laws is scandalously ineffective. Crimes of violence multiply; punishment walks lamely. Courts ought not to increase the difficulties by magnifying theoretical possibilities. It is their province to deal with matters actual and material; to promote order and not to hinder it by excessive theorizing of or by magnifying what in practice is not really important.\n I think the judgment below should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the Pinder Case, supra, the court said: 'Though the question is not in express terms provided for in the statute above cited' (McClellan's Digest, sec. 10, p. 446) 'yet it was a pertinent, and, as we think, proper, question to test fully the existence of bias or prejudice in the minds of the jurors. It sought to elicit a fact that was of the most vital import to the defendant; and a fact, too, that, if existent, was locked up entirely within the breasts of the jurors to whom the question was propounded, a knowledge of the existence of which could only be acquired by interrogating the juror himself. The answer to it, if in the affirmative, could have worked no harm to the juror, or to any one else, but would have done credit to the humanity and intelligence of the juror, and would have satisfactorily exhibited to the court and to the defendant his entire competency, so far as the element of bias or prejudice was involved. But, if the answer to it from the jurors had been in the negative, then we have no hesitancy in saying that it would have shown them to be wholly unfit and incompetent to sit upon the trial of a man of the negro race, whose right to a trial by a fair and impartial jury is as fully guarantied to him under our constitution and laws as to the whitest man in Christendm; a nd such incompetency asserts itself with superadded force in such a case as this, where the life or death of the defendant was the issue to tip the scale in the jury's hands for adjustment.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In that case, the court said (at page 340 of 64 N. C.): 'It is essential to the purity of trial by jury, that every juror shall be free from bias. If his mind has been poisoned by prejudice of any kind, whether resulting from reason or passion, he is unfit to sit on a jury. Here, his Honor refused to allow a proper question to be put to the juror, in order to test his qualifications. Suppose the question had been allowed, and the juror had answered, that the state of his feelings towards the colored race was such that he could not show equal and impartial justice between the state and the prisoner, especially in charges of this character, it is at once seen that he would have been grossly unfit to sit in the jury box.' The practice of permitting questions as to racial prejudice is not confined to any section of the country, and this fact attests the widespread sentiment that fairness demands that such inquiries be allowed. Thus, in New York, on the trial of a negro for the murder of his wife, who was white, a talesman, who had testified to a disqualifying prejudice, was excluded by the court on its own motion, and the Court of Appeals held that the exclusion was not error, although in the absence of a challenge to the talesman by either party. People v. Decker, 157 N. Y. 186, 190, 51 N. E. 1018. See, also, State v. Brown, 188 Mo. 451, 459, 460, 87 S. W. 519. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The court in that case said (at page 349 of 5 Cal.): 'As the juror best knows the condition of his own mind, no satisfactory conclusion can be arrived at, without resort to himself. Applying this test then, how is it possible to ascertain whether he is prejudiced or not, unless questions similar to the foregoing are propounded to him? ...\n'Prejudice being a state of mind more frequently founded in passion than in reason, may exist with or without cause; and to ask a person whether he is prejudiced or not against a party, and (if the answer is affirmative), whether that prejudice is of such a character as would lead him to deny the party a fair trial, is not only the simplest method of ascertaining the state of his mind, but is, probably, the only sure method of fathoming his thoughts and feelings. If the person called had not taken an obligation which would prejudice him against foreigners in such a manner as to imperil their rights in a court of law, he could say so, and the question and answer would be harmless. If, upon the other hand, he had taken oaths, and was under obligations which influenced his mind and feelings in such a manner as to deny to a foreigner an impartial trial, he is grossly unfit to sit as a juror, and such facts should be known.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] For an illustration of a case where the suggestion of bias was held to be too remote, e. g., as to political affiliations, see Connors v. United States, \n158 \nU.S. 408\n, 15 S. Ct. 951. \n\n\n\n\n","3":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nALFORD v. UNITED STATES(1931)\nNo. 370\nArgued: January 6, 1931Decided: February 24, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 687, 688]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Leo R. Friedman and Thomas M. Foley, both of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Mr. Bentley W. Warren, of Boston, Mass., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner was convicted in the District Court for southern California of using the mails to defraud in violation of section 215 of the Criminal Code (18 USCA  338). This Court granted certiorari, \n282 \nU.S. 826\n, 51 S. Ct. 77, 75 L. Ed. -, October 20, 1930, to review a judgment of affirmance by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which upheld certain rulings of the trial court upon the evidence. 41 F.(2d) 157.\n In the course of the trial the government called as a witness a former employee of petitioner. On direct examination he gave damaging testimony with respect to various transactions of accused, including conversations with the witness when others were not present, and statement of accused to salesmen under his direction, whom the witness did not identify. Upon cross-examination questions seeking to elicit the witness's place of residence were excluded on the government's objection that they were immaterial and not proper cross-examination. Counsel for the defense insisted that the questions were \n\n[282 U.S. 687, 689]\n\u00a0\n proper cross-examination, and that the jury was entitled to know 'who the witness is, where he lives and what his business is.' Relevant excerpts of the record are printed in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[282 U.S. 687, 690]\n\u00a0\n Later, the jury having been excused, counsel for the defense urged, as an 'additional' ground for asking the excluded questions, that he had been informed that the witness was then in the custody of the federal authorities, and that such fact might be brought out on cross- examination 'for the purpose of showing whatever bias or prejudice he may have.' But the court adhered to its previous rulings, saying that if the witness had been convicted of a felony that fact might be proved, but not that he was detained in custody.\n The Court of Appeals, after stating that it is customary to allow cross-examination of a witness with reference to \n\n[282 U.S. 687, 691]\n\u00a0\n his place of residence, upheld the trial court, saying, page 160 of 41 F.( 2d):\n'The purpose of such evidence is to identify the witness and to some extent given proper background for the interpretation of his testimony. In this case, however, the counsel indicated his purpose to use the information for the purpose of discrediting the witness. It is part of the obligation of a trial judge to protect witnesses against evidence tending to discredit the witness unless such evidence is reasonably called for by exigencies of the case. A witness is not on trial and has no means of protecting himself. Here it was evident that the counsel for the appellant desired to discredict the witness, without, so far as is shown, in any way connecting the expected answer with a matter on trial. If it had been contended that the witness was in custody because of his participation in the transaction with which the appellant was charged, and if it was sought to show that he was testifying under some promise of immunity, it would undoubtedly have been prejudicial error to have excluded such testimony; but counsel avowed no such purpose, and indicated that the proposed question was merely in pursuit of a fishing expedition by which he hoped to discredit the witness. The witness was examined at great; length concerning his relation to the appellant and great latitude was accorded in that examination.'\n\n Cross-examination of a witness is a matter of right. The Ottawa, 3 Wall. 268, 271. Its permissible purposes, among others, are that the witness may be identified with his community so that independent testimony may be sought and offered of his reputation for veracity in his own neighborhood, cf. Khan v. Zemansky, 59 Cal.App. 324, 327ff, 210 P. 529; 3 Wigmore, Evidence (2d Ed.)  1368 I. (1)(b); that the jury may interpret his testimony in the light refiected upon it by knowledge of his environment, Kirschner v. State, 9 Wis. 140; Wilbur v. Flood, 16 Mich. \n\n[282 U.S. 687, 692]\n\u00a0\n 40, 93 Am. Dec. 203; Hollingsworth v. State, 53 Ark. 387, 14 S. W. 41; People v. White, 251 Ill, 67, 72ff., 95 N. E. 2036; Wallace v. State, 41 Fla. 547, 574ff., 26 So. 713; and that facts may be brought out tending to discredit the witness by showing that his testimony in chief was untrue or biased, Tla-koo-yel-lee v. United States, \n167 \nU.S. 274\n, 17 S. Ct. 855; King v. United States (C. C. A.) 112 F. 988; Farkas v. United States (C. C. A.) 2 F.(2d) 644; see Furlong v. United States (C. C. A.) 10 F.(2d) 492, 494.\n Counsel often cannot know in advance what pertinent facts may be elicited on cross-examination. For that reason it is necessarily exploratory; and the rul th at the examiner must indicate the purpose of his inquiry does not, in general, apply. Knapp v. Wing, 72 Vt. 334, 340, 47 A. 1075; Martin v. Elden, 32 Ohio St. 282, 289. It is the essence of a fair trial that reasonable latitude be given the cross-examiner, even though he is unable to state to the court what fact a reasonable cross- examination might develop. Prejudice ensues from a denial of the opportunity to place the witness in his proper setting and put the weight of his testimony and his credibility to a test, without which the jury cannot fairly appraise them. Tla-koo-yel-lee v. United States, supra; King v. United States, supra; People v. Moore, 96 App. Div. 56, 89 N. Y. S. 83, affirmed without opinion, 181 N. Y. 524, 73 N. E. 1129; cf. People v. Becker, 210 N. Y. 274, 104 N. E. 396. To say that prejudice can be established only by showing that the cross-examination, if pursued, would necessarily have brought out facts tending to discredit the testimony in chief, is to deny a substantial right and withdraw one of the safeguards essential to a fair trial. Nailor v. Williams, 8 Wall. 107, 109; see People v. Stevenson (Cal. Sup.) 284 P. 491; cf. Brasfield v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 448\n, 47 S. Ct. 135. In this respect a summary denial of the right of cross-examination is distinguishable from the erroneous admission of harmless testimony. Nailor v. Williams, supra.\n The present case, after the witness for the prosecution had testified to uncorroborated conversations of the defendant of a damaging character, was a proper one for \n\n[282 U.S. 687, 693]\n\u00a0\n searching cross-examination. The question, 'Where do you live?' was not only an appropriate preliminary to the cross-examination of the witness, but on its face, without any such declaration of purpose as was made by counsel here, was an essential step in identifying the witness with his environment, to which cross-examination may always be directed. State v. Pugsley, 75 Iowa, 742, 38 N. W. 498; State v. Fong Loon, 29 Idaho, 248, 255ff., 158 P. 233. L. R. A. 1916F, 1198; Wallace v. State, supra; Wilbur v. Flood, supra; 5 Jones, Evidence (2d Ed.)  2366\n\n\n But counsel for the defense went further, and in the ensuing colloquy with the court urged, as an additional reason why the question should be allowed, not a substitute reason, as the court below assumed, that he was informed that the witness was then in court in custody of the federal authorities, and that that fact could be brought out on cross-examination to show whatever bias or prejudice the witness might have. The purpose obviously was not, as the trial court seemed to think, to discredit the witness by showing that he was charged with crime, but to show by such facts as proper cross-examination might develop, that his testimony was biased because given under promise or expectation of immunity, or under the coercive effect of his detention by officers of the United States, which was conducting the present prosecution. King v. United States, supra; Farkas v. United States, supra, and cases cited; People v. Becker, supra; State v. Ritz, 65 Mont. 180, and cases cited on page 188, 211 P. 298; Rex v. Watson, 32 How. St. Tr. 284. Nor is it material, as the Court of Appeals said, whether the witness was in custody because of his participation in the transactions for which petitioner was indicted. Even if the witness were charged with some other offense by the prosecuting authorities, petitioner was entitled to show by cross examination that his testimony was affected by fear or favor growing out of his detention. See Farkas v. United States, supra; People v. Dillwood, 4 Cal. Unrep. 973, 39 P. 438.\n\n\n[282 U.S. 687, 694]\n\u00a0\n The extent of cross-examination with respect to an appropriate subject of inquiry is within the sound discretion of the trial court. It may exercise a reasonable judgment in determining when the subject is exhausted. Storm v. United States, \n94 U.S. 76\n, 85; Rea v. Missouri, 17 Wall. 532, 542-543; Blitz v. United States, \n153 \nU.S. 308, 312\n, 14 S. t. 924. But no obligation is imposed on the court, such as that suggested below, to protect a witness from being discredited on cross-examination, short of an attempted invasion of his constitutional protection from self incrimination, properly invoked. There is a duty to protect him from questions which go beyond the bonds of proper cross- examination merely to harass, annoy or humiliate him. President, etc., of Third Great Western Turnpike Road Co. v. Loomis, 32 N. Y. 127, 132, 88 Am. Dec. 311; Wallace v. State, supra; 5 Jones, Evidence (2d Ed.)  2316. But no such case is presented here. The trial court cut off in limine all inquiry on a subject with respect to which the defense was entitled to a reasonable cross examination. This was an abuse of discretion and prejudicial error.

JOHNSON(1931)\nNo. 41\nArgued: January 8, 1931Decided: February 24, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 509, 510]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Simeon E. Sheffey and Burke Corbet, both of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Mr. U. S. Webb, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A tax reckoned, as required by the State Constitution, upon gross revenues derived from an automotive stage line operated by him during the year 1926 between fixed points in California, was assessed against petitioner, Alward. He paid one-half, $1,489.39, the first installment, and then brought suit in the superior court of Sacramento county to recover $1,057.16, the amount imposed because of receipts under his contract for carrying the mails. He asked judgment for that amount, together with costs, further relief, etc.\n Section 15, article 13, of the California Constitution, adopted November 2, 1926, provides:\n'Taxes levied, assessed and collected as hereinafter provided upon companies owning, operating or managing any automobile, truck or auto truck, jitney bus, stage or auto stage used in the business of transportation of persons or property as a common carrier for compensation over any public highway in this state between fixed termini or over a regular route, ... shall be entirely \n\n[282 U.S. 509, 511]\n\u00a0\n and exclusively for highway purposes, and shall be levied, assessed and collected in the manner hereinafter provided. The word 'companies,' as used in this section, shall include persons, partnerships, joint stock associations, companies and corporations.\n\n'(a) All such companies engaged in the business of transportation of persons, or persons and baggage, or persons and express, or persons, baggage and express where the same is transported on the same automobile, jitney bus, stage or auto stage transporting said persons shall annually pay to the state a tax upon their franchises, cars, equipment, and other property, or any part thereof, used exclusively in the operation of their business in this state, equal to four and one-quarter per cent. Of the gross receipts from operations of such companies, and each thereof, within this state.\n\n'All such companies operating trucks or auto trucks engaged in the business of transporting property shall annually pay to the state a tax upon their franchises, trucks or auto trucks, equipment, and other property, or any part thereof, used exclusively in the operation of their business in this state, equal to five per cent. of the gross receipts from operations of such companies, and each thereof, within this state. ...\n\n'Such taxes shall be in lieu of all other taxes and licenses, state, county and municipal, upon the property above enumerated of such companies. ...'\n\n The court below declared that the tax prescribed by the foregoing section of the Constitution is identical in kind with the one inaugurated earlier by section 14, which applies to railroad, telegraph, telephone, etc., companies. Under both sections taxes are laid according to gross receipts.\n The complaint alleges, in substance:\n The plaintiff is engaged in the business of operating an automotive stage line between Redding and Big Bear, \n\n[282 U.S. 509, 512]\n\u00a0\n Cal., by virtue of a contract entered into with the Post Office Department. The mails are carried by motor vehicles.\n The gross income derived from operating the line during 1926 follows: From carriage of passengers, $8,803.31; from carriage of freight, $9,806. 43; from carriage of United States mail, $42,286.73.\n Based upon these receipts, the following tax was assessed for the year 1927: On gross income from passengers, $374.14; from freight, $490.32; from United States mail, $2,114.32. He paid one-half of the total sum so assessed, the first installment.\n In earning this revenue, plaintff employed certain designated automotive property, and no other, the actual market value of which did not exceed $15,000. This was devoted chiefly to carrying the mails and had no value in excess of its actual market value; plaintiff's ability to earn more with it than other persons could with the same amount and character of property arose solely from the fact that he had a contract with the United States government for carrying the mails. Without this the stage line could not be operated profitably.\n The assessment against the plaintiff is confiscatory, arbitrary, excessive, and does not take into consideration the actual value of the property involved, and was made without consideration of any element of value except the gross earnings. The tax rate on property assessed on an ad valorem basis in the counties where plaintiff operates did not exceed 3 per centum. Replacement value of all property used by him does not exceed $ 15,000. In carrying the mails he acted under a contract with the Post Office Department and was an agency of the United States not subject to local taxation.\n The assessment, in so far as based upon the revenue derived from carrying the mails, was unlawful, and the \n\n[282 U.S. 509, 513]\n\u00a0\n portion of the first installment reckoned thereon and paid by plaintiff was unlawfully exacted.\n The trial court sustained a demurrer to the complaint; its judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court. 208 Cal. 359, 281 P. 389. The latter held that the tax assessed against the petitioner is essentially one on property, and is neither confiscatory, nor so arbitrary as to impair any right under the Federal Constitution; also that the petitioner did not, through his contract to carry the mails, become an agency of the federal government immune from taxation computed according to gross receipts.\n The record discloses no question relative to taxation of property outside the state or interference with interstate commerce.\n The Supreme Court of the state has declared the tax to be one upon property. The history, purpose, and effect of the constitutional provision under consideration have been pointed out in the opinions of that court. San Francisco v. Pacific T. & T. Co., 166 Cal. 244, 135 P. 971; Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Roberts, 168 Cal. 420, 143 P. 700; Lake Tahoe Ry. Co. v. Roberts, 168 Cal. 551, 143 P. 786, Ann. Cas. 1916E, 1196.

Ct. 180.\n The California Constitution divides property within the state for taxation purposes into several classes, and provides for different burdens upon them. Thee can be no doubt of the general power of a state where there is reasonable ground therefor to classify property wholly within her limits and to lay an appropriate tax upon each class. Bekins Van Lines v. Riley, \n280 \nU.S. 80, 82\n, 50 S. Ct. 64. It is not possible for us to say that the circumstances of the present cause disclose any arbitrary or unreasonable exertion of such power by the state. The distinction burdens upon them. There can be no a business which re- \n\n[282 U.S. 509, 514]\n\u00a0\n quires constant and unusual use of the highways and property not so employed is plain enough. Here the tax laid was exclusive of all other taxation, and the funds arising therefrom were assigned to the maintenance of roads, essential to petitioner's operations.\n Certainly, petitioner is in no position to complain of an arbitrary exactment. The prescribed method of assessment was permissible, and the mere fact that he was required to pay a higher rate upon property devoted to his peculiar business than was demanded of property not so employed is unimportant.\n Nor do we think petitioner's property was entitled to exemption from state taxation because used in connection with the transportation of the mails. There was no tax upon the contract for such carriage; the burden laid upon the property employed affected operations of the federal government only remotely. UnionPac . Ry. Co. v.

McCready, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Charles Neave, of New York City, and Melville Church, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n\n[283 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Brogdex Company, present owner of United States letters patent No. 1,529,461, relating to 'certain new and useful improvements in the art of preparing fresh fruit for market,' applied for August 13, 1923, and issued to Brogden and Trowbridge March 10, 1925, presented its bill of complaint to the District Court for Delaware (21 F.(2d) 110), April 15, 1926, wherein it charged that the defendant (peti- \n\n[283 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n tioner here), the American Fruit Growers, Inc., had infringed and asked an injunction, accounting, damages, etc. It relied upon claims Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18, which describe the process of treatment, also Nos. 23, 24, 25, and 26, which concern the product.\n Both courts below held all of these claims valid and infringed; and directed that petitioner be enjoined from using any process therein specified, also from manufacturing, selling, or using 'treated fruit embodying and containing the invention described in said letters patent and secured by any of said (product) claims.'\n Of the process claims, the following is characteristic:\n'3. In the preparation of fresh fruit for market, the process which comprises subjecting fruit to the action of an aqueous solution of borax, the fluidity, strength and temperature of the treating solution, and the duration of the treatment, being such that exposed rind or skin tissues of the fruit are effectively impregnated with borax and rendered resistant to blue mold decay, while at the same time the fruit is not scalded nor is its freshness or edibility otherwise substantially impaired.'\n\n The following is typical of the product claims:\n'26. Fresh citrus fruit of which the rind or skin carries borax in amount that is very small but sufficient to render the fruit resistant to blue mold decay.'\n\n'The claim of a patent must always be explained by and read in connection with the specification.' Carnegie Steel Co. v. Cambria Iron Co., \n185 \nU.S. 403, 432\n, 22 S. Ct. 698, 710.\n\n The specification in respect of the patent states:\n'This invention relates to art of preparing fresh fruit for market; and in particular it relates to processes for the treatment of citrus and other fruits in such manner that the development of molds and the like upon the fruit, and especially the development of blue mold and infection by blue mold spores, is prevented or arrested either wholly or to such large extent as greatly to pro- \n\n[283 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n long the marketable life of the fruit beyond what has been possible heretofore; the complete treatment most desirably also including a step of providing the fruit with a very thin film-like coating of protective material comprising a waxy substane  uch as paraffin; all as will more fully hereinafter appear.\n\n'The greatest present utility of the invention is in the treatment of citrus fruits such as oranges, grapefruit, lemons, tangerines, etc.; also apples and other fruits that are attacked by blue mold or the like. The invention is broad, however, and the term fruit as herein employed is to be understood as not necessarily restricted to fruit in the sense in which the word is usually employed, but is to be understood broadly as including not only fruit proper but also vegetables, such as tomatoes or the like, that can be treated to advantage in accordance with the principles of the invention to be hereinafter set forth.\n\n'For the sake of a concrete example whereby the principles of the invention may be illustrated and explained, reference will be made hereinafter more particularly to the treatment of citrus fruit, especially oranges and lemons, which are especially subject to attack and destruction by blue mold. It is a well-known fact that a large part of the losses from decay in the marketing of various fruits, such as citrus fruits and apples, is attributable directly to the action of blue mold. The problem of how to suppress or control blue mold development on fruits has been the subject of extensive and careful investigation, but admittedly no thoroughly satisfactory solution of the problem has heretofore been offered. In spite of elaborate precautions taken in the handling and transportation of fruits to market, it is not uncommon for shipments of oranges and the like to arrive at marketing points showing in some cases as much as 30 to 40 per cent. decay directly attributable to blue mold. The various investigations of the subject have shown that while blue mold \n\n[283 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n does not ordinarily attack perfectly sound fruit that is free from bruises, cuts, thorn-pricks or punctures, the slightest surface cut or scratch affords a point of attack by providing lodgment for blue mold spores which develop with great rapidity and soon bring about complete destruction of the infected fruit. ...\n\n'The present applicants have discovered that by proper treatment of the fruit in the packing house it is possible to greatly reduce, and often to absolutely prevent, the growth or development of blue mold on fruit for long periods of time, and thus to materially lessen or even eliminate the heretofore unavoidable losses from decay. Moreover, it is possible to achieve these results without upsetting or greatly changing present practice so far as concerns the mechanical handling of fruit in packing houses of the modern type. Thorough practical tests of the novel processes have demonstrated conclusively that, by proceeding in accordance with the invention, blue mold development can be arrested, and fruit can be rendered immune to attack by blue mold spores, in a simple and effective manner without affecting the freshness and flavor of the fruit, the marketable life of the fruit being thus prolonged far beyond that of untreated fruit. In view of the well known persistent activity of blue mold spores even under conditions fatal to the parent mold, the importance of this achievement is obvious. In general, the process of the invention involves applying to the fruit a mold-inhibiting reagent comprising the boric acid radical, said compound being most desirably alkaline in reaction and being employed in concentration effective to render the surface of the fruit unfavorable as a medium for blue mold development. Ordinary borax (Na1B4O7k10H2O) has been found after extensive investigation, to be especially potent in its retarding and inhibiting action in this connection, and this substance is considered at present to be the most desirable to employ \n\n[283 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n in practicing the invention. A water solution of borax is alkaline in reaction, but is without corrosive or other deteriorating action upon fruit to which it is applied. Boric acid is not so effective as a mold-retarder as is borax; but compounds of boron, whether acid or alkaline, appear to have a specific inhibiting action upon blue mold; and hence it is not desired to limit the invention, so far as concerns compounds of boron, to the employment of an alkaline treating solution.\n\n'The method of applying the treating solution to the fruit may assume various specifically different forms, the precise details of procedure being not essential to the invention in its broader aspects. However, where it is desirable, as may often be the case, to carry out the process without changing prior practice any more than is strictly necessary, the application of the mold-retarding agent may be effected as a part of or in conjunction with the usual washing operation to which the fruit is initially subjected in its handling according to modern packing house methods, especially as most of the mold-retarding agents herein contemplated also have excellent cleansing or detergent properties. Accordingly, in the practice of the invention, the mold-retarding agent, borax in a specific instance, may be added in proper mold-inhibiting quantity directly to the wash water in the usual soaking tank into which the fruit is dumped from the field boxes as it comes from the groves. ...\n\n'From this point on, the handling of the fruit in further preparation for boxing and shipment may or may not involve additional preservative treatment in accordance with the principles of the invention. This depends upon whether or not the fruit is to receive an application of protective coating material for the purpose of preventing or reducing shrinkage and withering and of ensuring conservation of the original freshness and flavor of the fruit for prolonged periods of time. Generally this further \n\n[283 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n treatment is highly desirable, and if the benefits of the invention are to be realized to the fullest extent, this further treatment should be carried out. It consists in applying to the fruit a normally solid protective material, especially paraffin or like waxy material, in such condition that it can be spread all over the surface of the fruit to produce an extremely thin protective film which is not noticeable except by the expert eye and does not interfere with the so-called breathing or transpiration of the fruit to an undesirable extent, but which is effective to conserve the original plumpness and freshness of the fruit as above stated. ...\n\n'In the foregoing disclosure of the principles of the invention, reference has been made more particularly to blue mold as a source or cause of decay. Such reference to blue mold is to be taken, not as restrictive, but as generic and as intended, both in the specification and in the claims, to cover not only blue mold but all kindred rot and decay organisms and diseases generally amenable to treatment in accordance with the invention, to which fruit is or may be susceptible and by which it may be damaged under the conditions prevailing in packing and marketing. ...'\n\n Petitioner admits ownership of plants which pack and sell citrus fruits, and that, when preparing these for market, it caused them to be dipped in a borax solution in order to prevent or retard decay incident to growth of blue mold. Under the treatment applied, the raw fruit is immersed in a cold or warm solution of borax or boric acid, permitted to remain until thoroughly wet, then rinsed, dryed, and brushed. Infringement is admitted, if the patent is valid.\n In defense, petitioner maintains that the product claims of the patent fail to describe an article of manufacture within the meaning of the statute. Also that the process \n\n[283 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n claims are invalid for various reasons, among them anticipation by United States letters patent No. 683,899, issued October 8, 1901, upon application of Simeon Bishop.\n Is an orange, the rind of which has become impregnated with borax, through immersion in a solution, and thereby rendered resistant to blue mold decay, a 'manufacture,' or manufactured article, within the meaning of section 31, title 35, U. S. Code (35 USCA  31)?\n Any person who has invented or discovered any new and useful art, machine, maufa cture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvements thereof, not known or used by others in this country, before his invention or discovery thereof, and not patented ... may ... obtain a patent therefor.'\n Answering affirmatively, the Circuit Court of Appeals said: 'The product claims define an article of manufacture, since the fruit is the result of a process which is defined and described and not a natural product. The product is a combination of the natural fruit and a boric compound carried by the rind or skin in an amount sufficient to render the fruit resistant to decay. The complete article is not found in nature and is thus an article of manufacture. Riter-Conley Mfg. Co. v. Aiken et al. ( C. C. A.) 203 F. 699.'\n This position, we think, is not tenable.\n Manufacture,' as well defined by the Century Dictionary, is 'the production of articles for use from raw or prepared materials by giving to these materials new forms, qualities, properties, or combinations, whether by handlablor or by machinery'; also 'anything made for use from raw or prepared materials.'\n Addition of borax to the rind of natural fruit does not produce from the raw material an article for use which possesses a new or distinctive form, quality, or property. The added substance only protects the natural article \n\n[283 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n against deterioration by inhibiting development of extraneous spores upon the rind. There is no change in the name, appearance, or general character of the fruit. It remains a fresh orange, fit only for the same beneficial uses as theretofore.\n In Hartranft v. Wiegmann, \n121 \nU.S. 609, 613\n, 615 S., 7 S. Ct. 1240, 1242, this Court considered the meaning of the words 'manufactures of shells,' and held that 'cleaning off the outer layer of the shell by acid, and then grinding off the second layer by an emery wheel, so as to expose the brilliant inner layer,' did not convert it into a manufacture. 'The shells in question here were not manufactured, and were not manufactures of shells, within the sense of the statute imposing a duty of 35 per centum upon such manufactures, but were shells not manufactured, and fell under that designation in the free list. They were still shells. They had not been manufactured into a new and different article, having a distinctive name, character, or use from that of a shell. The application of labor to an article, either by hand or by mechanism, does not make the article necessarily a manufactured article, within the meaning of that term as used in the tariff laws. Washing and scouring wool does not make the resulting wool a manufacture of wool. Cleaning and ginning cotton does not make the resulting cotton a manufacture of cotton.'\n And in Anheuser-Busch Brewing Ass'n v. United States, \n207 \nU.S. 556, 562\n, 28 S. Ct. 204, 206, where it was claimed that corks for bottles which had undergone special treatment after importation thereby became articles manufactured in the United States, this Court said: 'Manufacture implies a change, but every change is not manufacture, and yet every change in an article is the result of treatment, labor, and manipulation. But something more is necessary, as set forth and illustrated in Hartranft v. Wiegmann, 121 U. S. \n\n[283 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n 609, 7 S. Ct. 1240. There must be transformation; a new and different article must emerge 'having a distinctive name, character, or use.\"\n If it be assumed that the process claims under consideration cover an invention, we think this lacked novelty when application was made for the patent August 13, 1923. The underlying conception had been adequately revealed in Bishop's patent of 1901\n\n\n He claimed:\n'1. The method of treating articles of food to preserve and enhance their value, which consists in washing them with a solution of boracic acid and then applying a coating of gelatin, substantially as described.\n\n'2. The method of treating articles of food to preserve and enhance their value, which consists in washing them with a solution of boracic aid and then applying a coating of gelatin, and finally wrapping the article in tissue paper which has been impregnated with a solution of boracic acid, substantially as specified.'\n\n And in the specification he affirmed:\n'This invention aims to prolong the period of usefulness of fruit, vegetables, eggs, and the like as articles of food and prevent their usual rapid decay and deterioration, thereby benefiting the grower, the shipper, the merchant, and the consumer.\n\n'The invention consists in subjecting the article of food to an antiseptic bath of purify, cleanse, and kill all germs, then treating it to a coat of air-excluding material. This process not only preserves the articles of food, but enhances its value. ...\n\n'The application of boracic acid is advantageous in that it prevents decay and adds to the appearance of the article and is perfectly harmless to the human system. The gelatin, besides excluding the air, also adds to the appearance of the article. ...' \n\n[283 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n That boracic (boric) acid-a weak acid-and borax, with an alkaline reaction, inhibit the rapid development of blue mold, has long been known. Both are compounds of boron and contain the 'boric acid radical.' Their antiseptic quality is due to the presence of that element. For present purposes, the two must be regarded as equivalents, and the mere substitution of one for the other would not involve invention or avoid infringement. Walker on Patents (6th Ed.)  426.\n\n Read together, the claims and specification of the Bishop patent show that he intended it should have wide application and cover treatment of citrus, as well as other, fruits. He distinctly states the application of boracic acid prevents the usual rapid decay, and upon this basic fact respondent endeavors to support the patent in suit.\n True, Bishop proposed as a secondary step the application of gelatine which he averred would exclude the air and enhance the appearance of the article. But Brogden and Trowbridge also said in their specification that, 'if the benefits of the invention are to be realized to the fullest extent,' the fruit after being soaked should receive an application of protective coating material, such as paraffin, or like waxy material.

RAILROAD COMMISSION(1931)\nNo. 470\nArgued: Decided: May 18, 1931\n\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 380, 381]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. W. Durbrow, of San Francisco, Cal., and Frank Karr and Robert Brennan, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for appellants.\n\n\n[283 U.S. 380, 386]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Arthur T. George, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are appeals from judgments of the Supreme Court of California, which affirmed an order of the railroad commission of that state requiring the appellants to construct a union passenger station in the city of Los Angeles, together with incidental connections, extensions, improvements and terminal facilities, in substantial compliance with the plan outlined by the commission. 209 Cal. 460, 288 P. 775.\n Proceedings were begun before the state railroad commission in the year 1916, and in December, 1921, after two hearings, the railway companies were required to remove certain grade crossings and to build a union terminal within a defined area known as the Plaza site in Los Angeles. 19 Opinions, R. R. Com., Cal. 740; 20 Opinions, R. R. Com., Cal. 937. The Supreme Court of the state held that the order was beyond the power of the commission, because the subject matter had been committed to the Interstate Commerce Commission by the Transportation Act of 1920. 190 Cal. 214, 211 \n\n[283 U.S. 380, 387]\n\u00a0\n P. 460. The judgment was affirmed by this Court. \n264 \nU.S. 331\n, 44 S. Ct. 376. The Court held tat t he relocation of tracks, which was incidental to the proposed union station, required a certificate of approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission under paragraphs 18 to 21 of section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the Transportation Act of 1920 (41 Stat. 476-478 (49 USCA  1(18-21)), as a condition precedent to the validity of any action by the carriers or of any order by the State Railroad Commission. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Pending the consideration of that case, a proceeding was instituted before the Interstate Commerce Commission by the city of Los Angeles to obtain an order requiring the three railway companies to build the union station at the designated place. That commission decided, July 6, 1925 ( 100 I. C. C. 421), that it was without authority to require the construction of the station. But, in order to facilitate the disposition of the case, the commission made certain hypothetical certificates substantially as follows:2\n'(1) That the public convenience and necessity require the extensions of lines that may be necessary to reach and serve and union passenger station within the plaza which may be constructed in accordance with a lawful order of the State Commission and that may be necessary to provide for the incidental rearrangement of passenger and freight routes, and that the expense involved will not impair the carriers' ability to perform their duties to the public. (2) That public convenience and necessity permit the abandonment of train service on Alamenda street and such other abandonments of lines as would be necessary in connection with the establishment of any such \n\n[283 U.S. 380, 388]\n\u00a0\n station, so lawfully ordered by the State Commission. The report further found that such joint use of track or other terminal facilities as may be incidental and necessary to the proper operation of any such union station is in the public interest and is practicable, without substantially impairing the owning carriers' ability to handle their own business.'\n\n In reaching its conclusion, the Interstate Commerce Commission made an extended review of the question of the expense involved. Stating that 'if a union station were built at the Plaza under substantially the plan presented by the California commission, the new money necessary to be raised, less the value of property released from passenger service, would be about $5,500,000. The total investment in passenger facilities under the Plaza plan would approximate $9,500,000.' 100 I. C. C. page 457.\n After setting forth its findings upon the record before it, the commission reserved jurisdiction for the purpose of making such further findings and orders, and issuing such certificates, as should be warranted in the event that the plan of the state commission as finally evolved should be materially different from that 'as here considered to be in the public interest.' Id., 100 I. C. C. page 461.\n Following this action of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the proceeding before the state commission was reopened. The action of the federal commission was submitted, hearings were had at which evidence was received, and, on July 8, 1927, the state commission made the order, which was the subject of the judgments now under review, requiring the building of the station within the Plaza area and the establishment of the connections, additions and facilities which that project involved. The state commission found that 'the present and future public convenience and necessity' required the construction of the union station, and that it could be constructed at a cost of approximately $10,000,000 in substantial com- \n\n[283 U.S. 380, 389]\n\u00a0\n pliance with the plan outlined, which was found to be in all essential respects similar to that considered by the Interstate Commerce Commission in its order above mentioned. 30 Opinions, R. R. Com., Cal. 151.\n Petitions for final order were the pre sented by the city of Los Angeles and the state commission to the Interstate Commerce Commission. After further hearing the latter commission made its report, on May 8, 1928, adhering to the conclusions of its former report that 'public convenience and necessity' required the extension by the railway companies of their respective main lines in the city of Los Angeles 'so as to reach and serve a union passenger station and terminal which they may construct in the Plaza district,' pursuant to order of the state commission to that effect, with 'the abandonment of other portions of main lines to provide for incidental rearrangement of routes, and the abandonment of train service on Alameda Street,' and that 'such joint use is in the public interest and practicable, without impairing the ability of the carrier or carriers owning or entitled to the enjoyment of such track or tracks to handle its or their own business.' The Interstate Commerce Commission issued its certificate accordingly, but the petition for the issue of an order requiring the railway companies to construct a union station was denied. 142 I. C. C. 489.\n Application was then made to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for a writ of mandamus to compel the Interstate Commerce Commission to consider the evidence introduced before it for the purpose of determining whether the commission should order the railway companies to build the union station, and, after consideration of the evidence, to make such an order as the facts required. Dismissal of that petition was reversed by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia (59 App. D. C. 81, 34 F.(2d) 228), and, upon writ of certiorari, this Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals. This Court held that the Congress \n\n[283 U.S. 380, 390]\n\u00a0\n had not conferred upon the Interstate Commerce Commission authority to require the building of the station. \n280 \nU.S. 52\n, 50 S. Ct. 53.\n Referring to its former decision, the Court said (Id., 280 U. S. page 71, 50 S. Ct. 53, 57): 'The only issue there presented to this court was whether it was necessary to secure from the Interstate Commerce Commission its approval of the construction of a union station and the relocation of the connecting tracks proposed. The point in that case was the necessity for the acquiescence by the Interstate Commerce Commission in respect to a union passenger station. We held such a certificate to be necessary before a union station or connecting lines of interstate carriers could be lawful. That is all we held.'\n Thereupon, the railway companies petitioned the Supreme Court of the state to review the order of the state commission requiring the construction of the station, and that court entered the judgments of affirmance from which these appeals have been taken.\n The questions presented are solely those of constitutional authority. All questions of fact as to public convenience and necessity, and as to the practicability of the proposed plan, have been resolved against the railway companies by the proper tribunals. This Court had held that the state commission could not require the construction of the proposed station, and the relocation of connecting tracks, without the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission. That approval has been given. This Court has also decided that the Interstate Commerce Commission has not been empowered to require the building of the station. That commission has not attempted to exercise any such authority. The question now is as to the authority of the state commission, in view of the action of the federal commission, to require the construction of the station with the incidental arrangement of tracks and facilities. The decision of the state court \n\n[283 U.S. 380, 391]\n\u00a0\n is conclusive so far as the constitution and laws of the state are concerned. The state commission has acted within the power conferred upon it. The only questions before us are those arising under the federal constitution and the Interstate Commerce Act.\n First. The railway companies conten tha t the order of the state commission is repugnant to the commerce clause and is in conflict with the powers vested by the Congress in the Interstate Commerce Commission. The argument is that as to union terminal facilities, joint use of tracks and abandonment of lines, the Congress has occupied the field and that state authority has been abrogated. Northern Pacific Railway Company v. Washington, \n222 \nU.S. 370\n, 32 S. Ct. 160; Pennsylvania Railroad Company v. Public Service Commission, \n250 \nU.S. 566\n, 40 S. Ct. 36; Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153\n, 46 S. Ct. 452; Alabama & Vicksburg Railway Company v. Jackson & Eastern Railway Company, \n271 \nU.S. 244\n, 46 S. Ct. 535; Missouri Pacific Railroad Company v. Porter, \n273 \nU.S. 341\n, 47 S. Ct. 383. The contention presupposes that state authority could be exerted were it not for the provisions of the federal legislation. That is, that it was the intention of Congress to prevent the exercise of state power in this matter of serious public interest, although no authority was given to the federal commission to meet the public need. Such an intention to override existing state authority to deal with local exigencies is not to be imputed to the Congress unless its enactment compels that conclusion. In deciding that the Congress had given to the Interstate Commerce Commission no power to require the building of such a union terminal as that projected in this case, this Court adverted to the extent of the authority that would be involved and the effect of its exercise upon local interests. The Court said (280 U. S. pages 68, 69, 50 S. Ct. 53, 56):\n'Such authority, if conferred in Los Angeles, would have application to all interstate railroad junctions, including the numerous large cities of the country, with their \n\n[283 U.S. 380, 392]\n\u00a0\n residential, commercial, shopping, and municipal centers now fixed and established with relation to existing terminals. It would become a statute of the widest effect and would enter into the welfare of every part of the country. Various interests would be vitally affected by the substitution of a union station for the present terminals. A selection of its site from the standpoint of a city might greatly affect property values and likewise local transportation systems. The exercise of such power would compel the carriers to abandon existing terminals, to acquire new land and rights of way and enter upon new construction, to abandon large tracts, and to sell territory of the same extent as no longer necessary for the use of the carriers.\n\n'There would have to be tribunals to apportion the expenditures and cost as between the carriers. A proper statute would seem to require detailed directions, and we should expect the intention to be manifested in plain terms and not to have been left to be implied from varied regulatory provisions of uncertain scope. It would be a monumental work and one requiring the most extensive exercise of expert engineering and railroad construction. It would make possible great changes of much importance in the plans of every city and in the rearrangement and mutations of railroad property and public and private business structures everywhere. We find no statutory preparation for the organization of such machinery.'\n\n The considerations which led the Court to the conclusion that the power to compel the construction of such terminals had been withheld from the federal commission also make it clear that the authority which resided in the state had not been taken away except to the extent that the approval of the federal commission was required. The principle thus applicable has been frequently stated. It is that the Congress may circumscribe its regulation and occupy a limited field, and that the \n\n[283 U.S. 380, 393]\n\u00a0\n intention to supersede the exercise by the state of its authority as to matters not covered by the federal legislation is not to be implied unless the Act of Congress fairly interpreted is in conflict with the law of the State.

Railroad Commission, \n236 \nU.S. 439, 446\n, 35 S. Ct. 304; Illinois Central Railroad Company v. Public Utilities Commission, \n245 \nU.S. 493, 510\n, 38 S. Ct. 170; Carey v.

R. 805; International Shoe Company v. Pinkus, \n278 \nU.S. 261, 265\n, 49 S. Ct. 108. We find no such conflict in this case, as the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission has been obtained, and its certificate of public convenience and necessity has been issued, in relation to the rearrangement, extensions and abandonment of tracks, and the use of the terminal facilities, involved in the proposed plan, and nothing further was required by the Interstate Commerce Act.\n Second. The appellants further insist that the certificates of the Interstate Commerce Commission are void. The point is that the certificates were not issued upon the application of the railway companies but in proceedings adverse to them and over their protest. It is urged that paragraphs 18 to 20 of section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act give the commission no power to issue such certificates except upon application of the carriers, and that the certificates were also unauthorized under paragraph 21 of that section.\n The provisions of these paragraphs (18 to 21) contain no such limitation as that suggested. While they relate 'to the construction, acquisition, extension, and abandonment of a railroad,' and 'deal primarily with rights sought to be exercised by the carrier' (Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Railway Company v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 404, 408\n, 48 S. Ct. 189, 191) these paragraphs do not exclude appropriate action by the commission upon applications by \n\n[283 U.S. 380, 394]\n\u00a0\n those who have a proper interest in the subject-matter, although they are not carriers. If the state could be deemed to have no authority to compel the building of such a union terminal as that here involved, the question would not arise. But if the state originally had this authority, and the federal legislation has not superseded it, but has required, as this Court has held, a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Interstate Commerce Commission as a condition precedent to the validity of any order on the part of the state commission, we find no warrant for construing the statute as precluding the application which is necessary to obtain such a certificate. In its first opinion, this Court said that it was advised that the city of Los Angeles had filed a petition with the Interstate Commerce Commission and that the court thought that the course taken by the city 'was the correct one.' 264 U. S. pages 347, 348, 44 S. Ct. 376, 380. While the statement was obiter, it intimated an opinion which has been confirmed by further consideration of the purpose and terms of the statute. Nothing was said in the second opinion contrary to that view. The approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the issue of its certificate of public convenience and necessity being indispensable under the Act, application could properly be made by the authorities of the state, assuming that with such certificate that were entitled to require the establishment of the station.\n Third. We are thus brought to the contention of the appellants that the order of the state commission deprives the railway companies of their property without due process of law, and denies to them the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.\n The principle that the state, directly or through an authorized commission, may require railroad companies \n\n[283 U.S. 380, 395]\n\u00a0\n to provide reasonably adequate and suitable facilities for te co nvenience of the communities served by them, has frequently been applied.

The question in each case is whether, in the light of the facts disclosed, the regulation is essentially an unreasonable one. Wisconsin, Minnesota & Pacific Railroad Company v. Jacobson, supra; Norfolk & Western Railway Company v. Public Service Commission, supra. And 'the matter of expense is 'an important criteria to be taken into view in determining the reasonableness of the order.\" Oregon Railroad & Navigation Company v. Fairchild, \n224 \nU.S. 510, 529\n, 32 S. Ct. 535, 540.\n In the present case, careful inquiry has been made into all the relevant facts. There have been three hearings before the state commission and two hearings before the Interstate Commerce Commission. The inadequacy of existing facilities has been shown and the relative merits of various plans have been the subject of elaborate study. The expense involved in the plan adopted, when considered in relation to the importance of the interests affected and to be served, does not appear to be so large as to warrant the condemnation of the plan as unreasonable and beyond the authority of the state. In its second report, pursuant to which the certificate of public convenience and necessity was issued, the Interstate Commerce Commission said (142 I. C. C. 495, 496):\n'It will be observed that our findings of fact in the original report, previously set out are in effect duplicated by finding num bered 1 to 6 of the Railroad Commission of the State of California in its decision of July 8, 1927, as appears in Appendix 1 hereto. The State commission in addition found (7) that the present and future public convenience and necessity require and will require the construction by defendants and each of them of a union passenger station within that portion of Los Angeles described in the third finding, with the track and other facilities reasonably necessary, convenient, or incidental to the use of such passenger station; (8) that in its opin- \n\n[283 U.S. 380, 397]\n\u00a0\n ion an adequate union passenger station could be constructed within the described portion of the city at a cost of approximately $10,000, 000, in substantial compliance with the plan outlined in its Exhibit 4-B, which is found to be in all essential respects similar to the plan considered by us in our original decision and report; (9) that such plan for a union passenger station in the Plaza portion of Los Angeles in the opinion of the State commission is and would be in the public interest, and that its construction is practicable, without impairing the ability of the defendants to perform their respective duties to the public; and (10) that such construction ought reasonably to be made. ... All of the testimony of record in the original proceeding before us was examined and given careful analysis in our original report. We adhere to the conclusions there expressed, upon a further consideration of the whole record, including the subsequently imported testimony taken before the California commission. In our judgment, the findings of the California commission numbered 7 to 10, inclusive, as appears in the appendix and as above summarized, find sufficient support in the record.'\n\n We find no basis for the conclusion that the findings of fact are unsupported by evidence, or that, in view of the facts thus ascertained, the order of the state commission is unreaable or arbitrary.\n In this view, the judgments of the Supreme Court of the state are affirmed.\n Judgments affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed upon the ground that the assailed order of the railroad commission is arbitrary, unreasonable, and beyond any power which the state is competent to confer. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Interstate Commerce Commission v.

C., for petitioner.\n Mr. John P. Grace, of Charleston, S. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.\n This is an action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59) for causing the death of Marshall, the respondent's deceased. It has been before the Court after an earlier trial, Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Tyner, \n278 \nU.S. 565\n, 49 S. Ct. 35, and now is brought here again to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of South Carolina affirming a judgment for the plaintiff. 159 S. C. -, 159 S. E. 473. The petitioner contends that it was entitled to have a verdict directed in its favor on the grounds that there was no evidence that it was negligent and that Marshall must be taken to have assumed the risk of the supposed cause of his death.\n It may be assumed that Marshall, a switchman was killed while on the outside of a moving car by being brought into contact with a semaphore near the railroad track. The only ground for charging the Company with negligence that we regard as material is the suggestion that the semaphore was too near the track. The general principles laid down with regard to mail cranes in Southern Pacific Company v. Berkshire, \n254 \nU.S. 415\n, 41 S. Ct. 162, and Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. Leitch, \n276 \nU.S. 429\n, 48 S. Ct. 336, apply equally to semaphores. It is impracticable always to set suchstru ctures so far away as to leave no danger to one leaning out, and in dealing with a well known incident of the employment, adopted in the interest of the public and of the employees, it is unreasonable to throw the risks of it upon those who were compelled to adopt it. \n\n[283 U.S. 401, 403]\n\u00a0\n The semaphore in this instance was four feet and ten inches at its base from the outer edge of the track and probably a little more at four feet above the top of the rail. An order of the South Carolina Railroad Commission, made, as it states, in consideration of the safety or the public and employees of the road and of the necessity for employees to give and receive signals, provides that no structure be allowed nearer than four feet from the outer edge of the main or side track, measurement being made four feet above the top of the rail. It will be seen that the Railroad Company in this case more than complied with the order. It is true that four feet was a minimum distance, but it satisfied the requirement of the Commission, and it would be going far to say that the Railroad Company was not warranted in supposing that it had done its duty, so far as the Commission was concerned, when it put the semaphore four feet and ten inches away. Marshall from his previous experience probably knew of the semaphore as he was required to do by the rules of the road. It was shown that some other semaphores were farther from the track, but the circumstances do not appear, and there is nothing to show that in this case the petitioner could have made the position safer than it was, except by changing the place of the track. As remarked in Southern Pacific Co. v. Berkshire, \n254 \nU.S. 415, 417\n, 41 S. Ct. 162, the question is not whether a reasonable insurance against such misfortunes should be thrown upon the travelling public through the railroads, but whether the railroad is liable under the statute according to the principles of the common law regarding tort. No negligence is proved against the petitioner. It is urged that a certiorari was denied (\n269 \nU.S. 578\n, 46 S. Ct. 104) in Central of Georgia Ry. Co. v. Davis (C. C. A.) 7 F.(2d) 269, which seemed to qualify the doctrine of the Berkshire Case. But 'The denial of a writ of certiorari imports no expression of opinion upon the merits of the \n\n[283 U.S. 401, 404]\n\u00a0\n case, as the bar has been told many times.' United States v.

Agerton, both of Fort Worth, Tex., for appellant.\n Mr. Gib Callaway, of Brownwood, Tex., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Bain Peanut Company, a corporation of Texas, was sued in Comanche County of that State, being the county in which the cause of action arose. Its principal office was in Tarrant County, Texas. In due form it raised the question whether the statute of Texas (subdivision 24, article 1830, R. S. 1911, now subdivision 23, article 1995, R. S. 1925) that allowed suits against private corporations to be brought in any county in which the cause of action arose was valid under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution when unincorporated individuals are assumed not to be 'subject to suit outside their domiciliary counties in a similar situation.' We understand the Supreme Court of the State to have upheld the constitutionality of the statute although at first we were misled by the form of the order dismissing the application for a writ of error 'for want of jurisdiction.' A certificate from the Court executed since the question of our jurisdiction was before us satisfies us that the form was adopted in compliance with the Court's interpretation of a statute, and that while the Court was of opinion that the judgment sought to be brought up was correct in upholding the statute, yet, since it also regarded the \n\n[282 U.S. 499, 501]\n\u00a0\n opinion as incorrect in its declaration of the law, its duty was to adopt the above quoted form. The judgment below stood affirmed in fact against the fully stated objection of the appellant, and justice requires that the objection should be dealt with, although at first it seemed as if the Supreme Court was acting upon local grounds of procedure with which we have nothing to do, except when used as a cloak which was not the case here.\n Coming then to the merits, we are of opinion that the judgment was right. The interpretation of constitutional principles must not be too literal. We must remember that the machinery of government would not work if it were not allowed a little play in its joints. In deciding whether a corporation is denied the equal protection of the laws when its creator establishes a more extensive venue for actions against it than are fixed for private citizens we have to consider not a geometrical equation between a corporation and a man but whether the difference does injustice to the class generally, even though it bear hard in some particular case, which is not alleged or proved here. Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co., \n197 \nU.S. 430, 434\n, 25 S. Ct. 466; Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 138, 144\n, 34 S. Ct. 281. This it is for the corporation to make out. The range of the State's discretion is large. Armour & Co. v. North Dakota, \n240 \nU.S. 510, 516\n, 517 S., 36 S. Ct. 440, Ann. Cas. 1916D, 548. The question seems to be answered by Cincinnati Street Ry. Co. v. Snell, \n193 \nU.S. 30, 36\n, 37 S., 24 S. Ct. 319, which lays down that if the protection of fundamental rights by equal laws equally administered is enjoyed, the Constitution does not forbid allowing one person to seek a forum from which another in the same class is excluded. But without asserting a universal proposition it is obvious that there is likely to be such a difference between the business done by a corporation and that done by a private person that the State well may take it into account when it permits a corporation to be formed. That \n\n[282 U.S. 499, 502]\n\u00a0\n the provision in question is reasonable is made more probable by the fact that it had been adopted and sustained not only in Texas but in other States.

IOWA STATE TRAVELING MEN'S ASS'N(1931)\nNo. 445\nArgued: April 22, 1931Decided: May 18, 1931\n\n\n\n Messrs. Denton Dunn, C. W. Prince, and James Beery, all of Kansas City, Mo., and F. W. Lehmann, Jr., of Des Moines, Iowa, for petitioner.\n Mr. J. M. Parsons, of Des Moines, Iowa, for respondent. \n\n[283 U.S. 522, 523]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A writ of certiorari was granted herein1 to review the affirmance by the Circuit Court of Appeals2 of a judgment for respondent rendered by the District Court for Southern Iowa. The action was upon the record of a judgment rendered in favor of the petitioner against the respondent in the United States District Court for Western Missouri.\n The defense was lack of jurisdiction of the person of the respondent in the court which entered the judgment. After hearing, in which a jury was waived, this defense was sustained and the action dismissed. The first suit was begun in a Missouri state court and removed to the District Court. Respondent appeared specially and moved to quash and dismiss for want of service. The court quashed the service, but refused to dismiss. An alias summons was issued and returned served, whereupon it again appeared specially, moved to set aside the service, quash the return, and dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction of its person. After a hearing on affidavits and \n\n[283 U.S. 522, 524]\n\u00a0\n briefs, the motion was overruled, with leave to plead within thirty days. No plea having been filed within that period, the cause proceeded, and judgment was entered for the amount claimed. Respondent did not move to set aside the judgment nor sue out a writ of error.\n The ground of the motion made in the first suit is the same as that relied on as a defense to this one, namely, that the respondent is an Iowa corporation, that it never was present in Missouri, and that the person served with process in the latter state was not such an agent that service on him constituted a service on the corporation. The petitioner objected to proof of these matters, asserting that the defense constituted a colateral attack and a retrial of an issue settled in the first suit. The overruling of this objection and the resulting judgment for respondent are assigned as error.\n The petitioner suggests that article 4, section 1, of the Constitution, forbade the retrial of the question determined on respondent's motion in the Missouri District Court; but the full faith and credit required by that clause is not involved, since neither of the courts concerned was a state court. Compare Cooper v. Newell, \n173 \nU.S. 555, 567\n, 19 S. Ct. 506, 43 L Ed. 808; Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias v. Meyer, \n265 \nU.S. 30, 33\n, 44 S. Ct. 432. The respondent, on the other hand, insists that to deprive it of the defense which it made in the court below, of lack of jurisdiction over it by the Missouri District Court, would be to deny the due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment; but there is involved in that doctrine no right to litigate the same question twice. Chicago Life Ins. Co. v. Cherry, \n244 \nU.S. 25\n, 37 S. Ct. 492; compare York v. Texas, \n137 \nU.S. 15\n, 11 S. Ct. 9.\n The substantial matter for determination is whether the judgment amounts to res judicata on the question of the jurisdiction of the court which rendered it over the person of the respondent. It is of no moment that the \n\n[283 U.S. 522, 525]\n\u00a0\n appearance was a special one expressly saving any submission to such jurisdiction. That fact would be important upn ap peal from the judgment, and would save the question of the propeiety of the court's decision on the matter, even though, after the motion had been overruled, the respondent had proceeded, subject to a reserved objection and exception, to a trial on the merits. Harkness v. Hyde, \n98 U.S. 476\n; Goldey v. Morning News, \n156 \nU.S. 518\n, 15 S. Ct. 559; Toledo Rys. & Light Co. v. Hill, \n244 \nU.S. 49\n, 37 S. Ct. 591; Hitchman Coal & Coke Co. v.

The special appearance gives point to the fact that the respondent entered the Missouri court for the very purpose of litigating the question of jurisdiction over its person. It had the election not to appear at all. If, in the absence of appearance, the court had proceeded to judgment, and the present suit had been brought thereon, respondent could have raised and tried out the issue in the present action, because it would never have had its day in court with respect to jurisdiction. Thompson v. Whitman, 18 Wall. (85 U. S.) 457; Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 U.S. 714\n; Hart v. Sansom, \n110 \nU.S. 151\n, 3 S. Ct. 586; Wetmore v. Karrick, \n205 \nU.S. 141\n, 27 S. Ct. 434; Bigelow v.

It had also the right to appeal from the decision of the Missouri District Court, as is shown by Harkness v. Hyde, supra, and the other anthorities cited. It elected to follow neither of those courses, but, after having been defeated upon full hearing in its contention as to jurisdiction, it took no further steps, and the judgment in question resulted.\n Public policy dictates that there be an end of litigation; that those who have contested an issue shall be bound by the result of the contest; and that matters once tried shall be considered forever settled as between the parties. We see no reason why this doctrine should not apply in every \n\n[283 U.S. 522, 526]\n\u00a0\n case where one voluntarily appears, presents his case and is fully heard, and why he should not, in the absence of fraud, be thereafter concluded by the judgment of the tribunal to which he has submitted his cause.\n While this Court has never been called upon to determine the specific question here raised, several federal courts have held the judgment res judicata in like circumstances. Phelps v. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association (C. C. A.) 112 F. 453, 61. L. R. A. 717, affirmed on other grounds \n190 \nU.S. 147\n, 23 S. Ct. 707; Moch v. Insurance Co. ( C. C.) 10 F. 696; Thomas v. Virden (C. C. A.) 160 F. 418; Chinn v. Foster- Milburn Co. (D. C.) 195 F. 158. And we are in accord with this view.\n Respondent relies upon National Exchange Bank v. Wiley, \n195 \nU.S. 257\n, 25 S. Ct. 70, but it is not in point; for there it was shown, not that the defendant in the judgment of the Ohio state court on which suit was brought had appeared and contested jurisdiction, but that an attorney without right or authority had assumed to appear and confess judgment on its behalf.\n Bank of Jasper v. First National Bank, \n258 \nU.S. 112\n, 42 S. Ct. 202, cited by respondent, involved a wholly different question from that here presented. There a suit in equity was brought in a state court against both resident and nonresident defendants. Pursuant to state law, constructive service upon the nonresidents was made by publication. One of them, a Georgia bank, appeared specially and moved to quash the service. Its motion was overruled, and on appeal the Supreme Court of the state affirmed, holding that the purpose of the statute authorizing constructive service by publication was merely to notify nonresidents of the pending suit so that they might, if they cared to do so, come into the case. It heldthat there was no right to quash the notice, but that the nonresident had its full right to object should the court thereafter commit an error against it. This Court held that the special appearance for the purpose of quashing the notice \n\n[283 U.S. 522, 527]\n\u00a0\n of service did not amount to a general appearance. Subsequent proceedings in the state court, therefore, were taken without the presence of the bank, and were not binding upon it unless the res to be affected was in Florida and subject to the control of the state court. That point was not litigated by the bank-it was not present. This Court held there was not such res subject to the power of the state court, and therefore its judgment was not binding upon those who were not actual parties.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \n282 \nU.S. 827\n, 51 S.

SUPERIOR COURT(1931)\nNo. 43\nArgued: Decided: November 23, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 8, 9]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert B. Murphey, of Los Angeles, Cal., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 8, 10]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James S. Bennett, of Los Angeles, Cal., and U. S. Webb, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellants are producers of oil and gas from their respective wells in the Santa Fe Springs oil field, in Los Angeles county, Cal. In September, 1929, the state, acting through its director of natural resources, brought suit in the Superior Court of the state against the appellants and others, seeking to enjoin an alleged unreasonable waste of natural gas 912, p. 1724; 1929, c. 535, p. 924. Section 8b found in sections 8b and 14b of what is called the Oil and Gas Conservation Act of California. Stat. Cal. 1915, c. 718, p. 1404; 1917, c. 759, p. 1586; 1919, c. 536, p. 1165; 1921, c. 912, p. 1724; 1929. c. 535, p. 924. Section 8b prohibits 'the unreasonable waste of natural gas,' and section 14b authorizes suit by the director of natural resources to enforce the prohibition. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[284 U.S. 8, 11]\n\u00a0\n The Superior Court granted a preliminary injunction after a hearing upon the pleadings, affidavits, oral testimony, and documents submitted. The court recited in its order that there appeared to be an unreasonable waste of natural gas in the Santa Fe Springs oil field, and that an injunction was necessary in order 'to preserve the subject matter of the action to abide the decree of the court at the conclusion of the trial.' The court restricted the average daily production of 'net formation gas' from 'any lease or other property unit' to the amount shown for each operator in an accompanying schedule. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[284 U.S. 8, 12]\n\u00a0\n The court also directed each defendant to file reports showing the daily production of gas and oil, and the order was without prejudice to the right of any of the parties to move on five days' notice for modification of the injunction. The court later modified the order in particulars not important here. Appellants state that the order curtailed their production of gas from 57,120,000 to 27,187,000 cubic feet a day. \n\n[284 U.S. 8, 13]\n\u00a0\n Thereupon the appellants sought a writ of prohibition from the District Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District of the state, restraining the Superior Court and the respondent, William Hazlett, as one of its judges, from enforcing the injunction order. The jurisdiction of the Superior Court was attacked upon the ground of the invalidity of the statute invoked. The appellants contended, in substance, that the statute violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, in that it afforded no certain or definite standard as to what constituted 'waste' or 'unreasonable waste,' and unlawfully delegated power to the Superior Court to legislate upon that subject, in that, upon the facts and as applied against the appellants, the statute prohibited them 'from utilizing such amount of natural gas produced from their respective wells' as was 'reasonably necessary to produce oil therefrom in quantities not exceeding a reasonable proportion to the amount of oil produced from the same well'; and in that the statute required appellants to curtail their production of oil and gas 'for the purpose of conserving such natural gas for the benefit of the general public' without eminent domain proceedings and without just compensation, and was so arbitrary and oppressive that it was in excess of the power of the state. By reference to their pleadings in the injunction suit, the appellants also assailed, under the due process clause, the provision of the statute as to what should constitute prima facie evidence of unreasonable waste, and the appellants further insisted that the statute as enforced against them impaired the obligation of their lease contracts in violation of the contract clause of the Federal Constitution and that they were denied the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The respondents (appellees here) demurred to the petition, and the District Court of Appeal, entertaining and overruling the contentions of the appellants under the \n\n[284 U.S. 8, 14]\n\u00a0\n due process clause, denied the writ of prohibition. 293 P. 899. The appellants then applied for a hearing in the Supreme Court of the state, and, this having been denied, they seek in this Court a review of the judgment of the District Court of Appeal.\n This Court has jurisdiction. The proceeding for a writ of prohibition is a distinct suit, and the judgment finally disposing of it is a final judgment within the meaning of section 237(a) of the Judicial Code. U. S. C., tit. 28,  344(a), 28 USCA  344(a); Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 464; Mt. Vernon Cotton Company v. Alabama Power Company, \n240 \nU.S. 30, 31\n, 36 S. Ct. 234; State of Missouri ex rel. St. Louis B. & M. Rwy. Co. v. Taylor, \n266 \nU.S. 200, 206\n, 45 S. Ct. 47, 42 A. L. R. 1232; Michigan Central R. R. Co. v. Mix, \n278 \nU.S. 492, 494\n, 49 S. Ct. 207. That judgment, however, merely dealt with the jurisdiction of the Superior Court of the suit for injunction, and the only question before us is whether the District Court of Appeal erred in deciding the federal questions as to the validity of the statute upon which that jurisdiction was based. Moreover, with all questions of fact, or with questions of law which would appropriately be raised upon the facts adduced in the trial of the case in the Superior Court, as a court competent to entertain the suit, we are not concerned on this appeal. The appellants annexed to their petition in the prohibition proceeding, and made a part of it, the pleadings in the injunction suit and the affidavits presented upon the hearing of the application for preliminary injunction. But they could not in that manner, or by their characterization of the evidence thus adduced, or by pleading the conclusions derived therefrom, substitute the District Court of Appeal for the Superior Court in the determination of the facts, or of the law as addressed to the facts, which should properly be considered by the latter tribunal. It appears that in California, in accordance with the general conception of the province of the writ, prohibition is for the purpose of arresting the proceedings of any tribunal exercising ju- \n\n[284 U.S. 8, 15]\n\u00a0\n dicial functions when such proceedings are without, or in excess of, jurisdiction. Cal. Code of Civ. Proc.  1102, 1103; Jacobsen v. Superior Court, 192 Cal. 319, 219 P. 986, 29 A. L. R. 1399. See, also, Baar v. Smith, 201 Cal. 87, 101, 255 P. 827, 833. The writ of prohibition is not available as a substitute for an appeal from a court having jurisdiction. As was said by the Supreme Court of California, in Truck Owners & Shippers, Inc., v. Superior Court, 194 Cal. 146, 155, 228 P. 19, 22, 23: 'If the superior court has jurisdiction to entertain the action, it has the power to define the right sought to be protected. ... If the judgment of the superior court be incorrect, it may be reversed on appeal, but not on prohibition.'\n After the decision of the District Court of Appeal, and before the denial by the Supreme Court of the state of a hearing in the instant case, the latter court passed upon the constitutional validity of the statute in question. That decision was made upon an application for a writ of supersedeas pending an appeal by certain codefendants of the appellants here (who were not parties to the appeal) from the above-mentioned injunction order. People ex rel. Stevenot, Director of Natural Resources, v. Associated Oil Company et al., 211 Cal. 93, 294 P. 717. The Supreme Court found no reason to interfere with the action of the Superior Court, and, later, the Supreme Court, on that appeal, affirmed the injunction order holding that under the statute the Superior Court had the power to determine what wastage of gas in the production of oil was unreasonable. Id. 297 P. 536, 537. The District Court of Appeal, in the instant case, had expressed the same opinion, and accordingly decided that it could not interfere by writ of prohibition. 293 P. at page 907.\n It follows that, in considering and deciding federal questions in the prohibition proceeding, the District Court of Appeal must be regarded, as its opinion imports, as \n\n[284 U.S. 8, 16]\n\u00a0\n having determined merely that the statute was valid upon its face so that the Superior Court had jurisdiction to entertain the injunction suit. It is that determination alone that we can now consider.\n The District Court of Appeal overruled the contention that the statute was so uncertain and devoid of any definition of a standard of conduct as to be inconsistent with due process. The Supreme Court of the state, reaching the same conclusion (in the opinion above cited, 211 Cal. 93, 294 P. at page 724), described the general condition in which oil and gas were found in California and the standard which the court considered to be established by the statute. After observing that courts were entitled to take judicial notice of the condition and development of the petroleum industry, and of matters of science and common knowledge, and referring to scientific reports, the Supreme Court said: 'For present purposes it need only be noted that oil in this state is found under layers of rock in a sand or sandstone formation termed lentille or 'lentil,' under pressure caused by the presence of natural gas within the formation. The layers of rock thus form a gas-tight dome or cover for the oil reserve. The oil adheres in the interstices between the sand particles. The natural gas may be in a free state at the top of the dome, but is also in solution with the oil, thus increasing the fluidity of the oil and the ease with which the oil is lifted with the gas in solution when the pressure on the gas is released by drilling into the oil 'sand.' It is estimated that only from 10 to 25 per cent. of the total amount of oil deposited in a reservoir is ultimately recovered, depending on the natural characteristics of the reservoir and the methods employed in utilizing the lifting power of the gas. The importance of gas in the oil-producing industry has, therefore, become a question of great concern to the industry itself and to government, to the end that its \n\n[284 U.S. 8, 17]\n\u00a0\n function may be fully utilized without waste. It fairly appears on this application that, depending on its location in the oil reservoir, the extent of the oil 'sand,' the degree of pressure within the formation, the amount of oil in the 'sand,' the amount of gas in solution with the oil, the porosity of the 'sand,' and other considerations, each oil and gas well has a best mean gas and oil ratio in the utilization of the lifting power of the gas and the production of the greatest quantity of oil in proportion to the amount of gas so utilized, and which may be computed as to each individual well to a reasonable degree of certainty and be regulated accordingly.'\n In view of these circumstances, the Supreme Court concluded that it might be said that there was an 'unreasonable waste' of gas where it 'has been allowed to come to the surface without its lifting power having been utilized to produce the greatest quantity of oil in proportion.' It was such a waste of gas, the court said, that the Legislature of California intended to prohibit. In support of this conclusion, the court referred to the provisions of section 8d of the statute. \n3\n These provisions showed, in the opinion of the court, that the legislature had 'plainly adopted the standard so expressed,' that is, 'that gas \n\n[284 U.S. 8, 18]\n\u00a0\n may not be produced, under existing conditions where the production thereof so greatly exceeds the market demand therefor, in quantities exceeding a reasonable proportion to the amount of oil produced.' And, in explanation of its reasons for considering such a standard sufficiently definite, the court said that 'because of the many and varying conditions peculiar to each reservoir and to each well, which will bear upon a determination of what is a reasonable proportion of gas to the amount of oil produced, it may be said that it would be impossible for the Legislature to frame a measure based on ratios or percentages or definite proportions which would operate without discrimination, and that what is a reasonable proportion of gas to the amount of oil produced from each well or reservoir is a matter which may be ascertained to a fair degree of certainty in each individual case.'\n The statute is to be read with the construction placed upon it by the state court. Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Company, \n220 \nU.S. 61, 73\n, 31 S. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160. And, so read, we find no ground for concluding that the statute should be regarded as invalid upon its face, merely by reason of uncertainty, so as to deprive the Superior Court of jurisdiction to consider the relevant questions of fact and to determine with respect to a particular field whether or not there has been the unreasonable waste of gas which the statute condemns. Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 377\n, 33 S. Ct. 780; Miller v. Strahl, \n239 \nU.S. 426, 434\n, 36 S. Ct. 147; Omaechevarria v. Idaho, \n246 \nU.S. 343, 348\n, 38 S. Ct. 323; Hygrade Provision Company v. Sherman, \n266 \nU.S. 497, 502\n, 45 S. Ct. 141.\n The appellants make the further contention that the statute is invalid because of the provisions of section 8b (supra, page 10) that 'the blowing, release or escape of natural gas into the air shall be prima facie evidence of unreasonable waste.' The state, in the exercise of its general power \n\n[284 U.S. 8, 19]\n\u00a0\n to prescribe rules of evidence, may provide that proof of a particular fact, or of several facts taken collectively, shall be prima facie evidence of another fact when there is some rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed. The legislative presumption is invalid when it is entirely arbitrary, or creates an invidious discrimination, or operates to deprive a party of a reasonable opportunity to present the pertinent facts in his defense. Mobile, etc., Railroad Company v. Turnipseed, \n219 \nU.S. 35, 43\n, 31 S. Ct. 136, 32 L. R. A. (N. S.) 226, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 463; Bailey v. Alabama, \n219 \nU.S. 219, 238\n, 31 S. Ct. 145; Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Company, supra, at pages 81, 82 of 220 U. S., 31 S. Ct. 337; Manley v. Georgia, \n279 \nU.S. 1, 5\n, 6 S., 49 S. Ct. 215; Western & Atlantic v. Henderson, \n279 \nU.S. 639, 642\n, 49 S. Ct. 445. In the present case there is a manifest connection between the fact proved and the fact presumed, and, under the construction placed upon the statute by the state court, there appears to be no deprivation of a full opportunity to present all the facts relating to operations within the field.\n The question remains whether the statutory scheme of regulation, with the standard which it sets up under the construction of the state court, is on its face beyond the power of the state. The District Court of Appeal, in the instant case, approached this question by considering the correlative rights, under the law of California, of surface owners in the same field. The court concluded that under the law of California, 'on account of the self propelling or migratory character of natural gas, as well as oil,' the owner of the surface did not have an absolute title to the gas and oil beneath, and could acquire such a title only when he had reduced these substances to possession. As justifying this opinion, the court cited the case of Acme Oil Company v. Williams, 140 Cal. 681, 74 P. 296, where the Supreme Court of the state had said, with respect to oil, that it is 'of a fluctuating, uncertain, fugi- \n\n[284 U.S. 8, 20]\n\u00a0\n tive nature, lies at unknown depths, and the quantity, extent and trend of its flow are uncertain. It requires but a small surface area, in what is known as an oil district, upon which to commence operations for its discovery. But when a well is developed the oil may be tributary to it for a long distance through the strate which holds it. This flow is not inexhaustible, no certain control over it can be exercised, and its actual possession can only be obtained, as against others in the same field, engaged in the same enterprise, by diligent and continuous pumping. It is anybody's property who can acquire the surface right to bore for it, and when the flow is penetrated, he who operates his well most diligently obtains the greatest benefit, and this advantage is increased in proportion as his neighbor similarly situated neglects his opportunity.' And the Supreme Court of the state, in its decision dealing with the statute in question, quoted this language and held that 'the same rule would apply to natural gas.' 211 Cal. 93, 294 P. at page 722.\n It was with that understanding of the law of the state that the District Court of Appeal considered the statute, taken as a whole, as one regulating and adjusting the coexisting rights of the surface owners in the same field, and accordingly sustained the statute as a valid exercise of state power against the contentions under the due process clause. The court said: 'It is the coexistence of these rights which authorizes the state to make use of its legislative power. When the rights of one impinge upon the rights of others the state may interpose for the purpose of adjusting and regulating the enjoyment of those rights.' The District Court of Appeal apparently thought it doubtful whether the state might restrict or regulate the production of oil or gas 'on the theory of the public's interest in their natural resources,' but deemed it unnecessary to \n\n[284 U.S. 8, 21]\n\u00a0\n decide that question in the present case. That court explicity refused to accept the view that the statute 'does not proceed upon the theory of correlative rights, but only upon the policy of conserving or preserving the common supply.' And, replying to the suggestion that the Legislature was without authority to restrict the production of oil, the District Court of Appeal concluded its opinion with the statement that the record did not 'indicate that the temporary injunction was founded upon such a theory. Nor are we determining that the act attempts to confer upon the court any such power. Rather we are convinced that a proper construction of the enactment confines the authority within the limits of enjoining the production of gas when in excess of the reasonable proportion to the oil for the particular field involved, when not conveniently necessary for other than lifting purposes.'\n While this was the basis of the decision of the District Court of Appeal, the appellants insist that, in the subsequent decisions upon the appeal from the injunction order of the Superior Court, the Supreme Court of the state has taken a broader ground and has upheld the statute as one designed to protect the public interest in the conservation of natural resources. 211 Cal. 93, 294 P. at pages 722, 723. We do not understand, however, that the Supreme Court in taking that view denied the operation of the statute as a safeguard of the coexisting rights of surface owners. On the contrary, the Supreme Court, in its second decision affirming the injunction order of the Superior Court, summed up its conclusions in these words (297 P. at pages 537, 538): 'We reiterate that the legislation in question has lawfully vested in the superior court the power to determine what wastage of gas in the production of oil is reasonable or unreason- \n\n[284 U.S. 8, 22]\n\u00a0\n able. Whether such wastage be reasonable or unreasonable is a question of fact and should be determined in view of the necessity of one land owner to make productive use of his parcel, in view of the equal right of the adjoining owners not to be deprived of correlative production from their parcels, and in view of the right of the public to prevent the waste of that which cannot be replaced.'\n If the statute be viewed as one regulating the exercise of the correlative rights of surface owners with respect to a common source of supply of oil and gas, the conclusion that the statute is valid upon its face, that is, considered apart from any attempted application of it in administration which might violate constitutional right, is fully supported by the decisions of this Court. Ohio Oil Company v. Indiana, \n177 \nU.S. 190, 210\n, 211 S., 20 S. Ct. 576; Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Company, supra, at page 77 of 220 U. S., 31 S. Ct. 337; Walls v. Midland Carbon Company, \n254 \nU.S. 300, 323\n, 41 S. Ct. 118. In that aspect, the statute unquestionably has a valid operation, and it cannot be said that the Superiod Court was without jurisdiction to entertain the suit in which the injunction order was granted. That was all that the District Court of Appeal determined in the judgment now under review. It is not necessary to go further and to deal with contentions not suitably raised by the record before us. Constitutional questions are not to be dealt with abstractly. Having jurisdiction of the suit, the Superior Court had authority to take steps to protect the subject-matter of the action pending the trial on the merits. The injunction order stated that to be its purpose. Upon the trial, all questions of fact and of law relevant to the application and enforcement of the statute may be raised, and every constitutional right which these appellants may have in any aspect of the case as finally developed may be appropriately asserted and determined in due course of procedure.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] These sections are as follows:\n'See. 8b.

The blowing, release or escape of natural gas into the air shall be prima facie evidence of unreasonable waste.' St. Cal. 1929, c. 535, p. 927.\n\n'Sec. 14b.

St. Cal. 1929, ch. 535, p. 930. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The injunction order sets forth 'that the evidence available to the Court at this time shows that the unreasonable waste of natural gas in said field may be substantially reduced and that the equities of all parties may be fairly conserved by a preliminary injunction which will limit the waste of gas by restricting the production thereof to a quantity reasonably in excess of the present outlets for beneficial use above ground, require the extraction of gasoline from the gas produced in the field; that accordingly for the purposes of this order, and total gas outlets for all uses with a reasonable tolerance to take care of fluctuating demands and the necessary waste is taken at approximately two hundred eighty-five million (285,000,000) cubic feet of gas each day, and the estimated potential production of oil is taken at two hundred thirty- seven thousand five hundred seventy-six (237,576) barrels each day distributed among leases and other operating property units, as shown in the schedule hereafter set out; and that sufficient cause has been shown for the extraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction pending the trial of the action on the merits, and the entry of a final judgment herein;\n'It is Ordered and Decreed that the above named defendants ... be and they hereby are restrained and enjoined ... until the further order of this court as follows:\n\n'1.

Jones, both of St. Louis, Mo., for appellant.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n This action was originally brought in the circuit court, city of St. Louis, Mo., and was removed to the District Court of the United States upon the ground of diversity of citizenship. The action was upon a policy of automobile insurance issued by the defendant, and recovery depended upon judgment having been obtained and execution thereon having been returned unsatisfied in an action against the assured. It was shown that action had been brought in the state court against the assured, the Southwest Motor Sales Company, a Missouri corporation, and also against one Harry Shields, its executive officer. Process had been served upon Shields personally, and jurisdiction of the Southwest Motor Sales Company had been sought by constructive service under the Missouri law. Judgment by default had been entered against both defendants, and execution had been returned unsatisfied.\n In the present action the Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming judgment for the defendant, held that the insurance policy which the defendant had issued did not cover Shields and that the service in the action against the Southwest Motor Sales Company was invalid under the decisions of the state court.

The government first filed a general traverse. But later, asserting lack of authority on the part of the Commissioner to make the determination and refund, it filed a counterclaim for the amount of a check sent plaintiff to pay the balance of the refund remaining after deducting a part to pay an additional tax assessed against it for the year ended January 31, 1917. That tax was then, as it is now conceded, barred by a statute of limitation. Bowers v. N. Y. & Albany Co., \n273 \nU.S. 346\n, 47 S. Ct. 389. On special findings the court entered judgment dismissing plaintiff's complaint and the government's counterclaim, but gave the latter judgment for the cost of printing the record. 69 Ct. Cl. 638; (Ct. Cl.) 39 F. (2d) 730. On plaintiff's petition we granted a writ of certiorari. \n282 \nU.S. 823\n, 51 S. Ct. 34, 75 L. Ed. -.\n The court found: \n\n[283 U.S. 258, 260]\n\u00a0\n Plaintiff is a corporation engaged in the business of selling merchandise at retail. Its fiscal year begins February 1. July 14, 1919, it filed its return for the year ended January 31, 1919, reporting an income tax of $57,871.16 which was paid, one-half July 14 and the balance December 13 following. Pending audit of the return, the Commissioner fixed plaintiff's total tax liability for that year at $225,165.75 and in April, 1924, made a jeopardy assessment for $167,294.59, the excess over the amount returned and paid. The plaintiff promptly filed a claim for abatement of the full amount of the additional assessment.\n November 19, 1924, the Bureau sent plaintiff a letter containing a schedule disclosing the computation of its tax for the year ended January 31, 1919, and showing a total overassessment of $178,161.02. From this amount there was deducted $10,866.43 found by the Commissioner to have been erroneously included in plaintiff's return and paid. The letter stated: 'Inasmuch as the provisions of section 281 of the Revenue Act of 19241 have not been complied with (in) regard to the full amount of the above \n\n[283 U.S. 258, 261]\n\u00a0\n overassessment, a portion in the amount of $10,866.43 cannot be allowed.' In accordance with that letter, the Commissioner allowed plaintiff's claim for abatement.\n May 16, 1925, the Bureau wrote plaintiff that an examination of its income tax return for the year ended January 31, 1919, disclosed an apparent overassessment, and that it could not then be allowed 'unless an income and profits tax waiver is filed on or before June 15, 1925, as provided by an Act of Congress dated March 3, 1925, amending section 281(e) of the Revenue Act of 1924.2 Two waiver forms are therefore enclosed in order that you may, if you desire, execute and forward one of the formsto t his office.' Plaintiff executed the waiver and May 22, 1925, returned it with a letter stating: 'In accordance with your request, we enclose you herewith waiver.' On the following day the waiver was received and accepted in writing by the Commissioner.\n December 11, 1926, counsel for plaintiff sent the Bureau a letter which quoted the substance, as above given, of the letters of November 19, 1924, and May 16, 1925, and, in reference to the letter of May 22, 1925, said: 'Since that time we have heard nothing further from you and there has been no refund made to the taxpayer.' February 5, 1927, the head of the audit division approved and recommended for allowance the certificate of overassessment No. 990,988. The record of the case was checked to determine whether the plaintiff had filed a claim for refund prior to the expiration of the applicable period of limitation. And it was determined that the documents filed which included the audit letter of November 19, 1924, showing how the amount of the overpayment was ascertained, the \n\n[283 U.S. 258, 262]\n\u00a0\n letter of May 16, 1925, furnishing form of waiver, and the plaintiff's answer of May 22 following, inclosing the executed waiver, would be treated by the Bureau as an informal claim for refund filed May 23, 1925\n\n\n Plaintiff's letter of May 22, 1925, bears an undated indorsement: 'Inferential demand for the refund upon basis of the schedule sent taxpayer under date of November 19, 1924 ... Rules and Regulations. Mulligan,' and another dated April 4, 1927: 'Approved by Mr. Mulligan and Mr. Sherwood for scheduling as is. O. Allen.'\n February 9, 1927, the Bureau wrote plaintiff's counsel: '... In order that the allowance of the overassessment may be made, you are requested to file with this office a claim on the enclosed Form 843 setting forth the basis of the adjustment. ...' Accordingly plaintiff executed the form and thereon stated that the application should be allowed for the reasons shown in the audit letter of November 19, 1924, a copy of which was attached. And February 17, 1927, plaintiff returned the form with a letter saying: '... We enclose herewith for filing, claim for refund in the sum of $10,866.43 ... on Form 843.' The Claim was received and filed in the Bureau February 19; the Commissioner allowed the claim and on March 8 approved and scheduled to the collector the certificate of overassessment.\n On the margin of the Bureau's record copy appear the following certifications: 'Waiver filed May 23, 1925. Informal claim for refund filed May 23, 1925, with waiver perfected by claim Form 843. (Signed) O. Allen, 3\/4\/27.' 'Claim for refund filed May 23, 1925, waiver filed May 23, 1925.' 'This C. of O. (certificate of overassessment) approved for scheduling as is by W. T. S. (Signed) O. Allen, 4\/4\/27.'\n The collector credited $9,846.06 against the additional tax assessed for the year ending January 31, 1917. May 12, 1927, the Commissioner caused the certificate, show- \n\n[283 U.S. 258, 263]\n\u00a0\n ing the deduction made by the collector, to be delivered to plaintiff with a check for the balance of the overassessment and interest, $1,462.99. Plaintiff objected to the application of any part of the refund against such additional assessment on the ground that the 1917 tax was barred and declined to accept the check in full settlement, but offered to apply it in partial payment of the claim.\n The government, in support of the judgment below, insists that no claim for refund was filed by plaintiff prior to April 1, 1926, the time permitted by the Act of March 3, 1925, 43 Stat. 1115, and that therefore the Commissioner was without authority o al low the claim.\n The provision involved amends section 281(e) of the Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 302. It provides that, if the taxpayer has on or before June 15, 1925, filed a waiver of his right to have the tax due for the taxable year 1919 determined and assessed within five years after the return was filed, then refund relating to such tax shall be made if claim therefor is filed on or before April 1, 1926. The section is a part of a tax law giving to taxpayers opportunity to secure refund of overpayments that had become barred. Manifestly it is to be construed liberally in favor of the taxpayers to give the relief it was intended to provide. United States v. Merriam, \n263 \nU.S. 179, 187\n, 44 S. Ct. 69, 29 A. L. R. 1547; Bowers v. N. Y. & Albany Co., supra, \n273 \nU.S. 350\n, 47 S. Ct. 389; United States v. Updike, \n281 \nU.S. 489, 496\n, 50 S. Ct. 367; United States v. Michel, \n282 \nU.S. 656\n, 51 S. Ct. 284.\n Plaintiff filed its waiver within time, and, in consideration of that, it admittedly secured the right to claim the refund. But it did not within the specified time formally make a claim for it. The government's point comes down to the question whether the waiver and the letter transmitting it together with what went before amounted to the filing of a claim within the meaning of the statute.\n The Commissioner prior to that amendment had finally determined that in 1919 plaintiff had overpaid its tax by \n\n[283 U.S. 258, 264]\n\u00a0\n $10,866.43. That finding was made upon a consideration of the plaintiff's tax return, its claim for abatement of the jeopardy assessment, and presumably all material details of its business in the taxable year. The schedule contained in the audit letter of November 19, 1924, showed the manner in which the Bureau had computed the tax. And the refund of the ascertained overpayment was withheld by the Commissioner solely because of plaintiff's lack of compliance with section 281 as it then stood.\n The letter of May 16, 1925, sent soon after section 281 was amended unmistakably referred to the overpayment that the Commissioner had found and reported. That an allowance of credit or refund was immediately intended is shown by the statement that it could not then be allowed unless waiver was filed as provided by the 1925 amendment. Plaintiff's prompt execution and return of the waiver and the Bureau's acceptance of it clearly show that both considered the facts already found and reported a sufficient basis for plaintiff's claim. That such was the view of the Commissioner is fully confirmed by the notations made on the letter transmitting the waiver and upon the office record of the certificate.\n The question here is to be distinguished from that which would have arisen if, contrary to the taxpayer's insistence, the Commissioner had held that what was done did not constitute a filing of a claim. No statute provides for review of the Commissioner's determinations in favor of taxpayers when made within the scope of his authority. Such rulings are entitled to much weight. In this case he had already found that in 1919 plaintiff had overpaid its tax in the amount stated. He needed no additional information to enable him to determine whether credit or refund should then be made. There is no suggestion that the allowance was induced by or resulted from fraud or mistake. The facts found disclose that there was a reasonable or substantial compliance with the amendment. \n\n[283 U.S. 258, 265]\n\u00a0\n The Commissioner within the time allowed was advised of the grounds on which plaintiff's right to refund rested, and was not misled or deceived by plaintiff's failure to file formal claim and was fully warranted in holding that the waiver and earlier documents were sufficient. Tucker v. Alexander, \n275 \nU.S. 228, 231\n, 48 S. Ct. 45.\n The government further contends that, even if the Commissioner's allowance was authorized, this suit is barred by Rev. St.  3226, as amended. 26 U. S. C.,  156 (26 USCA  156).3 It provides that no suit for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously collected shall be begun after five years from the payment of such tax. The overpayment made was more than five years before the complaint was filed. This case is not within the clause giving two years after disallowance because here the claim was allowed. Plaintiff pleads its claim in two forms. The first is based upon the issue and delivery of the Commissioner's certificate showing plaintiff entitled to a refund in the amount specified. The second alleges an account stated showing that there is due plaintiff the amount claimed. The action is not for the overpayment of the tax in 1919, but is grounded upon the determination evidenced by the certificate issued by the Commissioner May 12, 1927. Upon delivery of the certificate to plaintiff, there arose the cause of action on which this suit was brought. United States v. Kaufman, \n96 U.S. 567\n, 570; United States v. Real Estate Savings Bank, \n104 U.S. 728\n; Bank of Greencastle's Case, 15 Ct. Cl. 225. There is no merit in the contention that the suit is barred.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 281, 43 Stat. 301 (26 USCA  1065 note):\n'(b) Except as provided in subdivision ...

C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought in the superior court of New Hampshire by the respondent, a citizen of that state, to recover damages for injuries resulting in the death of the respondent's interstate, upon the ground of the negligence of his employer, the defendant (appellant and petitioner here). The case was removed to the District Court of the United States for the District of New Hampshire. The defendant is a corporation organized under the laws of Vermont, and is engaged in supplying electric current in both Vermont and New Hampshire. It appeared that the respondent's interstate was a resident of Vermont and received his injuries in New Hampshire in the course of his employment. The contract of employment was made in Vermont, and the defendant contended that the parties were bound by the Workmen's Compensation Act of Vermont (Pub. Laws 1915, No. 164) and that the acceptance of the provisions of that act was a bar to the common- law action. Upon appeal from the judgment in favor of the respondent, the Circuit Court of Appeals first sustained the defense and directed reversal, but on rehearing affirmed the judgment. The court said that its attention had been called to the fact that the defendant had accepted the Workmen's Compensation Act of New Hampshire (Pub. Laws 1926, c. 178) which reserved to the employee or his legal representative an action at law for death caused by negligence; 'that no contract made in Vermont purporting to release an employer from liability for future negligence can bar an action brought in New Hampshire for an injury there sustained, and thus change the public policy of New Hampshire.' 51 F.(2d) 992, 999, 1000. As the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals was not against the validity of the statute of Vermont, the ap- \n\n[284 U.S. 221, 223]\n\u00a0\n peal to this Court must be dismissed for the want of jurisdiction.

(a) In any case, civil or criminal, in a circuit court of appeals, or in the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, it shall be competent for the Supreme Court of the United States, upon the petition of any party thereto, whether Government or other litigant, to require by certiorari, either before or after a judgment or decree by such lower court, that the cause be certified to the Supreme Court for determination by it with the same power and authority, and with like effect, as if the cause had been brought there by unrestricted writ of error or appeal.\n\n'(b) Any case in a circuit court of appeals where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of any State, on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is against its validity, may, at the election of the party relying on such State statute, be taken to the Supreme Court for review on writ of error or appeal; but in that event a review on certiorari shall not be allowed at the instance of such party, and the review on such writ of error or appeal shall be restricted to an examination and decision of the Federal questions presented in the case.\n\n'(c) No judgment or decree of a circuit court of appeals or of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court otherwise than as provided in this section.'\n\n The question is whether the general authority of this Court, under paragraph (a) of this section, 'in any case \n\n[284 U.S. 221, 224]\n\u00a0\n ... in a circuit court of appeals ... to require by certiorari' that the cause be certified to this Court for determination, is limited in a case like the instant one by the concluding clause of paragraph (b). Under the latter paragraph an appeal1 may be taken to this Court 'at the election' of the party relying on the state statute the validity of which has been denied by the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and 'in that event' a review on certiorari is not to allowed at the instance of such party. This provision is in obvious contrast with that of section 237(c) of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925,  1 (U. S. C. tit. 28,  344(c), 28 USCA  344(c), relating to appeals from judgments of state courts and providing in such cases that papers on an appeal improvidently sought may be treated as a petition for certiorari. But the event to which the limitation of section 240(b) applies, in the case of appeals from the Circuit Court of Appeals, is that an appeal will lie as provided and has been taken. If the case is one in which the Circuit Court of Appeals has not denied validity to a statute of a state upon the ground specified, no appeal will lie, and the bringing of the appeal in such a case has no effect save to invite its dismissal. As this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, it leaves the parties as they were. There is no ground for concluding that it was the intent of the Congress to penalize a party by depriving him of a right granted because he had made a mistake in asserting a right not granted. Accordingly, we conclude that, in a case in a Circuit Court of Appeals where no appeal lies, although one has been improvidently taken, application may be made for a writ of certiorari under section 240(a). The application must be made within \n\n[284 U.S. 221, 225]\n\u00a0\n the time limited. Act of February 13, 1925,  8 (U. S. C. tit. 28,  350 ( 28 USCA  350)). It was so made in this case.\n The petition for writ of certiorari is granted.\n Appeal dismissed. Writ granted. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Writ of error was abolished by the Act of January 31, 1928, c. 14, 45 Stat. 54, as amended by Act of April 26, 1928, c. 440, 45 Stat. (U. S.

O'Sullivan, of Kansas City, Mo., for Buck and others.\n Mr. Charles M. Blackmar, of Kansas City, Mo., for Jewell-La Salle Realty Co.\n\n\n[283 U.S. 191, 195]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These suits were brought in the federal court for Western Missouri by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, and one of its members, against the Jewell-La Salle Realty Company, which operates the La SalleHote l at Kansas City. The hotel maintains a master radio receiving set which is wired to each of the public and private rooms. As part of the service offered to its guests, loud-speakers or headphones are provided so that a program received on the master set can, if desired, be simultaneously heard throughout the building. Among the programs received are those transmitted by Wilson Duncan, who operates a duly licensed commercial broadcasting station in the same city. Duncan selects his own programs and broadcasts them for profit. There is no arrangement of any kind between him and the hotel. Both were notified by the plaintiff society of the existence of its copyrights, and were advised that, unless a license were obtained, performance of any copyrighted musical composition owned by its members was forbidden. Thereafter a copyrighted popular song, owned by the plaintiffs, was repeatedly broadcast by Duncan, and was received by the hotel company and made available to its guests. Suits were brought for an injunction and damages for the alleged infringements. \n1\n After a hearing on stipulated facts, relief against the hotel company was denied on the ground that its acts did not constitute a 'performance' within the Copyright Act. Buck v. Duncan (D. C.) 32 F.(2d) 366. Plaintiffs appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which certified the following question:\n'Do the acts of a hotel proprietor, in making available to his guests, through the instrumentality of a radio re- \n\n[283 U.S. 191, 196]\n\u00a0\n ceiving set and loud speakers installed in his hotel and under his control and for the entertainment of his guests, the hearing of a copyrighted musical composition which has been broadcast from a radio transmitting station, constitute a performance of such composition within the meaning of 17 USC Sec. 1(e)?'\n\n The provision referred to is section 1 of the Copyright Act of March 4, 1909, c. 320, 35 Stat. 1075 (17 USCA  1(e), which provides that 'Any person entitled thereto, upon complying with the provisions of this title, shall have the exclusive right: ... (e) To perform the copyrighted work publicly for profit if it be a musical composition and for the purpose of public performance for profit.'\n The parties agree that the owner of a private radio receiving set who in his own home invites friends to hear a musical composition which is being broadcast would not be liable for infringement. For, even if this be deemed a performance, it is neither public nor for profit. Compare Herbert v. Shanley Co., \n242 \nU.S. 591\n, 37 S. Ct. 232. The contention that what the hotel company does is not a performance within the meaning of the Copyright Act is urged on three grounds.\n First. The defendant contends that the Copyright Act may not reasonably be construed as applicable to one who merely receives a composition which is being broadcast. Although the art of radio broadcasting was unknown at the time the Copyright Act of 1909 was passed, and the means of transmission and reception now employed is wholly unlike any then in use,2 it is not denied that such \n\n[283 U.S. 191, 197]\n\u00a0\n broadcasting may be within the scope of the act. \n3\n Compare Kalem Co. v. Harper Bros., \n222 \nU.S. 55\n, 32 S. Ct. 20, Ann. Cas. 1913A, 1285; Gambart v. Ball, 14 C. B. (N. S.) 306, 319. The argument here urged, however, is that, since the transmitting of a musical composition by a commercial broadcasting station is a public performance for profit, control of the initial radio rendition exhausts the monopolies conferred, both that of making copies (including records) and that of giving public performances for profit (including mechanical performances from a record); and that a monopoly of the reception, for commercial purposes, of this same rendition, is not warranted by the act. The anaogy is invoked of the rule under which an author who permits copies of his writings to be made cannot, by virtue of his copyright, prevent or restrict the transfer of such copies. Compare Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, \n210 \nU.S. 339\n, 28 S. Ct. 722. This analogy is inapplicable. It is true that control of the sale of copies is not permitted by the act,4 but a monopoly is expressly granted of all public performances for profit.\n The defendant next urges that it did not perform because there can be but one actual performance each time \n\n[283 U.S. 191, 198]\n\u00a0\n a copyrighted selection is rendered, and that, if the broadcaster is held to be a performer, one who, without connivance, receives and distributes the transmitted selection, cannot also be held to have performed it. But nothing in the act circumscribes the meaning to be attributed to the term 'performance,' or prevents a single rendition of a copyrighted selection from resulting in more than one public performance for profit. While this may not have been possible before the development of radio broadcasting, the novelty of the means used does not lessen the duty of the courts to give full protection to the monopoly of public performance for profit which Congress has secured to the composer. Compare Kalem Co. v. Harper Bros., \n222 \nU.S. 55, 63\n, 32 S. Ct. 20, Ann. Cas. 1913A, 1285. No reason is suggested why there may not be more than one liability. And, since the public reception for profit in itself constitutes an infringement, we have no occasion to determine under what circumstances a broadcaster will be held to be a performer, or the effect upon others of his paying a license fee.\n The defendant contends further that the acts of the hotel company were not a performance because no detailed choice of selections was given to it. In support of this contention it is pointed out that the operator of a radio receiving set cannot render at will a performance of any composition, but must accept whatever program is transmitted during the broadcasting period. Intention to infringe is not essential under the act. Compare Hein v. Harris (C. C.) 175 F. 875, affirmed (C. C. A.) 183 F. 107; Stern v. Jerome H. Remick & Co. (C. C.) 175 F. 282; Haas v. Leo Feist, Inc . (D. C.) 234 F. 105; M. Witmark & Sons v. Calloway (D. C.) 22 F.(2d) 412, 414. And knowledge of the particular selection to be played or received is immaterial. One who hires an orchestra for a public performance for profit is not relieved from a charge of infringement merely because he does not select the particular program to be played. Similarly, when he tunes in on a broadcasting station, for his own commercial purposes, he necessarily assumes the \n\n[283 U.S. 191, 199]\n\u00a0\n risk that in so doing he may infringe the performing rights of another. Compare Harms v. Cohen (D. C.) 279 F. 276, 278; M. Witmark & Sons v. Pastime Amusement Co. (D. C.) 298 F. 470, 475, affirmed (C. C. A.) 2 F.(2d) 1020; M. Witmark & Sons v. Calloway (D. C.) 22 F.(2d) 412, 413. It may be that proper control over broadcasting programs would automatically secure to the copyright owner sufficient protection from unauthorized public performances by use of a radio receiving set,5 and that this might justify legislation denying relief against those who in using the receiving set innocently invade the copyright,6 but the existing statute makes no such exception.\n Second. The defendant contends that there was no performance because the reception of a radio broadcast is no different from listening to a distant rendition of the same program. \n7\n We are satisfied that the reception of a \n\n[283 U.S. 191, 200]\n\u00a0\n radio broadcast and its translation into audible sound is not a mere audition of the original program. It is essentially a reproduction. As to the general theory of radio transmission, there is no disagreement. All sounds consist of waves of relatively low frequencies which ordinarily pass through the air and are locally audible. Thus music played at a distant broadcasting studio is not directly heard at the receiving set. In the microphone of the radio transmitter the sound waves are used to modulate electrical currents of relatively high frequencies which are broadcast through an entirely different medium, conventionally known as the 'either.' These radio waves are not audible. \n8\n In the receiving set they are rectified; that is, converted into direct currents which actuate the loud-speaker to produce again in the air sound waves of audible frequencies. The modulation of the radio waves in the transmitting apparatus, by the audible sound waves, is comparable to the manner in which the wax phonograph record is impressed by these same waves through the medium of a recording stylus. \n9\n The transmitted radio waves require a receiving set for their detection and trans- \n\n[283 U.S. 191, 201]\n\u00a0\n lation into audible sound waves, just as the record requires another mechanism for the reproduction of the recorded composition. In neither case is the original program heard; and, in the former, complicated electrical instrumentalities are necessary for its adequate reception and distribution. Reproduction in both cases amounts to a performance. Compare Buck v. Heretis (D. C.) 24 F.(2d) 876; Irving Berlin, Inc., v. Daigle (C. C. A.) 31 F.(2d) 832, 833. In addition, the ordinary receiving set, and the distributing apparatus here employed by the hotel company are equipped to amplify the broadcast program after it has been received. Such acts clearly are more than the use of mere mechanical acoustic devices for the better hearing of the original program. The guests of the hotel hear a reproduction brought about b the acts of the hotel in (1) installing, (2) supplying electric current to, and (3) operating the radio receiving set and loud-speakers. There is no difference in substance between the case where a hotel engages an orchestra to furnish the music and that where, by means of the radio set and loud-speakers here employed, it furnishes the same music for the same purpose. In each the music is produced by instrumentalities under its control. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n[283 U.S. 191, 202]\n\u00a0\n Third. The defendant contends that there was no performance within the meaning of the act because it is not shown that the hotel operated the receiving set and loud-speakers for profit. Unless such acts were carried on for profit, there can, of course, be no liability. But whether there was a performance does not depend upon the existence of the profit motive. The question submitted does not call for a determination whether the acts of the hotel company recited in the certificate constitute operation for profit.\n The question certified, is answered yes. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In No. 138, Duncan was joined as a defendant and a decree pro confesso for failure to answer was entered against him.

See H. Rep. No. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., February 22, 1909, p. 19. It is applicable only where there is no relation between the manufacturer of the copy and the purchaser which might make the latter liable as a contributory infringer. Compare Scribner v. Straus, \n210 \nU.S. 352, 355\n, 28 S. Ct. 735. In the case at bar, the stipulated facts show that there was no relation whatever between the broadcaster and the hotel company, so that, even if the broadcasting constituted an infringement, there would be no question of contributory infringement. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] If the copyrighted composition had been broadcast by Duncan with plaintiffs' consent, a license for its commercial reception and distribution by the hotel company might possibly have been implied. Compare Buck v. Debaum (D. C.) 40 F.(2d) 734. But Duncan was not licensed; and the position of the hotel company is not unlike that of one who publicly performs for profit by the use of an unlicensed phonograph record. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] See the so-called Vestal Copyright Bill, which failed of passage in the Seventy-First Congress. H. R. 12549, 71st Cong. 2d Sess.  15(d). Compare note 10, infra. See, also, arguments concerning the broadcasting of copyrighted selections as set forth in Joint Hearings before the Committees on Patents, on S. 2328 and H. R. 10353, 69th Cong. 1st Sess. April 5-9, 1926; Hearings before the Senate Committee on Patents, on H. R. 12549, 71st Cong. 3d Sess. January 28, 29, 1931, pp. 52, et seq.; Sen. Rep. No. 1732, Id. February 17, 1931, p. 29. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] This argument is based upon an elaborate discussion of the theory of radio transmission and reception. Defendant's hypothesis is that the energy which actuates the receiving apparatus-that is, which varies the currents in the receiver to produce audible sound-is part of the original energy exerted upon the air by the performer. Hence it is urged that the radio receiving set is no more than a mechanical or electrical ear trumpet for the better audition of a distant performance. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Sound waves, which can pass through air, water, or solids, and radio or other electromagnetic waves, which operate in the 'either,' behave similarly in many respects. Yet not only are the latter inaudible, but they travel at relatively tremendous speeds. Sound waves travel at ordinary temperatures approximately 1,100 feet a second; electromagnetic waves with the speed of light, or about 186,000 miles per second. This velocity is dependent solely upon the particular medium through which the various kinds of waves travel. See Morecroft, Principles of Radio Communication, c. IV. Thus broadcast time signals can be heard practically simultaneously on receiving sets hundreds of miles apart; ordinary sound signals cannot. Compare as to the general theory of radio communication, Radio Corp. of America v. Twentieth Century Radio Corp. (C. C. A.) 19 F.( 2d) 290, 291; Chappell & Co., Ltd., v. Associated Radio Co. (1925) Victorian Law Reports, 350, 357, 358. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] The impressions on the phonograph disc are of course permanent whereas the modulations of the carrier radio waves, continually emitted by the sending station, are ephermeral. But in both cases the means used to transmit the selection being played are wholly different from the musical sounds themselves, and require an additional mechanism, not under the control of the performer, for the recreation of the original music. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] At the present time there are renewed proposals for the revision of the Copyright Act in the light of new conditions.

Price, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Revenue Act of June 2, 1924, c. 234,  278(c), 43 Stat. 253, 300 ( 26 USCA  1060 note), provides concerning incomes and profits taxes under the Revenue Act of 1918: 'Where both the Commissioner and the taxpayer have consented in writing to the assessment of the tax after the time prescribed in section 277 for its assessment the tax may be assessed \n\n[282 U.S. 295, 297]\n\u00a0\n at any time prior to the expiration of the perior agreed upon.' Section 277(a)(2), 43 Stat. 299, (26 USCA  1057 note), provides that the tax 'shall be assessed within five years after the return was filed, and no proceeding in court for the collection of such taxes shall be begun after the expiration of such period.' Section 277(b), 26 USCA  1057 note, provides that if due notice of the determination of a deficiency had been mailed to the taxpayer, and an appeal is taken to the Board of Tax Appeals, the time for making the assessment shall be extended 'by the number of days between the date of the mailing of such notice and the date of the final decision by the Board.' Section 278(d) (26 USCA  1061 note) provides that when assessed within the period prescribed by secion 277 or section 278, 'such tax may be collected by distraint or by a proceeding in court, begun within six years after the assessment of the tax.' This case presents, among others, the question whether a waiver given while the case was pending before the Board of Tax Appeals but after the expiration of five years from the filing of the return tolls the statute of limitations.\n On June 16, 1919, the Chicago Railway Equipment Company filed its income and profits tax return for 1918. On March 14, 1925, the Commissioner determined a deficiency and gave due notice thereof. On May 6, 1925, the taxpayer filed its appeal with the Board of Tax Appeals. On December 10, 1925, the taxpayer and the Commissioner executed an agreement which provided that 'the time for making any assessment ... shall remain in effect until December 31, 1926, and shall then expire except that if a notice of a deficiency in tax is sent to said taxpayer by registered mail before said date and ... if an appeal is filed with said Board (of Tax Appeals) then said date shall be extended by the number of days between the date of mailing of said notice of deficiency and the date of final decision by said board.' On July 28, 1926, the Board confirmed, in the main, the Com- \n\n[282 U.S. 295, 298]\n\u00a0\n missioner's determination, 4 B. T. A. 452; but the Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the case to it for further proceedings, 20 F.(2d) 10. Then, for the first time the defense was made that the deficiency had been barred by the statute of limitations. The Board overruled the objection, 13 B. T. A. 471; but its decision was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 39 F. (2d) 378. This Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n282 \nU.S. 821\n, 51 S. Ct. 30, 75 L. Ed. -.\n First. The taxpayer contends that the agreement of December 10, 1925, was inoperative because the Commissioner lacked the power to sign a waiver after an appeal from his determination to the Board of Tax Appeals. The argument is that once such an appeal has been filed, the Commissioner's powers of investigation and determination have been exhausted; that thereafter his duty in making an assessment pursuant to the Board's order is purely ministerial; that the waiver is in effect an agreement not to plead the statute of limitations; and that the Commissioner is not authorized to receive such a waiver. As we said in Stange v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 270\n, 51 S. Ct. 145, decided this day, the Commissioner's signature was required purely for administrative purposes. See Florsheim Bros. Co. v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 453, 466\n, 50 S. Ct. 215. There was nothing in this requirement which limits the period during which a waiver may be effectively given. Compare Aiken v. Burnet, \n282 \nU.S. 277\n, 51 S. Ct. 148, decided this day. Moreover, at the time this waiver was executed, the Commissioner was contemplating the making of a jeopardy assessment which the taxpayer desired to avoid. The Commissioner was clearly authorized, under his general administrative powers, to accept instead the waiver as a substitute means of insuring ultimate collection. See Aiken v. Commissioner, supra.\n Second. The taxpayer contends that the waiver was inoperative because the Commissioner lacked the power to sign a waiver after the expiration of the five-year \n\n[282 U.S. 295, 299]\n\u00a0\n period. \n1\n What was said on this subject in reference to a waiver under the 1921 act in Stange v. United States, supra, is applicable also to the corresponding provision of the 1924 act. A difference in phraseology is called to our attention; but it is without significance. The further argument is made that in view of other sections in the 1924 act,2 an interpretation of section 278(c) which permitted the giving of a waiver after the expiration of the five years, would lead to absurdities and inequalities which Congress could not have intended. Reference is made, first to section 278(e),3 which, it is urged, renders inoperative any waiver signed after the enactment of the statute where the assessment in question was already bared prior thereto. 4 The inequality charged is that the limitation period for the assessment of 1918 taxes due under a return filed before June 2, 1919, could not, under the suggested interpretation, be waived after June 2, 1924, but that the corresponding limitation for the same tax due under a return filed after June 2, 1919 could be so waived. We \n\n[282 U.S. 295, 300]\n\u00a0\n need not determine whether respondent is correct in assuming that section 278(e) qualifies section 278(c) in respect to waivers on assessment of taxes barred prior to June 2, 1924;5 for even if that section has this effect, no objectionable inequality would result in permitting a revival of liability in one case and not in the other. Some arbitrary date must be taken for the imposition of a period of limitation. It may be taken likewise in regard to its removal.\n Attention is also called to section 281(e) of the 1924 act,6 which extended the time for making claims for refund where a waiver of assessment had been filed prior to certain specified dates,7 and it is said that section 278(c), as inter- \n\n[282 U.S. 295, 301]\n\u00a0\n preted, would, when read with section 281(e), result in a discrimination against those taxpayers who had signed a waiver after the statute had run. The argument is that such taxpayers would still be liable for the tax, but that no corresponding extension of the limitation on claims for refund would be given. The dates specified in section 281(e), however, do not coincide with the periods of limitation onass essment and collection. The purpose of that section was merely to extend the time for filing claims for refund in particular cases of taxes for the years 1917-1919. There is no necessary relation between it and section 278(c). Moreover, a taxpayer who has signed a waiver and has had the validity of the alleged deficiency determined in the courts, on appeal from the Board's determination, has no good ground for complaint that he cannot thereafter raise the same question on a claim for refund. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[282 U.S. 295, 302]\n\u00a0\n Third. The taxpayer contends that, by its terms, the waiver expired December 31, 1926. The argument is that since the appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals had already been taken, the latter part of the instrument, relating to an extension of the time for assessment equal to the number of days the case would be before the Board, is inapplicable. The immediate object for which the waiver was given was to enable the case to be determined, without respondent being obliged to pay or to furnish bond; and it must have been assumed that thereafter the Commissioner would duly assess and collect the amount of the deficiency. The record reveals that three days before the execution of the waiver, the Solicitor of Internal Revenue wrote respondent that 'as it is impossible at this time to determine whether the case will be disposed of by the board prior to the expiration of the period ... you are requested to execute ... the enclosed waiver ...'; and hesta ted further that if the waiver were not given, the Commissioner would make a jeopardy assessment and require a bond as a condition of deferring collection. Consequently, the provisions of the latter part of the waiver were clearly intended to be applicable; and while its language perhaps was not as apt as it might have been,9 there is no basis for denying its obvious purpose. \n\n[282 U.S. 295, 303]\n\u00a0\n Fourth. The taxpayer contends that the waiver was inoperative because secured by duress. The argument is that while the Commissioner in December, 1925, might have made a jeopardy assessment and have enforced collection, such action would have been illegal because the statutory period had then expired, and that a waiver procured by such a threat is ineffective. Whether or not the Commissioner would have been liable to the taxpayer for a collection made as the result of a jeopardy assessment in 1925, we need not determine. He clearly had the power to make such assessment and thereby compel the filing of a claim for abatement and the giving of a bond,10 or, if such claim and accompanying bond were not filed, to make collection and relegate respondent to an action at law. In the absence of a determination that this deficiency was barred,11 it was the Commissioner's duty to proceed to insure the assessment and collection of the tax. At his suggestion, the taxpayer executed the waiver. Thereby it was enabled to have all questions concerning the alleged deficiency considered by the Board. A waiver given under such circumstances is not invalid. This contention, which seems to have been raised for the first time in this Court, is also unsound.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Joy Floral Co. v. Commissioner, 29 F.(2d) 865, 58 App. D. C. 277; Columbian Iron Works v. Brock (D. C.) 38 F.(2d) 816. In these cases the taxpayers' contention was sustained and the waivers held inoperative. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Respondent also cites section 278(e) of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 59 (26 USCA  1062), which substantially re-enacted section 278(e) of the 1924 act (26 USCA  1062 note), and urges that particular discriminations would result from the combined effect, under certain suggested interpretations, of these two sections. But the effect of a later statute cannot authorize an unintended and undesirable construction of an earlier act. Compare Russell v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 181, 188\n, 49 S. Ct. 121. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] '(e) This section shall not (1) authorize the assessment of a tax ... if at the time of the enactment of this Act such assessment ... was barred by the period of limitation then in existence ...' 43 Stat. 300 (26 USCA  1062 note). \n[\nFootnote 4\n] In the case at bar, the assessment would not have been barred until June 16, 1924, five years from the date of the return, and after the enactment of the 1924 act, so that section 278(e) is wholly inapplicable. Respondent offers the case of a tax under an earlier return merely for the purposes of its argument. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Subdivision (e) cannot be said to qualify every other subdivision in section 278. Nothing indicates an intention to have it limit the effect of section 278(a), 26 USCA  1058, which permits assessment to be made or suit to be brought at any time in the case of a false or fraudulent return or a failure to file any return. Compare United States v. Updike, \n281 \nU.S. 489, 495\n, 50 S. Ct. 367; United States v. Lazenby (D. C.) 5 F.(2d) 827. Nor is there any indication that it should qualify subsection ( c) which provides for the giving of waivers. But see Jacobs Brothers Co. v. Commissioner, 19 B. T. A. 315, which involved section 278(c) and related sections of the 1926 act, supra, note 2. Compare Steiner Mfg. Co. v. Commissioner, 18 B. T. A. 740; James & Holmstrom Piano Co. v.

United States, \n278 \nU.S. 181\n, 49 S. Ct. 121, involved the interpretation of subdivision (d) which extended the period for collection without any act on the part of the taxpayer. Subdivision (c) is effective only if the taxpayer voluntarily executed a waiver. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] 43 Stat. 302, as amended by the Act of March 3, 1925, c. 435, 43 Stat. 1115 (26 USCA 1065 note). \n[\nFootnote 7\n] E. g., for 1917 taxes, within five years after the return was filed; for 1918 taxes, before June 15, 1924; for 1919 taxes, before June 15, 1925.

Cl.) 44 F.(2d) 253. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The 1926 Act expressly provided that where an appeal had been taken from a deficiency determination, no credit or refund could thereafter be allowed except in conformance with the decision of the Board. Section 284( d), c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 67 (26 USCA  1065). And refund or credit was allowable only if the petition had been filed with the Board within four years after the tax was paid, or a timely claim for refund had been made. Section 284(e), 44 Stat. 67. This section was amended by section 507 of the 1928 act, c. 852, 45 Stat. 871, title 26 U. S. Code,  1065(e), 26 USCA  1065(e), to make the filing of a claim for refund or credit unnecessary where an appeal was taken. On the general problem of refunds, compare H. Rep. No. 1, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., December 7, 1925, pp. 13-14; Hearings Before the Committee on Ways and Means on Revenue Revision of 1925, Id., pp. 285-292, 504, 934, et seq., 981-983; Hearings Before the Senate Committee on Finance, on H. R. 1, Id., January 4, 1926, pp. 192-194, 208, 209. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The waiver was executed on the standard mimeographed form generally used prior to the mailing of a deficiency letter. Had it read, '... if a notice of deficiency was sent ...' before December 31, 1926, there could be no doubt of its applicability to the appeal then pending. Its meaning, in view of the circumstances under which it was given, is nevertheless clear. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234,  274(d) and section 279(a), 43 Stat. 253, 297, 300 (26 USCA  1051 note and  1063 note). \n[\nFootnote 11\n] Other waivers were alleged to be in existence, and while they were not produced at the trial before the Board, it is evident that in December, 1925, the Commissioner was of the opinion that the deficiency, already determined, was not barred.

(a) That in computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions: ...\n\n'(5) Losses sustained during the taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, if incurred in any transaction entered into for profit ...'\n\n The respondent, in making his tax return for 1920, claimed a loss incurred in a transaction entered into in the year 1906, by which he acquired certain rights of the character, and in the manner, hereafter stated. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the claim, and his determination was sustained by the Board of Tax Appeals upon the ground that the taxpayer had failed to show the value of the rights as of March 1, 1913. J. I. R. Henry v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 13 B. T. A. 279. Upon a petition for review, the Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the claim and reversed the action of the Board of Tax Appeals. 39 F.(2d) 351.\n The following are the facts: In 1906, owing to excessive loans made to Adolph Segal, the Real Estate Trust Company of Philadelphia closed its doors, and a receiver was appointed. Segal had deposited collateral, which possessed an 'uncertain value,' and could not readily be liquidated. A plan of reorganization was proposed by the receiver, which, among other things, contemplated the creation of a fund of $2,500,000 to be subscribed by direc- \n\n[283 U.S. 223, 225]\n\u00a0\n tors of the company to guarantee a value of $3,000,000 for the Segal collateral-designated in the plan, 'Segal matters.' The subscribers to the fund were to receive and excess over the amount of $3,000,000 which might be realized from the administration of the 'Segal matters.' No limit of time was put upon the administration, or upon the final disposition, of the assets embraced by the 'Segal matters.' The plan became effective, and the company resumed business on November 1, 1906; and thereafter, and until December 30, 1920, the 'Segal matters' were administered under the exclusive direction of the president of the company, who theretofore had been the receiver.\n The respondent, a director of the company, was a subscriber to the fund in the sum of $305,000. At the time of the subscription, respondent believed that the 'Segal matters' had a potential value which could be converted into a sum sufficient to repay the subscribers the amount of their subscriptions with interest, and possibly some profit. The president, then receiver, expressed to the directors the same belief.\n Included in the Segal collateral were certain bonds and shares of stock of the Pennsylvania Sugar Refining Company. At the time the subscriptions to the guarantee fund were made, there was in contemplation the bringing of a suit in behalf of that company against the American Sugar Refining Company under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act; and the value of the 'Segal matters' depended to some extent upon the successful prosecution of this suit. In fact, two suits were brought, one in a federal District Court for $10,000,000 and another in a state court, the latter on the ground that an agent of the American Sugar Refining Company had made an agreement in restraint of trade with Segal. The litigation was compromised in January, 1910, upon the delivery to the Real Estate Trust Company by the American Sugar Refining Company of certain bonds, among which were bonds of the Pennsyl- \n\n[283 U.S. 223, 226]\n\u00a0\n vania Sugar Refining Company. In 1912, the latter were converted in 7,268 shares of stock in a reorganization called Pennsylvania Sugar Company. Some question having arisen in respect of the rights of the subscribers, on May 5, 1916, a supplemental agreement, was made to the effect that, when the 7,268 shares of stock in the Pennsylvania Sugar Company were disposed of, the contributors to the guarantee fund should receive one- fourth of the proceeds. These shares, at that time, and for a period prior thereto, constituted the principal unliquidated assets of the origial ' Segal matters.'\n In 1920, the parties concerned having concluded that the remaining Segal assets would not soon increase in value, the subscribers entered into agreements providing for complete liquidation of the 'Segal matters,' and thereupon, for the distribution of one-fourth of the Pennsylvania Sugar Company stock to the subscribers in proportion respectively to the amounts of their subscriptions, in full satisfaction of all agreements relating thereto. Respondent, accordingly, received 222 shares of Pennsylvania Sugar Company stock, the fair market value of which was $150 per share. Upon that basis, respondent, in 1920, wrote off his books a loss of $271,700, a sum arrived at by deducting $33,300, the value of the stock received, from $305,000, the amount of his original subscription. In his return for 1920 the amount was deducted as a loss.\n We assume, for the purposes of the case, that, within the meaning of section 214(a)(5), the facts establish a transaction entered into for profit by the subscribers to the fund of $2,500,000. In this view each subscriber acquired an interest in the amount which might be realized in excess of $3,000,000 by the administration and disposition of the 'Segal matters.' Such an interest falls within the meaning of the term 'property.' See Townsend v. Ashepoo \n\n[283 U.S. 223, 227]\n\u00a0\n Fertilizer Co. (C. C. A.) 212 F. 97, 101; Samet v. Farmers' & Merchants' Nat. Bank (C. C. A.) 247 F. 669, 671; Presbrey v. Simpson, 53 App. D. C. 358, 290 F. 333, 335. Tested alone by the fact that the cost to respondent in 1906 of his portion of this interest was $305,000, and the fact that by the final settlement of 1920 he received only the sum of $33,300, the result was an actual loss to the extent of the sum claimed. But this is not enough. Section 202(a) of the Revenue Act of 1918, supra provides:\n'That for the purpose of ascertaining the gain derived or loss sustained from the sale or other disposition of property, real, personal, or mixed, the basis shall be-\n\n'(1) In the case of property acquired before March 1, 1913, the fair market price or value of such property as of that date. ...'\n\n Under this provision, it is necessary to consider, not only the cost of the interest acquired by respondent in 1906, but also its fair market price or value as of March 1, 1913; and whichever of these is found to be the lower must be taken as the basis for determining the loss resulting from the final disposition of the property. In other words, the effect of the provision in respect of value on March 1, 1913, is to limit the deductible loss by that value if it be less than the original cost. This is the effect of the prior decisions of this court. United States v. Flannery, \n268 \nU.S. 98, 103\n, 45 S. Ct. 420; and cases cited; Heiner v. Tindle, \n276 \nU.S. 582, 587\n, 48 S. Ct. 326 72 L. Ed. 714, and see Nichols v. Smith, (C. C. A.) 35 F.(2d) 938, 939; Bloch v. Commissioner, 16 B. T. A. 425, affirmed (C. C. A.) 42 F.(2d) 1013\n\n\n The burden of proof to establish a deductible loss and the amount of it, clearly, was upon the respondent. Reinecke v. Spalding, \n280 \nU.S. 227, 233\n, 50 S. Ct. 96; United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422, 443\n, 46 S. Ct. 131. It was just as necessary under the statute for the respondent to prove value as of March 1, 1913, as it was to prove cost in 1906 and the \n\n[283 U.S. 223, 228]\n\u00a0\n amount finally received by him in 1920. The court below after a review of the facts, disposed of the matter by saying:\n'To determine, in view of these variable factors, or lack of factors, its true or approximate value on a given date, as that of March 1, 1913 selected by the Commissioner as the basis of the tax calculation, was a sheer impossibility. The only fixed factors in the situation were those of cost in 1906 and return in 1920. It follows that the proper basis for measuring the petitioner's admitted loss-because the only possible basis-was that of cost and return.'\n\n We cannot agree that the impossibility of establishing a specific fact, made essental b y the statute as a prerequisite to the allowance of a loss, justifies a decision for the taxpayer based upon a consideration only of the remaining factors which the statute contemplates. The definite requirement of section 202(a)(1) of the act is not thus easily to be put aside. The impossibility of proving a material fact upon which the right to relief depends simply leaves the claimant upon whom the burden rests with an unenforceable claim, a misfortune to be borne by him, as it must be borne in other cases, as the result of a failure of proof. Compare Underwood v. Wing, 4 De Gex, M. & G. 632, 660; Newell et al. v. Nichols et al., 75 N. Y. 78, 90, 31 Am. Rep. 424; Estate of Ehle, 73 Wis. 445, 459, 460, 41 N. W. 627; 2 Chamberlayne, Modern Law of Evidence,  970.\n Neither can the presumption be indulged that the cost of respondent's interest in 1906 was the value of that interest in 1913, for non constat that such cost was the value even in 1906.\n Moreover, we think the record is far from demonstrating the impossibility of supplying evidence from which the required fact might be found. The 7,268 shares of stock in the Pennsylvania Sugar Company, the distribution of which in 1920 closed the transaction, had been received by the Real Estate Trust Company as early as 1912. This \n\n[283 U.S. 223, 229]\n\u00a0\n stock, together with certain bonds, not otherwise described, constituted on March 1, 1913, the entire available assets remaining of the original 'Segal matters.' There seems to have been no difficulty in ascertaining the value of the stock in 1920; and it is hard to see why its value, as well as the value of the bonds, could not have been, at least approximately, determined as of March 1, 1913, and, consequently, the approximate value of the contingent interest of each of the subscribers to the fund ascertained as of that date. No reason is suggested by the record or otherwise, and none occurs to us, for not seeking light on the subject from those who had been in charge of the liquidation of the 'Segal matters.' We cannot assume that such an effort, would have been fruitless. Respondent was bound to produce the best available evidence of value which the circumstances and nature of the transaction permitted. It does not, appear that he made any attempt to do so.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBURNET v.

Goodell, of New York City, for respondent Bruce.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These causes present the same questions. One opinion, stating the essential circumstances disclosed in No. 521, will suffice for both.\n Prior to March, 1913, and until March 11, 1916, respondent, Mrs. Logan, owned 250 of the 4,000 capital shares issued by the Andrews & Hitchcock Iron Company. It held 12 per cent. of the stock of the Mahoning Ore & Steel Company, an operating concern. In 1895 the latter corporation procured a lease for 97 years upon the 'Mahoning' mine and since then has regularly taken therefrom large, but varying, quantities of iron ore-in 1913, 1,515,428 tons; in 1914, 1,212,287 tons; in 1915, 2,311,940 tons; in 1919, 1,217,167 tons; in 1921, 303,020 tons; in 1923, 3,029,865 tons. The lease contract did not require production of either maximum or minimum tonnage or any definite payments. Through an agreement of stockholders ( steel manufacturers), the Mahoning Company is obligated to apportion extracted ore among them according to their holdings. \n\n[283 U.S. 404, 410]\n\u00a0\n On March 11, 1916, the owners of all the shares in Andrews & Hitchcock Company sold them to Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company, which thus acquired, among other things, 12 per cent. of the Mahoning Company's stock and the right to receive the same percentage of ore thereafter taken from the leased mine.\n For the shares so acquired, the Youngstown Company paid the holders $ 2,200,000 in money, and agreed to pay annually thereafter for distribution among them 60 cents for each ton of ore apportioned to it. Of this cash Mrs. Logan received 250\/4000-$137,500; and she became entitled to the same fraction of any annual payment thereafter made by the purchaser under the terms of sale.\n Mrs. Logan's mother had long owned 1,100 shares of the Andrews & Hitchcock Company. She died in 1917, leaving to the daughter one-half of her interest in payments thereafter made by the Youngstown Company. This bequest was appraised for federal estate tax purposes at $277,164.50.\n During 1917, 1918, 1919, and 1920 the Youngstown Company paid large sums under the agreement. Out of these respondent received on account of her 250 shares $9,900 in 1917; $11,250 in 1918; $8,995.50 in 1919; $5,444. 30 in 1920-$35,589.80. By reason of the interest from her mother's estate, she received $19,790.10 in 1919, and $11,977.49 in 1920\n\n\n Reports of income for 1918, 1919, and 1920 were made by Mrs. Logan upon the basis of cash receipts and disbursements. They included no part of what she had obtained from annual payments by the Youngstown Company. She maintains that until the total amount actually received by her from the sale of her shares equals their value on March 1, 1913, no taxable income will arise from the transaction. Also that, until she actually receives by reason of the right bequeathed to her a sum equal to its \n\n[283 U.S. 404, 411]\n\u00a0\n appraised value, there will be no taxable income therefrom.\n On March 1, 1913, the value of the 250 sharesthen held by Mrs. Logan exceeded $173,089.80-the total of all sums actually received by her prior to 1921 from their sale ($137,500 cash in 1916, plus four annual payments amounting to $35,589.80). That value also exceeded original cost of the shares. The amount received on the interest devised by her mother was less than its valuation for estate taxation; also less than the value when acquired by Mrs. Logan.\n The Commissioner ruled that the obligation of the Youngstown Company to pay 60 cents per ton has a fair market value of $1,942,111.46 on March 11, 1916; that this value should be treated as so much cash, and the sale of the stock regarded as a closed transaction with no profit in 1916. He also used this valuation as the basis for apportioning subsequent annual receipts between income and return of capital. His calculations, based upon estimates and assumptions, are too intricate for brief statement. \n1\n He made deficiency assessments according to the view just stated, and the Board of Tax Appeals approved the result. \n\n[283 U.S. 404, 412]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held that, in the circumstances, it was impossible to determine with fair certainty the market value of the agreement by the Youngstown Company to pay 60 cents per ton. Also that respondent was entitled to the return of her capital-the value of 250 shares on March 1, 1913, and the assessed value of the interest derived from her mother-before she could be charged with any taxable income. As this had not in fact been returned, there was no taxable income.\n We agree with the result reached by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The 1916 transaction was a sale of stock-not an exchange of property. We are not dealing with royalties or deductions from gross income because of depletion of mining property. Nor does the situation demand that an effort be made to place according to the best available data some approximate value upon the contract for future payments. This probably was necessary in order to assess the mother's estate. As annual payments on account of extracted ore come in, they can be readily apportioned first as return of capital and later as profit. The liability for income tax ultimately can be fairly determined without resort to mere estimates, assumptions, and speculation. \n\n[283 U.S. 404, 413]\n\u00a0\n When the profit, if any, is actually realized, the taxpayer will be required to respond. The consideration for the sale was $2,200,000 in cash and he p romise of future money payments wholly contingent upon facts and circumstances not possible to foretell with anything like fair certainty. The promise was in no proper sense equivalent to cash. It had no ascertainable fair market value. The transaction was not a closed one. Respondent might never recoup her capital investment from payments only conditionally promised. Prior to 1921, all receipts from the sale of her shares amounted to less than their value on March 1, 1913. She properly demanded the return of her capital investment before assessment of any taxable profit based on conjecture.\n'In order to determine whether there has been gain or loss, and the amount of the gain if any, we must withdraw from the gross proceeds an amount sufficient to restore the capital value that existed at the commencement of the period under consideration.' Doyle v. Mitchell Bros. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 179, 184\n, 185 S., 38 S. Ct. 467, 469. Revenue Act 1916,  2, 39 Stat. 757, 758; Revenue Act 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057. Ordinarily, at least, a taxpayer may not deduct from gross receipts a supposed loss which in fact is represented by his outstanding note. Eckert v. Burnet, \n283 \nU.S. 140\n, 51 S. Ct. 373 (April 13, 1931). And, conversely, a promise to pay indeterminate sums of money in not necessarily taxable income. 'Generally speaking, the income tax law is concerned only with realized losses, as with realized gains.' Lucas v. American Code Co., \n280 \nU.S. 445, 449\n, 50 S. Ct. 202, 203.\n\n From her mother's estate, Mrs. Logan obtained the right to share in possible proceeds of a contract thereafter to pay indefinite sums. The value of this was assumed to be $277,164.50, and its transfer was so taxed. Some valuation-speculative or otherwise-was necessary in order to close the estate. It may never yield as much, it may \n\n[283 U.S. 404, 414]\n\u00a0\n yield more. If a sum equal to the value thus ascertained had been invested in an annuity contract, payments thereunder would have been free from income tax until the owner had recouped his capital investment. We think a like rule should be applied here. The statute definitely excepts bequests from receipts which go to make up taxable income. See Burnet, Commissioner, v. Whitehouse, \n283 \nU.S. 148\n, 51 S. Ct. 374 (April 13, 1931).\n The judgments below are affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the brief for petitioner the following appears:\n The fair market value of the Youngstown contract on March 11, 1916, was found by the Commissioner to be $1,942,111.46. This was based upon an estimate that the ore reserves at the Mahoning mine amounted to 82,858,535 tons; that all such ore would be mined; that 12 per cent. (or 9,942,564.2 tons) would be delivered to the Youngstown Company. The total amount to be received by all the vendors of stock would then be $5,965,814.52 at the rate of 60 cents per ton. The Commissioner's figure for the fair market value on March 11, 1916, was the then worth of $5,965,814.52, upon the assumption that the amount was to be received in equal annual installments during 45 years, discounted at 6 per cent., with a provision for a sinking fund at 4 per cent. For lack of evidence to the contrary, this value was approved by the Board. The value of the 550\/4000 interest which each acquired by bequest was fixed at $277,164.50 for purposes of federal estate tax at the time of the mother's death.\n During the years here involved, the Youngstown Company made payments in accordance with the terms of the contract, and respondents respectively received sums proportionate to the interests in the contract which they acquired by exchange of property and by bequest.\n The Board held that respondents' receipts from the contract, during the years in question, represented 'gross income'; that respondents should be allowed to deduct from said gross income a reasonable allowance for exhaustion of their contract interests; and that the balance of the receipts should be regarded as taxable income. \n\n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBURNET v.

The Court of Appeals reversed. 38 F.( 2d) 718.\n The taxpayer, a Louisiana corporation organized in 1911, was engaged in making and selling beer. November 3, 1919, it abandoned that business, and commenced the manufacture of near beer, which it continued until 1923. For the manufacture of beer, the taxpayer had a brewery building and a cellar building having three floors. After prohibition, the brewery building and one floor of the cellar building were used in the production of near beer. Two floors of the cellar building and certain steel and wooden vats thereon formerly used for aging beer were not needed, and their use was discontinued on November 3, 1919. The Board found that the vats had no salvage value, and held their depreciated cost deductible as obsolescence over the period from December 18, 1917, the date of the submission of the Eighteenth Amendment, to January 16, 1620, the date that prohibition took effect. But it denied any allowance for obsolescence of the two floors on the ground that, while the taxpayer ceased to use them, there was nothing in the record to indicate that the structure was obsolete or becoming so. The Court of Appeals held the evidence ample to support the taxpayer's contention that, after abandonment, the two floors possessed no residual or salvage value. The Government has raised here only the question whether under the Revenue Act of 1918,  234(a)(4) or (a)( 7), 40 Stat. 1078, a deduction may be allowed for loss or obsolescence of tangible property caused by prohibition legislation, and concedes that it is not in position to contend that the evidence was not sufficient to establish obsolescence of the two floors.\n The government relies on Clarke v. Haberle Brewing Co., \n280 \nU.S. 384\n, 50 S. Ct. 155, and Renziehausen v. Lucas, \n280 \nU.S. 387\n, 50 S. Ct. 156. But we have held in the Gambrinus Case, \n282 \nU.S. 638\n, 51 S.

The Commissioner disallowed the deductions on the ground that, after prohibition, the taxpayer continued to use his property to make and sell near beer and other nonintoxicating beverages. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the Commissioner. 13 B. T. A. 1040. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 38 F.(2d) 217.\n The pertinent words of the statute, Revenue Act of 1918,  234(a)(7), 40 Stat. 1078, are: 'A reasonable allowance for the \n\n[282 U.S. 648, 651]\n\u00a0\n exhaustion, wear and tear of property used in the trade or business, including a reasonable allowance for obsolescence.'\n The government contends that this statute did not authorize a deduction for obsolescence of tangible property resulting from the imminence of prohibition. But in the Gambrinus Case, \n282 \nU.S. 638\n, 51 S. Ct. 260, just decided we hold the contrary.\n The government also maintains that on the facts of this case no allowance for obsolescence should be made.\n We take judicial notice of the following: Prior to the submission of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1917, more than 30 states had enacted prohibitory laws. A war measure, effective August 10, 1917, required the reduction of the alcoholic content of beer. The proposed amendment was ratified by 12 states in the first six months of 1918 and by 3 more before the expiration of that year; 21 states ratified in the early part of January, 1919, and in that month the amendment became a part of the Constitution, and took effect one year later, January 16, 1920\n\n\n There is no controversy as to facts found by the Board of Tax Appeals:\n The brewing company from 1902 until October, 1919, was engaged in making and selling beer. Its sales from 1912 to 1917, inclusive, ranged from 30,681 to 37,176 barrels per year. Due to war-time prohibition, its sales fell off in 1918 to 30,204 barrels, about 19 per cent. less than the sales of the preceding year, and in 1919 to 17,823 barrels, about 40 per cent. less than in 1918.\n At the end of 1917 the depreciated cost, and actual value, of te c ompany's land, buildings and equipment, was $477,054.60. After deducting the allowances in 1918 and in 1919 for exhaustion, wear, and tear of its plant and for obsolescence of property used for making beer, the book value of such property was reduced to $279,117.08. \n\n[282 U.S. 648, 652]\n\u00a0\n But, due to prohibition laws, its actual value at the end of 1919 was only $ 90,475. That is $188,642.08 less than the book value after such deductions.\n Its buildings, machinery, and equipment were designed and constructed for the brewing and selling of beer, and were not available or readily adaptable to other uses. The buildings were damp, the floor levels uneven; there were few openings for light and no elevators, and the property was located in a manufacturing zone. Much of the machinery could not be removed without dismantling or tearing out the walls of the building, and some of it could not be removed except by tearing out a side of the building. The company's officers considered selling or converting its buildings and machinery into a plant for a dairy, cold storage, ice cream manufacturing, dry storage, ice manufacture, fruit storage, semicold storage, machine shop, or chemical plant. They could find no use for the property except for the purpose of making near beer and other soft drinks.\n In 1917 the company began to manufacture near bear, and for that purpose used the machinery and processes employed in the making of bear. An additional process for dealcoholizing was necessary. It sold 16 barrels in that year, 327 in 1918, 8 in 1919, 7,921 in 1920 and 2,852 in 1921.\n In 1918 it began the manufacture of other soft drinks by use of machinery not here involved. In October, 1919, because of prohibition, the company discontinued the making of beer. It abandoned the lower floor of one of its buildings which had been devoted to storing and aging beer. That process is not involved in making near beer. Thereafter a part of another building with the equipment therein which had been used three or four times a week in making and bottling beer was used only once in about two weeks in making near beer. Apparently the rest of the property was used in connection with \n\n[282 U.S. 648, 653]\n\u00a0\n the making of such near beer and other soft drinks as were made by the company prior to its going out of business.\n The company could not operate at a profit after prohibition, and the corporation was voluntarily dissolved in December of 1921. Its affairs were administered by its former directors acting as trustees. In January, 1922, they leased all the property, including equipment that had been added for the making of soft drinks, for a term of three months, with privilege of renewal by the lessee. The lease was still in effect at the time of the hearing before the Board in 1927. The rent was at the rate of $ 5,000 per year, plus taxes, insurance, and repairs.\n The difference between the depreciated cost (found to be actual value) December 31, 1917, and the value of the property in 1918 and 1919 was due to the imminence and incidence of war-time and permanent prohibition. There was no material change in the value of land and buildings in the vicinity used for purposes other than brewing. In December, 1921, the company sold certain of its land, free from buildings, for $20,000. Up to the time of the hearing the highest offer for the remaining property that the company was able to secure was $35,000.\n The government argues that obsolescence is the state of becoming obsolete, that property is obsolete when it is no longer useful for the purpose for which it was acquired, and cannot be used for any other purpose, and that obsolescence begins only when there is a reasonable certainty that the property will become obsolete. And, further, that there is no finding that at any time during the taxable years in question it became apparent that the property would become obsolete, and that no inference to that effect can properly be drawn from the facts found.\n In the solution of the problem here presented, no general or comprehensive definition of 'obsolesenc e' is necessary. The word is much used, and its meaning de- \n\n[282 U.S. 648, 654]\n\u00a0\n pends upon and varies with the connections in which it is employed. It has been said to be 'the condition or process by which units gradually cease to be useful or profitable as a part of the property, on account of changed conditions.' \n1\n Obsolescence is not necessarily confined to particular elements or parts of a plant; the whole may become obsolete. Obsolescence may arise as the result of laws regulating or forbidding the particular use of the property as well as from changes in the art, the shifting of business centers, loss of trade, inadequacy, or other causes.\n We are here concerned with the meaning of obsolescence as used in the above-quoted clause of the taxing act. Clearly the statute contemplates that, where warranted by the facts, the taxpayer shall have the benefit of, and in making his return may deduct in each year, a reasonable allowance to cover obsolescence of the tangible property. And that is in accord with sound principles of accounting. Cf. Kansas City So. Ry. v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 423, 451\n, 34 S. Ct. 125, 52 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1, Pacific Gas Co. v. City and County of San Francisco, \n265 \nU.S. 403, 415\n, 44 S. Ct. 537. The provision is general, and applied alike to all taxpayers; its purpose is to guide the ascertainment of taxable income in each year. It is a familiar rule that tax laws are to be liberally construed in favor of taxpayers. Farmers Loan Co. v. Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204, 212\n, 50 S. Ct. 98, 65 A. L. R. 1000; Bowers v. N. Y. & Albany Co., \n273 \nU.S. 346, 350\n, 47 S. Ct. 389; United States v. Merriam, \n263 \nU.S. 179, 188\n, 44 S. Ct. 69, 29 A. L. R. 1547; Shwab v. Doyle, \n258 \nU.S. 529, 536\n, 42 S. Ct. 391, 26 A. L. R. 1454; Eidman v. Martinez, \n184 \nU.S. 578, 583\n, 22 S. Ct. 515.\n It would be unreasonable and violate that canon of construction to put upon the taxpayer the burden of proving to a reasonable certainty the existence and amount of obsolescence. Such weight of evidence as would reasonably support a verdict for a plaintiff in an ordinary action for the recovery of money fairly may be deemed sufficient. \n\n[282 U.S. 648, 655]\n\u00a0\n Neither the cost of obsolescence nor of accruing exhaustion, wear, and tear that is properly chargeable in any period of time can be measured accurately. A reasonable approximation of the amount that fairly may be included in the accounts of any year is all that is required. In determining the proper deduction for obsolescence, there is to be taken into consideration the amount probably recoverable, at the end of its service, by putting the property to another use or by selling it as scrap or otherwise. There is no hard and fast rule, as suggested by the government, that a taxpayer must show that his property will be scrapped or cease to be used or useful for any purpose, before any allowance may be made for obsolescence.\n There is no claim that, if allowable at all, the amounts deducted were excessive or that they were not properly allocated as between the two years in question. The rapid advance toward prohibition prior to and in 1917 was sufficient to warn one engaged in brewing beer that his business would probably be brought to an end at an early date. In January, 1919, before the tax return for 1918 was due, prohibition was established to take effect one year later. The facts found show that in the early part of 1918 the company was abundantly justified in concluding that upon the taking effect of prohibition it must cease to use its brewery for making beer.\n It was then warranted in concluding that the period of obsolescence commenced about the first of 1918 and would end upon the taking effect of prohibition. The fact that prohibition would put all the breweries out of business is enough to show that it would be practically impossible to sell such properties or find other uses to which they profitably could be pt. Due to prohibition, the diminution in value of the company's property in 1918 and 1919 was about twice as much as the total of all sums deducted to cover obsolescence in those years. In that period over 80 \n\n[282 U.S. 648, 656]\n\u00a0\n per cent. of the 1917 value of its lands, buildings, and equipment disappeared. Notwithstanding diligent efforts, the property could not be put to any profitable use or sold for more than a fraction of its value in 1917. The rents realized under a short term lease renewed from time to time for more than five years amounted to less than 1 1\/2 per cent. of such value.\n The facts found clearly show that obsolescence commenced about the beginning of 1918, and that the property became obsolete upon the taking effect of prohibition in January, 1920. The company was unable to find any profitable use to which the property could be put. The sums received on the sale and as rents constituted mere salvage.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Transactions, Am. Soc. C.

A. 452, which had sustained the action of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in making a deficiency assessment against respondent for income and profits taxes for the year 1920\n\n\n From 1913 to 1915, inclusive, respondent, a Delaware corporation engaged in business for profit, was acting for the Atlantic Dredging Company in carrying out a contract for dredging the Delaware River, entered into by that company with the United States. In making its income tax returns for the years 1913 to 1916, respondent added to gross income for each year the pamen ts made under the contract that year, and deducted its expenses paid that year in performing the contract. The total expenses exceeded the payments received by $176,271.88. The tax returns for 1913, 1915, and 1916 showed net losses. That for 1914 showed net income.\n In 1915 work under the contract was abandoned, and in 1916 suit was brought in the Court of Claims to recover for a breach of warranty of the character of the material \n\n[282 U.S. 359, 362]\n\u00a0\n to be dredged. Judgment for the claimant, 53 Ct. Cl. 490, was affirmed by this Court in 1920. United States v. Atlantic Dredging Co., \n253 \nU.S. 1\n, 40 S. Ct. 423, 425. It held that the recovery was upon the contract and was 'compensatory of the cost of the work, of which the government got the benefit.' From the total recovery, petitioner received in that year the sum of $192,577.59, which included the $176,271.88 by which its expenses under the contract had exceeded receipts from it, and accrued interest amounting to $16,305.71. Respondent having failed to include these amounts as gross income in its tax returns for 1920, the Commissioner made the deficiency assessment here involved, based on the addition of both items to gross income for that year.\n The Court of Appeals ruled that only the item of interest was properly included, holding, erroneously as the government contends, that the item of $176,271.88 was a return of losses suffered by respondent in earlier years and hence was wrongly assessed as income. Notwithstanding this conclusion, its judgment of reversal and the consequent elimination of this item from gross income for 1920 were made contingent upon the filing by respondent of amended returns for the years 1913 to 1916, from which were to be omitted the deductions of the related items of expenses paid in those years. Respondent insists that as the Sixteenth Amendment and the Revenue Act of 1918, which was in force in 1920, plainly contemplate a tax only on net income or profits, any application of the statute which operates to impose a tax with respect to the present transaction, from which respondent received no profit, cannot be upheld.\n If respondent's contention that only gain or profit may be taxed under the Sixteenth Amendment be accepted without qualification, see Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189\n, 40 S. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570; Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co., \n247 \nU.S. 179\n, 38 S. Ct. 467, the question remains whether the gain or profit which is the \n\n[282 U.S. 359, 363]\n\u00a0\n subject of the tax may be ascertained, as here, on the basis of fixed accounting periods, or whether, as is pressed upon us, it can only be net profit ascertained on the basis of particular transactions of the taxpayer when they are brought to a conclusion.\n All the revenue acts which have been enacted since the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment have uniformly assessed the tax on the basis of annual returns showing the net result of all the taxpayer's transactions during a fixed accounting period, either the calendar year, or, at the option of the taxpayer, the particular fiscal year which he may adopt. Under sections 230, 232 and 234(a) of the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1057, respondent was subject to tax upon its annual net income, arrived at by deducting from gross income for each taxable year all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid during that year in carrying on any trade or business, interest and taxes paid, and losses sustained, during the year. By sections 233(a) and 213(a) gross income 'includes ... income derived from ... business ... or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever.' The amount of all such items is required to be included in the gross income for the taxable year in which received by the taxpayer, unless they may be properly accounted for on the accrual basis under Section 212(b). See United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422\n, 46 S. Ct. 131; Aluminum Castings Co. v. Rotza hn, \n282 \nU.S. 92\n, 51 S. Ct. 11, decided November 24, 1930.\n That the recovery made by respondent in 1920 was gross income for that year within the meaning of these sections cannot, we think, be doubted. The money received was derived from a contract entered into in the course of respondent's business operations for profit. While it equalled, and in a loose sense was a return of, expenditures made in performing the contract, still, as the Board of Tax Appeals found, the expenditures were \n\n[282 U.S. 359, 364]\n\u00a0\n made in defraying the expenses incurred in the prosecution of the work under the contract, for the purpose of earning profits. They were not capital investments, the cost of which, if converted, must first be restored from the proceeds before there is a capital gain taxable as income. See Doyle v. Mitchell Brothers Co., supra, page 185 of 247 U. S., 38 S. Ct. 467.\n That such receipts from the conduct of a business enterprise are to be included in the taxpayer's return as a part of gross income, regardless of whether the particular transaction results in net profit, sufficiently appears from the quoted words of Section 213(a) and from the character of the deductions allowed. Only by including these items of gross income in the 1920 return would it have been possible to ascertain respondent's net income for the period covered by the return, which is what the statute taxes. The excess of gross income over deductions did not any the less constitute net income for the taxable period because respondent, in an earlier period, suffered net losses in the conduct of its business which were in some measure attributable to expenditures made to produce the net income of the later period.\n Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co., \n271 \nU.S. 170\n, 46 S. Ct. 449, on which respondent relies, does not support its position. In that case the taxpayer, which had lost, in business, borrowed money, which was to be repaid in German marks, and which was later repaid in depreciated currency, had neither made a profit on the transaction, nor received any money or property which could have been made subject to the tax.\n But respondent insists that if the sum which it recovered is the income defined by the statute, still it is not income, taxation of which without apportionment is permitted by the Sixteenth Amendment, since the particular transaction from which it was derived did not result in any net gain or profit. But we do not think the amendment is to be so narrowly construed. A taxpayer may be in receipt of net income in one year and not in another. \n\n[282 U.S. 359, 365]\n\u00a0\n The net result of the two years, if combined in a single taxable period, might still be a loss; but it has never been supposed that that fact would relieve him from a tax on the first, or that it affords any reason for postponing the assessment of the tax until the end of a lifetime, or for some other indefinite period, to ascertain more precisely whether the final outcome of the period, or of a given transaction, will be a gain or a loss.\n The Sixteenth Amendment was adopted to enable the government to raise revenue by taxation. It is the essence of any system of taxation that it should produce revenue ascertainable, and payable to the government, at regular intervals. Only by such a system is it practicable to produce a regular flow of income and apply methods of accounting, assessment, and collection capable of practical operation. It is not suggested that there has ever been any general scheme for taxing income on any other basis. The computation of income annually as the net result of all transactions within the year was a familiar practice, and taxes upon income so arrived at were not unknown, before the Sixteenth Amendment. See Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co., supra, page 174 of \n271 U.S. 46\n S. Ct. 449; Pacific Insurance Co. v. Soule, 7 Wall, 433; Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n158 \nU.S. 601, 630\n, 15 S. Ct. 912. It is not to be supposed that the amendment did not contemplatetha t Congress might make income so ascertained the basis of a scheme of taxation such as had been in actual operation within the United States before its adoption. While, conceivably, a different system might be devised by which the tax could be assessed, wholly or in part, on the basis of the finally ascertained results of particular transactions, Congress is not required by the amendment to adopt such a system in preference to the more familiar method, even if it were practicable. It would not necessarily obviate the kind of inequalities of which respondent complains. If losses from particular transactions were to be set off against \n\n[282 U.S. 359, 366]\n\u00a0\n gains in others, there would still be the practical necessity of computing the tax on the basis of annual or other fixed taxable periods, which might result in the taxpayer being required to pay a tax on income in one period exceeded by net losses in another.\n Under the statutes and regulations in force in 1920, two methods were provided by which, to a limited extent, the expenses of a transaction incurred in one year might be offset by the amounts actually received from it in another. One was by returns on the accrual basis under Section 212(b ), which provides that a taxpayer keeping accounts upon any basis other than that of actual receipts and disbursements, unless such basis does not clearly reflect its income, may, subject to regulations of the Commissioner, make its return upon the basis upon which its books are kept. See United States v. Anderson, and Aluminum Castings Co. v. Routzahn, supra. The other was under Treasury Regulations (article 121 of Rug. 33 of Jan. 2, 1918, under the Revenue Acts of 1916 and 1917; article 36 of Reg. 45, April 19, 1919, under the Revenue Act of 1918) providing that in reporting the income derived from certain long term contracts, the taxpayer might either report all of the receipts and all of the expenditures made on account of a particular contract in the year in which the work was completed, or report in each year the percentage of the estimated profit corresponding to the percentage of the total estimated expenditures which was made in that year.\n The Court of Appeals said that the case of the respondent here fell within the spirit of these regulations. But the court did not hold, nor does respondent assert, that it ever filed returns in compliance either with these regulations, or Section 212(b), or otherwise attempted to avail itself of their provisions; nor on this record do any facts appear tending to support the burden, resting on the taxpayer, of establishing that the Commissioner erred in failing to \n\n[282 U.S. 359, 367]\n\u00a0\n apply them. See Niles Bement Pond Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 357, 361\n, 50 S. Ct. 251.\n The assessment was properly made under the statutes. Relief from their alleged burdensome operation which may not be secured under these provisions, can be afforded only by legislation, not by the courts.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","26":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBURNET v. THOMPSON OIL & GAS CO.(1931)\nNo. 288\nArgued: Decided: April 13, 1931\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Seth W. Richardson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Phil D. Morelock, of Kansas City, Mo., and James S. Y. Ivins, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined a deficiency in the respondent's income tax for 1918. Upon \n\n[283 U.S. 301, 302]\n\u00a0\n the taxpayer's petition the Board of Tax Appeals sustained the Commissioner. \n1\n An appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals, which reversed the judgment of the Board. \n2\n This court granted certiorari. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The question presented is whether under section 234(a)(9) of the Revenue Act of 1918,4 in determining for any taxable year the capital value, recoverable through depletion allowance, of oil mining properties acquired prior to March 1, 1913, there should be deducted from the March 1, 1913 value of the properties the amount of depletion actually sustained in earlier years, or only so much of such depletion as was allowable as deductions under the revenue acts in force in those years.\n The Board of Tax Appeals found the following facts: The taxpayer owned an oil and gas mining lease acquired prior to March 1, 1913. On that date the recoverable oil in the reserve embraced by the lease was 278,000 barrels, and its value was $156,645, or $0.56347 per barrel. Between March 1, 1913, and December 31, 1915, it extracted 162,717 barrels of oil, so that at the unit rate mentioned it sustained depletion amounting to $91, 686.15. Its deduction for depletion in computing net income under the \n\n[283 U.S. 301, 303]\n\u00a0\n Revenue Act of 19135 was computed not by reference to the number of barrels extracted, or to the value of the reserve on March 1, 1913, but by taking 5 per cent. of the gross income from the sale of oil. The depletion allowance for 1913 to 1915, inclusive, computed by this method, amounted to $6322.02.\n In 1916 the taxpayer secured an extension of its lease at a cost of $ 30,000, whereby its oil reserve was increased by 300,000 barrels. There then remained of the original reserve 115,283 barrels having a value as of March 1, 1913, of $64,958.85. The Commissioner added to this depleted value the cost of the extension of the lease, and added to the remaining oil reserves of the original lease the additional 300,000 barrels then acquired. He thus ascertained a new total recoverable reserve of 415,283 barrels having a basic value or cost of $94,958.85, or $0.22866 per barrel. There were no subsequent additions to the reserves.\n In 1916 there were produced under the lease 49,452 barrels of oil, and in 1917, 39,204 barrels, leaving the reserve at January 1, 1918, 326, 627 barrels.\n A new method of allowance for depletion was adopted in the Revenue Act of 1916.6 Depletion was sustained under the formula therein prescribed in those two years, \n\n[283 U.S. 301, 304]\n\u00a0\n amounting to $20,272.08. It is agreed that this figure is correct and represents the sustained depletion as well as allowed depletion for those years.\n During 1918 there were produced 33,697 barrels of oil. At the unit price adopted by the Commissioner of $0.22866 per barrel, the depletion sustained and allowed for that year was $7,705.16. It is this depletion allowance for the year 1918 which is here called in question.\n In view of the fact that the depletion actually sustained by the taxpayer between March 1, 1913, and December 31, 1915, was $91,686.15, whereas in conformity with the act of 1913 the deduction actually allowed it as for depletion was only $6,322.02, the respondent contended tha the unit rate of depletion per barrel for 1918 should have been based upon the original March 1, 1913 value of the reserves, plus the cost of the extension of the lease, and less only that portion of the actually sustained depletion which was in fact allowed pursuant to the terms of the 1913 act. The Commissioner, on the other hand, substracted from the March 1, 1913, value plus the cost of the extension of the lease, the sustained or actual depletion, holding that the entire depletion actually sustained should be deducted from the original March 1, 1913 value, regardless of whether it was allowable as deductions from the gross income of the years 1913, 1914 and 1915. The Circuit Court of Appeals decided in favor of the respondent.\n The parties agree that respondent is not entitled as matter of right to make any deduction from annual income for depletion of the oil extracted and sold during the year. If it may take any such deduction, authority therefore must be found in the statute. \n7\n It follows that the question for decision is purely one of statutory construction.\n It is clear that Congress intended that the lessee of an oil well should be entitled to a reasonable allowance for \n\n[283 U.S. 301, 305]\n\u00a0\n depletion based upon cost or March 1, 1913 value. It did not however attempt to prescribe a formula for ascertaining it, but expressly delegated that function to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, who was to make rules and regulations to that end. Pursuant to this authority, regulations were made, which required the deduction of depletion theretofore sustained in ascertaining the capital remaining in any year recoverable by depletion deductions. \n8\n It is undisputed that the Commissioner calculated the depletion deduction in this case in accordance with the regulations.\n The taxpayer contends, however, and the court below held, that the allowance granted was not reasonable-as the act required it should be- because although it reflected the actual depletion in the year 1918, considered by itself, the result of the application of the regulation will fall short of returning to the taxpayer its March 1, 1913, capital tax- free at the date of exhaustion of the oil reserve. It is said that this was the intent of Congress as shown not only by the terms of the act, but by the history of prior legislation. Hence it is claimed that only the depletion allowed under the act of 1913 should be deducted in ascertaining the depletable capital at January 1, 1918. Thus respondent would recover its entire capital tax-free. The Government contends that the depletion allowance provided by the regulations is reasonable.\n It is evident that the act of 1913 did not allow enough to return the capital on exhaustion of the reserve. The deduction permitted by that act fell some $85,000 short of \n\n[283 U.S. 301, 306]\n\u00a0\n what was required in 1913-1915 for that purpose. Was it then the intent of the act of 1918 to permit a deduction from gross income for depletion which would represent not only that year's sustained depletion, but make up for sustained but disallowed depletion in the earlier years? The Government says, and we think rightly, that there is nothing in the terms of the act to indicate any such purpose. The tax is an income tax for 1918, and in the absence of express provision to the contrary, it is not to be supposed that the taxpayer is authorized to deduct from that year's income, depreciation, depletion, business losses or other similar items attributable to other years. \n9\n The very fact tha Con gress denied deductions equal to the sustained depletion in the earlier years negatives an intent that they should be allowed in later years, as if for depletion then sustained. The construction adopted by the court below in effect results in including in the taxable year items referable to other years, and is contrary to the theory of a tax for specific years.\n The nature of the tax as one for annual periods has been repeatedly mentioned in dealing with its application in various situations. \n10\n The taxable year 1918, and that only, in involved, and deductions applicable to that year only should be allowed.\n The court below recognized that its decision resulted in attributing an excessive value to the reserves remaining in 1918, but thought that United States v. Ludey11 required it so to hold. That case, however, involved the determination of taxable gain or loss on the \n\n[283 U.S. 301, 307]\n\u00a0\n sale of an oil property. To ascertain gain on a sale of a capital asset, there must be subtracted from the sale price a sum sufficient to restore the value at the date of acquisition (or March 1, 1913).12 The remainder is income. So in the Ludey Case it was held that, in order to ascertain the depleted cost, only the allowed depletion should be deducted from the original cost. Allowed depletion rather than sustained depletion was there the true measure of deduction. But here the question is what allowance Congress intended should be made from the gross annual income of the operation of an oil well. In the one case the question is how much of the capital has already been returned taxfree; in the other how much of the oil reserve remains at the beginning of a taxable year to be depleted over the period remaining until exhaustion. The court below relied on certain statements in the opinion in the Ludey Case which were applicable in the determination of gain on a sale, but which do not apply in this case, for if the sale of each barrel of oil were a partial sale of the reserve ( which it is not) to apply the rule which respondent seeks to deduce from the Ludey Case would increase the cost or 1913 value of each barrel sold, in determining gain or loss in 1918, beyond its actual cost or 1913 value, solely by reason of the fact that too low a cost or 1913 value was taken for barrels sold in prior years. The decision in the Ludey Case has been adopted in the later statutes as affecting sales of capital assets,13 but the provision for annual depletion allowance has remained substantially unchanged. \n14\n This in itself is persuasive evi- \n\n[283 U.S. 301, 308]\n\u00a0\n dence that Congress has approved the executive construction embodied in the regulations. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n Respondent insists that the increasing liberality in the statutory provisions for depletion allowances in the successive Revenue Acts, indicates that Congress never intended that the 1918 act should be so onst rued or administered as to deprive the taxpayer of the return of his entire capital tax-free. But the increasing liberality was to be applicable in calculating net income for the successive years and we can find no evidence either in the acts or in the regulations, of any intent to increase future depletion allowances to redress the inadequacy of those previously permitted.\n It follows that the judgment must be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 15 B.

His will provided for payment of twenty or more annuities. Among other items, it contained the following:\n Item 'Tenth. I also give and bequeath to the said Sybil Douglas, wife of William Whitehouse, an annuity of five thousand dollars.'\n Item 'Twenty-eight. ... All annuities hereby given shall commence at the time of my death and be payable \n\n[283 U.S. 148, 150]\n\u00a0\n in equal parts half-yearly, except as hereinabove specifically mentioned.'\n Item twenty-nine directed the executors to establish a Memorial Home, and to that end gave them the residue of the estate.\n Item 'Thirtieth. ... I authorize and empower said executors or executor to retain and hold any personal property which may belong to me at the time of my death and to set aside and hold any part thereof to provide for the payment and satisfaction of any annuity given by me.'\n The annuity for Mrs. Whitehouse was satisfied from the corpus of the estate prior to November 14, 1920; afterwards, out of income derived therefrom. December 30, 1920, the executors permanently set aside for the Memorial Home a large amount of interest-bearing securities, 'but subject to taxes, annuities, and other charges.'\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue demanded of Mrs. Whitehouse income tax for the year 1921 on the semiannual payments received during that period. She petitioned the Board of Tax Appeals for relief. It held that the bequest to her was within paragraph (b), item (3), section 213, Revenue Act of 1921, and therefore exempt. The Circuit Court of Appeals, First Circuit (38 F.(2d) 162), approved that conclusion.\n The most plausible argument submitted for the Commissioner is this: An annuity given by will is payable primarily out of the income from the estate. The residuary estate of Bennett produced enough during 1921 to meet all bequeathed annuities. The payments received by Mrs. Whitehouse during that year were, in fact, made from such income. Consequently, it cannot be said that the bequest was one of corpus; and the payments were taxable under Irwin v. Gavit, \n268 \nU.S. 161\n, 45 S. Ct. 475. \n\n[283 U.S. 148, 151]\n\u00a0\n As held below, the bequest to Mrs. Whitehouse was not one to be paid from income, but of a sum certain, payable at all events during each year so long  s he should live. It would be an anomaly to tax the receipts for one year and exempt them for another simply because executors paid the first from income received and the second out of the corpus. The will directed payment without reference to the existence or absence of income.\n Irwin v. Gavit is not applicable. The bequest to Gavit was to be paid out of income from a definite fund. If that yielded nothing, he got nothing. This court concluded that the gift was of money to be derived from income and to be paid and received as income by the donee. Here the gift did not depend upon income, but was a charge upon the whole estate during the life of the legatee to be satisfied like any ordinary bequest.\n An attempt is made to strengthen the position of the Commissioner by reference to section 219, Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 246), which declares that the tax imposed by sections 210 and 211 shall apply to the income of estates, including 'income which is to be distributed to the beneficiaries periodically. ...' But clearly enough, we think, this section applies only to income paid as such to a beneficiary. And, as above shown, the sums received by Mrs. Whitehouse were not gifts to be derived from and paid out of income, nor were they received as such by her.\n The exemption in section 213 is plain, and should not be destroyed by any strained construction of general language found in section 219.\n The judgment of the court below must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBURNET v.

Murphy, of Atlanta, Ga., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case came before the Circuit Court of Appeals upon a short question Returns for taxes for the fiscal year 1920 and the fiscal year 1921 were filed respectively on March 15, 1921, and March 15, 1922. Assessments for both years were made on March 15, 1926. The question is whether the assessments were too late under the statutes by which they were governed. The earlier one fell under the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18,  250(d), 40 Stat. 1057, 1083, which requires the amount of tax due to be assessed 'within five years after the return was due of was made.' That for 1921 was governed by Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136,  250(d), 42 Stat. 227, 265, which requires the assessment to be 'within four years after the return was filed.' Both acts are affirmed in Revenue Act of (February 26), 1926, c. 27,  277(a)(2)(3), 44 Stat. 9, 58 (26 USCA  1057). The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the assess- \n\n[282 U.S. 437, 439]\n\u00a0\n ments were too late. 36 F.(2d) 49. A writ of certiorari was granted by this court. \n281 \nU.S. 710\n, 50 S. Ct. 334\n\n\n The argument that prevailed with the Circuit Court of Appeals and that is pressed for the respondent is that a taxpayer is entitled to the most favorable construction of taxing acts, that there is a distinction between a limitation running from a day and one from an event, and that if the words quoted are taken literally the part of the day after the return was filed must be part of the four or five years. We are seeking a measure of time, and therefore we have to translate the event into the language of time; and when, as here, there is no special reason for being more precise, the day is the unit, because people generally measure periods of more than one day by days, months or years. When we say 'four years after the return was filed' by common usage we think of four years after the day on which the return was filed and it would seem that Congress was following common usage. The earlier act read 'after the return was due or was made.' The return was not due before the end of the day for filing. By section 250(d) of the Revenue Acts of 1918 and 1921 no suits shall be begun 'after the expiration of five years after the date when such return was filed,' obviously treating the 'date' and the filing as marking the same starting point, and 'date' equally plainly meaning the year and day of the month. The general rule was laid down long ago in language quoted from Chief Justice Bronson, Cornell v. Moulton, 3 Denio (N. Y.) 12, 'When the period allowed for doing an act is to be reckoned from the making of a contract, or the happening of any other event, the day on which the event happened may be regarded as an entirety, or a point of time; and so may be excluded from the computation.'

AMERICAN PATENTS DEVELOPMENT(1931)\nNo. 54\nArgued: April 27, 1931Decided: May 18, 1931\n\n\n\n Mr. Samuel E. Darby, Jr., of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Charles Neave and George C. Dean, both of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held the patent valid and infringed. 38 F.(2d) 62. In our opinion delivered \n\n[283 U.S. 420, 421]\n\u00a0\n March 9, 1931, we found it unnecessary to determine the validity of the patent, because we held that the bill should be dismissed on the ground that the owner of a patent may not limit its use so as to require that unpatented materials employed in practicing the invention shall be purchased only from the licensor. \n283 \nU.S. 27\n, 51 S. Ct. 334. On March 16, 1931, the Carbice Corporation petitioned that the Court rule also on the validity of the patent. The reason assigned was the inauguration by the Dry Ice Corporation of a campaign of intimidation against customers of the Carbice Corporation by releasing to the public press a statement that the validity of the patent as sustained by the Court of Appeals had not been disturbed; that the true patent monopoly had in no way been limited by this Court; that we had indicated that the proper way to enforce the patent monopoly is by directly suing those who use solid carbon dioxide in the patent combination without a license; and that the Dry Ice Corporation would immediately bring such a suit. A reargument, limited to the question of the validity of the patent, was ordered. \n283 \nU.S. 794\n, 51 S. Ct. 483, 75 L. Ed. -. The respondents petitioned for a rehearing on the issue determined in our former opinion. The latter petition was denied.\n The refrigerating transportation package which is specified and claimed in the patent in suit is described in the earlier opinion. \n283 \nU.S. 27\n, 51 S. Ct. 334. The alleged invention is for the locational arrangement of materials within a container. Whether a locational arrangement within a structure can ever be patented as a manufacture need not be determined. Nor need we consider whether the patent, as issued, contained a sufficient disclosure of the alleged invention. For the combination in suit lacks patentable invention and novelty. Each of the elements-refrigerant, material to be refrigerated, and container-performs its function in a known way. Long prior to the date of the claimed invention, it was known that solid carbon dioxide, which has a temperature of 110 \n\n[283 U.S. 420, 422]\n\u00a0\n degrees below zero, is a refrigerant; that when it 'melts' it passes directly into a dry gas heavier than air, of like low temperature, which may serve as a refrigerant until its temperature rises to that of the outside air. It was known also that a frozen article-be it ice cream or solid carbon dioxide-will remain frozen longer if insulated; and that paper is an insulator. It was not invention to conclude that a cake of the solid dioxide wrapped in paper would remain solid longer if also surrounded by ice cream, than if placed in more immediate proximity to the walls of the container and thus to the outer air; or to conclude that the gas, being heavier than air would, as generated, drive the air out of the container, and thus serve as an additional insulator. Compare Hollister v. Benedict & Burnham Manufacturing Co., \n113 \nU.S. 59, 72\n, 73 S., 5 S. Ct. 71; Dreyfus v. Searle, \n124 \nU.S. 60, 63\n, 8 S. Ct. 390; Wilson v. Janes, Fed. Cas. No. 17,811, 3 Blatchf. 227.\n Moreover, the structural device of surrounding the refrigerant by the article to be refrigerated had been shown in the Mosler and Ladewig refrigerating butter-box, United States patent No. 236,906, issued January 25, 1881; and in Rumpel's portable lunch box. United States patent No. 1, 130,932, issued March 9, 1915. It is true that in these prior art structures the refrigerant employed was not completely surrounded by the refrigerated materials, as the top or bottom of the ice container was usually left exposed. This was done to permit access to the ice chamber for the purpose of removing water. Since carbon dioxide sublimes directly into a dry gas, such access obviously need not be provided, and the refrigerant may be surrounded on all four sides. This difference is unimportant. These references suffice to render the patent invalid also because of anticipation without considering the additional defense of prior use. \n\n\n\n","30":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCARBICE CORPORATION v. AMERICAN PATENTS DEVELOPMENT CORP.(1931)\nNo. 54\nArgued: Decided: March 9, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 27, 28]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Samuel E. Darby, Jr., of New York City, for petitioners.\n Messrs. Charles Neave and George C. Dean, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The American Patents Development Corporation, as owner of United States Patent No. 1,595,426, and the Dry Ice Corporation, as exclusive licensee, brought this suit in the federal court for eastern New York to enjoin contributory infringement by the Carbice Company, for an accounting of profits, and for damages. The defendant denied both the validity of the patent and the alleged infringement. The District Court, without passing upon validity, dismissed the bill on the ground that infringement had not been shown, 25 F.(2d) 730. The Circuit Court of Appeals held the patent valid and infringed, 38 F.(2d) 62. A writ of certiorari was granted, \n281 \nU.S. 711\n, 50 S. Ct. 347\n\n\n Solid carbon dioxide has a temperature of about 110 below zero. When it 'melts,' it passes directly into a dry gaseous state-the gas having a like temperature and \n\n[283 U.S. 27, 29]\n\u00a0\n being in volume about 500 times that of the solid. These properties makes the solid dioxide an excellent dry refrigerant for foodstuffs, particularly for the shipment of ice cream. The refrigerating transportation package, which is the subject of the patent in suit, is made up in this way: Near the middle of the outer box or carton in which the ice cream or other foodstuff is to be shipped, there is placed, in a small container, a quantity of solid carbon dioxide. So placed, this refrigerant is relatively enduring because it is doubly protected from the exterior heat by the ice cream which surrounds it and by the evaporating gas which excludes air and moisture from the shipping case. The ice cream is kept frozen by both the solid and the gaseous dioxide. Although the cost of solid dioxide is about ten times that of water ice, such use is said to have revolutionized the transportation of ice cream, as in this may shipping and handling charges are greatly reduced and the messiness incident to the employment of water ice is eliminated.\n The patent in suit is not for solid carbon dioxide. That artile and its properties as a refrigerant have been long known to the public. The patent is not for a machine for making solid carbon dioxide. Nor is it for a process for making or using that substance. The Patent Office rejected an application for a process patent. The patent is said to be for a manufacture. The specifications outline the method of construction and use; and a typical claim (6) is for a 'transportation package consisting of a protective casing of insulating material having packed therein a quantity of frozen carbon dioxide in an insulating container and a quantity of freezable product in freezing proximity to said frozen carbon dioxide and the gas evaporated therefrom, arranged so that said frozen carbon dioxide is less accessible for exterior heat than said freezable products.'\n The sole business of the Dry Ice Corporation is the manufacture of solid carbon dioxide which it sells under \n\n[283 U.S. 27, 30]\n\u00a0\n the name of 'dry-Ice.' It does not make or sell transportation packages in which solid carbon dioxide is used as a refrigerant. It does not issue to other concerns licenses to make such packages upon payment of a stipulated royalty. It does not formally license buyers of its dry ice to use the invention in suit. But each invoice for solid dioxide sold by it bears this notice. 'The merchandise herein described is shipped upon the following condition: That DryIce shall not be used except in DryIce cabinets or other containers or apparatus provided or approved by the DryIce Corporation of America; and the DryIce Cabinets or other containers or apparatus provided or approved by the DryIce Corporation of America shall be refrigerated or used only with DryIce. These uses of DryIce are fully covered by our Basic Method and Apparatus Patent No. 1,511,306. Granted October 14th, 1924, and other Patents Pending.' The patent in suit, No. 1,595,426, issued August 10, 1926, is not named in the invoice; but it has been assumed that thereby the Dry Ice Corporation extends to each of its customers, buyers of solid carbon dioxide, a license to use the invention without the payment of royalty. The restrictions as to the purchase of cartons set forth in the invoices of the corporation appear not to have been insisted upon by it.\n The Carbice Corporation also manufactures solid carbon dioxide. It is charged with contributory infringement because it sells its product to customers of the Dry Ice Corporation with knowledge that the dioxide is to be used by the purchaser in transportation packages like those described in the patent. The Carbice Corporation challenges the validity of the patent and denies infringement. Whether the transportation package described is a patentable invention we need not determine. For even if it is, no relief can be granted.\n The invention claimed is for a particular kind of package employing solid carbon dioxide in a new combination. \n\n[283 U.S. 27, 31]\n\u00a0\n If the patent is valid the owner can, of course, prohibit entirely the manufacture, sale, or use of such packages, Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co., \n210 \nU.S. 405\n, 28 S. Ct. 748. Or it can grant licenses upon terms consistent with the limited scope of the patent monopoly, United States v. General Electric Co., \n272 \nU.S. 476, 489\n, 47 S. Ct. 192. It may charge a royalty or license fee. But it may not exact as the condition of a license that unpatented materials used in connection with the invention shall be purchased only from the licensor; and if it does so, relief against one who supplies such unpatented materials will be denied. \n1\n The limited monopoly to make, use, and vend an article may not be 'expanded by limitations as to materials and supplies necessary to the operation of it.' Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Manufacturing Co., \n243 \nU.S. 502, 515\n, 37 S. Ct. 416, 420, L. R. A. 1917E, 1187, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 959. Compare United Shoe Machinery Corp. v. United States, \n258 \nU.S. 451, 462\n, 42 S. Ct. 363; United States v. General Electric Co., \n272 \nU.S. 46, 492\n, 47 S. Ct. 192.\n The relief here sought is indistinguishable from that denied in the Motion Picture Case. There, it was held that to permit the patent-owner to 'derive its profit, not \n\n[283 U.S. 27, 32]\n\u00a0\n from the invention on which the law gives it a monopoly, but from the unpatented supplies with which it is used' is 'wholly without the scope of the patent monopoly.' Page 517 of 243 U. S., 37 S. Ct. 416, 421. If a monopoly could be so expanded, the owner of a patent for a product might conceivably monopolize the commerce in a large part of unpatented materials used in its manufacture. The owner of a patent for a machine might thereby secure a partial monopoly on the unpatented supplies consumed in its operation. The owner of a patent for a process might secure a partial monopoly on the unpatented material employed in it. The owner of the patent in suit might conceivably secure a limited monopoly for the supplying not only of solid carbon dioxide, but also of the ice cream and other foods, as well as the cartons in which they are shipped. \n2\n The attempt to limit the licensee to the use of unpatented materials purchased from the licensor is comparable to the attempt of a patentee to fix the price at which the patented article may be resold. Bauer & Cie v. O'Donnell, \n229 \nU.S. 1\n, 33 S. Ct. 616, 50 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1185, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 150; Straus v. Victor Talking Machine Co., \n243 \nU.S. 490\n, 37 S. Ct. 412, L. R. A. 1917E, 1196, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 955; Boston Store v. American Graphophone Co., \n246 \nU.S. 8\n, 38 S. Ct. 257, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 447. Compare Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, \n210 \nU.S. 339\n, 28 S. Ct. 722. In both classes of cases, courts deny relief against those who disregard the limitations sought to be imposed by the patentee beyond the legitimate scope of its monopoly. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[283 U.S. 27, 33]\n\u00a0\n Plaintiffs seek to distinguish the Motion Picture Case from that at bar, by pointing out that there, as in Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., \n224 \nU.S. 1\n, 32 S. Ct. 364, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 880, the unpatented supplies, over which the licensor sought to extend its monopoly, were merely used in the patented machines, whereas here the unpatented refrigerant is one of the necessary elements of the patented product. And to distinguish the case at bar from Morgan Envelope Co. v. Albany Perforated Wrapping Paper Co., \n152 \nU.S. 425, 433\n, 14 S. Ct. 627, it is pointed out that the Carbice Corporation is furnishing not a passive element in the combination, like the paper in the Morgan Envelope fixture, but the dynamic element which produces refrigeration. These distinctions are without legal significance. Infringement, whether direct or contributory, is essentially a tort, and implies invasion of some right of the patentee. Compare Moore v. Marsh, 7 Wall. 515, 520; Root v. Railway Co., \n105 U.S. 189\n, 214. The Dry Ice Corporation has no right to be free from competition in the sale of solid carbon dioxide. Control over the supply of such unpatented material is beyond the scope of the patentee's monopoly; and this limitation, inherent in the patent grant, is not dependent upon the peculiar function or character of the unpatented material or on the way in which it is used. Relief is denied because the Dry Ice Corporation is attempting, without sanction of law, to employ the patent to secure a limited \n\n[283 U.S. 27, 34]\n\u00a0\n monopoly of unpatented material used in applying the invention. The present attempt is analogous to the use of a patent as an instrument for restraining commerce which was condemned, under the Sherman Anti-Trust Law, in Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 20\n, 33 S. Ct. 9.4\n The case at bar is wholly unlike Leeds & Catlin v. Victor Talking Machine Co., \n213 \nU.S. 325, 333\n, 29 S. Ct. 503, on which plaintiffs rely. That was an ordinary case of contributory infringement. The Victor Company sold machines embodying a patent for a combination. Leeds & Catlin were held to be infringers because the intended incorporation in the Victor machines of the article which they sold, did not constitute a repair of the machine and hence was not within the license implied on sale. Heyer v. Duplicator Mfg. Co., \n263 \nU.S. 100\n, 44 S. Ct. 31. There was no suggestion that the Victor Company which itself manufactured and sold the patented product, sought 'to derive its profits, not from the invention on which the law gives it a monopoly, but from the unpatented supplies with which it is used.' In the case at bar the plaintiffs neither sell nor license others to sell complete transportation packages. They supply merely one of the several materials entering into the combination; and on that \n\n[283 U.S. 27, 35]\n\u00a0\n commodity they have not been granted a monopoly. Their attempt to secure one cannot be sanctioned. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In England the insertion of such a requirement in any license agreement is a complete defense to any defendant charged with infringement. See Patents and Designs Act (1907) 7 Edw. VII, c. 29,  38, as amended by ( 1919) 9 & 10 Geo. V, c. 80,  20, Sched. 38; Sarason v. Fre nay (1914) 2Ch. 474; Huntoon Co. v. Kolynos, (Inc.), (1930) 1 Ch.

In this country the patent statutes similarly provide that an unreasonable delay in formally disavowing patent claims held invalid, and the consequent maintenance of a broader monopoly than warranted, is a complete defense to all infringers, even as to remaining valid claims.

A patent covering an essential instrumentality does not enable a patentee or its licensee thereby to abridge its obligations as a public utility; the exclusive right to license use of the invention cannot be so exercised.

S. Code, title 45, chap. 2 (45 USCA  51-59)), William Kuhn suffered serious injury. Thereafter he sued the company for damages in the court of common pleas, Pike county, Ohio. He alleged that the accident resulted from its negligence in the following matters: Ordering him to use a defective sledge hammer and chisel; failing to promulgate and enforce proper rules concerning the upkeep of tools ordinarily used, to furnish guards or goggles for workmen's eyes, to provide a reasonably safe place for him to work.\n The Company denied negligence. It also set up in defense that the plaintiff voluntarily assumed the risk incident to his employment. At the trial it duly, but unsuccessfully, requested a directed verdict because of such assumption.\n The jury returned a verdict for the respondent. Judgment upon this was affirmed by the Court of Appeals; the Supreme Court denied a review. This Court allowed writs of certiorari both to the Supreme Court, No. 34, \n\n[284 U.S. 44, 46]\n\u00a0\n and the Court of Appeals, No. 35. The cause is properly here on the latter writ. No. 34 will be dismissed.\n On the day of the accident, February 9, 1926, William Kuhn, an experienced section hand 54 years old, was engaged with others in repairing a side track leading from petitioner's main line to a steam shovel. It became necessary to remove two steel rails and shorten them some six or eight inches. They were first laid on the ground and then cut with a cold chisel. One man held the chisel while respondent and two others, acting in turn, struck it with a heavy hammer. None of them wore goggles; none asked for goggles or objected to the method of operation. The first rail had been severed; work had begun on the second. While respondent was standing by awaiting his turn to strike, a steel chip from the chisel or rail struck and destoryed his eye. On other occasions he had assisted in cutting steel rails when goggles were used and he knew chips would fly during such an operation. 'That was the value of goggles,' he testified. He understood the dangers incident to the undertaking. The job was a hurry-up one. The assistant foreman in charge had told the men 'to gang up and go in a hurry, that he wanted to get through there.' 'Don't be afraid.'\n We think the evidence clearly discloses that Kuhn's injury resulted from the ordinary hazards of his employment, which he fully understood, and voluntarily assumed. There was no complaint, no promise by his superior to mitigate the obvious dangers. The trial judge should have directed a verdict for the railway company.\n In cases like this, where damages are claimed under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59), defense of the assumption of the risk is permissible and where the undisputed evidence clearly shows such assumption the trial judge should direct a verdict for the defendant. Moreover, in proceedings under that act, wherever brought, the rights and obligations of the parties depend upon it \n\n[284 U.S. 44, 47]\n\u00a0\n and applicable principles of common law as interpreted and applied in the federal courts.

MARTIN(1931)\nNo. 155\nArgued: March 4, 1931Decided: April 13, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 209, 210]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Meade T. Spicer, Jr., and Walter Leake, both of Richmond, Va., for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought by the respondents against petitioner in a state court to recover damages for the 'misdelivery' of a carload of potatoes transported on a through bill of lading in interstate commerce. On November 6, 1925, the shipment was initiated in Michigan by another carrier, and transferred to the petitioner for final transportation to, and delivery in, Richmond, Va. Respondents had arranged for the storage of potatoes with the Bowman Transfer Company in Richmond, and petitioner had been notified that all potatoes billed to respondents were to be delivered at the warehouse of that company. The potatoes arrived at petitioner's yards in \n\n[283 U.S. 209, 211]\n\u00a0\n Richmond six days after shipment from Michigan, and four days later ( November 16th) were inspected by respondents, who thereupon paid all freight and demurrage charges and became entitled to delivery. To make delivery to the Bowman warehouse, it first was necessary to transfer the car of potatoes to the Southern Railway; and the usual time required for the entire movement was not more than forty-eight hours. Petitioner, on November 17th, transferred the car to the Southern Railway, but by mistake directed that delivery be made to the warehouse of D. S. Harwood, where the car was unloaded and the potatoes were stored in the belief that they belonged to a customer of Harwood. The smae day the Bowman Company mailed to respondents a warehouse receipt acknowledging the receipt and storage of the potatoes in the warehouse of that company; but a month later advised respondents by letter that the receipt had been issued in error, and that the car had been taken to the warehouse of D. S. Harwood. Notwithstanding this letter, respondents visited the Bowman warehouse, and upon inquiry concluded that the potatoes were there. The made no inquiry of the petitioner or at the Harwood warehouse. Harwood did not know the respondents or suspect that they were the owners of the potatoes until May 10, 1926, at which time he informed them that he had the car. The respondents then identified the potatoes, found them in a spoiled condition, sold them for a small sum, and brought this action. No notice of loss was given or claim for damages made until May 26, 1926, a period of six months and twenty days after the shipment from Michigan.\n The bill of lading contains the following provision:\n'Claims for loss, damage, or injury to property must be made in writing to the originating or delivering carrier or carriers issuing this bill of lading within six months after delivery of the property ( or, in case of export traffic, within nine months after delivery at port of export), or \n\n[283 U.S. 209, 212]\n\u00a0\n in case of failure to make delivery, then within six months (or nine months in case of export traffic) after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; provided that if such loss, damage or injury was due to delay or damage while being loaded or unloaded, or damaged in transit by carelessness or negligence, then no notice of claim nor filing of claim shall be required as a condition precedent to recovery.'\n\n Petitioner's freight agent testified that a reasonale t ime after shipment for delivery of the potatoes to the consignee in Richmond would be about eight days, and that, if any longer time were taken, it would be considered a delayed movement. There was no eivdence to the contrary.\n At the conclusion of respondents' case in rebuttal, petitioner demurred to the evidence upon the ground that the action was barred by the provision of the bill of lading requiring claims for loss or damage in case of failure to make delivery to be made 'within six months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed.' The demurrer was overruled and judgment entered against petitioner upon verdict for the sum of $1684.39. The trial court said that the testimony of the freight agent was no part of the plaintiffs' case; that the misdelivery was made through his office; that, although unimpeached, the jury would not be bound to accept the evidence of the agent as conclusive; and, consequently, that the court was obliged to disregard it and overrule the demurrer of the evidence. The judgment was affirmed on appeal. 143 S. E. 629; 152 S. E. 335.\n The provision of the bill of lading that claim for loss in case of failure to deliver must be made within six months after the lapse of a reasonable time for delivery is authorized by federal statute,1 and is valid and appli- \n\n[283 U.S. 209, 213]\n\u00a0\n cable, Georgia, Fla. & Fla. Ry. v. Blish Co., \n241 \nU.S. 190, 197\n, 36 S. Ct. 541; and, since it was issued in respect of an interstate shipment pursuant to an act of Congress, the bill of lading is an instrumentality of such commerce, and the question whether its provisions have been complied with is a federal question to be determined by the application of federal law.

Ct. 462.\n The state Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment on the grounds that the evidence was sufficient to show compliance on the part of respondents with the requirement of the bill of lading in respect of the time for making claim; and that, in any event, the petitioner was estopped from asserting noncompliance with that requirement. We are of opinion that neither ground is tenable.\n First. Since the claim for loss was not made until the expiration of six months and twenty days after the shipment, the first ground resolves itself into the question whether twenty days was a reasonable time for the delivery of the car to the consignee. What constitutes a reasonable time depends upon the circumstances of the particular case. As applied to a case like this, it means such time as is necessary conveniently to transport and make delivery of the shipment in the ordinary course of business, in the light of the circumstances and conditions surrounding the transaction.

In ruling upon either, the court must resolve all conflicts in the evidence against the defendant; but is bound to sustain the demur- \n\n[283 U.S. 209, 214]\n\u00a0\n rer or grant the motion, as the case may be, whenever the facts established and the conclusions which they reasonably justify are legally insufficient to serve as the foundation for a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.

And, in the consideration of the question, the court, as will be shown, is not at liberty to disregard the testimony of a witness on the ground that he is an employee of the defendant, in the absence of conflicting proof or of circumstances justifying countervailing inferences or suggesting doubt as to the truth of his statement, unless the evidence be of such a nature as fairly to be open to challenge as suspicious or inherently improbable. The agent at petitioner's freight office in Richmond, shown by twenty years' experience to be qualified to speak, testified, in part, as follows:\n'Q. Mr. Neiss, the bill of lading issued covering this car shows it was consigned from Wyman, Michigan, on November 6th, and the yard records at Fulton show it arrived there on November 12th. Are you in a position to say whether or not that was a reasonable movement?\n\n'A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. Would you say it was a reasonable movement?\n\n'A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. Have you had occasion in the course of your experience to handle in-bound shipments?\n\n'A. About twenty years.\n\n'Q. During the course of that time have you become in a general way familiar with the time required for movements of like character as this?\n\n'A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. What would you say would be a reasonable time for shipment and delivery to a consignee at Richmond of a car under those circumstances from that point?\n\n'A. About eight days.\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 209, 215]\n\u00a0\n 'Q. Would anything beyond that be considered a delayed movement?\n'A. Well, yes, sir; I think it would.\n\n'Q. Mr. Neiss, Mr. Martin has testified that freight was paid on this car the morning of November 16th, and order given for disposition to the Bowman Warehouse. Are you in a position to state how long it would take the C. & O. to have that order carried out to the extent of having the car sent to the interchange track?\n\n'A. Well, if we give the order to the yard any time up to 4 o'clock in the afternoon, it is usually moved up to 5:15.\n\n'Q. The same day?\n\n'A. Yes, sir; same day.\n\n'Q. Suppose the order is given after 4 o'clock or received after 4 o'clock, at Fulton yards?\n\n'A. It is laid over until next morning between 9 and 1 o'clock.\n\n'Q. So that the time required for the carrying out of that order by the C. & O. would be less than 24 hours?\n\n'A. Yes, sir.'\n\n It sufficiently appears that the time reasonably necessary for completion of delivery to the Bowman warehouse after the receipt of the shipment at petitioner's yards would, in no event, exceed forty-eight hours.\n Not only is the estimate of the agent reasonable upon its face and in accordance with probability; and not only is it wholly unchallenged by other evidence or circumstances; but it is so completely corroborated by the undisputed facts in respect of this very shipment as to put it beyond the reach of a fair doubt. The movement of the car from the point of origin to the yards of petitioner in Richmond actually was made in six days; and, if there be added full forty-eight hours thereafter for completing delivery to the Bowman warehouse, the testimony of the agent as to time stands verified by indubitable test. In \n\n[283 U.S. 209, 216]\n\u00a0\n the face of this record, the conclusion of the court that it was still open for the jury to say that not eight days merely, but twenty days, fell short of being a reasonable time for delivery, is so clearly erroneous as to cause the ruling of the court, in effect, to rest upon nothing more substantial than the power of a jury arbitrarily to disregard established facts.\n We recognize the general rule, of course, as stated by both courts below, that the question of the credibility of witnesses is one for the jury alone; but this does not mean that the jury is at liberty, under the guise of passing upon the credibility of a witness, to disregard his testimony, when from no reasonable point of view is it open to doubt. The complete testimony of th age nt in this case appears in the record. A reading of it discloses no lack of candor on his part. It was not shaken by cross-examination; indeed, upon this point, there was no cross- examination. Its accuracy was not controverted by proof or circumstances, directly or inferentially; and it is difficult to see why, if inaccurate, it readily could not have been shown to be so. The witness was not impeached; and there is nothing in the record which reflects unfavorably upon his credibility. The only possible ground for submitting the question to the jury as one of fact was that the witness was an employee of the petitioner. In the circumstances above detailed, we are of opinion that this was not enough to take the question to the jury, and that the court should have so held.\n It is true that numerous expressions are to be found in the decisions to the effect that the credibility of an interested witness always must be submitted to the jury, and that that body is at liberty to reject his testimony upon the sole ground of his interest. But these broad generalizations cannot be accepted without qualification. Such a variety of differing facts, however, is disclosed by the cases that no useful purpose would be served by an attempt to review them. In many, if not most, of them, there \n\n[283 U.S. 209, 217]\n\u00a0\n were circumstances tending to cast suspicion upon the testimony or upon the witness, apart from the fact that he was interested. We have been unable to find any decision enforcing such a rule where the facts and circumstances were comparable to those here disclosed. Applied to such facts and circumstances, the rule, by the clear weight of authority, is definitely to the contrary. Hauss v. Lake Erie & W. R. Co. (C. C. A.) 105 F. 733; Illinois Cent. R. Co. v.

Of like effect, although in a different connection, see also, Roberts v. Chicago City, Ry. Co., 262 Ill. 228, 232, 104 N. E. 708; Veatch v. State, 56 Ind. 584, 587, 26 Am.

Littauer, supra, the doctrine that the question of credibility of a witness must be submitted to the jury was held to be not an inflexible one, even though such witness be a party to the action. In that case the defendants moved for direction of a verdict in their favor, which was resisted by plaintiff on the ground that the proof upon which the motion was based rested upon the evidence of interested parties. The court, nevertheless, sustained the motion. On appeal, the state Court of Appeals affirmed this judgment, saying (page 572 of 162 N. Y., 57 N. E. 102):\n'It is true that the evidence to establish the entirety of the contract was given by the defendants, but the rule which the plaintiff invokes is not applicable to such a case \n\n[283 U.S. 209, 218]\n\u00a0\n as this. Generally, the credibility of a witness who is a party to the action, and therefore interested in its result, is for the jury; but this rule, being founded in reason, is not an absolute and inflexible one. If the evidence is possible of contradiction in the circumstances; if its truthfulness or accuracy is open to a reasonable doubt upon the facts of the case, and the interest of the witness furnishes a proper ground for hesitating to accept his statements,-it is a necessary and just rule that the jury should pass upon it. Where, however, the evidence of a party to the actin is not contradicted by direct evidence, nor by any legitimate inferences from the evidence, and it is not opposed to the probabilities, nor, in its nature, surprising or suspicious, there is no reason for denying to it conclusiveness. Though a party to an action has been enabled, since the legislation of 1857 (chapter 353, Laws 1857), to testify as a witness, his evidence is not to be regarded as that of a disinterested person, and whether it should be accepted without question depends upon the situation as developed by the facts and circumstances and the attitude of his adversary. In Lomer v. Meeker, 25 N. Y. 361, where the defense to an action upon a promissory note was usury, and the indorser gave the evidence to establish it without contradiction, it was said that 'it was the duty of the court in such case to dismiss the complaint, or nonsuit the plaintiff, or direct a verdict for the defendants. It is a mistake to suppose that, because the evidence came from the defendant, after the plaintiff had rested, the case must go to the jury. ... The argument is that this could not properly be done, because there was a question of credibility raised in respect to the witness Bock, who proved the usury. But this objection is untenable. The witness was not impeached or contradicted. His testimony is positive and direct, and not incredible upon its face. It was the duty of the court and jury to give credit to his testimony.' More recently, in Kelly v. Burroughs, \n\n[283 U.S. 209, 219]\n\u00a0\n 102 N. Y. 93, 6 N. E. 109, Judge Danforth, after observing that, as the facts were not disputed, there was no occasion to present them to the jury, said 'the mere fact that the plaintiff, who testified to important particulars, was interested, was unimportant in view of the fact that there was no conflict in the evidence, or any thing or circumstance from which an inference against the fact testified to by him could be drawn.\"\n\n In Hauss v. Lake Erie & W. R. Co., supra, a direction of the trial judge to find for the defendant was sustained, although the motion rested upon the testimony of the conductor of the train. The court put aside the objection that the witness was an employee of the defendant and had an interest to show that he had performed his duty and a motive falsely to represent that he had done so, saying (page 735 of 105 F.):\n'The testimony of the witness was not contradicted by that of any other witness, nor was it brought in question by the cross- examination nor by the admitted facts of the case; and, outside of the suggested interest and motive, there is not a fact or circumstance in the case which tends to raise a doubt as to the truth of his testimony.'\n\n And, at page 736 of 105 F.:\n'... Nor do the facts and circumstances of the case justify an impeaching presumption against the credibility of the witness, founded upon his mere relation to the parties and to the subject- matter of the controversy, which should overcome the counter presumption that, as an uncontradicted witness, testifying under oath, he spoke the truth.'\n\n In M. H. Thomas & Co. v. Hawthorne, supra, at page 972 of 245 S. W., the rule is thus stated:\n'A jury cannot arbitrarily discredit a witness and disregard his testimony in the absence of any equivocation, confusion, or aberration in it. It is not proper to submit uncontradicted testimony to a jury for the sole purpose of \n\n[283 U.S. 209, 220]\n\u00a0\n giving the jury an opportunity to nullify it by discrediting the witness, when nothing more than mere interest in the case exists upon which to discredit such witness. The testimony must inherently contain some element of confusion or contrariety, or must be attended by some circumstance which would render a total disregard of it by a jury reasonable rather than capricious, before a peremptory instruction upon the evidence can be said to constitute an invasion of the right of trial by jury. That it is proper for a trial court to instruct a verdict upon the uncontradicted testimony of interested parties, when it is positive and unequivocal and there is no circumstance discloed t ending to discredit or impeach such testimony, can be said to be a settled rule in Texas.'\n\n Second. The estoppel relied upon seems to be that, since petitioner negligently delivered the shipment to the Harwood warehouse, instead of to the Bowman warehouse, and respondents made claim for the loss promptly after discovering the negligent misdelivery, petitioner may not be heard to complain that the claim was not made at an earlier day. The court below said (143 S. E. 629, 630):\n'Whatever may be the decisions of the court elsewhere, we are of the opinion that the doctrine laid down in Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. Rebman & Clark, 120 Va. 71, 90 S. E. 629, should be adhered to,'\n\n -and then quoted from that case the following:\n\"If it be conceded that plaintiffs were under obligation to give notice of their demand under the circumstances of this anomalous transaction, the evidence shows that such notice was given without delay as soon as the negligence of the ... defendant which occasioned the loss was discovered.\"\n\n But the vice of this position is that, in following its own prior decision, the court ignored the decision of this court to the contrary. This lawfully it could not do; the ques- \n\n[283 U.S. 209, 221]\n\u00a0\n tion, as we have shown, being a federal question to be determined by the application of federal law. The determination by this court of that question is binding upon the state courts, and must be followed, any state law, decision, or rule to the contrary notwithstanding. And it was distinctly held by this court in Georgia, Fla. & Ala. Ry. v. Blish Co., supra, page 197 of 241 U. S., 36 S. Ct. 541, 544, that the parties to a contract of interstate shipment by rail, made pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act, could not waive its terms; 'nor could the carrier by its conduct give the shipper the right to ignore these terms which were applicable to that conduct, and hold the carrier to a different responsibility from that fixed by the agreement made under the published tariffs and regulations. A different view would antagonize the plain policy of the act and open the door to the very abuses at which the act was aimed.' The provision of the bill of lading involved there was identical with that here under consideration; and there, as here, the delivery was to another in violation of instructions. The Blish Company insisted that the phrase 'failure to make delivery' did not cover a case of misdelivery, but this court said (page 195 of 241 U. S., 36 S. Ct. 541, 543):\n'The clause with respect to the notice of claims-upon which the plaintiff in error relies in its second contention-specifically covers 'failure to make delivery.' It is said that this is not to be deemed to include a case where there was not only failure to deliver to the consignee, but actual delivery to another, or delivery in violation of instructions. But 'delivery' must mean delivery as required by the contract, and the terms of the stipulation are comprehensive-fully adequate in their literal and natural meaning to cover all cases where the delivery has not been made as required. When the goods have been misdelivered there is as clearly a 'failure to make delivery' as when the goods have been lost or destroyed; and it is quite as competent in the one case as in the other \n\n[283 U.S. 209, 222]\n\u00a0\n for the parties to agree upon reasonable notice of the claim as a condition of liability.'\n\n Other state courts have correctly interpreted the decision of this court in that case as applying to a situation like the one here presented, and have followed it, although in some instances their prior decisions had been to the contrary. See, among others, Bronstein v. Payne, 138 Md. 116, 120, 113 A. 648; Metz Co. v. Boston & Maine Railroad, 227 Mass. 307, 116 N. E. 475. Indeed, the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia itself, in Davis v. Rodgers, 139 Va. 618, 625, 124 S. E. 408, seems to have taken the same view.\n It is held by his court that the shipper may not invoke the doctrine of estoppel against the right to collect the legal rate, because to do so wuld be to avoid the requirement of the law as to equal rates. Pittsburgh, etc., Ry. Co. v. Fink, \n250 \nU.S. 577, 582\n, 40 S. Ct. 27; L . & N. R. R. v. Central Iron Co., \n265 \nU.S. 59, 65\n, 44 S. Ct. 441, and cases cited. These decisions lend support to our conclusion in respect of the matter here. Whether under any circumstances the shipper may rely upon that doctrine in avoidance of the time limitation clause of the bill of lading, we need not now determine. But the Blish Company Case makes clear that the fact that delivery was made contrary to instructions, due to the misunderstanding or negligence of the carrier, cannot successfully be set up as an estoppel against the claim of a failure to comply with the requirement of the bill of lading here involved. To allow it would be to alter the terms of a contract, made in pursuance of the Interstate Commerce Act and having, in effect, the quality of a statute of limitation, and thus to open the door for evasions of the spirit and purpose of the act to prevent preferences and discrimination in respect of rates and service.

Code,  47 ( 28 USCA  47) against the United States. the Guyandot & Tug River Railroad Company and the Norfolk & Western Railway Company. The former is a subsidiary of the latter and both may be called the Norfolk. The Interstate Commerce Commission appeared as a defendant. Title 28 U. S. Code,  45a (28 USCA  45a). The purpose of the suit was to set aside and annul so much of an order and certificate of the Commission entered and issued July 23, 1928 (145 I. C. C. 167, 188, 193) and so much of subsequent orders in the same proceeding as authorize the Norfolk to construct and operate a line of railroad in West Virginia from Gilbert about 10 1\/2 miles to Wharncliffe. The case was tried before three judges. A condensed statement of the evidence and exhibits before the Commission was submitted to the court. After hearing argument for the respective parties, the court entered its decree denying plaintiff any relief and dismissing the bill. (D. C.) 35 F.(2d) 769.\n May 7, 1925, the Chesapeake filed its application for a certificate that the present and future public convenience and necessity require the construction by it of an extension of its Logan subdivision from Gilbert easterly 47.3 miles to Mullens and an extension of its Winding Gulf line from Stone Coal westerly 8.2 miles to Mullens. On October 29, \n\n[283 U.S. 35, 37]\n\u00a0\n 1925, the Guyandot Company filed its application for a similar certificate for the construction of a line of railroad extending from a connection with the Virginian Railway at Elmore westerly 53 miles to Wharncliffe. The Norfolk and the Virginian joined in this application. An amended application was filed December 24, 1925, by the Guyandot which was joined in by the Norfolk alone. January 21, 1927, the Virginian & Western Railway, a subsidiary of the Virginian Railway Company-both may be referred to as the Virginian-ile d its application for a like certificate for the construction of a line extending from a connection with the Guyandot branch of the Virginian at Ittman down that river 40.6 miles to a connection with the Chesapeake at Gilbert. This application was joined in by the Virginian Railway Company.\n The locations of all the proposed lines between Gilbert and Mullens, Elmore or Ittman were in the narrow valley traversed by the Guyandot river. Authority to build the line between Gilbert and Wharncliffe was sought only by the Norfolk. The three applications were considered at the same hearing. The Virginian supported the Norfolk's application for the Gilbert- Wharncliffe connection. The Chesapeake opposed. All the applications were disposed of by the same report and order.\n The Commission granted to the Virginian permission to construct its line in the Guyandot valley from Ittman to Gilbert and to the Norfolk leave to build between Gilbert and Wharncliffe. It denied the rest of the application of the Norfolk and that of the Chesapeake in toto.\n The appellant seeks reversal upon the claim that neither the findings of the Commission nor the evidence affords any support for the order and that the record shows the construction of the proposed line between Gilbert and Wharncliffe to be contrary to the public interest and to have been authorized under an erroneous theory of the applicable law. It says that the only finding of the Com- \n\n[283 U.S. 35, 38]\n\u00a0\n mission that supports the order is that the construction of the line will enable the Norfolk to compete with the Chesapeake for westbound traffic moving over the Virginian from the Guyandot valley and will assure the coal operators on the Virginian competitive service to the west. And it maintains that the Commission is not authorized by the Act to grant a certificate of public convenience and necessity for new construction upon a naked finding that competition between carriers and competitive service to shippers will result.\n The situation, as disclosed by the report and the undisputed evidence, is as follows:\n That part of West Virginia which is south of the Kanawha and New rivers contains vast deposits of coal and has many mines in operation. The Chesapeake, the Norfolk and the Virginian are the only railroads of importance in the district. The eastern terminus of the Chesapeake is at Newport News. It serves mines immediately south of these rivers. It has lines extending to the west where it has connections at Cincinnati, Columbus, Chicago and elsewhere on the Great Lakes. The eastern termini of the other carriers are at Norfolk. The lines of the Norfolk through the coal district are in the valleys of the Tug and Big Sandy considerably to the south of the lines of the Chesapeake and separated from them by a range of mountains extending from near Matoaka 150 miles or more northwesterly where it ends not far from Huntington on the Ohio. The Norfolk's main line crosses that of the Chesapeake at Kenova on the south side of the Ohio some distance below Huntington and extends to the west where it has connections at Cincinnati and Columbus. The Virginian has main and branch lines in the easterly part of these coal fields but it has no line to the west. It connects with the Chesapeake at Deepwater, a station on the Kanawha, and with the Norfolk at Matoaka which is a little over the divide south of the valley of the Guyandot. \n\n[283 U.S. 35, 39]\n\u00a0\n These railroads have long been competing carriers of coal from that district. The tonnage controlled by the Virginian is about one-seventh of that of the Norfolk and that of the latter is about 60 per cent. of that of the Chesapeake. In 1927, 47 Coal mines were served by the Virginian alone. These are called local mines. And 55 were served by it and also by the Chesapeake. These are called joint mines. Such local and joint mines during the first nine months of that year produced and shipped coal via the Virginian at the rate of more than 12,000,000 tons per annum. And in that period the Virginian handed over to the Chesapeake at Deepwater andto the Norfolk at Matoaka coal for transportation to the west at the rate of more than 4,270,000 tons per annum, 80 per cent. of which moved via Matoaka.\n Some years prior to the Virginian's application to build the proposed line the Commission required it to establish joint rates and through routes to the west via Deepwater, the Chesapeake and its connections, and also via Matoaka, the Norfolk and its connections. \n1\n The orders in that case covered only rates from a few specific origins on the Virginian. But the Chesapeake and the Virginian voluntarily established joint rates via Deepwater from all local mines on the Virginian and from such of the joint mines as were located between destinations and a local mine. The Chesapeake refused to establish rates from joint mines which were not intermediate because that would operate to short-haul itself. Similar joint rates were voluntarily established by the Virginian and Norfolk via Matoaka from all local and joint mines served by the Virginian.\n The Chesapeake and the Norfolk are active competitors for transportation of coal originating on the Virginian and destined to the west. The line of the Virginian between its principal coal territory and Deepwater crosses three \n\n[283 U.S. 35, 40]\n\u00a0\n summits with heavy adverse grades against the loaded movement and heavier ones against the return movement. The Virginian's line to Matoaka has heavier adverse grades against the loaded movement than on its line to Deepwater. And on that route difficult grades are encountered on the Norfolk.\n The line to be built by the Virginian down the Guyandot will have substantially no grades adverse to western movement. The Logan subdivision of the Chesapeake is a well-located low grade line along the lower stretches of that river, and it has capacity to handle efficiently all the west-bound traffic originating on the Virginian. The route to the west down the river to Gillbert and over the divide to Wharncliffe is 41 miles shorter than the route via Matoaka. The line to be built across the divide will have an adverse grade that will require doubling. But both of the proposed new routes will be better than either of the existing ones. The Chesapeake estimates that the cost per ton of handling coal over the new route via Gilbert and its Logan subdivision will be 1.69 cents per ton less than the cost via the Gilbert-Wharncliffe route. The Norfolk estimates that cost via the latter will be 14 cents per ton less than via the present Matoaka route. The Norfolk through a subsidiary controls large deposits of coal in the valley tributary to the new line of the Virginian. And there is a considerable deposit of coal that may be made tributary to the proposed Gilbert-Wharncliffe line.\n There is need for a line to connect the railways on the upper Guyandot with the Logan subdivision of the Chesapeake in the lower valley. Its main functions will be to provide a suitable outlet for westbound traffic, chiefly coal, from the lines of the Virginian and the Chesapeake in the upper valley and to carry the large tonnage of coal and lumber that may be developed tributary to the new line. The construction of the Gilbert-Wharn- \n\n[283 U.S. 35, 41]\n\u00a0\n cliffe line will enable the Norfolk to compete with the Chesapeake for westbound traffic originating on the Virginian and will give the latter greater independence in respect of such shipments.\n The construction of the line of the Virginian from the upper Guyandot to a connection with the Chesapeake at Gilbert would immensely improve the position of the latter in respect of the westbound movement of coal originating on the Virginian. It is also plain, indeed so obvious as scarcely to require statement, that the construction of the Gilbert- Wharncliffe connection is necessary in order to enable the Norfolk to continue, on conditions that are tolerable, to compete with the Chesapeake for that traffic. The constrcti on of that connection cannot reasonably be regarded as an intrusion by the Norfolk into territory already being well- served by the Chesapeake. On the contrary the Norfolk already hauls about four-fifths of the Virginian's westbound coal. By this relatively short connection, it will be able to give a better outlet for that traffic, to make substantial saving in the cost of handling, and to remain in position, at relatively slight disadvantage, to compete for traffic in which it long has had a large share. And shippers will have the benefit of such competitive service.\n But the Chesapeake insists that under the Transportation Act the Commission may not authorize new construction for the purpose of continuing such competition.\n The Act cannot reasonably be so construed.\n Section 1(18) provides (title 49, U. S. Code, 49 USCA  1(18):\n'No carrier by railroad ... shall undertake the extension of its line of railroad, or the construction of a new line of railroad, ... unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require the ... construction and operation, of such additional or extended line of railroad. ...' \n\n[283 U.S. 35, 42]\n\u00a0\n Section 1(20) provides:\n\n'The commission shall have power to issue such certificate as prayed for, or to refuse to issue it, or to issue it for a portion ... of a line of railroad, or extension thereof described in the application ... and may attach to the issuance of the certificate such terms and conditions as in its judgment the public convenience and necessity may require. ...'\n\n There is no specification of the considerations by which the Commission is to be governed in determining whether the public convenience and necessity require the proposed construction. Under the Act it was the duty of the Commission to find the facts and, in the exercise of a reasonable judgment, to determine that question. Texas & Pac. Ry. Co. v. Gulf, etc., Ry. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266, 273\n, 46 S. Ct. 263.\n Undoubtedly the purpose of these provisions is to enable the Commission, in the interest of the public, to prevent improvident and unnecessary expenditures for the construction and operation of lines not needed to insure adequate service. In the absence of a plain declaration to that effect, it would be unreasonable to hold that Congress did not intend to empower the Commission to authorize construction of new lines to provide for shippers such competing service as it should find to be convenient or necessary in the public interest. Indeed section 5(4) of the Act (49 USCA  5(4), authorizing the Commission to adopt a plan for the consolidation of railway properties into a limited number of systems, clearly discloses a policy on the part of Congress to preserve competition among carriers. It provides: 'In the division of such railways into such systems under such plan, competition shall be preserved as fully as possible and wherever practicable the existing routes and channels of trade and commerce shall be maintained.' And the Commission has recognized the advantages of competitive service to shippers especially in respect of a \n\n[283 U.S. 35, 43]\n\u00a0\n diversified car supply for the shipment of coal and lumber; it suggests the possibility of failure of operation from various causes, that under some circumstances competition operates to stimulate better service and that reasonable competition may be in the public interest.

Wilcox, all of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Joseph D. Ryan, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the court.\n Petitioner is a common carrier by railroad engaged in the interstate and intrastate transportation of passengers and freight. Respondent was employed by petitioner to \n\n[284 U.S. 74, 76]\n\u00a0\n fire a stationary engine which was utilized to generate steam for the purpose of heating the passenger depot, baggageroom, and other structures and rooms used for general railroad purposes at Waukegan, Ill. The steam was also used to heat suburban passenger coaches while standing in the yards. Some of these coaches, taken off of interstate trains moving out of Chicago, were heated when necessary before being taken up by other interstate trains to be carried back. A way car and bunk cars, converted into stationary structures and occupied by some of the employees engaged in the track maintenance and bridge and building departments, were likewise heated; and sometimes steam was used to prevent freezing of a turntable used for turning engines employed both in interstate and intrastate traffic.\n On the occasion in question, the stationary engine was temporarily out of order, and, in accordance with the usual practice, respondent had been making use of a locomotive engine as a substitute. While thus employed, he was directed to accompany this locomotive engine to a place about four miles distant to obtain a supply of coal. For that purpose, the engine was attached to and moved with three other locomotive engines then being prepared for use in interstate transportation. While coal was being taken upon one of the locomotives, respondent was seriously injured, through what is alleged to have been the negligence of petitioner.\n The sole object of the movement of the substitute engine was to procure a supply of coal for the purpose of generating steam. Its movement was in no way related to the contemplated employment of the other three locomotives in interstate transportation; and its use differed in no way from the use of the stationary engine when that was available.\n There is evidence that respondent, at other times, had been engaged in supplying other engines with coal and \n\n[284 U.S. 74, 77]\n\u00a0\n water, firing live engines, and turning a turntable; but his employment at the time of the injury was confined to firing the stationary or locomotive engine for the sole purpose of producing steam. The character of the work which he did at other times, therefore, becomes immaterial. Shanks v. Delaware, Lack. & West. R. Co., \n239 \nU.S. 556, 558\n, 36 S. Ct. 188, L. R. A. 1916C, 797; Chicago, Burlington & Q. R. Co. v. Harrington, \n241 \nU.S. 177, 179\n, 36 S. Ct. 517.\n The action was brought under the Federal Employer's Liability Act (c. 149, 35 Stat. 65, as amended in 1910, title 45, c. 2, U. S. C. (45 USCA  51-59)) to recover damages for the injury. There have been three trials of the case. In the first, the verdict and judgment was for the respondent, which upon appeal was reversed by the intermediate Appellate Court, upon the ground that the evidence failed to show that respondent was engaged in interstate commerce when injured. 235 Ill. App. 380. This judgment of the Appellate Court was reversed by the Supreme Court. 324 Ill. 479, 155 N. E. 287. After remand, there was another trial resulting in a directed verdict and judgment for petitioner; and this judgment the Appellate Court, following the decision of the Supreme Court of the state, reversed. 251 Ill. App. 623. Upon the third trial, judgment upon a verdict was entered in favor of the respondent. This the Appellate Court affirmed, 258 Ill. App. 545, and the Supreme Court refused certiorari to review the cause.\n The Appellate Court, in holding upon the first appeal that respondent was not engaged in interstate commerce, applied the rule laid down in the Shanks Case, supra; and, in so doing, was clearly right.\n The railroad company which was sued in the Shanks Case maintained a large machine shop for repairing locomotives used in both interstate and intrastate traffic. While employed in this shop, Shanks was injured through the negligence of the company. Usually he was employed in repair work, but on the occasion of the injury he was \n\n[284 U.S. 74, 78]\n\u00a0\n engaged solely in taking down, and putting into a new location, an overhead countershaft through which power was communicated to some of the machinery used in the repair work. The Employers' Liability Act,  1 (45 USCA  51) provides that 'every common carrier by railroad while engaging in commerce between any of the several States ... shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce,' if the injury be due to the negligence of the carrier, etc. This court, at page 558 of 239 U. S., 36 S. Ct. 188, 189, after quoting the words of the act, laid down the following test for determining whether the employee, in any given case, comes within them: 'Having in mind the nature and usual course of the business to which the act relates and the evident purpose of Congress in adopting the act, we think it speaks of interstate commerce, not in a technical legal sense, but in a practical one better suited to the occasion (see Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 398\n, 25 S. Ct. 276, 525), and that the true test of employment in such commerce in the sense intended is, Was the employee, at the time of the injury, engaged in interstate transportation, or in work so closely related to it as to be practically a part of it?'\n It will be observed that the word used in defining the test is 'transportation,' not the word 'commerce.' The two words were not regarded as interchangeable, but as conveying different meanings. Commerce covers the whole field of which transportation is only a part; and the word of narrower signification was chosen understandingly and deliberately as the appropriate term. The business of a railroad is not to carry on commerce generally. It is engaged in the transportation of persons and things in commerce; and hence the test of whether an employee at the time of his injury is engaged in interstate commerce, within the meaning of the act, naturally must be whether he was engaged in interstate transportation, or \n\n[284 U.S. 74, 79]\n\u00a0\n in work so closely related so such transportation as to be practically a part of it.\n Since the decision in the Shanks Case, the test there laid down has been steadily adhered to, and never intentionally departed from or otherwise stated. It is necessary to refer to only a few of the decisions. In Chicago, Burlington & Q. R. Co. v. Harrington, supra, an employee engaged in placing coal in coal chutes, thence to be supplied to locomotives engaged in interstate traffic, was held not to have met the test. In Illinois Central R. Co. v. Cousins, \n241 \nU.S. 641\n, 36 S. Ct. 446, as appears from the decision of the state court (126 Minn. 172, 148 N. W. 58), an employee was engaged in wheeling a barrow of coal to heat the shop in which other employees were at work repairing cars that had been, and were to be, used in interstate traffic. The state court held that the employee came within the act, on the ground that the work which he was doing was a part of the interstate commerce in which the carrier was engaged, and cited Pedersen v. Delaware, Lack, & West. R. Co., \n229 \nU.S. 146\n, 33 S. Ct. 648, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 153. This court, however, repudiated that view, and reversed in an opinion per curiam on the authority of the Shanks Case. In New York Central R. Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188, 192\n, 37 S. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629, it was held, applying the test of the Shanks Case, that employment in guarding tools, intended for use in the construction of a new depot and tracks to be used in interstate commerce, had no such direct relation to interstate transportation as was contemplated by the Employers' Liability Act.\n The rule announced by the Shanks Case has been categorically restated and applied also in the following cases among others: Southern Pac. Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission, \n251 \nU.S. 259, 263\n, 40 S. Ct. 130, 10 A. L. R. 1181; Industrial Commission v. Davis, \n259 \nU.S. 182, 185\n, 42 S. Ct. 489; Baltimore & O. S. W. R. Co. v. Burtch, \n263 \nU.S. 540, 543\n, 44 S. Ct. 165. The applicable test thus firmly established is not to be shaken by the one or two \n\n[284 U.S. 74, 80]\n\u00a0\n decisions of this court where, inadvertently, the word 'commerce' has been employed instead of the word 'transportation.'\n Plainly, the respondent in the present case does not bring himself within the rule. At the time of receiving his injury, he was engaged in work not incidental to transportation in interstate commerce, but purely incidental to the furnishing of means for heating the station and other structures of the company. His duty ended when he had produced a supply of steam for that purpose. He had nothing to do with its distribution or specific use. Indeed, what he produced was not used or intended to be used, directly or indirectly, in the transportation of anything. It is plain that his work was not in interstate transportation, and was not so closely related to such transportation as to cause it to be practically a part of it. Certainly that work was no more closely related to transportation than was that of the employee in the Harrington Case, who placed coal in the chutes for the use of locomotives engaged in interstate transportation; or that of the employee in the Cousins Case, who supplied coal for heating the shop in which cars used in interstate traffic were repaired. The work of the employees in those cases and that of the respondent here are, in fact, so nearly alike in their lack of necessary relationship to interstate transportation, as to be in principle the same.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","36":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO, R.

Co.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois to set aside parts of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission made in a proceeding instituted by that body on its own motion. The purpose of the proceeding was to investigate 'the rules for car-hire settlement between common carriers by railroad in the United States for the use and detention of freight cars while on the lines of carriers other than their owners, with a view of making such order or orders in the premises as may be warranted by the record.' All common carriers by railroad in the United States were made parties respondent. The Commission reopened and consolidated with the proceeding a number of cases therefore pending before it, some of which had already been \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 88]\n\u00a0\n heard and decided. Elaborate hearings were had, at which, generally, the trunk line railroads were represented by the American Railway Association, and the short lines, by the American Short Line Railroad Association. A large amount of testimony was submitted, together with several hundred exhibits. The Commission filed two reports. The first will be found in 1960 I. C. C 369-448, and the second or supplemental report in 165 I. C. C. 495.\n The original report discussed the case and concluded with nine specific findings, the first of which follows: '1. Common-carrier railroads, whether subscribers to the per diem agreement of the American Railway Association or nonsubscribers, are entitled to receive reasonable compensation in the form of a daily rental for the use of their general- service freight cars when on foreign lines, and that the present per diem charge of $1 per car day reasonably compensates car owners for average car ownership and maintenance costs. The reasonableness of this per diem rate is not questioned.'\n No order was then made, but the carriers affected were expected to conform to the findings and were left to modify their rules and practices accordingly. The carriers having failed and refused to do so, the Commission issued its supplemental report and entered an order giving effect to its findings, by which order the respondents in the proceedings before the Commission were required, on or before October 1, 1930, to cease and desist, and thereafter to abstain, from applying rules for car- hire settlements in conflict with those prescribed by the Commission's order, and were required to establish, on or before that date, and thereafter to maintain and observe, rules with respect to car-hire settlements which shall provide:\n'(1) That the same daily car rental shall be paid to common-carrier nonsubscribers as respondents contemporaneously pay to subscribers to the per diem rules agree- \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 89]\n\u00a0\n ment of the American Railway Association, for the use of general- service freight cars.\n\n'(2) That similar reclaim allowances shall be made to nonsubscribers as to subscribers of the per diem rules agreement, in connection with cars handled in terminal switching service, as the latter term is defined by the switching reclaim rules of the American Railway Association.\n\n'(3) That short-line railroads which are less than 10 miles in length, and which return railroad-owned equipment to the road from which received, shall not be required to report per diem accruals to numerous car owners throughout the country, but shall be attached to their connecting carriers for purpose of car-hire settlement.\n\n'(4) That common-carrier railroads which interchange freight cars with more than one subscriber railroad, and which deliver to one or more subscribing carriers, freight cars which are received from another such carrier, and railroads 100 miles or more in length, regardless of the number of railroads with which they connect, shall make car-hire settlements direct with car owners in accordance with the per diem rules.\n\n'(5) That common-carrier railroads outside switching districts, other than those referred to in paragraph 4 hereof, shall pay per diem to connecting carriers on railroad-owned freight cars after deducting an average of two days free time per loaded freight car interchanged, settlements to be made at the end of each calendar month, except that no car hire need be paid on cars received for return loading with coal from coal mines which are customarily dependent upon connecting carriers for car supply.'\n\n Thereupon, appellants, on behalf of themselves and other carriers similarly situated, brought this suit to set aside paragraphs (2), (3), and (5) of the order. No complaint was made in respect of paragraphs (1) and (4). \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 90]\n\u00a0\n The case was heard by a court of three judges, constituted as required by the Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, 38 Stat. 220, U. S. C., title 28,  47 (28 USCA  47). That court, without an opinion, made findings and conclusions sustaining the order of the Commission in all respects, and entered a decree of dismissal without prejudice of further applications to the Commission for modification of the order, if, subsequently, injury or unfair results follow from the application of the order.\n In the early history of railroad operation, through freight was transferred from the cars of one road to those of the connecting line at junction points. This resulted in waste of time and money, and the railroads themselves soon adopted the practice of permitting the loaded cars to pass from their own tracks to those of the connecting roads, making a charge therefor. See in the Matter of Car Shortage, etc., 12 I. C. C. 561, 573. For many years charges for interchanged cars were on a mileage basis, but this was found impracticable, and a per diem rate generally was substituted. Finally, an agreement was entered into, known as the 'Car Service and Per Diem Agreement,' which provided for an interchange of cars subject to a code of rules adopted by the American Railway association, the general principle of which was that payment should be made to the car-owning railroad for each day the car was off its lines. The railroads subscribing to this agreement are known as 'subscribers,' and other roads, as 'nonsubscribers.' The subscribers, all members of the American Railway Association, comprise nearly 78 per cent. of the steam railroads in the United States; and these operate nearly 98 per cent. of the entire railroad mileage, and own 99.81 per cent. of all the railroad common carrier car equipment of the country. Carriers operating less than 100 miles of railroad are eligible for associate membership but without voting rights. At the time this case was heard by the \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 91]\n\u00a0\n Commission, the per diem rate was fixed at $1.00 per car. The rules required daily interchange reports in repect of all cars interchanged between subscribers. Generally, nonsubscribers were railroads operating short lines and owning little, or in some cases no, freight car equipment. Provision was made in the rule for a 'reclaim allowance,' that is to say, a refund, to railroads which had paid car rental, to the extent of the per diem expense incurred in handling cars in terminal switching service. This rule was confined to subscribers, and no reclaim allowance was permitted to nonsubscribers for such service.\n That the order of the Commission falls within the scope of its statutory powers is clear. Interstate Commerce Act,  1, subds. 10-14, as amended by Transportation Act, 1920, c. 91,  402, 41 Stat. 456, 476, U. S. C., title 49,  1(10) to (14), 49 USCA  1(10-14). Subdivision (14) provides: 'The commission may, after hearing, on a complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, establish reasonable rules, regulations, and practices with respect to car service by carriers by railroad subject to this chapter, including the compensation to be paid for the use of any locomotive, car, or other vehicle not owned by the carrier using it, and the penalties or other sanctions for nonobservance of such rules, regulations or practices.'\n The authority of the Commission to institute the proceeding on its own motion, and to prescribe reasonable rules relating to the subject of car service, and to prescribe reasonable compensation for the use of the cars of one railroad by another railroad, is conceded. Nor is it disputed that under the law, in the operation of through routes, common carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  1-27) may be obliged to permit their car equipment to be carried beyond their own lines. See Missouri & Illinois Coal Co. v. I. C. R. Co., 22 I. C. C. 39. Appellants assail paragraph (2), (3), and (5) of the order on the grounds \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 92]\n\u00a0\n that their provisions operate to take property without compensation, are not justified by the evidence, and are discriminatory, unequal, arbitrary, and unreasonable.\n First-Paragraph (2). Paragraph (1) of the order, which is not challenged, requires the same daily car rental to be paid to nonsubscribers as is paid to subscribers to the per diem rules agreement. Of this, paragraph (2) is the logical corollary. If nonsubscribers are entitled to be put on terms of equality with subscribers in the matter of liability for car rental payments, it is hard to see why they should not also be entitled to the same equality in respect of refunds of such portions of the payments as represent switching charges, provided, of course, that the nonsubscribers are also required to assume like obligation in respect of reclaim allowances when they in turn are owners of the used cars. The two paragraphs, taken together and fairly interpreted, we think justify the conclusion that the obligations imposed and the benefits to be received are intended to be reciprocal, and put subscribers and nonsubscribers, in respect thereof, upon terms of equality. That this is the view of the government and of the Commission appears from the language of their brief, as follows: 'The Commission's obvious purpose was to place nonsubscribers on an equal footing with subscribers. The order is directed against all the common-carrier railroads in the United States, including both subscribers and nonsubscribers. The requirement that 'similar reclaim allowances shall be made to nonsubscribers as to subscribers' can only mean that nonsubscribers and subscribers are to be treated alike. ... The order in any event does not prevent appellants and the other subscribers from modifying the per diem rules so as to require nonsubscribers to pay such allowances to the subscribers. Since appellants can themselves cure the defect which they allege in the \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 93]\n\u00a0\n Commission's order, they are not in a position to challenge the order on this ground.'\n This virtually amounts to a construction by the Commission of its own order in accordance with the view we have expressed. The suggestion that in so far as the short line railroads can bring themselves within paragraph (5) of the order, this equality of treatment will fail, will be found to disappear when we come to deal with that paragraph.\n Second-Paragraph (3). This paragraph relieves the short line railroads of the defined-i. e., those returning cars of other carriers to the road from which received, from the burden of reporting per diem accruals to numerous cas owners, and in effect requires such reports to be made only to their immediate connecting carriers. The objection urged to the paragraph is that it requires the connecting carrier to expend its money in keeping accounts and making reports and payments in respect of operating expenses of the short line carrier, and thus amounts to confiscation in the guise of regulation.\n The classification which results in exempting railroads less than 100 miles in length from the necessity of making reports of per diem accruals separately to each of the numerous car owners throughout the country is attacked as arbitrary and unreasonable. We think it is neither. It is of a kind frequently made and frequently upheld by this court. St. L., Iron Mt . & S. Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n240 \nU.S. 518, 520\n, 36 S. Ct. 443; Wilson v. New, \n243 \nU.S. 332, 354\n, 37 S. Ct. 298, L. R. A. 1917E, 938, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1024, and authorities cited. Moreover, the car equipment of the country is substantially in the hands of the trunk lines, that owned by the short lines being almost a negligible proportion of the whole. And this fact affords some additional ground for the classification. Indeed, the classification was recognized as legitimate by appellants themselves, when they subscribed to the provision that such short lines should be permitted to become associate mem- \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 94]\n\u00a0\n bers only of the American Railway Association, but without voting rights.\n Under the per diem agreement subscribers must report to each car owner as to cars used, and pay the per diem charges to such owner; but in the case of nonsubscribers-who are not bound by the rules-the reports and payments are made to the immediate connecting subscriber carrier. The effect of paragraph (3) is to extend this privilege to the subscribing short line carriers as well. In other words, all short line railroads, whether subscribers or not, are put in a separate class and relieved from the burden of keeping account of a multitude of separate per diem charges, and reporting them separately to the various trunk lines.\n Each of the trunk lines already maintains a large accounting force, and is obliged to keep account of cars received from other lines, including those turned over to, and returned by, its connecting short lines. It fairly may be said that it will entail relatively little additional service to keep the accounts and make the reports, as required by paragraph (3). Each of these trunk lines in turn will be relieved from much of the burden and expense of dealing directly with nonconnecting short lines; and it is not improbable that the benefits received will counterbalance the burdens, or at least go very far in that direction. On the whole, we are unable to conclude that this part of the order imposes upon the connecting lines anything of substance that as a matter of law constitutes a part of the work of operating the short lines, of that the required change adds anything to the operating expenses of such connecting carriers. On the other hand, as the record clearly shows, the keeping of these additional accounts, and the making of the vast number of reports to the numerous car owners throughout the country which would be required in the absence of paragraph (3), would put upon these short lines an excessive and disproportionate burden. It was estimated by one witness, and not \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 95]\n\u00a0\n contradicted, that if the short lines were required to keep their accounts as they are kept by the trunk lines, it would impose an unnecessary burden upon the traffic of the country of approximately $500,000 per month.\n The power to 'establish reasonable rules, regulations, and practices with respect to car service by carriers by railroad,' conferred by subdivision (14) of section 1, hereinbefore quoted, undoubtedly includes the power to make reasonable rules prescribing forms and methods of accounting, reporting, and distributing payments in respect of such service. The Commission is here dealing with the railroad system of the country as a whole. A multitude of interrelated interests in concerned. The trunk lines, as owners, furnish in the main all the car equipment used by the short lines. These are legitimate facts to be considered by the Commission in exercising its authority in respect of accounts; and these facts, and other facts and circumstances, justly may require that more of the clerical work shall be done by one of these classes than by the other.\n The Commission is a body of trained and experienced experts, and in respect of such matters a reasonable degree of latitude must be allowed for the exercise of its judgment. The mere fact that, in application, mathematical accuracy in the adjustment of the burden may not be attained is not enough to pur upon the Commission's order the stamp of invalidity. Primarily, the question is an administrative one, and unless the limits of reasonable regulation be transcended, the courts may not interfere. The Commission concluded that the circumstances afforded warrant for requiring that class of railroads which generally owned the cars, which was best equipped to perform the clerical work, and which would receive the most in the way of compensating and offsetting benefits, to perform a larger proportion of the service of keeping and rendering the accounts. In doing so, we are \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 96]\n\u00a0\n of opinion that it did not transcend the limits of reasonable regulation, and that the claim of confiscation is not sustained.\n Third-Paragraph (5). This paragraph stands upon a different footing from those just considered. We do not find it necessary to review the various arguments made for and against the power of the Commission to make this part of the order. Section 1(14), supra, authorizes the Commission to fix the compensation to be paid for the use of cars, etc., not owned by the carrier using them. This the Commission undertook to do, and expressly found that, whether subscribers or not, all common carrier railroads were 'entitled to receive reasonable compensation in the form of a daily rental for the use of their general-service freight cars when on foreign lines, and that the present per diem charge of $1 per car day' was such reasonable compensation. In so doing it followed the direction of the statute. It then proceeded, however, by an order to grant to the short line railroads two days free time for interchanged loaded cars, and denied compensation altogether in the case of cars received for return loading with coal from coal miner customarily dependent upon connecting carriers for car supply.\n That exceptions of this character could be made if applied to all railroads, may be conceded, but that is not what was done. Here the Commission, having found that all railroads were entitled to receive a definitely fixed sum per day for every car used by a foreign line, entered an order relieving some of the railroads, in whole or in part, from such payments. Plainly this order is in flat opposition to the finding and cannot be permitted to stand.\n Confiscation may result from a taking of the use of property without compensation quite as well as from the taking of the title. Chicago M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n134 \nU.S. 418, 458\n, 10 S. Ct. 462; Reagan v. Farmers' Loan \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 97]\n\u00a0\n & Trust Co., \n154 \nU.S. 362, 410\n, 412 S., 14 S. Ct. 1047; Chicago, Mil. & St. P. R. Co. v. Wisconsin, \n238 \nU.S. 491, 498\n, 499 S., 35 S. Ct. 869, L. R. A. 1916A, 1133. The use of railroad property is subject to public regulation, but a regulation which is so arbitrary and unreasonable as to become an infringement upon the right of ownership constitutes a violation of the due process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. North Carolina Corp. Commission, \n206 \nU.S. 1, 20\n, 27 S. Ct. 585, 11 Ann. Cas. 398. And certainly a regulation permitting the free use of property in the face of an express finding that the owner is entitled to compensation for such use cannot be regarded otherwise than as arbitrary and unreasonable.\n If, as claimed, the earnings of the short lines are insufficient to enable them to make full payment of car hire costs, the Commission may be able to afford a remedy by increasing the rates, or by a readjustment of the division of joint rates. New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184\n, 43 S. Ct. 270; Beaumont, S. L. & W. Ry. Co. v. U. S., \n282 \nU.S. 74\n, 51 S. Ct. 1. It cannot be done by confiscating for their benefit the use of cars of other railroads. Short lines, as well as trunk lines, participating in joint rates, must furnish their share of the equipment. If they do not own cars, they must rent them. The Commission itself has pointed out very clearly the basis for this requirement. Virginia Blue Ridge Ry. v. S. Ry. Co., 96 I. C. C. 591, 593: 'The per diem that complainant pays for car hire is merely equivalent to interest, depreciation, insurance, taxes, and other car-ownership costs which it would have to bear if it owned the cars used in interline traffic. The car owner incurs these costs in the first instance, and is reimbursed by complainant (a short line) through the per diem or rental charges, thereby relieving the latter of the necessity of investing in equipment for this service.'\n The case does not present a question of apportionment of car hire costs. The Commission undertook to deter- \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 98]\n\u00a0\n mine, and did determine, what was a reasonable compensation for the use of cars, and definitely fixed that compensation on a per diem basis. It then, by its order, denied such reasonable compensation in certain cases. This is in no proper sense an apportionment of expense, but a plain giving of the free use of property for which, the Commission had concluded, the owner should be paid. We must deal with cases as they are made, not as they might have been made. To do otherwise, if we had the power, would be only to invite confusion. What the Commission would do in a proper case of apportionment, involving many elements for consideration not now before us, we are not advised; and it has made no findings suitable to a determination of that matter.\n We find no reason for applying a different rule in respect of the clause of paragraph (5) which altogether relieves the short lines from the payment of car hire on coal cars received for return loading with coal from mines customarily dependent upon connecting carriers for car supply. This is a blanket order in opposition to the express finding of the Commission quite as much as that part of the paragraph which grants to the short lines two days free use of cars. The general rule in respect of the obligation of a railroad, whether a short line or a trunk line, to furnish equipment for the transportation of freight tendered to it, applies to the case of coal loaded at coal mines as well as to other traffic. Demurrage on Coal & Coke, 102 I. C. C. 554, 557, 558, citing Brick from Michigan City, Ind., 42 I. C. C. 509, 511, where the general rule is stated.\n In the first-named case the Tennessee Railroad, a short line, undertook, by a proposed tariff, to make a demurrage charge against cars held at coal mines as an offset to per diem charges paid by it to the Southern Railway. The Commission, however, regarding the tariff as an attempt \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 99]\n\u00a0\n to transfer the railroad's car hire expense to the coal operators, required the tariff to be canceled, saying: 'Although respondent states that the proposed schedule was published for the sole purpose of recovering its car-hire cost on cars under load, it would be applicable to all cars. In other words, it would have the effect of largely offsetting respondent's cost of car hire by assessing shippers an amount equal thereto beyond a certain time. Respondent is under obligation to furnish the equipment necessary for the transportation of traffic tendered to it, and if it does not possess such equipment the charges paid for the revenue ( evidently meaning rental) thereof can not be considered as an item of expense which is not included in the rate.'\n There is nothing in section 1(12) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended (49 USCA  1(12), which affords a basis for this part of paragraph ( 5), although the terms of the order might suggest that this subdivision was relied upon. Section 1(12) has relation only to the subject of car distribution, that is, to a 'just and reasonable distribution of cars' by each railroad 'for transportation of coal among the coal mines served by it, whether located upon its line or lines or customarily dependent upon it for car supply.' See Assigned Car Cases, \n274 \nU.S. 564, 577\n, 47 S. Ct. 727. The object of this provision was to insure a proportional distribution of all available coal cars so as to afford a fair and equal opportunity to each mine to enjoy their use on the basis of its rating. Baltimore & O. R. Co. v. Lambert Run Coal Co. (C. C. A.) 267 F. 776, 779.1 It has nothing to do with the question of compensation for the use of cars by nonowning railroads. That subject, as already appears, is covered by section 1(14). \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 100]\n\u00a0\n The part of the order, paragraph (5), now under consideration creates an exemption in favor of all short lines and against all connecting carriers, irrespective of varying circumstances, in the face of a general finding that all common carrier railroads are entitled to compensation in the form of daily rental for the use of cars when on foreign lines. The language of the finding could not be more comprehensive. If followed, it necessarily compels payment of rental by the lines exempted as well as all other lines. It affords no justification for any exemption. We are not called upon to consider the evidence, since the Commission, upon the evidence, has made its findings. The vice of the situation is that the order of the Commission, that is to say, its judgment, does not conform to its conclusions upon the facts. In disapproving this paragraph, we do not mean, for the present, to go beyond the precise case presented, or to pass upon the question of the authority of the Commission to make fair apportionment of car hire costs, or, in special cases, to make adjustments and afford a proper measure of relief in the matter of payment of charges for the use of cars. Compare Ohio Farm Bureau Federation v. A. & W. Ry. Co ., 89 I. C. C. 489, 499; Kanawha Black Band Coal Co. v. C. & O. Ry. Co., 142 I. C. C. 433, 442.\n It follows that the court below should have set aside paragraph (5) of the order.\n Decree reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n Acting under authority conferred by the Esch Car Service Act (section 1(14) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by Transportation Act, 1920, February 28, 1920, c. 91,  402, 41 Stat. 456, 476, 49 USCA  1(14), the Interstate Commerce Commission, after a nation-wide investigation, has prescribed certain rules which affect compensation for the \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 101]\n\u00a0\n use and detention of freight cars on lines of common carriers other than their owners. The principal subject of controversy here is the validity of so much of the Commission's order as relates to the apportionment of car- hire charges upon cars interchanged between a designated class of short line carriers and their trunk line connections. This part of the order, as well as that which the Court has sustained, should, I think, be held valid.\n At the outset it should be pointed out that the part of the order held void does not deny to car owners the right to compensation for the first two days that a car is on the rails of a short line of the designated class. Regardless of the ownership of the car the order determines only which of the connecting carriers shall bear the burden of that compensation. The connecting trunk line may or may not own the car, but in either case the purpose and effect of the order is to determine the fair share of the per diem car-hire expense to be borne, respectively, by a trunk line and its connecting short line of the particular class, participating in a through route.\n An adequate appreciation of the nature of the problem with which the Commission was required to deal by section 1(14) involves an examination of the history and present day practices of car interchange between connecting carriers in the United States. In their early history the railroads in this country did not permit freight cars which they owned to leave their rails, and freight to be transported over more than one line was unloaded and reloaded at junction points. \n2\n With the development of more efficient transportation methods after the Civil War, this uneconomical and time-wasting practice was gradually abandoned. In 1886, the adoption by the southern rail \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 102]\n\u00a0\n roads of standard gauge track removed the last physical barrier to free interchange of equipment throughout the nation; and in 1911 a rule which the railroads had long before come to recognize as a necessity of commerce was declared to be an obligation of law, when the Interstate Commerce Commission, under the amended Interstate Commerce Act, decided that carriers could not refuse to permit their freight cars to pass onto rails of connecting carriers. Missouri & Illinois Coal Co. v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., 22 I. C. C. 39; see St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n217 \nU.S. 136, 145\n, 146 S., 148, 30 S. Ct. 476, 29 L. R. A. (N. S.) 802. The obligation has never since been doubted, and the power to regulate it is exclusively vested in the Commission. Assigned Car Cases, \n274 \nU.S. 564\n, 47 S. Ct. 727; United States v. New River Co., \n265 \nU.S. 533\n, 44 S. Ct. 610\n\n\n This freedom of car movement has been attained without impairment of the basic obligation of rail carriers to furnish equipment for carriage, either by owning it or hiring it, and, if by hiring it, to pay proper compensation. \n3\n Until comparatively recent years, the standard of compensation has been fixed by the railroads themselves, by custom or agreement. Before 1902 the prevailing and customary basis was mileage; but this proved unsatisfactory. The then existing mileage rates are said to have been inadequately compensatory; the car owner had no means of verifying mileage on foreign lines; and no incentive was furnished for the prompt handling of cars. The first \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 103]\n\u00a0\n difficulty might, with some exceptions, have been removed by increasing the rates, but the second and third were inherent in the system, and the last involved, not the adequacy of the compensation for the use of cars, but the failure of the rate to exercise any controlling influence on car movements.\n To meet these objections, the American Railway Association, in 1902, after many years of discussion and investigation, formulated a radically different method of car-hire settlement, a method which, as steadily elaborated and modified in the light of experience, has remained in force ever since. The basis of this plan is the requirement that every carrier using a car belonging to another shall pay to the owner a flat sum (fixed at one dollar since 1920) per diem, the liability for the following twenty- four hours to attach to the carrier holding the car at midnight. \n4\n Other provisions pertinent to this controversy are the agreement exacted of each member road to report daily to car owners all cars currently interchanged, 5 and the exemption granted to switching railroads, under certain circumstances, from the otherwise unvarying liability of the carrier in possession of a foreign car to pay per diem charges on it. \n6\n Under this exemption, denominated 'switching reclaim,' a carrier using cars in so- called 'terminal switching service' pays per diem costs in due course on each car, but is entitled to recover from the connecting line haul carrier an amount per car based on the average detention period of cars in such service.\n The American Railway Association is, and has been since its inception, a purely voluntary organization. No carrier is bound to subscribe to its Code of Per Diem \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 104]\n\u00a0\n Rules; and no carrier operating less than one hundred miles of road is eligible to voting membership, although it may become an associate member, subject to the reciprocal rights and obligations of the Code, which the Association, by its voting members, prescribes. Subscription to the Per Diem Code entails substantial burdens, some of them peculiarly onerous for short lines. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Of the 1731 steam railroads in the United States, 384 do not subscribe to the agreement, and of these nearly all are short-line, Class III roads, that is, roads having annual operating revenues of less than $ 100,000. Many of them are less than ten miles in length. Several important rules of the Association deal with relations between subscribers and this group of nonassenting lines. It is the frankly admitted aim of the Association to coerce the nonassenting lines into joining it, by subjecting them to treatment substantially less favorable than that accorded to subscribers. The cars of nonsubscribers are not paid for on a per diem, but on a mileage basis, concededly less remunerative. They are denied the privilege, granted to Association members, of the switching reclaim. In addition, since 1922, trunk line members have been expressly prohibited from making car-hire arrangements with their nonsubscribing connections on any other than a strict per diem basis-arrangements to which the short lines assert their special situation entitles them, and which many trunk line members of the Association have granted in spite of the Code; others have expressed their willingness to grant it, were it not for the prohibition of the Code. This coercive use of the regulations, together with the asserted unfair- \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 105]\n\u00a0\n ness of the per diem basis generally to short lines, forms the background of the Commission's order now under review.\n By the Esch Car Service Act, the Interstate Commerce Commission was given sweeping control over rules of car interchange and car hire settlement,8 and the authority conferred by it in respect to compensation for use of cars has been exercised by the Commission in numerous instances upon complaint by individual carriers. \n9\n With such complaints pending before it, together with a petition by the American Short Line Railroad Association, the Commission, on January 4, 1926, instituted a general investigation upon its own motion, reopening many of the decided cases and consolidating pending ones with the general inquiry. An extended record was made up, embracing some 5,000 pages of testimony and more than 500 exhibits. The order ultimately issues by the Commission, embodied in five numbered paragraphs, was addressed to all common carriers by railroad in the United States. Rules for Car-Hire Settlement, 160 I. C. C. 369; Id., 165 I. C. C. 495.\n In this order the Commission made no effort to replace in their entirety the per diem rules of the American Railway Association. Instead it removed the discrimination complained of by bringing all common carriers by railroad, subscribers or nonsubscribers, within those rules, as modified, to meet certain of the objections growing out of the special circumstances of the short lines. Para- \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 106]\n\u00a0\n graph (1) of the order entitles nonsubscribers to per diem payment for the use of their cars upon the same terms as the Association prescribes for cars of its members. Paragraph (4) requires all carriers, whether members of the Association or not, whose lines are more than 100 miles long or who receive cars from one subscriber and deliver them to another, to make car- hire settlements direct with car owners in accordance with the per diem rules. These provisions are not attacked by any of the appellant railroads. Paragraph (2) entitles nonsubscribers to switching reclaim, on account of cars handled in terminal switching service, upon the same terms as hitherto received by subscribers. The practical effect of this paragraph is to compel allowance of the switching reclaim to nonsubscribing short lines, since the existing practice of allowing the reclaim to subscribers is generally approved and regarded as necessary, as the revenue from switching services is insufficient to meet the car-hire cost of the carriers performing them. Paragraph (3) attaches short line railroads which return cars to the road from which received, to their connecting carriers for purposes of car-hire accounting and settlement. Paragraph (5) requires the same class of short line roads to pay per diem to their connecting carriers, but with the deduction of two days' free time per loaded freight car, and with the proviso that in the case of short line roads, 'no car-hire need be paid on cars received for return loading with coal from coal mines which are customarily dependent upon connecting carriers for car supply.'\n This Court now holds that paragraphs (2) and (3) are valid, but, without considering the evidence, that paragraph (5) is void, being on its face so arbitrary and unreasonable as to deprive the appellants of property without due process of law. In support of this conclusion, it is said that, the Commission having found generally 'that the present per diem charge of $1 per car day reasonably \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 107]\n\u00a0\n compensates car owners, for average car ownership and maintenance costs,' its order granting to the short lines the two days' allowance is in such flat opposition to this finding that the order cannot be allowed to stand as an exception to the general rule.\n But there is no such opposition. The Commission was concerned and dealt with far more important questions than the determination of the reasonable per diem rental of a freight car. Its declared purpose in instituting the proceeding was to investigate the rules of car-hire settlements and to make 'such order ... in the premises as might be warranted by the record.' The reasonableness of the two days' free time allowance and that of the switching reclaim were the chief subjects of its inquiry. The one which the Court has disapproved is no more an exception to the general finding than the other which it approves. Both were expressly found reasonable by the Commission and both are consistent with its adoption of the per diem as a standard for measuring the rental value of cars for purposes of car-hire settlements. The real issue presented upon the evidence, the findings and the order of the Commission is not whether the per diem is a fair method of compensating the car owner-all agree that it is-but whether it is a fair method of apportioning the burden of car-hire necessarily incident to a through route; not whether compensation should be paid, but who shall pay it. Upon the record, the Commission's findings and order cannot justly be characterized as declaring in the same breath that the two days' free time allowance is both reasonable and unreasonable. See United States v. Wells, \n283 \nU.S. 102, 111\n, 120 S., 51 S. Ct. 446.\n The Commission's investigation embraced all the elements which affect the use of the per diem as an instrument of regulation of the movement of interchanged cars and as a means of apportioning car-hire costs between trunk line carriers and connecting short line carriers of \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 108]\n\u00a0\n the designated class participating in the joint haul. The findings of the Commission are based on the investigation which it made and support its order. For the following reasons, the fifth paragraph of the order is not open to the objections urged against it.\n First. The very language of the Esch Car Service Act, authorizing the Commission to establish 'rules, regulations, and practices with respect to car service ... including the compensation to be paid,' treats car-hire as one form of regulation of the service. It is but a recognition of the historic fact that the car-hire charge may serve to penalize the unnecessary detention of cars and thus to regulate car movement, one of the considerations which led to the substitution of the per diem charge for the mileage system of car-hire payments. \n10\n In this respect it is analogous to demurrage, in which the penalty element of the money payment imposed is emphasized over the element of compensation. \n11\n It is for this reason, among \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 109]\n\u00a0\n others, that the Commission has generally refused to consider car-hire costs in fixing division,12 and in this case the Commission found that divisions had not customarily been adjusted with relation to such costs.\n That the per diem charge in its aspect as a penalty was an important element in the determination of the Commission, appears from its opinion and order. As the two days' free time allowance applies only to those cars which the short line receives from and returns to the line carrier, it is in practical effect limited to those cars with respect to which the short line renders terminal and originating services. Under the national demurrage rules, the terminal lines are compelled to allow to shippers two days' free time for loading and unloading before demurrage attaches. There is nothing in the Fifth Amendment to preclude the Commission, in apportioning car-hire costs, from giving consideration to the operation of the per diem charge as a penalty for the detention of cars and from making some allowance for the fact that the terminal carrier is in turn required to allow to shippers time free of demurrage charges. The two days which it did allow are by no means an exact offset of the free time allowed \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 110]\n\u00a0\n under the demurrage rules. \n13\n The amount of time to be allowed was a matter for the judgment of the Commission, influenced by this, together with all other relevant considerations. The Commission gave some, but not controlling weight to the fact that the short lines, when thus serving as terminals, would be unduly penalized if no allowance were made to offset the time allowed to shippers. There was ample evidence supporting its conclusion, and its order no more deprives the carrier of its property than would a corresponding determination that time free of demurrage should be allowed to the shipper, and that it should be two rather than one or three days.\n Second. In any aspect, the Commission's order cannot be viewed as requiring trunk lines to furnish their short line connections with free cars. As stated, the part of the order with which we are now concerned deals with the problem of just apportionment, between certain connecting carriers, of the carhire cost of a joint haul. The Per Diem Rules of the American Railway Association make that apportionment according to the length of time the car is upon the rails of the respective carriers. The Commission found, and the evidence supports its finding, that such an apportionment is in many respects unfair to short lines, engaged in time- consuming terminal and originating services. The Commission's modification of the Railway Association's formula is based upon the necessary detention of cars in the performance of such services by the short line for the benefit of both carriers. The assumption is inadmissible that in so far as trunk lines are thus re- \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 111]\n\u00a0\n quired to pay per diem while a car is on a connecting carrier's rails, they are necessarily compelled to assume an operating cost of the connection. It presupposes the answer to the very question to be decided- whether the per diem without allowances is a just basis for apportioning car-hire costs in the case of the short lines. The fallacy of the similar assumption, once commonly made, that mileage should be the sole test of the reasonableness of divisions of joint rates, was repeatedly pointed out both by the Commission and by this court, before Congress specifically enumerated other elements for consideration. \n14\n In both cases, the reduction of the broad statutory injunction of reasonableness to a single one of its constituent elements, disregarding all others, produces a result with a false appearance of reasonableness, which, when gauged by the standard which the regulatory statute sets up, is unreasonable and unjust.\n Far from representing any universal standard of natural justice for the fair apportionment of car-hire costs, the per diem system is of recent origin, and adopted with purposes primarily in view quite foreign to the simple end of accurate compensation. \n15\n The completely disparate measure of mileage prevailed until 1902. Mileage is still the basis upon which owners of private railroad cars are compensated;16 and until the orders issued by the \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 112]\n\u00a0\n Commission in the present controversy, it was the measure of payment stipulated by members of the American Railway Association for cars of non- members. The per diem is admittedly but a rule of thumb, though the best which experience has devised to meet all the complex requirements growing out of the average car-hire situation. In a large number of instances the Interstate Commerce Commission, to secure a more just apportionment, has ordered that car-hire costs of certain short-line industrial common carriers be computed with a varying number of days of 'free time';17 and in a still larger num- \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 113]\n\u00a0\n ber of instances trunk lines themselves have voluntarily \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 114]\n\u00a0\n instituted such arrangements. 18 The device of 'switching reclaim' itself, elsewhere concerned in this case, pointedly exemplifies the admitted inapplicability of the per diem system to certain special operating conditions. In this instance carriers engaged in a time-consuming switching service are in effect relieved altogether of care-hire costs; and the Court has sustained this departure by the Commission from the single standard of time of detention. Perhaps the most striking example of all is the operation of the rule imposing upon the carrier in possession of a car at midnight liability for per diem for the following twenty-four hours. Under this rule an intermediate carrier, incurring no delays for loading or unloading, may receive a car shortly after midnight, haul \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 115]\n\u00a0\n it several hundred miles, and by delivering it to a third road before the following midnight escape car-hire altogether. The seeming unfairness, when measured in terms of the period of detention alone, disappears when that element is examined in comparison with the compensating effects of the reciprocal operation of the rule between connecting carriers and the difficulties and expense of accounting for less than twenty-four hour periods. Freedom from the per diem, when all relevant considerations are taken into account, is therefore not necessarily a gratuity.\n[]\n Nonsubscriber connections.\n Which pay Which settle Trunk Line Total straight on some per diem other basis []\n Burlington 18 2 16 Chesapeake & Ohio 10 5 5 Great Northern 21 0 21 L. & N. 10 2 8 Missouri Pacific 20 3 17 New Haven 8 5 3 Northwestern 9 6 3 Pennsylvania 55 6 49 Soo Line 12 4 8 Southern 27 20 7 Southern Pacific (Pacific Lines) 46 24 22 Southern Pacific (Texas and Louisiana) 14 10 4 St. L.

[]\n a Exact number not given.\n This table includes 67 industrial roads among the nonsubscriber roads and is therefore not a wholly accurate reflection of the relations of other short lines with the trunk line carriers; but even when the industrial roads are eliminated from the table, it is still apparent that the trunk lines disregard the Code with respect to a large proportion of the total nonsubscriber connections. Settlement with industrial roads on other than the per diem basis does not violate the Code. But the present order of the Commission, it may be noted, does not distinguish between industrial and other short lines. \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 116]\n\u00a0\n In attempting to find a measure of the just apportionment of car-hire costs, the railroads and the Commission have had to face a condition of extraordinary complexity, and not a theory. The Fifth Amendment does not command the impossible. It does not demand that the power and duty of the Commission to make the apportionment be thwarted by requiring it to adopt a standard of unattainable exactness. The validity of what is of necessity a rule of thumb, best adapted to secure a just apportionment, can hardly depend upon a perfect precision in its application; its imperfections in this respect are themselves compensated by an advisedly sought simplicity and convenience of operation.\n Under these circumstances, it is not to be supposed that in a special situation such as that of the short lines, the mere departure by the Commission from the per diem basis for apportioning car-hire costs between parties to a joint haul, can of itself constitute either a taking of the property of the carrier affected by it, or a taking of it without compensation. The appellants have no vested right not to pay their share of the hire of cars engaged in a joint service to which they are parties, simply because those cars are temporarily off their own rails. They are entitled only to have the Commission make reasonable rules for car-hire apportionment; and the reasonableness of any rule which it may adopt is a question wholly independent of its conformity to the measure of time of detention or to the Per Diem Rules of the American Railway Association. The reasons which support that part of the order allowing switching reclaims, as well as those advanced by the Court to justify that imposing on the trunk lines the burden of accounting for carhire settlements on cars exchanged with the short lines, do not differ in principle from those which support the two day allowance, and at least should have led to some consideration by the Court of the evidence warranting the latter. \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 117]\n\u00a0\n Third. The appellants have not sustained their burden of establishing that the Commission's rule is unreasonable. The principles to which courts ordinarily adhere in reviewing orders of the Commission do not admit of dispute. If the Commission does not refuse to consider relevant evidence, if it does not proceed upon a mistake of law, if it acts upon evidence sufficient to support its findings, the Court will not itself undertake to weigh such evidence, to inquire into the soundness of the reasoning which induced the Commission's conclusions, or to question the wisdom of regulations which it prescribes. New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 203\n, 204 S., 43 S. Ct. 270.\n But the position of appellants is that the question is not one of the reasonableness of the Commission's action. They insist that as the per diem is an operating expense, like any other which the short line must pay, no evidence can justify an order that it should be paid by any other railroad. \n19\n Their position ignores the fact that the action of the Commission is no more than the exercise of its undoubted power to apportion the car-hire costs of a joint service by connecting lines and is based upon a fundamentally erroneous theory of the powers of the Commission to prescribe reasonable rules for car-hire settlement. The per diem principle adopted by the American Railway Association in 1902 is not embedded in the Fifth Amendment adopted by this nation in 1791. Departures from it are not forbidden any more than any other action which may be taken under section 1(14), if reasonable and supported by adequate evidence. See Assigned Car Cases, supra, 274 U. S. page 580, 47 S. Ct. 727.\n Nevertheless, appellants have presented no argument either here or below upon the reasonableness of the present departure or upon the issue of the adequacy of the evidence. During the Commission's hearings they \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 118]\n\u00a0\n steadily opposed the introduction of testimony relating to comparative proportions of car-hire expense and operating costs as between short lines and trunk lines, or to the comparative proportions of car-hire expenses and operating revenues. They offered no such evidence themselves; nor did they attempt to defend the fairness to the short line carriers of the per diem basis of apportioning car-hire costs, beyond asserting that a fair apportionment of such costs was necessarily an apportionment per diem, an assertion unsupported by any evidence to establish the unfairness of any other of the formulae proposed. The appellants having confined their entire case to this contention, it suffices for this Court to point out their error.\n Fourth. Even assuming the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to be open, it is clear that the Commission had ample evidence before it to show that short lines were being compelled to bear a disproportionate burden of car-hire costs. It was undisputed that the per diem system was adopted by the larger carriers in disregard of protests of the short lines, and that the per diem rules had been modified and elaborated by members of the American Railway Association without giving the short lines a voice in the decisions. The evidence left no possible question that the short lines lost heavily by the replacement of the mileage system, which imposed no car hire whatever for equipment not in motion, by the per diem system, which emphasizes the period of detention. Short line witnesses presented a mass of evidence of the time-consuming character of the services performed by short lines in terminal and originating operations, including spotting and weighing cars, issuing through bills of lading, maintaining joint tariffs and computing rates, and, most important of all, the allowance to shippers of two \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 119]\n\u00a0\n days' free time for loading and unloading, as provided under the National Demurrage Rules. \n20\n\u00a0\n\n It was urged that with the two days' allowance to short line feeders, the trunk lines could still derive more net revenue from the haul than would accrue if the shipments originated on their own lines at the points of interchange. There was evidence that operating conditions of short lines, because of the very shortness of the haul and physiographical and other difficulties, are characteristically unfavorable to speed in handling. Many witnesses testified that the measurement of car-hire costs by time of detention imposes a peculiarly heavy burden upon a class of carriers benefited by paragraph (5) of the Commission's order, that is, short lines engaged in returning loaded cars empty, or empty cars loaded, to trunk line connections, because unlike other lines engaged only in part in such operations, they never have the opportunity of averaging gains and losses, the advantage of a long haul with the disadvantage of a short. \n21\n\u00a0\n\n In corroboration of this testimony a great amount of evidence was received, as a result of a questionnaire sent to all short lines desiring to be heard, to show that the ratio of car-hire expenses, to total expenses, and of car-hire costs to revenues was substantially higher for the short lines than for their trunk line connections. Upon \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 120]\n\u00a0\n such a record it cannot be said that the Commission could give no weight to those considerations and could not reasonably conclude that the short lines were entitled to relief; on the contrary, the evidence justified the conclusion that the per diem basis enforced or threatened to be enforced against them by the American Railway Association would, in fact, result in transferring to larger roads part of the legitimate revenues of the short lines, and thus would deprive them of their property without any process of law whatever.\n Fifth. The Commission's order does not go beyond the relief to which the short lines showed themselves entitled, nor does it prescribe a formula unreasonably burdensome upon their trunk line connections, nor is it based upon an improper classification. Paragraph (5) is strictly limited to cars which are used by short lines in terminal or originating services; and to that extent is accurately framed to meet the only substantial complaint which the short lines made. It is also apparently limited to carriers engaged exclusively in such service; and appellants suggest that the resulting exclusion of roads performing any amount of intermediate service, however slight, is arbitrary and unreasonable. Whatever the proper construction of the order, and whatever the justice of any complaint by a carrier of the class excluded, it is sufficient answer here that appellants do not themselves belong to that class, Roberts & Schaefer Co. v. Emmerson, \n271 \nU.S. 50, 54\n, 55 S., 46 S. Ct. 375, 45 A. L. R. 1495, and cannot complain that the Commission's order was not given a wider application.\n The order also excludes terminal or originating carriers of more than one hundred miles in length, a class to which appellants do belong. The opinion of the Court concedes that the two day allowance would be valid if made to all railroads, but insists that an allowance which could be made to all cannot be made to a selected class, the short lines which perform terminal services. The contention is \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 121]\n\u00a0\n in effect that the Commission, confronted with evidence of the peculiarly onerous operation of per diem charges on terminal and originating movements, had power to relieve it, if at all, only by establishing a system of universal reclaim for terminal and originating car-hire costs, analogous to switching reclaim, and running in favor of all carriers engaged in such service. But the Commission's authority is not restricted either by section 1(14) or by the Constitution to granting relief to all or none, regardless of their need. There was abundant evidence that the per diem system equalized itself for trunk line carriers through the averaging of gains and losses from long and short hauls. There was no evidence that the trunk lines regarded that system as unfair. The limitation of the order to carriers of less than 100 miles engaged exclusively in terminal or originating services, whose special situation rendered the per diem peculiarly burdensome to them, falls well within the bounds of reasonable classification marked out by the decisions of this Court. Wilson v. New, \n243 \nU.S. 332, 354\n, 37 S. Ct. 298, L. R. A. 1917E, 938, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1024, and cases cited.\n Nor was the Commission's action within the class chosen unreasonable. A remedy may, and in the present case must, be shaped to meet the evil. Instead of abandoning the per diem system altogether for the benefit of the comparatively few roads prejudiced by it, the Commission lightened its burden upon them by a rule of thumb no more crude or arbitrary than the principle of per diem itself. Had it returned all roads to a mileage basis, or, as the opinion of the Court suggests, allowed the two days to all roads, the short lines would equally have been relieved of the disadvantages of per diem, but the trunk lines would have lost its advantages. The remedy given by the Commission retains the benefits of per diem and relieves the short lines of the brunt of the burden arising from the two free days accorded shippers, while leaving them to bear the other special costs created \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 122]\n\u00a0\n by a time measure for short hauls, and conforms to the urgent suggestions of trunk line witnesses that any practicable rule must be simple of statement and ready of application. It is less extreme in result than the device of switching reclaim, in approval of which this Court and the Commission agree, and which was designed to relieve carriers whose services, many witnesses testified, are distinguishable from those of these short lines only by being performed under a switching rather than a line haul rate. Virtually all the 141 short line witnesses testified to the average detention period of cars on their lines, and many of them to the amount of car-hire which would be incurred under the Commission's proposed rule. The record justifies the opinion that only rarely would the short lines escape the payment of substantial sums, and then only under circumstances as exceptional as those created by the midnight rule already mentioned. The weighing of evidence of this sort is peculiarly a matter to be left to the administrative 'tribunal appointed by law and informed by experience.' Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n206 \nU.S. 441, 454\n, 27 S. Ct. 700, 704. No adequate reason has been advanced for rejecting the conclusion which that tribunal drew from the evidence presented to it.\n Sixth. The Commission, under the authority conferred by paragraph (14) to establish reasonable rules and practices for car service, 'including the compensation to be paid for the use of any ... car,' is empowered to make orders of the character issued in this investigation without instituting a divisions case to review the rate structure and financial condition of every carrier in the country. The contention of appellants to the contrary is based upon grounds so sweeping as either to deny the existence of the power or to render impossible its effective exercise. It is urged that the effect of the Commission's order is \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 123]\n\u00a0\n to require a transfer of revenue from appellants and other roads similarly situated to the designated short-line carriers; that rates, divisions, and financial condition of the railroads were not in issue; and that the Commission cannot avoid the rules governing the fixing of divisions by effecting a redistribution of revenue between carriers under the guise of regulation of car-hire. But as any alteration in the rules governing compensation for the use of cars authorized by section 1(14) necessarily affects the revenues of the carriers concerned, the argument amounts to an assertion that there can be none except in a divisions case.\n In so far as the appellants' imputation is that the Commission was less concerned with fair apportionment of car-hire costs than with financial rehabilitation of weak lines, it may be said shortly that this is without support in the record. The Commission did consider, and properly so, the relation between car costs and total operating costs of short lines, and between car costs and revenues from joint hauls. It found that the short lines were paying disproportionately large sums for the use of cars; and it found further that their rates and divisions had not customarily been adjusted with relation to such costs. \n22\n The Commission's power to remedy an unfair basis of car-hire apportionment is not confined to remitting the injured carriers to the uncertainties of rate litigation which, but for that unfairness, would be unnecessary, and which opens up a multitude of unrelated questions serving only to obscure the immediate issue. Many of the short lines are not able financially to litigate a divisions case. Rates established to absorb unduly heavy car-hire costs, moreover, must themselves be unduly high; and in many instances would defeat the object of relief. Finally, the \n\n[284 U.S. 80, 124]\n\u00a0\n Commission is without jurisdiction to adjust many divisions of intrastate rates. Its authority over car-hire charges is without such limitation.\n The Commission considered at length its power and duty to apportion car-hire costs independently of divisions. Its judgment that they should be dealt with, under the authority conferred by section 1(14), was in accordance with the unvaried practice of the trunk lines, whose traffic and transportation departments have customarily kept divisions and car- hire rigidly divorced. There is no basis, either in fact or law, for the assumption that the questions involved in an apportionment of car-hire, at least in cases like the present, are not separable from those involved in a divisions case, or for the assertion that the power conferred on the Commission by section 1(14) cannot be exercised independently of its power to order a division of a joint rate.\n Considerations especially applicable to coal cars placed on mine sidings on the short lines for loading, but analogous to those which led to the two day allowance for cars of other types, support the conclusion of the Commission that the per diem rule should not operate at all in the case of the former. It suffices to say that the difference is based upon the peculiar character of this traffic and of the originating service rendered, and particularly upon the fact that under the applicable demurrage rules short lines are forbidden to collect any demurrage on coal cars so placed. See Demurrage on Coal and Coke, 102 I. C. C. 554. The principle involved being the same as that underlying each of the other provisions of the order, this one, like the others, should not have been disturbed unless an examination of the evidence disclosed that it was not reasonable.\n The judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This case came to this court by appeal from the Circuit Court of Appeals and was remanded with a direction to dismiss for want of jurisdiction and without prejudice.

See also the early statement that the compensatory aspect of the mileage system was a minor one, since it was to be expected that, with a proper balance of car ownership, debits, and credits for car hire would equalize themselves. Burton Stock Car Co. v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., 1 I. C. C. 132, 140. In later cases the Commission has adverted to the punitive aspect of per diem, New England Divisions, 62 I. C. C. 513, 537, 538, and has stressed also the element of reciprocity as distinguishing the situation of the line-haul carriers and that of many of the short lines. Virginia Blue Ridge Ry. v.

New England Divisions, 62 I. C. C. 513, 538. Other cases in which the Commission has discussed the relation of per diem to fair divisions are Chaffee R. R. Co. v. Western Md. Ry. Co., 156 I. C. C. 471; Western Md. Ry. Co. v. Maryland & Pa. R. R. Co., 167 I. C. C. 57, 63. In some exceptional circumstances, the Commission has weighed car-rental expenses when determining divisions of the freight rate. See Chaffee R. R. Co. v. Western Md. Ry. Co., 102 I. C. C. 53, 59; Middle Creek R. R. Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., 168 I. C. C. 110, 117 (the fact that no car- hire was charged a short line was considered in fixing divisions). \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The terminal carrier may be required to allow four days' demurrage for a single car while on its line, two days for unloading and two for loading. The demurrage rules do not count Sundays or holidays, nor, for certain commodities, days of stormy weather. On the other hand, the short line terminal carrier may benefit if the shipper does not use his two days, although under the average demurrage agreement the unused portion is likely to be inconsiderable. \n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] See, e. g., O'Keefe v.

Loree, Railroad Freight Transportation (2d Ed. 1929) pp. 383, 390. \n[\nFootnote 16\n] Under section 1(14), the Commission has several times prescribed reasonable rates of compensation on a mileage basis for private cars. In Matter of Private Cars, 50 I. C. C. 652, 684-686, it considered the per diem basis at length and concluded that for private cars the mileage system was preferable. See, also, Armour & Co. v. El Paso & Southwestern Co., 52 I. C. C. 240; Paragon Refining Co. v. Alton & Southern R. R., 118 I. C. C. 166; Assigned Cars for Bituminous Coal Mines, 80 I. C. C. 520, 556; Assigned Car Cases, \n274 \nU.S. 564, 575\n, 47 S. Ct. 727. \n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] The Commission has many times, apparently acting under section 1( 14), prescribed terms of car compensation for industrial common carriers. Compare the approval, prior to 1917, of the placing of short lines on a demurrage basis, in Drummond & S. W. Ry. Co. v. Chicago, etc., Ry. Co., 21 I. C. C. 567. These cases took their starting point, before the passage of the Esch Car Service Act, in the Industrial Railways Case, 29 I. C. C. 212, 231-233, in which the Commission found that the switching reclaims under the per diem system were a fertile source of rebates and exemptions from demurrage for shippers who maintained independently incorporated railroads which were in substance plant facilities. Following the announcement in the Tap Line Cases, \n234 \nU.S. 1\n, 34 S. Ct. 741, of a rule giving many of the roads involved in the Industrial Railways Case the status of common carriers, the Commission, in a supplemental report, modified its original findings as to such carriers, and permitted them to reestablish per diem and reclaims. 32 I. C. C. 129, 133. See, also, Second Industrial Railways Case, 34 I. C. C. 596, 600. Subsequently, however, in a long series of cases the per diem system as applied to industrially owned common carriers was condemned, and different methods of car hire compensation prescribed. In the Northampton & Bath R. R. Co. Case, 41 I. C. C. 68, 74, the effect of the arrangement prescribed was to give the carrier two days' free time counterbalancing the two days accorded shippers under the demurrage rules, plus one day in addition. In the Owasco River Ry. Case, 53 I. C. C. 104, 113, a straight per diem system was ordered; but this basis of settlement was disapproved soon after in Birmingham Southern R. R. Co. v. Director General, 61 I. C. C. 551. In this case an industrial common carrier specifically besought the Commission to fix reasonable charges under section 1(14), asking for a per diem system with reclaims for all cars, whether handled under switching rates or under joint rates with divisions. The Commission denied this relief, and condemned reclaims, but prescribed a demurrage system, giving the short line 72 hours free time on cars loaded one way, credits for cars sooner returned to be averaged against debits, and the short line to be free to execute average demurrage agreements with shippers. The Birmingham Southern was not eligible for switching reclaims under the A. R. A. rules in respect to traffic handled under joint rates. Its average detention of foreign cars was shown to be 3.2 days. \n The so-called Birmingham Southern Rules were subsequently prescribed for other industrial common carriers in National Tube Co. v. Pittsburgh, C ., C. & St. L. R. R. Co., 61 I. C. C. 590; Illinois Northern Ry., 61 I. C. C. 629; Pullman Railroad Co., 61 I. C. C. 637; Benwood & Wheeling Connecting Ry. Co. v.

The question was re-examined with respect to several of the roads involved in the preceding cases in Lake Erie & Fort Wayne R. R. Co, 78 I. C. C. 475, and the Birmingham Southern rules somewhat modified. In this case the notion that the object was to relieve the industrial common carrier altogether of car hire was specifically repudiated. Id. at page 489 of 78 I. C. C. The Birmingham Southern Rules were again prescribed in Valley & Siletz R. R. Co. v. Southern Pac. Co., 80 I. C. C. 724; Hanging Rock Iron Co. v. Norfolk & Western Ry.

C. 269, 270, 274.\n This last group of cases states that the application of the Birmingham Southern Rules is to be restricted to industrial common carriers, and that their purpose is to prevent undue favoritism to the proprietary industries through the payment of switching reclaims. Many of the roads in question, however, were operating at least in part under joint rates and divisions, and thus were not eligible for reclaims; and the allowance to them of a modified demurrage basis was much more favorable than per diem. In the present investigation the Commission abandoned its distinction between industrial and non-industrial common carriers, revoked its determination in cases of both the Birmingham Southern and the Virginia Blue Ridge types, and substituted the provisions of paragraph (5) of its order. \n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] The following table, taken from the Commission's Report (Record, p. 39), illustrates the extent to which non-subscribing railroads \n outside of Chicago, have settled on some basis other than per diem with the trunk lines with which they exchange traffic:\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] Appellant's Brief p. 95. \n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] Note 11, supra.

BURNET(1931)\nNo. 81\nArgued: Decided: May 25, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 691, 692]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. T. J. Leahy, of Pawhuska, Okl., and James H. Maxey, of Tulsa, Okl., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. G. A. Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner is a member of the Osage Tribe of Indians, duly enrolled as such under the Act of June 28, 1906,1 and holds a certificate of competency issued March 5, 1910, pursuant to that act. He owns his own original allotment of the tribal lands, and has inherited from a deceased member a one-half interest in the latter's allotment, but nothing in this case turns on his ownership of these lands. He also owns his own original share in the tribal revenues, and, by inheritance from a deceased member, one-half of the interest in those revenues, to which that member would be entitled if living.\n In the years 1918, 1919, and 1920, petitioner's entire income was received from these one and one-half shares in the tribal income from oil and gas leases made by the tibe under the authority of the act. The leases were on a portion of the lands bought by the United States with money belonging to the tribe, thereafter held in trust for it, and subsequently allotted to its members as directed by the act. But in the division or allotment of the tribal lands the oil, gas, and other minerals therein were expressly reserved to the tribe for a period of twenty \n\n[283 U.S. 691, 693]\n\u00a0\n five years,2 now extended to April 8, 1958.3 Provision was made for the leasing of such minerals by the tribal council, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior,4 and the income from such leases is to be placed in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the members of the tribe and distributed among them quarterly. \n5\n This was the source of the petitioner's income.\n The petitioner paid income taxes in each of the years mentioned. Upon the receipt of a deficiency letter from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, he instituted a proceeding before the Board of Tax Appeals in which he claimed that he owed no deficiencies, but was entitled to a refund of the amounts theretofore paid because he was exempt from income tax on the sums received. The Board's decision was for respondent,6 and was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n7\n This Court granted certiorari. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioner urges several arguments in support of the claim that he is not liable for tax under the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057). These may conveniently be grouped into two main contentions: First, that the statute evidences no intent to tax petitioner on such income; and, second, that, if its language is broad enough to cover his case, his status or the nature of the income, requires a holding that the is exempt.\n The language of sections 210 and 211(a)9 subjects the income of 'every individual' to tax. Section 213(a)10 \n\n[283 U.S. 691, 694]\n\u00a0\n includes income 'from any source whatever.' The intent of Congress was to levy the tax with respect to all residents of the United States and upon all sorts of income. The act does not expressly exempt the sort of income here involved, nor a person having petitioner's status respecting such income, and we are not referred to any other statute which does.\n But it is said that, as to the income here taxed, petitioner is exempt because of his status as an Indian. This assertion requires a reference to the policy of the government with respect to the Indians. No provision in any of the treaties referred to by counsel has any bearing upon the question of the liability of an individual Indian to pay tax upon income derived by him from his own property. The course of legislation discloses that the plan of the government has been gradually to emancipate the Indian from his former status as a ward; to prepare him for complete independence by education and the gradual release of his property to his own individual management. This plan has included imposing upon him both the responsibilities and the privileges of the owner of property, including the duty to pay taxes. \n11\n Pursuant to this policy, the act of 1906 directed the allotment to each member of the Osage Tribe of a homestead of 160 acres to be chosen by him, which was to be inalienable and nontaxable for twenty-five years or during the life of the allottee. After setting apart such homestead to each, the surplus lands were all to be equally divided and allotted amongst the members. Section 2, seventh, of the act provides that the Secretary of the Interior, after due investigation, may issue certificates of competency to members of the tribe. It declares that 'upon the issuance of such certificate of competency \n\n[283 U.S. 691, 695]\n\u00a0\n the lands of such member (except his or her homestead) shall become subject to taxation, andsuch member (with exceptions not here material) shall have the right to manage, control, and dispose of his or her lands the same as any citizen of the United States.' \n12\n Since 1910, when he received his certificate, petitioner has therefore been taxable upon his allotted lands, except his homestead, and they have been freely alienable.\n There are provisions in the act of 1906 with respect to the holding, payment, and administration of the royalty shares of members who do not have certificates of competency, but with these we are not concerned. The shares of royalty of those holding such certificates are to be paid to them quarterly.\n The petitioner, then, was competent to hold and make any use (except to grant mining leases) of all his lands. All except his homestead were taxable, and were freely alienable without control or supervision of the government. His share of the royalties from oil and gas leases was payable to him, without restriction upon his use of the funds so paid. It is evident that, as respects his property other than his homestead, his status is not different from that of any citizen of the United States. In the process of gradually changing the relation between the Indian and the government he has been, with respect to the income in question, fully emancipated. Compare United States v. Waller, supra. It is true, as petitioner \n\n[283 U.S. 691, 696]\n\u00a0\n asserts, that as to his homestead he still remains a restricted Indian. But this fact is only significant as evidencing the contrast between his qualified power of disposition of that property and his untrammeled ownership of the income in controversy. The latter was clearly beyond the control of the United States. The duty to pay it into petitioner's hands, and his power to use it after it was so paid, were absolute. Work v. U. S. ex rel. Mosier, \n261 \nU.S. 352\n, 43 S. Ct. 389; Work v. U. S. ex rel. Lynn, \n266 \nU.S. 161\n, 45 S. Ct. 39. The claim that with respect to this income the petitioner was restricted, and therefore exempt from the tax laid by sections 210 and 211(a), must fail.\n It remains to consider whether there is anything in the nature of the income itself making it necessary to exempt it from the broad language of the Revenue Act. It is suggested by petitioner that the sums received were gifts and not income. In view of the facts above recited, this argument is without substance. It is further insisted that, since the royalties are not taxable so long as they remain in the hands of the government in trust for the tribe and undistributed to members, income derived by the individual member from this fund comes from an exempt source and must therefore also be held to be exempt. See Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429\n, 15 S. Ct. 673; Id., \n158 \nU.S. 601\n, 15 S. Ct. 912. Royalties received by the government from mineral leases of Indian lands have been held to be beyond a state's taxing power ( Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501\n, 42 S. Ct. 171; Shaw \n\n[283 U.S. 691, 697]\n\u00a0\n v. Oil Corporation, supra) on the ground that while in the possession of the United States they re a federal instrumentality, to be used to carry out a governmental purpose. It does not follow, however, that they cannot be subjected to a federal tax. The intent to exclude must be definitely expressed, where, as here, the general language of the act laying the tax is broad enough to include the subject-matter. Heiner v. Colonial Trust Co ., \n275 \nU.S. 232\n, 48 S. Ct. 65; Shaw v. Oil Corporation, supra. But whatever may have been the liability of the fund to federal taxation while it remained in the hands of the government, it cannot properly be said that the share of it paid as royalties to the petitioner constituted in his hands an instrumentality of the government and was therefore beyond the scope of the tax. Compare McCurdy v. United States, supra.

MILLER(1931)\nNo. 195\nArgued: Decided: April 13, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 96, 97]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. H. Watkins, of Jackson, Miss., and R. C. Stovall, of Okolona, Miss., for appellants and petitioners.\n Mr. Simon Rosenthal, of Jackson, Miss., for appellee and respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On behalf of the Mississippi levee district, the state tax collector of Mississippi sued the Columbus & Greenville Railway Company to collect a tax for the years 1926 and 1927, under chapter 282 of the Laws of Mississippi of 1914, at the rate of $350 a mile on its main line within the District. The railway company had paid the tax at the rate of $50 a mile, pursuant to the provisions of an amending act, chapter 259 of the Laws of 1926, which fixed the tax at that rate for a railroad having less than twenty-five miles of main line within the district. The railway company fell within the amendment, as its main line in the district was only 18.41 miles in length. The collector alleged in his declaration that the act of 1926 was unconstitutional and void because the bill providing therefor had not been published, in advance of introduction, as required by section 234 of the state Constitution. Demurrer to the declaration was sustained by the circuit court \n\n[283 U.S. 96, 98]\n\u00a0\n of Montgomery county, but its judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of the state upon the ground that the classification by the act of 1926 was 'arbitrary and unreasonable, and therefore in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.' 154 Miss. 317, 122 So. 366, 367.\n The railway company then pleaded that it was not indebted, and gave notice that it would undertake to show that the classification of the act of 1926 was valid, and, further, that the statute laying the tax demanded by the plaintiff, that is, the act of 1914, was itself unreasonable and violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Upon the trial, evidence offered by the defendant in support of these allegations was received subject to objection which the circuit court finally sustained, and judgment was entered for the amount of the tax on the basis of $350 a mile. This judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state, in the view that the case was ruled by its previous opinion and that the excluded evidence, if competent, could not have changed the result. 127 So. 784.\n An appeal was taken to this Court, and a motion to dismiss or affirm was postponed to the hearing on the merits. At the same time, this Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n282 \nU.S. 825\n, 51 S. Ct. 39, 75 L. Ed. -.\n That part of the state of Mississippi, known as the Mississippi Delta, is divided into two districts, the Mississippi levee district and the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta levee district, to the end that each district may maintain the levees necessary to protect the lands within it. The Mississippi levee district, created in 1865, comprises the southern part of the Delta. It is said that four methods of taxation are used to maintain this district, an acreage tax, a cotton tax, an ad valorem tax on property generally, and a mileage tax on railroad companies which it appears is in lieu of the ad valorem tax. Miller v. Yazoo & Mississippi Valley Railroad Co., 132 So. 597, Supreme Court of Mississippi, decided February 23, 1931. \n\n[283 U.S. 96, 99]\n\u00a0\n Prior legislation providing for the mileage tax on railroads was amended by chapter 282 of the Laws of 1914 so as to impose a tax of $350 a mile on the main line of standard gauge railroads within the district, $87.50 a mile on narrow gauge railroads, and $210 a mile on standard gauge branch lines. Chapter 259 of the Laws of 1926 added to the statute the following proviso: 'Provided further that the tax per mile per annum on the main line of any railroad company which does not own in excess of twenty-five miles of railroad in the Mississippi levee district shall be $50.00 per annum.' The Supreme Court of the state, holding that this proviso was invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment, did not deem it necessary to decide, whether this ruling invalidated merely the proviso or the entire act of 1926, as in either event the tax to be paid would be the same.\n We are not concerned with any question of the state's policy in imposing taxes, or with the various methods employed in the levee district, apart from the application of the Fourteenth Amendment. The question as to the validity of the act of 1926 is raised only by the state tax collector in his official capacity, as one acting solely under the authority of the Legislature whose requirement he contests. The only person taxed by the statute whose rights are before the court is the petitioner, which seeks to uphold the state legislation which defines its liability and with which it has complied. The questions which the collector sought to raise under the state Constitution have not been passed upon by the state court. While, so far as state practice is concerned, the authority of a public officer to assail in the courts of the state the constitutional validity of a state statute is a local question,1 this fact does not alter the fundamental principle, governing the determination of the federal question by this court, that the protec- \n\n[283 U.S. 96, 100]\n\u00a0\n tion of the Fourteenth Amendment against state action is only for the benefit of those who are injured through the invasions of personal or property rights or through the discriminations which the amendment forbids. 2 The constitutional guaranty does not extend to the mere interest of an official, as such, who has not been deprived of his property without due process of law or denied the equal protection of the laws. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n Apart from this consideration, the only question presented is whether the act of 1926 with its proviso, or the proviso alone, is invalid upon its face. The evidence offered to support the classification was excluded, and was treated as being in any event without effect, and the case thus stood before the state court upon the bare terms of the statute. If the facts shown by the evidence, thus excluded. were treated as established ( Fairmont Creamery Co. v. Minnesota, \n274 \nU.S. 1, 5\n, 47 S. Ct. 506, 52 A. L. R. 163), they would have no tendency to invalidate the statute, but rather to sustain it. It appears that there are only two main lines of railroad within the district, that of the Yazoo & Mississippi Valley Railroad Company, extending north and south through the entire levee district parallel with the Mississippi river, and that of the petitioner running east from the Mississippi river. The petitioner sought to show, not only the difference in location, but that the condition of its road and its equipment was inferior to that of the other railroad. The petitioner also offered to prove, and the fact was stipulated subject to objection, that the state tax commission had assessed for ad va- \n\n[283 U.S. 96, 101]\n\u00a0\n lorem taxes the railroad of the petitioner within the levee district at $1, 000 a mile, and that of the other railroad at $32,000 a mile, and, further, that in the classification of railroads by the state railroad commission for the purpose of levying a privilege tax the petitioner was placed with respect to its main line in class 3 and the other railroad in class 1.\n Without attempting to appraise the excluded evidence with respect to the asserted differences between the two railroads, it is sufficient to say that, if this evidence be disregarded, the record shows no factual basis for holding the classification of the statute invalid other than the simple fact that the classification is according to mileage. But the mere selection by the state Legislature, in the exercise of its broad discretion in the imposition of taxes,4 of a mileage basis, and the establishment of a particular class of railroads having less than twenty- five miles of main line within the District, cannot be regarded, in the absence of any further showing, as arbitrary and as constituting a violation of the Federal Constitution. On the contrary, a classification of this sort has frequently been sustained. In Dow v. Beidelman, \n125 \nU.S. 680, 691\n, 8 S. Ct. 1028, 1031, a statute classifying railroads according to mileage, with respect to the passenger fares to be charged, was sustained. The Court said: 'Whether the classification shall be according to the amount of passengers and freight carried, or of gross or net earnings, during a previous year, or according to the simpler and more constant test of the length of the line of the railroad, is a matter within the discretion of the legislature.' To the same effect if Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Co. v. Conley, \n230 \nU.S. 513\n, 33 S. Ct. 985. Similar rulings have been made in upholding other regulatory statutes; e. g., a statute relating to the heating of passenger cars but not applying to railroads less than \n\n[283 U.S. 96, 102]\n\u00a0\n fifty miles in length (New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Co. v. New York, \n165 \nU.S. 628, 633\n, 634 S., 17 S. Ct. 418), and statutes requiring a minimum number of men in train crews but not applying to railroads of less than a stated mileage (Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Co. v. Arkansas, \n219 \nU.S. 453\n, 31 S. Ct. 275; St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Railway Co. v. Arkansas, \n240 \nU.S. 518\n, 36 S. Ct. 443). See, also Wilson v. New, \n243 \nU.S. 332, 354\n, 37 S. Ct. 298, L. R. A. 1917E, 938, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1024\n\n\n As we find no ground for holding the act of 1926 to be invalid under the Federal Constitution, it is unnecessary to consider the questions discussed in relation to the act of 1914.\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Smith v.

Each of the policies provided that in case of fire immediate notice in writing of any loss should be given to the company, and within sixty days a statement should be rendered, signed, and sworn to by the insured, setting forth the time and origin of the fire, the interest of insured and others in the property, the cash value of the items and amount of loss upon each, and other particulars; that the company should not be held to have waived any provision or condition of the policy by any requirement, act, or proceeding on its part relating to the appraisal, or any examination provided for; that the loss should not become payable until sixty days after the notice, ascertainment, estimate, and proof of loss had been received by the company, including an award by an appraiser when appraisal had been required; that no person, unless duly authorized in writing, should be deemed an agent of the insurer in any matter relating to insurance; that no officer, agent, or other representative should have power to waive any provision or condition of the policy except such as by the terms of the policy might be the subject of agreement indorsed thereon or added thereto; and that no waiver should be effective unless written upon or attached to the policy.\n The complaints contained pleas of waiver and estoppel, the substance of which we adopt from the opinion of the court below:\n'The amended complaints alleged that on January 2, 1926, and within two or three hours after the fire had destroyed the building and furniture and fixtures therein, the plaintiff notified appellants' agents of the fire and the extent of the damage and destruction, with the request that they notify their companie. T hat within two or three days thereafter the appellants selected named persons to represent them and authorized such persons to investigate the fire and make estimates as to the value \n\n[282 U.S. 545, 549]\n\u00a0\n of the property destroyed and settle for the loss; that these adjusters for the insurers visited the scene of the fire and made examinations as to the value of the property destroyed and the circumstances surrounding the fire, and had plaintiff furnish them with the items of the property destroyed, the plans and specifications of the building, which plaintiff furnished, and requested plaintiff to furnish assistance to a building contractor selected and appointed by the insurers and their adjusters, who was to make estimates of the value of the property destroyed and collect information as to its condition at the time of the loss; that thereafter on the 27th day of February, 1926, which was the 56th day after the fire, the said adjusters and the members of the plaintiff's board of trustees held a meeting at the scene of the fire; that said building contractor was at said meeting; that said meeting was held for the purpose of discussing the settlement and adjustment of the loss sustained by plaintiff; that thereupon all of the insurers, acting through their said adjusters and agents, stated to plaintiff's board that they had made full and complete investigation as to the fire and the market value of the building and furniture and fixtures therein destroyed by said fire and had obtained all and the correct information thereon, that there was no question as to the loss upon the furniture and fixtures in the sum of $3,400.00 and that appellants were then and there ready to pay plaintiff that sum for its loss on the furniture and fixtures; that said insurers, through their adjusters and agents, at the same time stated that said building was overvalued and could be replaced for the sum of approximately $53,000, and then offered the sum of approximately $56, 000 as full payment for all of the loss to both said buildings and furniture and fixtures destroyed; that plaintiff declined to accept said amount and requested the insurance companies, through their adjusters, to replace said building, this however the insurers refused to do; \n\n[282 U.S. 545, 550]\n\u00a0\n that plaintiff's board at said meeting contended that the value of the building was $75,000; that the value of the building and its replacement cost were the only matters discussed as to which there was any disagreement; no objection was made at any time that proofs of loss had not been furnished by the plaintiff and there was no request for the same; that the insurers at said meeting, by their conduct in offering to pay the full amount of insurance upon the furniture and fixtures and in offering to pay the sum of $53,000 for the loss of the building, led the plaintiff to believe that the only matter in dispute was the market and replacement value of the building, the appellants contending on the one hand that the market and replacement value was the sum of $53,000 and the plaintiff contending that the value was $75,000, and that by reason of the facts stated appellants waived the furnishing of proofs of loss in strict accordance with the provisions of the policies and are estopped to set up and claim such failure to furnish proofs; that appellants, through the examinations and efforts of their adjusters and the assistance of plaintiff's board rendered at the request of the adjusters obtained all the information which could have been obtained had proof of loss been furnished in strict conformity to the policies and the said adjusters led the plaintiff to believe that they had all the information desired with reference to said loss.'\n\n Upon demurrer these allegations must be taken as true. And, unless the stipulation contained in the policy that any waiver to be effective must be written upon or attached to the policy stands in the way, it is clear that the facts alleged are sufficient to constitute a waiver of, or, what amounts to the same thing, an estoppel against setting up, the condition rqui ring verified proofs of loss to be furnished within sixty days. See Firemen's Ins. Co. v. Brooks (C. C. A.) 32 F.(2d) 451, 452, 65 A. L. R. 909; Continental Ins. Co. v. Fortner (C. C. A.) 25 F.(2d) 398, 401, et seq. Cf. Insurance \n\n[282 U.S. 545, 551]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Wolff, \n95 U.S. 326\n, 333. That the stipulation does not stand in the way is settled by the great preponderance of federal and state decisions. The rule deducible from these authorities is that such a stipulation has reference to those provisions and conditions which constitute part of the contract of insurance, and does not apply to a waiver, after the loss occurs, of stipulations in respect of things to be done subsequent to the loss as prerequisites to adjustment and payment. It is enough to cite, as examples Continental Ins. Co. v. Fortner, supra, 25 F.(2d) page 402; Home Ins. Co. v. Hightower (C. C. A.) 22 F.(2d) 882, 885, 62 A. L. R. 620; Twin City Fire Ins. Co. v. Stockmen's Nat. Bank (C. C. A.) 261 F. 470, 476.\n With some exceptions, the cases decided by this Court, relied upon by petitioners (e. g., Lumber Underwriters v. Rife, \n237 \nU.S. 605\n, 35 S. Ct. 717), merely apply the familiar principle that parol proof may not be received to vary the terms of a written instrument; and nothing in any of them is in conflict with, the rule as above stated. Scottish Union & Nat. Ins. Co. v. Encampment Smelting Co. (C. C. A.) 166 F. 231, supports petitioners' contention; and it was because of the conflict created by that case that the certiorari here was granted. We cannot accept the theory of that case. It is out of harmony with the general current of authority, and with the views we have expressed. A late decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit clearly indicates that, if the same question were again before that court, the Scottish Union Case would not be followed. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Empire Coal Min. Co., 30 F.(2d) 794, 802.\n Second. The trial court allowed interest upon the amount of the loss beginning sixty days from the last date upon which proofs of loss were due under the terms of the policies. The contention is that the allowance of interest in a case of this kind is controlled by section 5972, Compiled Oklahoma Statutes, 1921, and that that statute as \n\n[282 U.S. 545, 552]\n\u00a0\n construed by the State Supreme Court does not allow interest prior to the rendition of judgment. The section referred to reads:\n'Any person who is entitled to recover damages certain, or capable of being made certain by calculation, and the right to recover which is vested in him upon a particular day, is entitled also to recover interest thereon from that day, except during such time as the debtor is prevented by law, or by the act of the creditor from paying the debt.'\n\n The general rule that a federal court will follow the decisions of the highest court of a state construing a state statute is, of course, well established. The difficulty here is that, prior to the judgment of the federal district court in this case allowing interest, the decisions of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma were in such confusion that the view of that court in respect of the meaning of the statute, as applied to the present case, could not definitely be determined.\n In City of Chickasha v. Hollingsworth et al., 56 Okl. 341, 155 P. 859, it was held that interest could not be recovered upon unliquidated damages where a judgment on verdict was necessary in order to ascertain the amount; and that decision was followed in St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Robison, 72 Okl. 269, 180 P. 702, where the action was under a hail insurance policy to recover for damages to a crop of cotton. On the contrary, in City of Oklahoma City v. Hoke, 75 Okl. 211, 182 P. 692, it was held that, in an action for the destruction of crops due to an overflow caused by the maintenance of a dam, damages and interest from the time of the injury must be allowed on the ground that the value of the property destroyed was susceptible of computation. And again in Hartford FireIns urance Co. v. Bernard, 99 Okl. 44, 221 P. 1011, in an action upon a fire insurance policy for unliquidated damages, it was held that, since the amount could be ascertained by calculation based on the reasonable \n\n[282 U.S. 545, 553]\n\u00a0\n market value of the property insured, interest should be allowed from the them when the insurance company should have satisfied the claim. In the still later case of Midland Valley R. Co. v. Price, 127 Okl. 106, 260 P. 26, where the action was for death of cattle caused by the negligence of a common carrier, and damage for the loss was based on the market value, it was held that interest was recoverable from the date of the injury.\n From an examination and comparison of these cases and others it is evidence that the federal trial court could not say that the State Supreme Court definitely had so construed the statute as to deny to the insured the right to recover interest from the date when payment for the loss should have been made; and the federal court was free to construe the statute for itself.\n Petitioners, however, rely upon American Eagle Fire Ins. Co. v. Lively, 142 Okl. 246, 286 P. 797, 799, as finally having settled the question in harmony with their contention. Whether it does so is, at least, doubtful. The action there was upon a fire insurance policy. the property destroyed consisting mostly of library books and some household furniture. In disposing of the question of interest the court said:\n'Considering the nature of the property destroyed and the difficulty in ascertaining the actual or fair value thereof, we think interest should not have been allowed until the claim was reduced to judgment.'\n\n Assuming this to be a correct exposition of the statute as applied to that case, it does not follow, in the light of some of the other decisions digested above, that the same rule would be applied to the destruction of a house, the replacement or fair value of which could be ascertained without much difficulty. But that inquiry may be put aside, since the decision was handed down on April 8, 1930, more than a year after the present judgment had been entered by the federal district court, and whatever \n\n[282 U.S. 545, 554]\n\u00a0\n may be the prospective effect of this last decision it cannot be given a retroactive effect in respect of the judgment of the federal district court so as to 'make that erroneous which was not so when the judgment of that court was given.' Morgan v. Curtenius et al., 20 How. 1, 3; Pease v. Peck, 18 How. 595, 598; Roberts v. Bolles, \n101 U.S. 119\n, 128-129; Burgess v. Seligman, 107 U. S., 20, 35, 2 S. Ct. 10; Edward Hines Trustees v. Martin, \n268 \nU.S. 458\n, 45 S. Ct. 543; Fleischmann Co. v. Murray (C. C.) 161 F. 162.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals thought that the matter of interest was controlled by section 5977, Compiled Oklahoma Statutes 1921, which provides:\n'The detriment caused by the breach of an obligation to pay money only is deemed to be the amount due by the terms of the obligation, with interest thereon.'\n\n Here the insurance companies had admitted their liability in the sum of $3,400 for furniture and fixtures and in the sum of $53,000 for the building, the latter amount being based upon what they insisted would be the cost of replacement. The only dispute between the parties was as to the latter item. Respondent contended that the value of the building was $ 75,000, but expressed a willingness and desire to have petitioners make the replacement. Under the terms of the insurance surance contracts the companies became liable to pay the amount of the loss not later than sixty days after proof of loss, or within one hundred and twenty days in all from the date of the loss. In the light of these facts it is immaterial whether section 5972 or section 5977 be invoked. In the absence of an authoritative state decision to the contrary, there was nothing in either which required the trial court in rendering its judgment to depart from the rule in respect of the allowance of interst which this court had recognized, namely, that, even in a case of unliquidated damages, 'when necessary in order to arrive at fair compensation, the court in the exercise of a sound discretion may include \n\n[282 U.S. 545, 555]\n\u00a0\n interest or its equivalent as an element of damages.' Miller v. Robertson, \n266 U.S. 243\n, 257-259, 45 S. Ct. 73, 78, and cases cited. See, also, Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 76, 79\n, 45 S. Ct. 211; Bernhard v. Rochester German Ins. Co., 79 Conn. 388, 397, 65 A. 134, 8 Ann. Cas. 298. Under the facts disclosed by the record, the principles established by these decisions fully justified the allowance of interest made by the district court in this case.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","40":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOOLIDGE v. LONG(1931)\nNo. 33\nArgued: Decided: February 24, 1931\n\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 582, 584]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert G. Dodge and Harold S. Davis, both of Boston, Mass., for appellants.\n\n\n[282 U.S. 582, 589]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James S. Eastham, of Lawrence, Mass., and Joseph E. Warner, of Boston, Mass., for appellee.\n\n\n[282 U.S. 582, 593]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Each of these appeals brings here for review a decree of the probate court of Norfolk county, Mass., entered in accordance with a rescript from the Supreme Judicial Court of the commonwealth. 167 N. E. 757, 758. In each appellants presented to the probate court an application for the abatement of an inheritance tax assessed under section 1, c. 65, General Laws. There was drawn in question the validity of the statute on the ground of its being repugnant to the contract clause of the Federal Constitution and the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The probate court reserved for the consideration of the Supreme Judicial Court all questions of law and the matter of what decrees should be entered. That court held the statute valid, and sustained the taxes.\n The opinion states the facts as follows:\n'The petitioners (appellants here) are trustees under a deed and declaration of trust executed on July 29, 1907, by J. Randolph Coolidge and Julia Coolidge and the petitioners.\n\n'By that deed a large amount of real and personal estate was transferred to the trustees by the settlors voluntarily and not as a bona fide purchase for full consideration in money or in money's worth. The trustees were given extensive powers of management, investment and reinvestment with the right to determine finally what receipts and payments should be credited to income or principal. The part of the trust fund furnished by J. Randolph Coolidge was four- sevenths, and the part furnished by Julia Coolidge was three-sevenths.\n\n'By the terms of the trust the income was to be paid in these proportions to each of the settlors during their joint lives and then the entire income to the survivor, and, \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 594]\n\u00a0\n upon the death of the survivor, the principal was to be divided equally among their five sons, provided that, if any of the sons should predecease the survivor of the settlors, his share should go to those entitled to take his intestate property under the statute of distributions in force at the death of such survivor, with a further provision to the effect that in no event should a widow of such deceased son take as distributee more than half of such share.\n\n'There was in the declaration of trust no power of revocation or modification or termination prior to the death of the survivor of the settlors. Coolidge v. Loring, 235 Mass. 220 (126 N. E. 276).\n\n'By instrument executed on April 6, 1917, the settlors assigned their interest in the trust to the five sons, all of whom eventually survived the termination of the trust.\n\n'Julia Coolidge died in January, 1921, and J. Randolph Coolidge on November 10, 1925, both being residents of this Commonwealth.\n\n'The defendant determined that the petitioners were subject to excise taxes under G. L. c. 65,  1, as amended, upon the four-sevenths and upon the three-sevenths of the trust estate furnished respectively by each settlor as of November 10, 1925.'\n\n When the declaration of trust was excuted, on statute was in effect under which the succession to the trust property could have been subjected to this tax. The statutes then in force provided for the imposition of an excise only where the succession was to collateral relatives and strangers. The first relevant statute was approved June 27, 1907 (St. 1907, c. 563), and took effect September 1, about five weeks after the date of the declaration of the trust. It did not apply to property passing by deed, grant, sale, or gift made prior to its effective date. But by section 3, c. 678, St. 1912, it was made applicable 'to all property passing by deed, grant or gift ... made or intended to \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 595]\n\u00a0\n take effect in possession or enjoyment after the death of the grantor or donor, if such death occurs subsequent to the passage hereof.' And see section 1, c. 563, St. 1914\n\n\n Chapter 65, General Laws, effective since January 1, 1921, provides:\n Section 1. 'All property within the jurisdiction of the commonwealth ... which shall pass by ... deed, grant or gift, except in cases of a bona fide purchase for full consideration in money or money's worth ... made or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after his (grantor's) death ... to any person, absolutely or in trust ... shall be subject to a tax. ...'\n Section 36. 'This chapter shall apply only to property or interests therein passing or accruing upon the death of persons dying on or after May fourth, nineteen hundred and twenty. ...'\n The Supreme Judicial Court sustained the exaction as an excise. It held that possession or enjoyment upon the death of the survivor of the settlors was a taxable commodity under the statute enacted after the creation of the trust.\n The trust deeds are contracts within the meaning of the contract clause of the Federal Constitution. They were fully executed before the taking effect of the state law under which the excise is claimed. The commonwealth was without authority by subsequent legislation, whether enacted under the guise of its power to tax or otherwise, to alter their effect or to impair or destroy rights which had vested under them. Appleby v. City of New York, \n271 \nU.S. 364\n, 46 S. Ct. 569; Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 87, 136; Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 624, 656; Farrington v. Tennessee, \n95 U.S. 679\n, 683; Carondelet Canal Co. v. Louisiana, \n233 \nU.S. 362, 373\n, 378 S., 34 S. Ct. 627.\n This Court has held that the Revenue Act of 1924,  319-324 (26 USCA  1131 note to 1133 note, 1134, 1135 note, 1136 note), in so far as it undertook to impose a tax on gifts fully consummated before its provisions came before \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 596]\n\u00a0\n Congress (Blodgett v. Holden, \n275 \nU.S. 142\n, 48 S. Ct. 105) or before its passage (Untermyer v. Anderson, \n276 \nU.S. 440\n, 48 S. Ct. 353), was arbitrary and repugnant to the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. In Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531\n, 47 S. Ct. 710, 52 A. L. R. 1081, we considered the trust deed of Mrs. Coolidge that is now before us. The question in that case was whether the value of the property so conveyed prior to the enactment should be included in her estate for the purpose of ascertaining the federal estate tax thereon. We said (page 542 of 274 U. S., 47 S. Ct. 710, 714):\n'This court has recognized that a statute purporting to tax may be so arbitrary and capricious as to amount to confiscation and offend the Fifth Amendment. Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 24\n, 36 S. Ct. 236, L. R. A. 1917D, 414, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713; Barclay & Co. v. Edwards, \n267 \nU.S. 442, 450\n, 45 S. Ct. 135, 348. See, also, Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 77\n, 20 S. Ct. 747. And we must conclude that section 402(c) of the statute here under consideration, in so far as it requires that there shall be included in the gross estate the value of property transferred by a decedent prior to its passage merely because the conveyance was intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death, is arbitrary, capricious and amounts to confiscation.'\n\n See Levy v. Wardell, \n258 \nU.S. 542, 544\n, 42 S. Ct. 395. The states are similarly restrained by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n In its opinion, the state court suggests that the federal estate tax was upon property of the deceased transferred at his death, and that it was levied upon a subject 'quite different from the succession to property by a beneficiary, which is the subject of the present excise.' Undoubtedly the state has power to lay such an excise upon property so passing after the taking effect of the taxing act. The fundamental question here is whether rights had so vested prior to the taking effect of the tax statute that there was thereafter no occasion in respect of which the excise might constitutionally be imposed. The state court held that \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 597]\n\u00a0\n the succession was not complete until the death of the survivor of the grantors, and that therefore the tax is valid. It is well understood that, when the jurisdiction of this court is invoked to determine whether a state law impairs the rights of the litigant under a prior contract, or whether the state is depriving him of his property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the question turns upon the existence or terms of a contract, this court is bound to determine for itself whether there is a contract and to ascertain its true meaning and effect. That rule is necessary in order that this court may properly enforce these provisions of the Constitution. Railroad Commission v. Eastern Texas R. R., \n264 \nU.S. 79, 86\n, 44 S. Ct. 247, and cases cited.\n By the deed of each grantor one-fifth of the remainder was immediately vested in each of the sons, subject to be divested only by his death before the death of the survivor of the settlors. It was a grant in praesenti, to be possessed and enjoyed by the sons upon the death of such survivor. Blanchard v. Blanchard, 1 Allen (Mass.) 223; Clarke v. Fay, 205 Mass. 228, 91 N. E. 328, 27 L. R. A. (N. S.) 454; McArthur v. Scott, \n113 \nU.S. 340, 379\n, 5 S. Ct. 652, and cases cited. And see United States v. Fidelity Trust Co., \n222 \nU.S. 158\n, 32 S. Ct. 59; Henry v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 393\n, 40 S. Ct. 185. The provision for the payment of income to the settlors during their lives did not operate to postpone the vesting in the sons of the right of possession or enjoyment. The settlors divested themselves of all control over the principal; they had no power to revoke or modify the trust. Coolidge v. Loring, supra, page 223 of 235 Mass., 126 N. E. 276. Upon the happening of the event specified without more, the trustees were bound to hand over the property to the beneficiaries. Neither the death of Mrs. Coolidge nor of her husband was a generating source of any right in the remaindermen. Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 56\n, 20 S. Ct. 747. Nothing moed from her or him or from the estates of either when she or he died. There was no transmission \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 598]\n\u00a0\n then. The rights of the remaindermen, including possession and enjoyment upon the termination of the trusts, were derived solely from the deeds. The situation would have been precisely the same if the possibility of divestment had been made to cease upon the death of a third person instead of upon the death of the survivor of the settlors. The succession, when the time came, did not depend upon any permission or grant of the commonwealth. While the sons, if occasion should arise, might by appropriate suit require the trustees to account, it is to be borne in mind that the property was never in the custody of the law or of any court. Resort might be had to the law to enforce the rights that had vested. But the commonwealth was powerless to condition possession or enjoyment of what had been conveyed to them by the deeds. Barnitz v. Beverly, \n163 \nU.S. 118\n, 16 S. Ct. 1042, and cases cited.\n The fact that each son was liable to be divested of the remainder by his own death before that of the survivor of the grantors does not render the succession incomplete. The vesting of actual possession and enjoyment depended upon an event which must inevitably happen by the efflux of time, and nothing but his failure to survive the settlors could prevent it. Blanchard v. Blanchard, supra; Moore v. Lyons, 25 Wend. (N. Y.) 119, 144. Succession is effected as completely by a transfer of a life estate to one and remainder over to another as by a transfer in fee. Reinecke v. Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339, 347\n, 348 S., 49 S. Ct. 123, 66 A. L. R. 397. The recent case of Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260\n, 48 S. Ct. 225, furnishes a good illustration of incomplete succession. There the remainder was liable at any time during the settlor's life to be divested through the exertion of the power of alteration and revocation that was reserved in the instrument creating the trust. The decision sustaining a transfer tax went upon the ground that 'the gift taxed is ... one which never passed to the beneficiaries beyond recall until the death of the donor. ... A \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 599]\n\u00a0\n power of appointment reserved by the donor leaves the transfer, as to him, incomplete and subject to tax. ... The beneficiary's acquisition of the property is equally incomplete whether the power be reserved to the donor or another.' Page 271 of 276 U. S., 48 S. Ct. 225, 227. See, also, Chase Nat. Bank v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 327, 335\n, 338 S., 49 S. Ct. 126, 63 A. L. R. 388.\n No act of Congress has been held by this court to impose a tax upon possession and enjoyment, the right to which had fully vested prior to the enactment.\n Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497\n, 50 S. Ct. 356, 69 A. L. R. 758, held constitutional sections 201 and 202 of the Revenue Acts of 1916, 39 Stat. 756, 777, 778, and of 1921,  401, 402, 42 Stat. 227, 277, 278, which included in the gross estate the value of an interest held by decedent and any other person as tenants by the entirety. In each case, the estate was created after the passage of the applicable act; and none of the property constituting it had prior to its creation ever belonged to the surviving spouse. The court held that the acts did not impose a direct tax, because, putting aside a common-law fiction, and having regard to substance, the death of one of the parties was in fact the generating source of important and definite accessions to the property rights of the other. It held that the provisions were intended to prevent an avoidance of the estate tax by the creation of such tenancies, and were obviously neither arbitrary nor capricious, and so not violative of the Fifth Amendment.\n Clapp v. Mason, \n94 U.S. 589\n, and Mason v. Sargent, \n104 U.S. 689\n, arose under the Succession Tax Act of June 30, 1864,  124 et seq., 13 Stat. 285. Vanderbilt v. Eidman, \n196 \nU.S. 480\n, 25 S. Ct. 331, and Hertzv. Woodman, \n218 \nU.S. 205\n, 30 S. Ct. 621, arose under a similar act of June 13, 1898,  29 and 30, 30 Stat. 464. In all these cases, the property vested in interest after the acts took effect, and the decisions went on the ground that the right to impose the excises did not accrue until the subsequent vesting in possession and enjoyment. Under these acts, the mere \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 600]\n\u00a0\n passage of title was not sufficient; possession and enjoyment were also required. Wright v. Blakeslee, \n101 U.S. 174\n, 177, went upon the ground that, up to the moment of the life tenant's death, 'her children had no interest in the land except a bare contingent remainder expectant upon her death and their surviving her. At her death it came to them as an estate in fee in possession absolute.'\n This court has not sustained any state law imposing an excise upon mere entry into possession and enjoyment of property, where the right to such possession and enjoyment upon the happening of a specified event had fully vested before the enactment.\n In Cahen v. Brewster, \n203 \nU.S. 543\n, 27 S. Ct. 174, 8 Ann. Cas. 215, the testator died May 26, 1904, the will was probated May 30, and a special inheritance tax law was passed June 28. It imposed a tax upon all inheritances and legacies, and provided that the tax should not be enforced when the property had borne its just proportion of taxes prior to the time of the inheritance, and that the tax should be collected on all successions not finally closed. The enactment was assailed as repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. This court held that the state, without unconstitutional deprivation, could exercise its power to impose inheritance taxes at any time while it holds the property from the legatee, page 551 of 203 U. S., 27 S. Ct. 174; and, dealing with the contention that taxing successions not closed, and exemption those that had been closed, operated to deny equal protection, the court said (page 552 of 203 U. S., 27 S. Ct. 174, 177): 'It was certainly not improper classification to make the tax depend upon a fact without which it would not have been valid.' As the court said in United States v. Jones, \n236 \nU.S. 106, 112\n, 35 S. Ct. 261, 263, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 316, 'It hardly needs statement that personal property does not pass directly from a decedent to legatees or distributees, but goes primarily to the executor or administrator, who is to apply it, so far as may be necessary, in paying debts \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 601]\n\u00a0\n of the deceased and expenses of administration, and is then to pass the residue, if any, to legatees or distributees.' See, also, Carpenter v. Pennsylvania, 17 How, 456, 462.\n In Moffitt v. Kelly, \n218 \nU.S. 400\n, 31 S. Ct. 79, 30 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1179, Moffitt married in California in 1863, and resided there with his wife until his death in 1906. By his will, he gave to her and their children as if he had died intestate. A state law passed in 1905 imposed a tax upon property so descending. The state court sustained the tax upon the wife's share in the community property. This court held that the nature and character of her right was a local question, and that the tax was not violative of the contract clause of the Constitution or the due process or equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In United States v. Robbins, \n269 \nU.S. 315, 326\n, 46 S. Ct. 148, 149, this court considered the character of the wife's estate during the existence of the community, and said: 'We can see no sufficient reason to doubt that the settled opinion of the Supreme Court of California, at least with reference to the time before the later statutes, is that the wife had a mere expectancy while living with her husband. The latest decision that we have seen dealing directly with the matter explicitly takes that view, says that it is a rule of property that has been settled for more than 60 years. ...' See, also, Poe v. Seaborn, \n282 \nU.S. 101, 116\n, 51 S.  Ct . 58. Cf. Nickel v. Cole, \n256 \nU.S. 222, 225\n, 41 S. Ct. 467.\n Chanler v. Kelsey, \n205 \nU.S. 466\n, 27 S. Ct. 550, arose under the New York inheritance tax law of 1897 (Laws N. Y. 1897, c. 284). Prior to its enactment, a father conveyed property to trustees to pay the income to his daughter for life, with remainder to her issue in fee, or, in default of issue, to her heirs in fee, and gave her power by will to appoint the remainder among her issue or heirs is such manner and proportions as she might determine. She died in 1902, and by her will exercised the power. The tax law deemed such appointment a transfer, and made it taxable. It was attacked as repugnant to the \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 602]\n\u00a0\n due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the contract clause. This court held that without such appointment the estates in remainder would have gone to all in the class named in the deeds, that, by the exercise of the power, some were divested of their estates and the same were vested in others, and that it was only on the exercise of the power that the estates of the appointees became complete. And it sustained the tax. Justice Holmes and Moody, dissenting, insisted that the succession was complete when the father's deeds took effect, and that 'the execution of the power did not depend in any way upon the continued cooperation of the laws of New York by way of permission or grant.' Page 481 of 205 U. S., 27 S. Ct. 550, 555.\n The overwhelming weight of authority sustains the conclusion that the succession in the present case was complete when the deed took effect.\n In Matter of Pell, 171 N. Y. 48, 63 N. E. 789, 57 L. R. A. 540, 89 Am. St. Rep. 791, the testator's will gave a life estate in his property to his widow, with remainders over at her death to his nephews and nieces and the issue of any deceased nephew or niece, together with a share to his sister. He died in 1863. The life tenant died December 20, 1899, and at that time all the estates in remainder came into actual possession and enjoyment of the beneficiaries. The Act of March 14, 1899 (chapter 76, Laws of that year), provided:\n'All estates upon remainder ... which vested prior to June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and eighty-five, but which will not come into actual possession or enjoyment of the person ... beneficially interested therein until after the passage of this act shall be appraised and taxed as soon as the person ... beneficially interested therein shall be entitled to the actual possession or enjoyment thereof.'\n\n The court said (page 55 of 171 N. Y., 63 N. E. 789, 791):\n'This court and the Supreme Court of the United States have held in numerous cases that the transfer tax is not imposed upon property, but upon the right to suc- \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 603]\n\u00a0\n cession. It therefore follows that where there was a complete vesting of a residuary estate before the enactment of the transfer tax statute, it cannot be reached by that form of taxation. In the case before us it is an undisputed fact that these remainders had vested in 1863, and the only contingency leading to their divesting was the death of a remainderman in the lifetime of the life tenant, in which event the children of the one so dying would be substituted. If these estates in remainder were vested prior to the enactment of the transfer tax act, there could be in no legal sense a transfer of the property at the time of possession and enjoyment. This being so to impose a tax based on the succession would be to diminish the value of these vested estates, to impair the obligation of a contract, and take private property for public use without compensation.'\n\n Matter of Craig, 97 App. Div. 289, 89 N. Y. S. 971 (affirmed 181 N. Y. 551, 74 N. E. 1116). involved a similar state of facts. The court said ( page 296 of 97 App. Div., 89 N. Y. S. 971, 975):\n'The underlying principle which supports the tax is that such right ( the right of succession) is not a natural one, but is in fact a privilege only, and that the authority conferring the privilege may impose conditons upon its exercise. But when the privilege has ripened into a right it is too late to impose conditions of the character in question, and when the right is conferred by a lawfully executed grant or contract it is property, and not a privilege, and as such is protected from legislative encroachment by constitutional guaranties.'\n\n In Hunt v. Wicht, 174 Cal. 205, 162 P. 639, L. R. A. 1917C, 961, the court held that a deed delivered by grantor to a third person in escrow, to be delivered to grantee on the death of the grantor, passed a present title to the grantee, the grantor retaining only a life estate; and that the Legislature was without power subsequently to impose a succession tax accruing at the termination of the grantor's life estate simply because the \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 604]\n\u00a0\n grantee was during the intervening life estate without immediate possession of the property conveyed. The court said (page 209 of 174 Cal., 162 P. 639, 641): 'It is the vesting in interest that constitutes the succession, and the question of liability to such a tax must be determined by the law in force at that time. ... What we have said appears perfectly clear on principle, and is sustained by practically all of the authorities in other states where the question has arisen.'\n In Lacey v. State Treasurer, 152 Iowa, 477, 132 N. W. 843, a contract created a vested interest in real estate, subject only to postponement of the right of possession and enjoyment until the death of the grantor. The court held that there was a transfer of a present interest, and that its character was not affected by a condition therein that might subsequently reduce the share of each grantee. It was also held (pages 483, 484 of 152 Iowa, 132 N. W. 843, 846):\n'Even though the remainder is so far conditional that it may have to be opened up to let in after-born children, and on the other hand, may be divested by death without issue of the person named, nevertheless it constitutes a vested interest, not subject to a subsequent collateral inheritance tax statute, passed before the termination of the life estate. In re Seaman, 147 N. Y. 69, 41 N. E. 401. Any attempted litigation imposing a collateral inheritance tax upon interests in remainder, which have become vested by the taking effect of the will creating them, would be unconstitutional. In re Pell, 171 N. Y. 48, 63 N. E. 789, 57 L. R. A. 540, 89 Am. St. Rep. 791.'\n\n In re Houston's Estate, 276 Pa. 330, 120 A. 267, a deed irrevocably conveyed property in trust to pay income to the settlor for life and at her death to a remainderman. The statute then in force imposed a 5 per cent. tax on transfers intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death. The life tenant died after the taking effect of legislation, which increased the rate to 10 per. cent. The court held the estate passing to the emainderman \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 605]\n\u00a0\n taxable at 5 per cent., and not at the higher rate fixed by the later statute. The opinion of the orphans' court, adopted by the Supreme Court, said (page 331 of 276 Pa., 120 A. 267, 268):\n'Nor can it be successfully argued that the tax is not on the transfer of title to the property, but on the transfer of enjoyment, for, as it seems to us, the act means by this the right of enjoyment, and this was vested under the deed. If the tax is imposed when enjoyment is perfected by actual possession, and this theory is carried to its logical conclusion, it would seem that, if during the administration of an estate, delays occur, as they necessarily must, and if before actual distribution is made the rate of taxation is changed, a legacy would be taxed at the changed rate, which would appear to be a reductio ad absurdum.'\n\n In State ex rel. v. Probate Court, 102 Minn. 268, 113 N. W. 888, an owner of much property organized a corporation and, his wife joining, conveyed practically all to the corporation. It issued its shares to him, and he gave one-third to her. Then they transferred the stock to their four children, who leased two-thirds to the father for his life and one- third tothe mother for her life. The father died in 1905 after the taking effect of an inheritance tax law enacted in that year. The court held that the leases vested in each parent a life estate in the stock, and reserved to the children estates in reversion which were beyond the control of the life tenants; and that the interests of the children vested when the leases were made, came into possession upon the termination of the life estates, and that the inheritance tax could not be collected thereon. See, also, Commonwealth v. Wellford, 114 Va. 372, 79 S. E. 917, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 419.\n We conclude that the succession was complete when the trust deeds of Mr. and Mrs. Coolidge took effect, and that the enforcement of the statute imposing the excise in question would be repugnant to the contract clause of the Constitution and the due process clause of the Four- \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 606]\n\u00a0\n teenth Amendment. We need not consider whether it would also conflict with the equal protection clause.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS (dissenting).\n The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has construed and applied the statute as one taxing the taking of possession of property by a remainderman whose interest, acquired before the death of the donor, vested in possession and enjoyment, and free of a contingent gift over, on the donor's death. That court said:\n'The ... statute ... is designed to include within its sweep all methods of succession to property to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the death of the grantor or donor. ... Whenever property is conveyed upon such limitation that it will vest in interest, possession or enjoyment by reason of the death of the grantor or donor, such succession falls within the descriptive words of the statute.\n\n'The succession to any of these attributes of property occurring as the result of the death of the grantor or donor constitutes the taxable commodity.'\n\n And also said:\n'The 'tax authorized by these statutes is a tax upon 'succession' which includes the 'privileges enjoyed by the beneficiary of succeeding to the possession and enjoyment of property.\" ...\n\n'The present tax is not laid on the donor, but on the beneficiary; the gift taxed is not one long since completed, but one which never passed to the beneficiaries beyond recall until the death of the donor. ... So long as the privilege of succession has not been fully exercised it may be reached by the tax. ...'\n\n We are bound by the state court's determination as to the meaning of the statute, Nickel v. Cole, \n256 \nU.S. 222\n, 41 S. Ct. 467; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260\n, 48 S. Ct. 225; and its applica- \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 607]\n\u00a0\n tion, Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137\n, 45 S. Ct. 424, 44 A. L. R. 1454; Cahen v. Brewster, \n203 \nU.S. 545\n, 27 S. Ct. 174, 8 Ann. Cas. 215; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, supra.\n The application of the statute, thus defined, is held by this Court to be a denial of due process, and an impairment of the obligation of a contract, on the sole ground that the remainder vested before the adoption of the taxing statute, although the enjoyment in possession of the property, and the termination of the possibility of the contingent gift over, both followed its enactment. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[282 U.S. 582, 608]\n\u00a0\n This is to deny to the commonwealth the power to distinguish, in laying its tax, between the vesting of a defeasible future interest which carries to the beneficiary no assurance of future possession or enjoyment and the later vesting of that interest by death in possession and enjoyment of the tangible property, without possibility of being divested. It is to assert that the succession is so complete upon the mere creation of the future interest that the state must tax the future estate when that interest comes into being, or thereafter abstain entirely from taxing it.\n This position seems to me untenable. It is founded on the premise that the only privilege enjoyed by the holder of a future interest in property is the dry legal abstraction of owning that particular interest- that, if it vested years ago, to tax the owner later on the occasion of his coming into actual possession, control, and enjoyment of the property is in fact to tax him presently for the exercise of a privilege long since enjoyed.\n In weighing the argument, it is essential that the nature of the challenged tax be kept clearly in mind.\n Excises laid in respect of the privilege of transmitting property rights at death, and those laid on the correlative privilege of acquiring the same rights, are common. The phrases 'transfer,' 'estate,' and 'succession' taxes, and 'death duties,' are somewhat indiscriminately used to designate the two wholly different forms of tax. It will tend to clarity to employ the more usual phraseology and refer hereafter to the excise on the privilege of transmission as a transfer tax, and that on the privilege of reception as a succession tax. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[282 U.S. 582, 609]\n\u00a0\n Since no one has the natural right either to own property or to transfer it to others at his death, but derives the power so to do solely from the state, the sovereign may tax the owner for the privilege of transmission conferred by law. United States v. Perkins, \n163 \nU.S. 625, 628\n, 16 S. Ct. 1073. The right to receive and enjoy that which was formerly owned by another is similarly derived, and upon like principles the sovereign may tax the taker for the privilege accorded. Mager v. Grima, 8 How. 490, 494; Plummer v. Coler, \n178 U.S. 115\n, 130-132, 20 S. Ct. 829. So distinct are these privileges that either or both may be taxed as respects the same property. Stebbins v. Riley, supra: Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, supra.\n The one is collected on the transfer of his estate by a decedent; it taxes not that to which some person succeeds upon a death, but that which ceased by reason of death. Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531, 537\n, 47 S. Ct. 710, 52 A. L. R. 1081; Edwards v. Slocum, \n264 \nU.S. 61, 62\n, 44 S. Ct. 293. The other is laid on the right to become beneficially entitled to property on the death of its former owner. Keeney v. Comptroller of State of New York, \n222 \nU.S. 525, 533\n, 32 S. Ct. 105, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1139; Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U. S. at page 541, 47 S. Ct. 710, 52 A. L. R. 1081.\n The latter type of excise has existed in Massachusetts for years, and the courts of that commonwealth have consistently construed the statutes as they did in this case. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Though the settlor's children took a vested interest by the delivery of the deed of trust in 1907, it was subject to be divested, as to any child, by his death prior to that of the survivor of the settlors. Until the parents died, it could not be known whether a child ever would possess or enjoy the trust property. Until then he had none of the rights of an owner in fee. He could not obtain \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 610]\n\u00a0\n possession; that was in the trustees. He could neither spend the income nor direct its expenditure; the provisions of the deed of trust governed these matters.\n In 1917 the parents conveyed their life estates to the children. The latter, conceiving that this entitled them, as sole owners, to the possession and enjoyment of the property, demanded of the trustees delivery of the corpus. This was refused. The settlors then filed a bill to reform the trust instrument so that it should provide that, by surrender of the parents' life interests to the children, the trust should terminate. They alleged that it was the true intent of the parties that the contingent remainders in the next of kin of the children should not vest if the interest of the settlors was released previous to the death of the survivor, and that appropriate language to express this intent had by mistake been omitted from the deed. The court held that no case had been made for the reformation of the deed, and refused relief. The trust property remained in the control and under the administration of the trustees. Coolidge v. Loring, 235 Mass. 220, 126 N. E. 276.\n The appellants, nevertheless, assert that, while the children may have required the state's aid at the time of the delivery of the deed of trust, they never again had occasion to rely on the state's assistance; that the transfer to and into the beneficiaries was then complete; that they needed to do nothing more to become possessed of and enjoy their property; that merely to sit still and await the deaths of their parents did not constitute the doing of anything; that the vesting of their remainder interests in 1907 covers and includes its consequence, namely, their acquirement of tangible property and the enjoyment thereof at their parents' death. In short, appellants insist that the beneficiaries did not have to look to the laws of Massachusetts for the right of possession or enjoyment; and that consequently an alleged taxing of the \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 611]\n\u00a0\n succession on the occasion of their acquiring such possession and enjoyment is but a thinly veiled attempt retroactively to tax the acquisition of an interest which vested in 1907.\n But it is obvious that the children did rely on the law of Massachusetts for their right to receive the trust property from the trustees; and it might well have been they would have had to resort to her courts to obtain possession. All the law applicable to the administration of trusts, regulating the acts of trustees, giving remedies for trustees' defaults, providing for their compensation, and requiring the full execution of their fiduciary duties, was available to appellants. Without it their future interest, by way of remainder, might have been the merest shadow.\n In spite of this, it is said that the succession is one and entire; that it must be taxed at its inception or not at all; that it is wholly out of the ordinary to tax it on the occasion of its fruition in possession; and that this court has held the attempt so to do violative of the Constitution. The converse of these propositions is true. This Court has repeatedly approved the selection of the event of possession and enjoyment as the proper occasion for the imposition of an excise; and every applicable decision of the Court sustains the validity of the tax and supports the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.\n First. In laying succession taxes, the United States has chosen as the occasion therefor, not the acquirement of a mere technical legal interest in property, but the coming into actual possession and enjoyment; and this fact has been recognized by this Court.\n By the act of June 30, 1864,  124 (13 Stat. 285), a tax was imposed on legacies and distributive shares arising from personal property '... passing, after the passage of this act, from any person possessed of such property, either by \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 612]\n\u00a0\n will or by the intestate laws ... or any personal property or interest therein, transferred by deed, grant, bargain, sale, or gift, made or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the death of the grantor or bargainor. ...'\n Section 127 provided that 'every past or future disposition of real estate by will, deed, or laws of descent, by reason whereof any person shall become beneficially entitled, in possession or expectancy, to any real estate, of the income thereof, upon the death of any person dying after the passing of this act,' should constitute the person so taking a successor and make him liable to a tax.\n In Clapp v. Mason, \n94 U.S. 589\n, a testator, who died in 1867, devised real estate to his widow for life, with remainder to her children. She died in 1872, and the children's interests then took effect in enjoyment. The tax was assessed in 1873. It was paid under protest because the act of June 30, 1864, had been repealed by Act of July 14, 1870 (16 Stat. 256) on all legacies and successions after August 1, 1870. In an action against the collector to recover the amount paid, he defened on the ground that the tax accrued on creation of the remainder in 1867. The devisees in remainder contended that it did not accrue until they came into possession, which was subsequent to the repeal of the taxing act. This Court held that the occasion of the tax was not the vesting of the remainder, but the coming into possession by the successor. The corollary seems clear enough that, if a remainderman had died during the life estate, the statute would not have justified a tax upon him measured by the clear value of the property in which he owned only a future interest.\n The case was followed in Mason v. Sargent, \n104 U.S. 689\n, which involved a trust of personal property created by the same will. Testator's daughter was entitled to the income of the trust for life, and on her death the \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 613]\n\u00a0\n principal was to be paid to her children. It was held that no tax was due until the termination of the life trust, for until then the children had neither possession nor enjoyment. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n By Act of June 13, 1898, c. 448,  29 (30 Stat. 448, 464), an excise was imposed relating, first, to legacies or distributive shares passing by death and arising from personal property, and secondly, to any personal property or interest therein transferred by deed, grant, bargain, sale, or gift to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the death of the grantor or bargainor, in favor of any person or persons, in trust or otherwise. In Vanderbilt v. Eidman, \n196 \nU.S. 480, 492\n, 25 S. Ct. 331, 334, this Court said:\n'As to this second class, the statute specifically makes the liability for taxation depend, not upon the mere vesting, in a technical sense, of title to the gift, but upon the actual possession or enjoyment thereof. By any fair construction the limitation ... expressed as to one class must be applied to the other, unless it be found that the statute, whilst treating the two as one and the same for the purpose of the imposition of the death duty, has yet subjected them to different rules.'\n\n After analyzing the words of the statute in order to arrive at its intent, the court said:\n'In view of the express provisions of the statute as to possession or enjoyment and beneficial interest and clear value, and of the absence of any express language exhibiting an intention to tax a mere technically vested interest in a case where the right to possession or enjoyment was subordinated to an un certain contingency, it would, we think, be doing violence to the statute to construe it as taxing such an interest before the period when possession or enjoyment had attached.' \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 614]\n\u00a0\n While there was no question of retroactivity in that case, for the reason that the statute antedated the creation of the trust, there was an attempt to tax vested interests subject to be divested prior to the time when it could be ascertained whether they would ever take effect in actual possession or enjoyment, and this the Court held could not be done in view of the language of the statute.5\n\n In Hertz v. Woodman, \n218 \nU.S. 205\n, 30 S. Ct. 621, Vanderbilt v. Eidman was followed. There a repealing act had been passed between the time of a decedent's death and the time for payment of a legacy under his will in accordance with the rules of administration. The Court held that, as the legatee had become fully entitled to possession prior to the passage of the repealer, he was liable for the tax. The dissenting justices, while not differing from the majority in the view that the tax was laid upon the coming into beneficial enjoyment and possession, were of opinion that until actual payment of the legacy the tax was not due, and therefore the repealing act had abolished it prior to the time fixed for its incidence upon the succession.\n The foregoing cases are cited, not because they involve any constitutional questions, but because they answer in no uncertain terms the appellants' insistent argument that here the succession consists of but a single item-the creation of a future interest-and that upon the coming into being of that interest the succession is so complete as to prohibit the sovereign's imposing its excise as of the occasion of enjoyment and possession by the successor. They constitute a complete demonstration of the fallacy of the argument that a privilege tax which ignores the creation of the mere technical future interest and reaches \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 615]\n\u00a0\n the possession and enjoyment of property pursuant to such interest is unheard of or in any wise out of the ordinary.\n Second. The sanction of this Court has been given to the collection of a like excise by the United States, under a statute similar to that here in question, and in circumstances like those in the case at bar.\n A testator who died in 1846 devised real estate to his daughter for life, with remainder in fee to her son should he survie h er. The daughter died in 1865. The collector's demand that the remainderman make return of his remainder for taxation under the act of 1864, above cited, was refused. The tax was assessed with penalty; payment was made under protest; and suit brought to recover the amount paid. Judgment for the collector was affirmed as to the tax, but, on grounds here immaterial, was reversed as to the penalty. Wright v. Blakeslee, \n101 U.S. 174\n.6\n The remainder was contingent, but it was urged that it was a form of future estate known to the law, which had vested in the son in 1846 and must be taxed, if at all, as of that date. But this court was clear that the tax was laid on the event which occurred in 1865, quoting the words of the act to show that there was a 'past' 'disposition of real estate by will' 'by reason whereof' the life tenant's children became 'beneficially entitled, in possession,' to the property devised 'upon the death of (a) person dying after the passing of this act.' The brief for appellant shows he argued that the phrase 'past disposition' must be construed only to cover the case of a deed or will executed prior to the passage of the law, but legally operative thereafter, in order to avoid a retroactive effect of the statute and interference with vested \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 616]\n\u00a0\n rights. He also insisted that the construction placed upon the act by the collector brought about an arbitrary result. So little did this Court regard the argument that it does not even notice it in its opinion. The Fifth Amendment obviously applied in that case, if the Fourteenth applies in the present.\n Third. In cases involving the application of state laws imposing succession taxes, in circumstances such as are here found, this Court has overruled the contentions here made, and sustained the tax. The facts involved in some of these cases were more favorable to the appellants' contentions than those in the case at bar.\n In Cahen v. Brewster, \n203 \nU.S. 543\n, 27 S. Ct. 174, 8 Ann. Cas. 215, the decedent, a resident of Louisiana, died May 26, 1904; his will was probated May 30; a final accounting was made, and tableau of distribution sibmitted to the probate court on August 3. These were approved and distribution ordered by a judgment of August 16. On October 16 the universal legatees petitioned the probate court for the delivery of the residuary estate to them. The executors answered that a tax was due on the legacies which they were bound to withhold. On June 28, 1904, a statute had been passed which imposed a tax applicable to all successions not finally closed at the date of its passage and all that should thereafter be opened. There were no forced heirs, and, under the statutes of Louisiana, the universal legatees were vested by law at the moment of death with full title to the property without taking any step whatever to put themselves into possession, without demanding delivery, or signifying their assent to accept the property bequeathed. The statutes are quoted in the margin, \n203 \nU.S. 549\n, 27 S. Ct. 175, 8 Ann. Cas. 215.\n The petitioners argued that the taxing act as applied to them was violative of the Fourteenth Amendment because retroactive and arbitrary. The Supreme Court of Louisiana sustained the tax. This Court affirmed, hold- \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 617]\n\u00a0\n ing that the state was at liberty to decide at what point it would impose the tax, provided such imposition was prior to the legatees' actual possession of the property. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Appellants' attempt to distinguish this caseis unconvincing. They say that it merely decided that the state had the power to lay the tax so long as the property was under the control of its courts for administration. They overlook the fact that in the instant case the possession of the trustees of the Coolidge trust did not cease until the death of the survivor of the settlors. During all that time the trust property was under the control of the Massachusetts courts. Not until those trustees had settled their trust and made distribution in accordance with the law of Massachusetts could the remaindermen come into possession and enjoyment of the property. And obviously the operation of the law of Massachusetts as to credits for expenses and commissions, and as to the duties of the trustees, and as to delivery of the trust property, might all be invoked before the beneficiaries could get actual possession and enjoyment.\n It is certainly an immaterial difference that in the one case the fiduciaries were called executors and in the other trustees. Both were subject to the law of the state, which defined and protected the rights of beneficiaries in both cases. The Coolidge children could not obtain possession or control of the corpus despite their parents' release of all interest in it. The trustees still had duties to perform. Coolidge v. Loring, supra. Cahen v. Brewster presents a more extreme case than this, because it involved no such contingency of divestment as is here involved; the executors \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 618]\n\u00a0\n there having completed their administration, the act of physical delivery only remained to the performed by them. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n In Chanler v. Kelsey, \n205 \nU.S. 466\n, 27 S. Ct. 550, one Astor, in 1844, 1848, 1849, and 1865, made deeds to trustees, which provided that the income should go to his daughter Laura for life, with remainder to her issue in fee, or, in default thereof, to her heirs in fee, with power of appointment amongst her issue in such amounts and proportions as she should-by instrument in its nature testamentary, to be acknowledged by her as a deed in the presence of two witnesses, or published by her as a will-appoint. She died in 1902, and by will exercised the power. An act of 1897 imposed a succession tax, and under its provisions the authorities sought to collect from the appointees under the daugher's will. The argument made on behalf of the beneficiaries was that the gift was completed when Astor made his deeds. It will be noted that the remainders were in that case vested, subject to be divested by the daughter's exercise of the power. The argument was strongly pressed that, in the case of a power of appointment, title passes under the creating instrument, and does not pass from the donee by virtue of his act of appointment. That this is sound law is undisputed. On this doctrine the beneficiaries founded their argument, that to tax the succession upon the occasion of their coming into possession and enjoyment was to tax something which had in fact occurred years before at the date of the delivery of the deeds by Astor. This is the same argument appellants now urge upon facts which present no significant legal difference from those in the Chanler Case. The Court of Appeals of New York (In re Delano's Estate, 176 N. Y. 486, 68 N. E. 871, 64 L. R. A. 279) \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 619]\n\u00a0\n held the tax not offensive to any constitutional principle. This Court affirmed. In so doing, it disregarded the technical situation, and looked to the substance of the matter. \n9\n At page 473 of 205 U. S., 27 S. Ct. 550, 552, it used the following language:\n'However technically correct it may be to say that the estate ame from the donor, and not from the donee, of the power, it is self- evident that it was only upon the exercise of the power that the estate in the plaintiffs in error became complete. Without the exercise of the power of appointment the estates in remainder would have gone to all in the class named in the deeds of William B. Astor. By the exercise of this power some were divested of their estates and the same were vested in others. It may be that the donee had no interest in the estate as owner, but it took her act of appointment to finally transfer the estate to some of the class and take it from others.' \n10\n\u00a0\n\n[282 U.S. 582, 620]\n\u00a0\n In Moffitt v. Kelly, \n218 \nU.S. 400\n, 31 S. Ct. 79, 80, 30 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1179, the facts were these:\n\n Moffitt married in California in 1863 and resided there with his wife until his death in 1906. By his will he gave his estate to his wife and children as if he had died intestate The probate court held that his widow's interest in the marital community was within the provisions of a law passed in 1905 taxing all devolutions of property by will or intestacy. The question was, therefore, whether a surviving wife was liable for a tax, which, as applied, could only be incident to her coming into untrammeled possession and enjoyment of what she had technically owned prior to the passage of the taxing statute. The Supreme Court of California held the tax valid against her insistence that this was a violation of the contract clause, the due process clause, and the equal protection clause, of the Federal Constitution. This Court sustained the judgment, and said:\n'But in every conceivable aspect, this proposition must rest upon one or both of two theories: either that the nature and character of the right or interest was such that the state could not tax it without violating the Constitution of the United States, or that, if it could be generically taxed without violating that instrument, for some particular reason the otherwise valid state power of taxation could not be exerted without violating the Constitution of the United States. The first conception is at once disposed of by saying that it is elementary that the Constitution of the United States does not, generally speaking, control the power of the states to select and classify subjects of taxation, and hence, even although the wife's right in the communityproperty was a vested right which could not be impaired by subsequent legislation it was nevertheless, within the power of the state, without violating the Constitution of the United States, in selecting objects of taxation, to select the vesting in omp lete possession and enjoyment by wives of their shares in community \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 621]\n\u00a0\n property, consequent upon the death of their husbands, and the resulting cessation of their power to control the same and enjoy the fruits thereof. And this also disposes of the second conception, since, if the state had the power, so far as the Constitution of the United States was concerned, to select the vesting of such right to possession and enjoyment as a subject of taxation, clearly the mere fact that the wife had a preexiting right to the property created no exemption from taxation if the selection for taxation would be otherwise legal. It follows, therefore, that the mere statement of the contention demonstrates the mistaken conception upon which, in the nature of things, it rests.\n\n'It is said, however, that the reasoning just stated, while it may be abstractly sound, is here inapplicable because the thing complained of in this case is that the state of California has imposed an inheritance tax upon the share of the wife in the community, and thereby taxed her as an heir of her husband, when, if the laws existing at the time of the celebration of the marriage be properly construed, and be held to be contractual, she took her share of the property on her husband's death, not as an heir to property of which he was the owner, but by virtue of a right of ownership vested in her prior to the death of the husband, although the right to possess and enjoy such property was deferred, and arose only on his death. But, for the purpose of enforcing the Constitution of the United States, we are not concerned with the mere designation affixed to the tax which the court below upheld, or whether the thing or subject taxed may or may not have been mistakenly brought within the state taxing law. We say so because, in determining whether the imposition of the tax complained of violated the Constitution of the United States, we are solely confined to considering whether the state had the lawful power, without violating the Constitution of the United States, to \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 622]\n\u00a0\n levy a tax upon the subject or thing taxed. This being true, as it clearly results from what we have said that the vesting of the wife's right of possession and enjoyment, arising upon the death of her husband, was subject to be taxed by the state, so far as the Constitution of the United States was concerned, it follows that whether the tax imposed was designated or levied as an inheritance tax or any other is a matter with which we have no concern.'\n\n Whatever may be said of the nature of the wife's interest in community property, this decision assumes the wife's vested interest in her half thereof; and that its free and unincumbered enjoyment only was postponed to the husband's death. There can be no difference in legal effect between that situation and one presented by the division of the total interests in a given property into a life tenancy and a remainder.\n The authority of the cases just noted has not heretofore been questioned in this court, and for years they have stood unqualified in the vindication of the constitutional validity of just such a tax as is now under attack.\n Fourth. In all its decisions touching death duties, whether on successions or on transfers, this Court has enunciated principles which sustain the validity of the tax.\n The most recent expression with respect to a succession tax concerned the very laws of Massachusetts the application of which is here called in question.\n In Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260\n, 48 S. Ct. 225, one Brooks, on various dates between 1905 and 1907, executed deeds to trustees, which provided that the income should be paid to the settlor for life, or, if he elected, should be accumulated, and that upon his and his wife's deaths the income should be paid to his children in spendthrift trust, with gifts over. The instruments reserved to the grantor \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 623]\n\u00a0\n certain powers of management of the trust, and also provided that their terms might be changed by him with the concurrence of one truste. Brooks died in 1920, having three times changed the trusts-the last time in 1919. At the time the deeds were executed, there was no statute taxing the succession to children of a decedent. But prior to Brooks' death the act of 1907, which is involved in the present case, had been passed, and had been amended by an act of 1909 taxing the acquisition of possession and enjoyment of property by virtue of the exercise of a power of appointment or by reason of the failure to exercise it. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that the power of revocation reserved to Brooks was equivalent to the creation of a power of appointment in him, and that, since the beneficiaries could not be certain of taking until his death, the gift was one made or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after his death; and that the tax was on the succession, which includes the 'privileges enjoyed by the beneficiary of succeeding to the possession and enjoyment of property.' There, as here, it was claimed that the beneficiaries had vested interests subject to be divested by a future event (in that case, the exercise of the power), which never happened, and they argued that the tax law was retroactive in its operation if applied to their interests, and hence violated the due process clause, the equal protection clause, and probably article 1,  10, of the Constitution. There, as here, it was insisted that the remaindermen needed nothing from the commonwealth of Massachusetts subsequent to the vesting of their remainders.\n After pointing out that the excise was not on the privilege of transmission, as was the federal estate tax dealt with in Nichols v. Coolidge, but was upon the privilege of succession, which might constitutionally be subjected to a tax by the state, whether occasioned by death or \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 624]\n\u00a0\n effected by deed, and after calling attention to the fact that the tax was imposed not on the donor, but on the beneficiary, this Court said:\n'... The gift taxed is not one long since completed, but one which never passed to the beneficiaries beyond recall until the death of the donor; and the value of the gift at that operative moment, rather than at some later date, is the basis of the tax.'\n\n The Court further stated that:\n'So long as the privilege of succession has not been fully exercised it may be reached by the tax.'\n\n Again the Court said:\n'... In determining whether it has been so exercised technical distinctions between vested remainders and other interests are of little avail, for the shifting of the economic benefits and burdens of property, which is the subject of a succession tax, may even in the case of a vested remainder be restricted or suspended by other legal devices.'\n\n One of such other 'legal devices' is a provision 'divesting' a remainder which is 'vested.'\n As the above quotation shows, the essential question in all such cases is whether the succession has become complete by actual possession and enjoyment prior to the passage of the taxing act.\n Notwithstanding the distinction between a transfer tax and a succession tax, the decisions under the federal estate tax statutes ( transfer tax laws) are convincing on the matter of substantiality as against technicality. The Court has uniformly disregarded the technical aspect of a transfer and looked at the reality and substance of the transaction. There is, in this aspect, no logical distinction between the two kinds of excise.\n In Chase National Bank v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 327\n, 49 S. Ct. 126, 129, 63 A. L. R. 388, where the beneficiaries' interests were admittedly vested, the Court reiterated the principle stated in Salton- \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 625]\n\u00a0\n stall v. Saltonstall, that the test of constitutionality is the incidence of the tax on the shifting of economic benefit, and not on the passage of mere technical legal title. Thus it said:\n'Termination of the power of control at the time of death inures to the benefit of him who owns the property subject to the power and thus brings about, at death, the completio of that shifting of the economic benefits of property which is the real subject of the tax, just as effectively as would its exercise, which latter may be subjected to a privilege tax. Chanler v. Kelsey, \n205 \nU.S. 466\n, 27 S. Ct. 550.'\n\n In Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497\n, 50 S. Ct. 356, 358, 69 A. L. R. 758, the Court considered the estate tax provisions of the Revenue Acts of 1916 and 1921. Both acts contained a provision that upon the death of one of two tenants by the entireties there should be included in the amount of the decedent's estate, for the purpose of measuring the tax, the value of the joint estate property, 'except such part thereof as may be shown to have originally belonged to' the surviving joint tenant, 'and never to have belonged to the decedent.' Under this provision, the United States assessed a tax against the estates of Pennsylvania and Maryland decedents. Collection was resisted on the ground that, by the common law of those states, tenants by the entireties are seised of the whole and of every part of the joint estate, and that the survivor had a vested estate long prior to the passage of the acts.\n It was conceded that at the death of one nothing descends to the survivor; the latter has, in the eye of the law, no more and no less than he or she had before-technically speaking, there is no succession.\n But Congress expressed a purpose to tax the passage of something from the decedent at death; just as here the Massachusetts Legislature showed its intent to tax the \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 626]\n\u00a0\n acquisition of something which accrued to the beneficiaries at the death of the settlor. In the instant case the so-called vested estate of the beneficiaries was subject to be divested by their death prior to that of the survivor of the grantors. In the Tyler Case the estate was absolutely vested; not only so, but it was in law as large qua the survivor after the death of his cotenant as it had been when both were alive; it could not be divested by the act of either party; it could not be taken in execution of a judgment against either party; the survivor needed to make no demand upon any one for possession.\n The taxpayers argued in the Tyler Case, on precisely the same ground as appellants now urge, that the survivor's interest had vested long prior to the adoption of the Revenue Acts; that no transfer of title or interest in property occurred on the death of one of the tenants by the entireties, and consequently the tax was arbitrary and in violation of the Fifth Amendment, because the subject or event on which the tax must be predicated was wanting. But the Court had no difficulty in holding that what happened at the death of one of the tenants was a transfer from the decedent of something which was the legitimate subject of an excise. The Court said (page 503 of 281 U. S., 50 S. Ct. 356, 359):\n'The question here, then, is not whether there has been, in the strick sense of that word, a 'transfer' of the property by the death of the decedent, or a receipt of it by right of succession, but whether the death has brought into being or ripened for the survivor, property rights of such character as to make appropriate the imposition of a tax upon that result (which Congress may call a transfer tax, a death duty or anything else it sees fit), to be measured, in whole or in part, by the value of such rights.'\n\n Language more closely descriptive of the situation presented in the present case could not be employed. Again the Court said (pages 503, 504 of 281 U. S., 50 S. Ct. 356, 359):\n\n\n[282 U.S. 582, 627]\n\u00a0\n 'According to the amiable fiction of the common law, adhered to in Pennsylvania and Maryland, husband and wife are but one person, and the point made is that, by the death of one party to this unit, no interest in property held by them as tenants by the entirety passes to the other. This view when applied to a taxing act, seems quite unsubstantial. The power of taxation is a fundamental and imperious necessity of all government, not to be restricted by mere legal fictions.Whe ther that power has been properly exercised in the present instance must be determined by the actual results brought about by the death, rather than by a consideration of the artificial rules which delimit the title, rights, and powers of tenants by the entirety at common law. See Nicol v. Ames, \n173 \nU.S. 509, 516\n, 19 S. Ct. 522; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, supra, page 271 of 276 U. S., 48 S. Ct. 225.\n'Taxation, as it many times has been said, is eminently practical, and a practical mind, considering results, would have some difficulty in accepting the conclusion that the death of one of the tenants in each of these cases did not have the effect of passing to the survivor substantial rights, in respect of the property, theretofore never enjoyed by such survivor. Before the death of the husband (to take the Tyler Case, No. 428) the wife had the right to possess and use the whole property, but so, also, had her husband; she could not dispose of the property except with her husband's concurrence; her rights were hedged about at all points by the equal rights of her husband. At his death, however, and because of it, she, for the first time, became entitled to exclusive possession, use and enjoyment; she ceased to hold the property subject to qualifications imposed by the law relating to tenancy by the entirety, and became entitled to hold and enjoy it absolutely as her own; and then, and then only, she acquired the power, not theretofore possessed, of disposing of the property by an exercise of hre sole will. Thus \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 628]\n\u00a0\n the death of one of the parties to the tenancy became the 'generating source' of important and definite accessions to the property rights of the other. These circumstances, together with the fact, the existence of which the statute requires, that no part of the property originally had belonged to the wife, are sufficient, in our opinion, to make valid the inclusion of the property in the gross estate which forms the primary base for the measurement of the tax. And in that view the resulting tax attributable to such property is plainly indirect.'\n\n Every word of the above quotation applies with as great force to the beneficiaries of the Coolidge trust as it applied in that case to the surviving tenant.\n In Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339\n, 49 S. Ct. 123, 125, 66 A. L. R. 397, a testator who died in 1922 had, in the period between 1903 and 1919, while not in contemplation of death, executed seven trust indentures. Two of these provided that the income should be paid to the settlor for life; and, after his death, to named persons, with remainders over. These deeds reserved a power of revocation to the settlor alone. The remaining five provided for life incomes to certain persons, terminable five years after the settlor's death, or upon the death of the life tenants, whichever should first happen, with remainders over. Powers of amendment were reserved in these, not to the settlor alone, but jointly to the settlor and certain beneficiaries. One of the seven trusts was modified in a matter immaterial to the decision, and the others were not modified or revoked. In calculating the amount of the federal estate tax, the United States sought to include the property embraced in all seven of the trusts. It was held that as to the two trusts in which the settlor had unrestricted power of revocation the transfer was not complete until his death. As to the five trusts in which the settlor did not have such power in himself alone, but had power of amendment jointly with bene- \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 629]\n\u00a0\n ficiaries, it was decided that the property had for all practical purposes passed completely from his control. It was pointed out that the reservation of powers of management in the settlor, as distinguished from the right to revoke or change the beneficiaries of the trust, was insignificant, and that the essential test was the passage of the economic benefit or enjoyment of the property. Thus it was said:\n'Nor did the reserved powers of management of the trusts save o d ecedent any control over the economic benefits or the enjoyment of the property. He would equally have reserved all these powers and others had he made himself the trustee, but the transfer would not for that reason have been incomplete. The shifting of the economic interest in the trust property which was the subject of the tax was thus complete as soon as the trust was made. His power to recall the property and of control over it for his own benefit then ceased and as the trusts were not made in contemplation of death, the reserved powers do not serve to distinguish them from any other gift inter vivos not subject to the tax.'\n\n Repeatedly throughout the opinion the passage of the control, possession, and enjoyment of the property is referred to as the touchstone of the incidence of the tax. If that be the test when the privilege of the transferor is under investigation, no reason is apparent why the same yardstick should not be used when we are considering acquisition of rights by the beneficiary.\n Thus the Reinecke Case is a full authority for the disregard of mere legal interests as distinguished from substantial rights of control or enjoyment. Technically speaking, the remainders to the beneficiaries in that case were vested subject only to be divested by the exercise of a power of revocation reserved to the grantor. It has been argued in the instant case that the vested estates created by the deed of 1907 never were divested; that \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 630]\n\u00a0\n the event which could work a divestiture never occurred. That was equally true in the Reinecke Case.\n It might well have been argued in the Reinecke Case that the right of revocation reserved by the grantor did not constitute an interest in the property; was not a property right, and therefore, the grantor having parted with all legal interest, his estate could not be taxed as upon the transfer of any property or any interest recognized by the law. Such an argument would have been technically sound under Jones v. Clifton, \n101 U.S. 225\n, 230, where it was said of such a power:\n'The title to the land and policies passed by the deeds; a power only was reserved. That power is not an interest in the property which can be transferred to another, or sold on execution, or devised by will . ... Nor is the power a chose in action.'\n\n The reasoning in the Reinecke Case shows that such an argument would have been of no avail. No more ought the argument of appellants, based upon the so-called vesting of the future interest at the execution of the deed, prevail in this case.\n It is said that the death of the settlors has no necessary relation to the benefits received by the remaindermen; that any other event might as well have been chosen as the occasion for the commutation of the children's future interests into interests in fee simple in possession; and that this in itself makes the tax arbitrary and unreasonable because the incident which occasions its imposition is irrelevant. This Court has negatived this contention. In Keeney v. Comptroller of State of New York, supra, it was said:\n'There can be no arbitrary and unreasonable discrimination. But when there is a difference, it need not be great or conspicuous in order to warrant classification. In the present instance, and so far as the 14th Amendment is concerned, the state could put transfers intended to take effect at the death of the grantor in a \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 631]\n\u00a0\n class with transfers by descent, will, or gifts in contemplation of the death of the donor, without, at the same time, taxing transfers intended to take effect on the death of some person other than the grantor, or on the happening of a certain or contingent event.'\n\n And in the same case it was said:\n'Where the grantor makes a transfer of property to take effect on the death of a third person, it might ... be taxed as a devolution or succession.'11\n\n And in Chase National Bank v. United States, supra, the same principle was announced at page 338 of 278 U. S., 49 S. Ct. 129.12\n Appellants rely on Nichols v. Coolidge, supra; Blodgett v. Holden, \n275 \nU.S. 142\n, 48 S. Ct. 105; Untermyer v. Anderson, \n276 \nU.S. 440\n, 48 S. Ct. 353; Chase National Bank v. United States, supra; and Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., supra, as in principle supporting their position. The Reinecke Case and the Chase National Bank Case have already been analyzed. It is evident from what has been said that appellants can derive no comfort from those decisions.\n Of course the test to be applied in cases arising under the federal estate tax law is whether the transferor has parted with every vestige of control over the beneficial enjoyment and possession of the property, and not whether the beneficiary has received it. Nichols v. Coolidge dealt, \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 632]\n\u00a0\n under the federal estate tax law, with the same trust involved in this case, and the inquiry there necessarily was whether prior to the passage of the estate tax act the grantors had so fully divested themselves of all right of control and enjoyment of the property that nothing remained to pass out of them at death. The facts were held to make an affirmative answer imperative. Here, on the other hand, we inquire, not whether the grantor has parted with title, control, and enjoyment, but whether the grantee has fully acquired them prior to the passage of the law.\n In Blodgett v. Holden and Untermyer v. Anderson the Court had under consideration a transfer tax laid on the donor in respect of gifts made inter vivos. The gifts in those cases were complete prior to the passage of the taxing statute, and, as in Nichols v. Coolidge, technical title, power to recall, and beneficial use and enjoyment had all passed from the donor prior to the legislative attempt to tax the gift. These circumstances demonstrate that neither case is an authority for holding a succession tax invalid if levied on the occasion of the acquisition of possession and enjoyment of property by the donee.\n Finally, appellants cite Matter of Pell, 171 N. Y. 48, 63 N. E. 789, 57 L. R. A. 540, 89 Am. St. Rep. 791, and certain cases in state courts which have followed it. That case adopts the views urged by appellants. It was followed in Hunt v. Wicht, 174 Cal. 205, 162 P. 639, L. R. A. 1917C, 961.\n In re Houston's Estate, 276 Pa. 330, 120 A. 267, involved no constitutional question. The statute in that case was construed to apply only to interests thereafter created.\n In Lacey v. State Treasurer, 152 Iowa, 477, 132 N. W. 843, and Commonwealth v. Wellford, 114 Va. 372, 76 S. E. 917, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 419, the statutes were construed as affecting only interests thereafter arising, though in both there were dicta to the effect that a contrary construction would render them unconstitutional. The dic- \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 633]\n\u00a0\n tum in the Lacey Case is repugnant to the later decision in Brown v. Gulliford, 181 Iowa, 897, 165 N. W. 182.\n State v. Probate Court, 102 Minn. 268, 113 N. W. 888, is not only distinguishable on its facts, as later held by the same court (State v. Brooks, 232 N. W. 331, 334), but the constitutional question here raised was not discussed.\n In a well-considered case, involving precisely the same question as Cahen v. Brewster, supra, the tax was sustained. Gelsthorpe v. Furnell, 20 Mont. 299, 51 P. 267, 39 . R . A. 170.\n It cannot, therefore, be said, as appellants contend, that there is any considerable body of state decisions in their favor.\n The reasoning of the state court cases which have held the tax invalid is flatly contrary to the decisions of this Court in the cases above discussed; and, in view of that fact, it should not prevail here.\n The Massachusetts court described the tax as one on the succession, and we have dealt with it on that basis; but it is neither necessary to sustain it nor permissible to defeat it by applying to it any particular descriptive language. See Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, \n279 \nU.S. 620, 625\n, 626 S., 49 S. Ct. 432; Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, \n282 \nU.S. 379\n, 51 S. Ct. 170, decided January 12, 1931; Moffitt v. Kelly, supra; Tyler v. United States, supra. A state's power to tax property is plenary. The power to tax it as a whole necessarily embraces the power to tax any of its incidents, or the use or enjoyment of them-provided only that the taxable occasion does not antedate the taxing statute so as to render it invalid because retroactive. If the property itself may constitutionally be taxed, obviously it is competent to tax the use of it, Billings v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 261\n, 34 S. Ct. 421; Hylton v. United States, 3 Dall. 171; or a sale of it, Thomas v. United States, \n192 \nU.S. 363, 370\n, 24 S. Ct. 305; Nicol v. Ames, \n173 \nU.S. 509\n, 19 S. Ct. 522; or the gift of it, Bromley v. McCaughn, \n280 \nU.S. 124\n, 50 S. Ct. 46. And, if the gift of it may be taxed, it is difficult \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 634]\n\u00a0\n to see upon what constitutional grounds the power to tax the receipt of it, whether as the result of inheritance or otherwise, may be denied to a state, whatever name may be given the tax, and even though the right to receive it, as distinguished from its actual receipt at a future date, antedated the statute. Receipt in possession and enjoyment is as much a taxable occasion as the enjoyment of any other incident of property. A levy upon the taking possession of property acquired by inheritance is one of the most ancient forms of tax known to the law. It existed on the European Continent and in England prior to the adoption of our Constitution. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n A tax laid upon the succession after the future interest has been created and the right accrued, but before the actual enjoyment in possession of the property, is no more a denial of due process than a tax laid upon income accrued prior to the adoption of the taxing statute but received after its passage. The constitutionality of the latter form of tax is now beyond question. Brushaber v. U. P. R. R. \n240 \nU.S. 1, 20\n, 36 S. Ct. 236, L. R. A. 1917D, 414, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713; Lynch v. Hornby, \n247 \nU.S. 339, 343\n, 38 S. Ct. 543; Taft v. Bowers, \n278 \nU.S. 470, 483\n, 484 S., 49 S. Ct. 199, 64 A. L. R. 362; Cooper v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 409, 411\n, 50 S. Ct. 164.\n The contention that taxation of a property right or an incident of ownership previously created by a deed or contract impairs the obligation of the contract is not new. But it must be denied both on reason and on authority. The present tax has no reference to the contract or its obligation save to recognize and observe the existence of both. It would serve no useful purpose at this late day to elaborate the doctrine, long since settled, that, to be obnoxious to the contract clause, a statute must \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 635]\n\u00a0\n act upon the contract so as to interfere with the right of enforcement. All of the cases cited as supporting the conclusion of the Court deal with such a situation. None of them even remotely ear  on the question here raised whether a tax levied in respect of the future enjoyment of property which chanced to be acquired under an earlier contract impairs the contract. That question, often raised, has always been answered here in the negative.\n In Orr v. Gilman, supra, it was claimed that a succession tax law enacted after the original deed granting a power of appointment, and construed as taxing the beneficiary of the power, violated article 1,  10, of the Constitution. The argument was rejected.\n A similar contention made in Chanler v. Kelsey, supra, was disposed of in these words:\n'Nor do we perceive that the effect has been to violate any contract right of the parties. It is said that this is so, because, instead of disposing of the entire estate, 95 per cent of the property included in the power has been transferred and 5 per cent taken by the state; but as there was a valid exercise of the taxing power of the state, we think the imposition of such a tax violated no contract because it resulted in the reduction of the estate.'\n\n Justice White, in Moffitt v. Kelly, supra, said of a similar contention:\n'1. The Alleged Violation of the Contract Clause.-Considered merely subjectively, the contention is that the rights vested in the wife as a partner in the community existing by virtue of the constitution and laws of the state of California governing at the time of the marriage were contractual rights of such a character that they could not be essentially changed or modified by subsequent legislation without impairing the obligations of the contract, and thereby violating the Constitution of the United States. But even although this theoretical proposition be \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 636]\n\u00a0\n fully conceded, for the sake of the argument, it is apparent that it is here a mere abstraction, and is therefore irrelevant to the case to be decided. We say this because there is no assertion of the giving effect to any law enacted subsequent to the contracting of the marriage which purports to essentially modify the rights of the wife in and to the community, as those rights existed at the time the marriage was celebrated. This is so because the state law the enforcement of which it is asserted will impair the obligation of the contract is merely a law imposing a tax.' 218 U. S. pages 402, 403, 31 S. Ct. 79, 30 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1179.\n\n The foregoing cases constitute only one application of a principle which has been repeatedly applied, not only to rights derived under deeds in their aspect as contracts, but to rights derived pursuant to all sorts of contracts. It was said in North Missouri Railroad v. Maguire, 20 Wall. 46, 61:\n'Authorities from numerous sources are cited by the plaintiffs, but none of them show that a lawful tax on a new subject, or an increased tax on an old one, interferes with a contract or impairs its obligation, within the meaning of the Constitution, even though such taxation may affect particular contracts, as it may increase the debt of one person and lessen the security of another, or may impose additional burdens upon one class and release the burdens of another, still the tax must be paid unless prohibited by the Constitution, nor can it be said that it impairs the obligation of any existing contract in its true legal sense.'\n\n With respect to deeds and grants, this Court said in Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Pet. 514, 562:\n'Land, for example, has, in many, perhaps in all the states, been granted by government since the adoption of the constitution. This grant is a contract, the object of which is that the profits issuing from it shall enure to the benefit of the grantee. Yet the power of taxation \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 637]\n\u00a0\n may be carried so far as to absorb these profits. Does this impair the obligation of the contract? The idea is rejected by all; and the proposition appears so extravagant, that it is difficult to admit any resemblance in the cases.'\n\n In Kehrer v. Stewart, \n197 \nU.S. 60\n, 25 S. Ct. 403, 406, it was contended that a statute levying a tax upon all agents of packing houses doing business in the state, of $200, in each county where such business was carried on, impaired the obligation of the contract which an agent and entered into with a packing house. With respect to this contention this Court said:\n'The argument that the tax impairs the obligation of a contract between the petitioner and Nelson Morris & Company is hardly worthy of serious consideration. The power of taxation overrides any agreement of an employee to serve for a specific sum.'\n\n With respect to a tax upon income, it was said in Murray v. Charleston, \n96 U.S. 432\n, 446:\n'A tax on income derived from contracts, if it does not prevent the receipt of the income, cannot be said to vary or lessen the debtor's obligation imposed by the contracts.'\n\n In Clement National Bank v. Vermont, \n231 \nU.S. 120\n, 34 S. Ct. 31, 38, the claim was that a state statute which levied a tax on bank deposits collectible from the depositor, and which had to be deducted by the bank from the interest paid to the depositor, impaired the obligations of the prior contracts of depositors with the bank. This Court overruled the objection, saying:\n'But this is clearly untenable. The statute did not act upon such contracts; it imposed a tax upon the property of depositors in the exercise of a power subject to which the deposits were made.'\n\n In Lake Superior Mines v. Lord, \n271 \nU.S. 577\n, 46 S. Ct. 627, 628, the obligation of an outstanding contract for the receipt of \n\n[282 U.S. 582, 638]\n\u00a0\n royalties in minerals mined was held not to be impaired by a later state statute taxing the proceeds of the contract. The Court said:\n'Titles to all the lands and leases were obtained subject to the state's power to tax. If the statute now in controversy is within that power, it cannot impair the obligation of appellants' contracts; if beyond, it is, of course, invalid. Accordingly, there is no occasion further to discuss the application of article 1,  10.'\n\n In short, it is evident from the authorities cited, and many more which might be quoted, that the power to tax property, or a right or a status, or a privilege, acquired or enjoyed by virtue of a contract, is no wise him dered or impeded by the fact of the existend of the contract whether it antedates or follows the effective date of the taxing act. No exercise of a governmental power, whether it be that of taxation, police, or eminent domain, though it make less valuable the fruits of a private contract, can be said to impair the obligation thereof.\n I think the judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice STONE concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The importance of the question is shown by the fact that forty-one states and territories have statutes containing provisions substantially similar to those of the Massachusetts acts involved in this appeal: Alaska, chapter 60, S.

No. 1498, 4 Cliff. 101, where apparently no attack was made on the constitutionality of the tax. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Carpenter v. Pennsylvania, 17 How. 456, dealt with a similar situation, and the tax was sustained. It was decided prior to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment; but in Orr v. Gilman, \n183 \nU.S. 278, 286\n, 22 S. Ct. 213, it was said that the grounds on which it went were pertinent under the amendment. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] In Stauffer's Succession, 119 La. 66, 43 So. 928, it was held that, where the executors had actually delivered the property to the legatee prior to the passage of the act, the tax could not be collected, because the seisin in right had merged into a seisin in fact, and that to apply the statute would be to give it a retroactive effect; and reference was made to the Cahen Case. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See, also, to the same effect, Orr v. Gilman, supra. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] Taxes have been sustained where a statute passed after the creation of a future interest imposed a tax on the occasion of the acquisition of possession and enjoyment due to the failure to exercise a power of appointment, the exercise of which would have divested such future interest. Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260\n, 48 S. Ct. 225, infra; Minot v. Treasurer, 207 Mass. 588, 93 N. E. 973, 33 L. R. A. (N. S.) 236; Manning v. Board, 46 R. I. 400, 127 A. 865; Montague v. State, 163 Wis. 58, 157 N. W. 508; State v. Brooks (Minn.) 232 N. W. 331. Such cases are authority against appellants' contention. The 'estate' or 'interest' of the beneficiary is just as truly vested in such a case as here; it is equally true that he has to do nothing but wait to come into possession and enjoyment. In both instances some future event, either a voluntary act of the donor or the holder of the power, or an event certain to happen, but uncertain as to the time of its happening, may deprive him of the possibility of possession and enjoyment. See contra, In re Lansing, 182 N. Y. 238, 74 N. E. 882; In re Chapman, 133 App. Div. 337, 117 N. Y. S. 679. The courts of New York thus hold that possession and enjoyment due to the exercise of a power of appointment is taxable, though the legal estate springs from the original instrument which antedated the taxing statute, while that due to nonexercise of the power is not. \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] See, also, Blake v. McCartney, Fed. Cas. No. 1498, 4 Cliff. 101, where, under a bequest in trust effective in 1847, two successive life estates were created, the second of which too ef fect in possession in 1867, and it was held the beneficiary was liable for tax under the act of 1864. The court said: 'The argument for the plaintiff is, that the tax can only be imposed by virtue of the section in question, where the death of the predecessor is the cause of the successor's being entitled to possession of the real estate, and not where it is merely the occasion, as in this case; but the proposition finds no support in the language of the provision, and the rule in the exchequer court of England is well settled the other way.' \n[\nFootnote 12\n] See Boston Safe Dep. & T.

BOARD OF REVISION OF TAX ASSESSMENTS IN(1931)\nNo. 7-13\nArgued: Decided: November 23, 1931\n\n\n\n Messrs. Arthur B. Van Buskirk, William A. Seifert, and Samuel McClay, all of Pittsburgh, Pa., for petitioners. \n\n[284 U.S. 23, 24]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Challen W. Waychoff and Ambrose Bradley, both of Waynesburg, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These seven cases were heard together in the state court and decided in a single opinion, as they were deemed to present but one question. They relate to assessments for taxation of the coal lands of the petitioners, for the year 1928, in several townships of Greene county, Pa. Taking as typical the assessment of coal lands in the township of Cumberland, it appears that petitioners, on appeal to the court of common pleas of Greene county, assailed the plan of assessment adopted by the commissioners of the county sitting as a board of appeal for the revision and equalization of assessments. Petitioners alleged that the valuation placed upon their coal was unjust and discriminatory, as the commissioners had 'assessed all coal in the same township (except what is termed 'active coal') at the same valuation, regardless of the remoteness or accessibility of the said coal to market cost of operation, or means of transportation and regardless of the difference in value and without due regard to the valuation and assessment of other coal and other classes of real estate in the County of Greene.' The court of common pleas, on findings of fact and conclusions of law, dismissed the appeals, and the decrees were affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state. Greene County Coal Tax Appeals, 302 Pa. 179, 152 A. 755. The specific contention that the plan of assessment violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was presented by petition for reargument and was considered and was explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court. As the state court entertained and decided the federal question, this court has jurisdiction. Jud. Code,  237(b), U. S. C., tit. 28, \n\n[284 U.S. 23, 25]\n\u00a0\n s 344 (28 USCA  344(b); Leigh v.

Fleming, \n264 \nU.S. 29, 31\n, 44 S. Ct. 246.\n There is no question that the assessments under review were made pursuant to a deliberately adopted system. The case is not one of mere errors in judgment in following a proper method (Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Wakefield, \n247 \nU.S. 350, 352\n, 353 S., 38 S. Ct. 495; Southern R. Co. v. Watts, \n260 \nU.S. 519, 526\n, 43 S. Ct. 192 ), but one where the challenged discrimination resulted from a plan of assessment which was none the less systematic and intentional because of belief in its validity (Raymond v. Chicago Union Traction Co., \n207 \nU.S. 20, 35\n, 37 S., 28 S. Ct. 7, 12 Ann. Cas. 757; Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota County, \n260 \nU.S. 441, 445\n, 43 S. Ct. 190, 28 A. L. R. 979; Chicago Great Western R. Co. v. Kendall, \n266 \nU.S. 94, 98\n, 99 S., 45 S. Ct. 55).\n From the facts as found by the court of common pleas, it appears that the petitioners' property in question is virgin coal (as distinguished from 'active coal,' that is, coal which 'is opened and mined'1) and is part of the Pittsburgh or river vein. That is a continuous vein of bituminous coal underlying the whole of Greene county and is 'practically of the same character, quality and thickness.' Greene county is bounded on the east by the Monongahela river, and the Pittsburgh or river vein extends westerly for several miles through a number of townships. The coal immediately along the river front, by reason of proximity to rail and river transportation, is more valuable than the 'back coal,' and the value of the coal decreases with the distance from the river. Within a distance of about three miles westerly from the river, \n\n[284 U.S. 23, 26]\n\u00a0\n mining operations are being conducted. In making the triennial assessments for the taxation of property ad valorem, the commissioners adopted as a uniform basis for all property 50 per cent. of the amount taken as actual value. The commissioners then assigned different values for the coal in the different townships of the county, but assessed the coal within the same township at the same value an acre notwithstanding differences in actual or market value due to distances from transportation facilities and to other factors.\n Cumberland township adjoins the Monongahela river and extends westerly about nine miles. All the coal in the Pittsburgh or river vein within the limits of this township, except what was described as 'active coal,'2 was assessed by the commissioners (on the fifty per cent. basis) at $260 an acre, despite the fact that the coal along the river, and for a considerable area (much more than 250 acres3) around the operating plants, was worth $1,000 an acre.\n The petitioner, Cumberland Coal Company, owns 64,574 acres of the Pittsburgh or river vein of coal within Greene county, of which 9,237 acres lie in Cumberland township and consists (with the exception of two small, detached tracts not here involved) of a block of coal extending from a point distant two and one-fourth miles westerly from the Monongahela river to the western boundary of the township. With respect to the difference in actual value of that petitioner's coal, distant from the river, as compared with coal of the same sort belonging to other owners and more favorably located, the court of common pleas expressly found as follows:\n'The Pittsburgh or River vein of coal of appellant' (petitioner here) 'lying a distance of three miles west of the Monongahela River and extending back a distance \n\n[284 U.S. 23, 27]\n\u00a0\n of three miles, or six miles from the river, does not possess a value of more than one-half of the value of the same vein of coal fronting on the Monongahela River, belonging to others than appellant, and extending back a distance of three miles westwardly.'\n\n In attempted justification of the discrimination, the court of common pleas adverted to the fact that other owners of coal in this vein were also assessed for 'active coal' and for buildings, equipment and real estate constituting 'operating properties.' But such assessments appear to have been made for items in a different class of properties, and the complaint of the petitioner is not with respect to such items, but as to the discrimination in the assessment of coal of the same character and description within the township (that is, exclusive of active coal and operating properties) which was assessed at the same figure of $260 an acre throughout the township, notwithstanding the great differences in actual value according to location.\n It is not necessary to deal with disparties in the assessments of coal in the same vein in other townships of Greene county, as these assessments present essentially the same question. Nor is it necessary to enlarge upon the facts, as the Supreme Court of the state made no question as to these, and dealt specifically with the question of law which they raise. That question was defined and answered by the Supreme Court in its opinion, as follows:\n'Appellants' counsel state their position thus: Township assessors and county commissioners sitting as a board of revision may not assess all bituminous coal in the Pittsburgh or river vein within the territorial limits of a township at the same value, disregarding differences in actual or market values by reason of great differences of distance from the river or rail transportation and other factors entering into values where it is undisputed that \n\n[284 U.S. 23, 28]\n\u00a0\n the actual or market value of the coal varies throughout the township, and that the coal fronting on the river and reilroads possesses a value twice that of the coal lying back from the river and extending to a distance of nine or ten miles. Our answer must be that they may so assess it, and the courts may not alter individual assessments, provided they do not fix the value at a figure in each instance greater than the fair market value of each owner's property, or, as in the cases before us, higher than the percentage of value, here 50 per cent. uniformly fixed throughout the county.\n\n'None of appellants has shown that its or his property in the market is not worth double the assessment fixed by the county commissioners and court below. Since they fixed 50 per cent. of market value as they conceived it to be, appellants without showing a less value for their properties have no standing to complain. ...\n\n'The 50 per cent. ratio throughout the county having been uniformly fixed, and appellants not having shown that their assessments as made are in excess of 50 per cent. of the fair market values of their property, have no standing to complain, it matters not what other assessments of other properties not before us may be.' Greene County Coal Tax Appeals, 302 Pa. at pages 182-184, 152 A. 755, 756.\n\n And, on the petition for reargument, presenting the federal question, the Supreme Court, modifying its first order denying the petition, said, upon consideration, that the Court was 'of opinion that the plan of assessment in these cases does not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.'\n We are unable to agree with this view. It is established that the intentional, systematic undervaluation by state officials of taxable property of the same class belonging to other owners contravenes the constitutional right of one taxed upon the full value of his property. \n\n[284 U.S. 23, 29]\n\u00a0\n Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Wakefield, supra; Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota County, supra; Raymond v. Chicago Union Traction Co., supra; Chicago Great Western R. Co. v. Kendall, supra. In Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota County, supra (at page 446 of 260 U. S., 43 S. Ct. 190, 192), this Court, referring to the dilemma presented by a case where one or a few of a class of taxpayers are assessed at 100 per cent. of the value of their property pursuant to statutory requirement and the rest of the class are intentionally assessed at a lower percentage, stated the rule to be as follows: 'This court holds that the right of the taxpayer whose property alone is taxed at 100 per cent. of its true value is to have his assessment reduced to the percentage of that value at which others are taxed even though this is a departure from the requirement of statute. The conclusion is based on the principle that where it is impossible to secure both the standard of the true value, and the uniformity and equality required by law, the latter requirement is to be preferred as the just and ultimate purpose of the law.'\n In applying this principle, the fact that a uniform percentage of assigned values is used, cannot be regarded as important, if, in assigning the values to which the percentage is applied, a system is deliberately adopted which ignores differences in actual values so that property in the same class as that of the complaining taxpayer is valued at the same figure (according to the unit of valuation, as, for example, an acre) as the property of other owners which has an actual value admittedly higher. Applying the same ratio to the same assigned values, when the actual values differ, creates the same disparity in effect as applying a different ratio to actual values when the latter are the same. If the commissioners, in the instant case, had taken the basis of 100 per cent. instead of 50 per cent. of the assigned values, but had adopted the same method of assessment by which all the coal in a township \n\n[284 U.S. 23, 30]\n\u00a0\n (aside from active coal) was assessed at the same value an acre, despite well-known and important differences in value, the result would have been an undervaluation of similar coal belonging to other owners, which would have brought the case of the petitioners within the principle of the decisions cited. In such case, if the petitioners' property had been valued at 100 per cent. of its actual value, the like property of the other owners, having a higher actual value, would in effect have been valued at less than 100 per cent. The discrimination is essentially the same, and is equally repugnant to constitutional right, when both assessments are made on the basis of 50 per cent. of assigned values and differences in actual values are deliberately and systematically disregarded. The undervalued property is in effect valued at less than 50 per cent. of its actual value; for example, coal of the same description worth twice as much, as that of the Cumberland Coal Company was really valued at 25 per cent. of its actual value.\n The petitioners are entitled to a readjustment of the assessments of their coal so as to put these assessments upon a basis of equality, with due regard to differences in actual value, with other assessments of the coal of the same class within the tax district.\n The decrees are reversed and the causes are remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The court found that, 'where the coal is opened and mined,' the commissioners 'have assessed one hundred acres as active coal, and if the amount of coal mined exceeds seventy-five acres for the year 1927 they have increased the acreage of the active coal to two hundred fifty acres.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'Active coal' was assessed at $500 an acre. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] See note 1, supra. \n\n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCUSTER v. MCCUTCHEON(1931)\nNo. 422\nArgued: April 20, 1931Decided: May 18, 1931\n\n\n\n Messrs. J. F. Nugent, of Boise, Idaho, and James R. Bothwell, of Twin Falls, Idaho, for petitioner.\n Mr. Whitney North Seymour, of Washington, D. C., for respondent. \n\n[283 U.S. 514, 515]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent's predecessor, as United States Marshal, on October 9, 1929, levied an execution issued September 21, 1929, out of the District Court for Idaho, against the petitioner, upon a judgment entered in that court March 7, 1921, in favor of the United States. On October 10, 1929, the petitioner filed a bill in the same court to restrain the marshal from proceeding further under the execution process, on the ground that section 6910 of the Idaho Compiled Statutes of 1919 permitted the issuance of execution only within five years from the date of rendition of judgment. The District Court, on motion of the United States, dismissed the bill, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed its judgment1 This court granted certiorari. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The question presented is whether the Idaho statute, which has been adopted as governing execution process in the United States District Court for that state, is applicable to an execution issued on behalf of the United States as a judgment plaintiff. The statute follows:\n'The party in whose favor judgment is given, may, at any time within five years after the entry thereof, have a writ of execution issued for its enforcement.'\n\n It has become a part of the law of procedure in the United States Court by virtue of section 916 of the Revised Statutes,3 which provides:\n'The party recovering a judgment in any common-law cause in any district court, shall be entitled to similar remedies upon the same, by execution or otherwise, to \n\n[283 U.S. 514, 516]\n\u00a0\n reach the property of the judgment debtor, as are provided in like causes by the laws of the State in which such court is held, or by any such laws which may subsequently be enacted and adopted by general rules of such district court; and such courts may, from time to time, by general rules, adopt such State laws as may be in force in such State in relation to remedies upon judgments, as aforesaid, by execution or otherwise;'\n\n -and Standing Rule 73 of the District Court, which is:\n'Subject to the provisions of the acts of Congress in relation to executions, judgments in actions at law shall be enforced in the same manner as such judgments in the State Courts are enforced, and the State laws in relation to executions, sales, exemptions, rights of purchasers, right of judgment creditors and judgment debtors, redemptions, liens of judgments and of decrees and proceedings supplementary to execution as said provisions now exist or as they shall exist at the time in question are adopted as rules of this Court; and the Marshal of this Court shall conform his proceedings thereto. ...'\n\n As a result of section 916 and Rule 73, the Idaho statute is applicable to proceedings in the District Court as if it had been passed by Congress. In the language of Rule 73, it has been 'adopted' as a rule of the court. While it is clear that it governs executions issued on judgments recovered by other litigants, the lower courts held that it does not applyto t hose sued out by the United States. This ruling is based upon the familiar doctrine that, in the absence of specific provision to the contrary, statutes of limitation do not bind the sovereign. The petitioner insists that this act is not in the ordinary sense of the term a statute of limitation, that it does not affect the time within which a suit may be brought upon the judgment, but that on the contrary it grants the right of execution, and the time element is an integral part of the statutory right conferred. Petitioner says that in this aspect \n\n[283 U.S. 514, 517]\n\u00a0\n the United States as plaintiff is on no better footing than any other litigant availing itself of the provisions of the statute. A proper decision depends upon the scope and meaning to be given to Rev. St.  916, and the rule of court.\n Section 14 of the Judiciary Act of 17894 conferred upon the courts of the United States power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs, not specially provided for by statute, which might be necessary for the exercise of their jurisdiction agreeably to the principles and usages of law. These words comprehended executions on judgments. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 22.\n At the same session an act was passed 'To regulate Processes in the Courts of the United States.' \n5\n It provided that:\n'Until further provision shall be made, and except where by this act or other statutes of the United States is otherwise provided, the forms of writs and executions, except their style, and modes of process ... in the circuit and district courts, in suits at common law, shall be the same in each state respectively as are now used or allowed in the supreme courts of the same.'\n\n This act was to remain in force only until the expiration of the next session of Congress. It was followed by that of May 8, 1792;6 and thereafter by other acts,7 the last of which became Rev. St.  916.\n Section 916 prohibits the courts of the United States from adopting, recognizing, or giving effect to any form of execution, except such as was, at the time of the passage of the act of 1872, from which it was derived, or has subsequently become by adoption of state statutes, a writ \n\n[283 U.S. 514, 518]\n\u00a0\n authorized by the laws of the state. Fink v. O'Neil, \n106 \nU.S. 272, 278\n, 1 S. Ct. 325, 330.\n This court has twice considered the bearing of these statutes upon executions issued on judgments in favor of the United States. In United States v. Knight, 14 Pet. 301, it was held that the act of 1828, supra, gave to debtors in prison under executions from the courts of the United States, at its suit, the privilege of jail limits in the several states as they were fixed by the laws of those states at the date of the act. It was asserted that the statute did not include executions on judgments in favor of the United States, as the sovereign is never bound by any statute unless expressly named. The contention was, however, overruled, and it was held that the obvious intent to create a conformity between the mode of proceeding in federal courts and state courts ought to be given effect.\n In Fink v. O'Neil, supra, the question was whether the homestead of a defendant resident in Wisconsin was subject to seizure and sale under an execution issued out of a federal court on a judgment recovered by the United States. It was held that the Wisconsin statute exempting homesteads from such seizure, which admittedly embraced executions issued on judgments held by private citizens, applied also to the United States. It was observed that no distinction is made in any of the successive statutes on the subject between executions on judgments in favor of private parties and those i fav or of the United States. The court added:\n'And as there is no provision as to the effect of executions at all, except as contained in this legislation, it follows necessarily that the exemptions from levy and sale, under executions of one class, apply equally to all, including those on judgments recovered by the United States.' \n\n[283 U.S. 514, 519]\n\u00a0\n The contention of the government that on grounds of public policy the sovereign ought not to be subject to exemptions binding on private suitors was overruled.\n\n It is clear, therefore, that Rev. St.  916 and rules of court adopted pursuant thereto confine the United States to such executions as may be issued by individuals under the state statutes, and impose upon it the same restrictions and exemptions as are applicable to other suitors, and the question here is whether an exception should be made to this general rule as respects the time fixed by the state statute within which execution must issue. We see no valid reason for making such an exception. The time limited for issuing executions is, strictly speaking, not a statute of limitations. On the contrary, the privilege of issuing an execution is merely to be exercised within a specified time, as are other procedural steps in the course of a litigation after it is instituted. The plaintiff is not precluded from bringing an action upon the judgment, but merely from having an execution in the form provided by state law.\n It is argued on behalf of the United States that the five-year period is not binding upon the state of Idaho, and therefore the adoption of the statute does not affect the federal government in respect of the time of issuance of the writ. We find no decision of the Supreme Court of Idaho exempting the sovereign from the provisions of the statute, nor does examination of other cognate sections of the Idaho Compiled Statutes disclose any matter which would indicate such a purpose. We think that in the interest of uniformity, and in the absence of either express state decision or provision by Congress to the contrary, the statute is to be held applicable to all plaintiffs seeking to avail themselves of the writ of execution therein provided, including the United States.\n The judgment must be\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 41 F.(2d) 354. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] \n282 \nU.S. 826\n, 51 S.

Ct. 333, 75 L. Ed. -, to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, holding the Langmuir patent, No. 1,558,436, granted October 20, 1925, for 'electrical discharge apparatus and process of preparing and using the same,' valid, and infringed by petitioners. The District Court for Delaware, in which respondent, the assignee of the patent, brought suit for infringement, held the patent invalid for want of invention, and because of prior use and prior invention, and gave judgment dismissing the complaint, 23 F.(2d) 698, which the appellate court at first affirmed, and then, on reargument, reversed. 44 F.(2d) 931.\n Infringement is conceded if the claims of the patent are valid. It is known as a high vacuum tube patent, and \n\n[283 U.S. 664, 670]\n\u00a0\n the alleged invention is exemplified in high vacuum tubes of familiar use as detectors or amplifiers in the art of radio communication and telephony. Correct appreciation of the contentions made requires, at the outset, an understanding and some exposition of the scientific principles which it is agreed are brought into play in the high vacuum tube or which at least are accepted as working hypotheses accounting for its operation.\n A radio tube of the audion or three electrode type consists of a bulb, within which a vacuum has been created, enclosing a filament, which is a negative electrode, or cathode; a plate, which is a positive electrode, or anode; and a third electrode, known as a grid, located between the filament and the plate. The grid is connected with an input circuit, over which electrical radio activity, actuated at the sending station, is gathered from the ether and passes to the grid. When the tube is used as an amplifier, the plate is connected in circuit with a telephone receiver or loud speaker. In operation, the filament is heated to incandescence by passing an electric current through it. In its incandescent state, electrons, or negative charges of electricity, are developed at the filament and pass to the plate, attracted to it by its positive potential, and cause a flow of electricity through the plate loud speaker circuit. The sounds given out by the loud speaker are produced by variations in the current passing to it. Radio amplification depends on producing in the more powerful current of the loud speaker circuit, variations exactly corresponding to the variations in th wea ker input or voice current which are actuated by the sending station.\n In the vacuum tube of the three electrode type, this is accomplished by passing the input or voice current over the grid. Variations in that current produce variations in potential of the grid which, by reason of its location between the filament and plate, effects like variations in the \n\n[283 U.S. 664, 671]\n\u00a0\n effective potential of the plate with corresponding variations in the loud speaker circuit. The number of electrons emitted by the filament is determined by its temperature. But the current passing through the plate loud speaker circuit depends on the number of electrons drawn from the filament to the plate, and this in turn depends on the voltage of the current passing to the filament. When it is high enough to force all the electrons emitted by the filament to pass from filament to plate, increase in the voltage at the filament will not produce an increase in current in the loud speaker circuit and the tube is then said to be 'saturated.' As successful operation of the tube depends on the response of the loud speaker current to changes in voltage effected by the voice or input current, the tube is most efficiently operated at a voltage of a range below saturation, and a current within this range is known as the 'space current.'\n Of critical importance in the present controversy is the effect of the presence of gas within the tube. As in the practical art of bulb manufacture no scientifically perfect vacuum can be attained, air or other gas is always present within the vacuum tube. This consists of a small amount of residual gas, after the vacuum is created by pumping out the tube in the process of manufacture. There is also gas in the walls of the bulb and the electrodes, described as 'occluded,' which, if not expelled from them and removed in the course of manufacture, is later freed in varying amounts when the tube is in use, by the action of the heat of the filament and the electrons generated there.\n The passage of electrons from filament to plate at certain voltages produces changes in the gas, known as 'ionization.' Ionization is the manifestation of a rearrangement of the constituent electrons of the gas atoms which occurs, in low vacuum tubes, if other factors of causation remain constant, at known voltages within a \n\n[283 U.S. 664, 672]\n\u00a0\n range of from 20 to 30, but varying somewhat with different gases. The atom, according to present day scientific theory, is composed of an electrically positive nucleus, around which revolve at high speeds electrically negative electrons. In its normal state, the atom, whose nucleus and electrons are in electrical balance, exhibits no electrical effects; but within a thermionic tube, the impact upon the gas atoms of the electrons, passing from cathode to anode at velocities induced by ionization voltages, forces off negative electrons from the atoms. The atoms from which the electrons have thus been detached are then electrically positive and are known as ions. Ionization, which begins at the ionization voltage, is increased with increasing voltages as the tube approaches saturation, when extreme ionization takes place; and, for reasons which need not be elaborated here, the tube then ceases to function as a radio tube, a condition visibly manifested by a blue glow within it.\n Gas ionization in the vacuum tube is of great practical importance because of its effect on the current passing from filament to plate. Ionization, when it occurs, may operate within the range of the space current to increase 'conductivity' of the tube, that is, the discharge from filament to plate, above what it would be at the same voltage in the absence of ionization, through the development of the positive ions, which pass to the cathode, and of the negative electrons, which pass to the anode. The ions facilitate the flow of electrons from cathode to anode and increase their number by impact on the former, which raises its temperature. The result is that, in low vacuum tubes, saturation with the blue glow effect is reached, other fators remaining constant, at lower voltages than in high vacuum tubes. Hence, in the range of voltage above ionization and below saturation, within which the tube is commonly operated, a low vacuum tube, because of the increase of current due to \n\n[283 U.S. 664, 673]\n\u00a0\n ionization, is more responsive to slight changes in voltage produced by the operation of the grid or input current. In consequence, the low vacuum tube is more sensitive both as a detector and as an amplifier than a tube of high vacuum.\n But this advantage is accompanied by a serious disadvantage, especially when the tube is used for amplification, in that ionization produces variations in the electronic discharge from filament to plate, which correspondingly affect the current passing through the loud speaker circuit. Ionization is affected by amount of gas in the tube, and hence by the degree of vacuum and the amount of occluded gas freed in operation by heat and bombardment. Since the discharge varies with the amount of ionization, the effective current in the loud speaker circuit varies with different tubes and with the same tube at different times; and critical adjustments of the current flowing to the filament are necessary to improve operation.\n From what has been said, it is apparent that the problem of securing evenness or regularity of discharge from filament to plate and hence of current flowing through the loud speaker circuit is dependent upon the reduction of ionization in the tube, and this in ture is dependent, within certain ranges of limits, upon a number of variables, the more important of which are (1) the geometry of the tube, that is, its size and shape and the location of electrodes, (2) heat of the filament, (3) voltage of the filament, and (4) of vital importance here, amount of gas, that is, pressure within the tube. With the other variables controlled so as to remain approximately constant, as is practicable, reduction of pressure reduces ionization and increases steadiness of current and in turn raises the saturation point of the tube, permitting its use with higher than ionization voltages.\n As in the low vacuum tube regularity or evenness of the loud speaker current was more or less imperfectly se- \n\n[283 U.S. 664, 674]\n\u00a0\n cured by varying the voltage at the filament with different tubes and at different times with the same tube, and desired result may also be attained, and far more effectively, by reducing the pressure in the tube and keeping other factors constant. When a vacuum is produced of as low a pressure as a few hundredths of a micron (a micron is equal to 1\/1000 of a millimeter of mercury in terms of barometric pressure), the discharge is independent of the degree of vacuum, when the tube is used with appropriate space charge. The discharge then passing from cathode at constant temperature to anode, varies directly with the 3\/2 power (square root of the cube) of the voltage imposed on the cathode. This is equivalent to saying that steadiness of current through the loud speaker circuit is obtained, with an increase in power, until saturation, in known relationship to the increase of the imposed voltage. While the effectiveness of the low vacuum tube begins to diminish, in the upper range of ionization voltages, with high vacuum tubes, currents of much higher voltages may be used without loss of effectiveness.\n The desired reduction of pressure in the tube involves the use of methods for producting a high vacuum and reducing to a minimum the effects of occluded gas. By evacuating the tube by pump or other suitable means, and at the same time freeing it of occluded gas by heating tube and electrodes, and also, as may be done, by passing a current through the filament, causing 'bombardment' of the electrodes by electrons, a high vacuum tube is produced. By such procedure, the disturbing influence of ionization may be removed with consequent stability of discharge. The result is of great importance, since by a adaptation of the procedure to manufacturing methods, tubes giving uniform stability of current may be commercially poduc ed, suitable for use in the complex mod- \n\n[283 U.S. 664, 675]\n\u00a0\n ern radio receiving sets employing multiple tubes, without necessity for the critical adjustments of the filament circuit necessary with low vacuum tubes.\n It is the high vacuum tube of this type which respondent says embodies the Langmuir invention. As a product or structure it differs from the low vacuum tube, of which the Fleming valve and De Forest audion are well known types, only in that the pressure has been reduced to such a point that there is no appreciable ionization, with the resulting constancy of current in the amplifier circuit.\n In the light of the explanation given of the operation of the vacuum tube, we now examine the claims of the patent. The application, filed October 16, 1913, was pending for twelve years before it was issued October 20, 1925, a period which witnessed the most important beginnings and many of the chief developments of the radio art. The original application was for a process or method patent only. It contained five claims covering methods of obtaining a high vacuum in vacuum tubes and expelling occluded gas from them. These claims were all ultimately cancelled. Other process claims, substituted by amendment, of which four only survived in the patent as issued, were amplifications of the original method and process claims. Late in 1913 Langmuir first made claim to invention of the tube as a structure or device, in four claims, all of which were amended one or more times. All but the third, which was amended four times, were cancelled in 1925, the year the patent issued. There are twenty-eight claims for the structure or device in the patent as issued. Of these one was filed by amendment in 1913, one in 1917, nine in 1919, three in 1921, and fourteen in 1925. During the twelve years the patent was pending, there were sixty-seven amendments of specifications of which forty-five were in 1925. Amended \n\n[283 U.S. 664, 676]\n\u00a0\n claims filed, and additions and cancellations of them made, number one hundred in all, of which forty-two were in 1925\n\n\n The process claims cover methods of creating the high vacuum tube in the manner already described, that is, freeing the tube of occluded gas by heating tubes and electrodes and by electronic bombardment, at the same time evacuating the tube of air or gas by approved methods, such as the use of the Gaede molecular pump or chemical means. The court below did not rest its holding of validity of the patent on these claims, and respondent does not seriously urge their validity here. It suffices to say that an examination of the prior art discloses that long before the earliest date claimed for Langmuir, the necessity for removing occluded gas from tubes or other electrical discharge devices in order to procure a high vacuum, and the methods of doing it by heating and electronic bombardment were well known, as was the procedure for construcint the high vacuum tube by expelling occluded gas while evacuating the tube. An article by Duncan, American Electrician, May, 1896; one by Doane, Electrical World and Engineer, of May 21, 1904; the Dwyer Patent, No. 496,694, January 4, 1898, for a process for producing high vacuum in incandescent lamps or similar receptacles during their manufacture; the Soddy Patent, No. 859,021, July 2, 1907, for the employment of certain reagents in the process of producing high vacuum; the Thatcher Patent, No. 1,028,636, June 4, 1912, application filed March 30, 1910, for method of exhausting vessels; and an article by Lilienfeld in 1910, to be mentioned later, disclosed before Langmuir the essentials for producing a high vacuum, described in the present process claims. They were in use in laboratory practice by Millikan and others before 1911.\n It was upon the claims for the high vacuum tube structure or device that the court below based its decision, \n\n[283 U.S. 664, 677]\n\u00a0\n and they are urged upon us here as the grounds for sustaining the patent. They put forward, in a great variety of forms, claims for an electrical discharge device consisting of a tube with cathode and anod wit hin it, with relation of parts and degree of evacuation (vacuum) such that the device is capable of operation with higher than ionization voltages in a range below saturation, substantially unaffected by ionization. Claim 2, which respondent selects as typical reads:\n'2. A discharge tube having a cathode adapted to emit electrons and an anode adapted to receive said emitted electrons, the tube walls being fashioned or shaped to permit the direct passage of a useful proportion of said electrons from cathode to anode, the gas content or residue of said tube and the relation of the parts of the tube being such that the tube is capable of being so operated in a range below saturation and materially above ionization voltages that the space current is governed or limited by the electric field of said electrons substantially unaffected by positive ionization.'\n\n But this claim, as well as all others of the Langmuir patent, must be read in the light of the fact, fully accepted by the parties to this litigation, that electrical discharge devices such as the Fleming valve and the De Forest audion, patents on the latter of which expired in 1925, which were well known before Langmuir, comprise all the elements of the combination claimed except the presence within it of a high vacuum. It is conceded that if the requisite high vacuum be created in a De Forest audion, it becomes the high vacuum tube of the patent and is an infringing device if the patent is valid. The degree of the vacuum within the tube is therefore the crucial feature of the invention claimed. Langmuir, in describing in his patent the method of producing the device, says: 'The evacuation of the device should be preferably carried to a pressure as low as a few hundredths of a micron, \n\n[283 U.S. 664, 678]\n\u00a0\n or even lower, but no definite limits can be assigned.' In at least 13 of the claims, the device claimed is one in which the gas within the tube, or the pressure, is sufficiently reduced, or the vacuum raised high enough, ( all of which are synonymous), to produce the desired result, that is, a discharge unaffected by ionization when the tube is operated by the appropriate space current, which may be of higher voltage than that for the low vacuum tube.\n The characteristics of the discharge named by the inventor in the specifications 'in order to distinguish electron discharge devices made in accordance with my invention from the prior art' are the following: (1) Gas ionization absent or negligible; (2) cathode not heated by the discharge; (3) no blue glow or visible evidence of discharge; (4) 3\/2 power relation of current to voltage; (5) discharge independent of degree of vacuum within intended limit for particular tube; (6) regularity and reproducibility. But all these characteristics may be summed up in the simple statement that in the tube of the patent, there must be an absence of harmful ionization; and since, as already indicated, harmful ionization disappears when the requisite vacuum is attained, the device or structure of the patent is one in which such a vacuum has been produced.\n That the high vacuum tube was an improvement over the low vacuum tube of great importance, is not open to doubt. Even though the improvement was accomplished by so simple a change in structure as could be brought about by reducing the pressure in the well known low vacuum tube by a few microns, still it may be invention. Whether it is or not depends upon a question of fact, whether the relationship of the degree of vacuum within the tube, to ionization, and hence to the stability and effectiveness of discharge passing from cathode to anode, was known to the art when Langmuir began his experiments. If that relationship was then known, it re- \n\n[283 U.S. 664, 679]\n\u00a0\n quired no inventive genius to avoid ionization and secure the desired result by creating the vacuum in a De Forest tube or other form of low vacuum discharge device.\n That this relationship was known was the fact found by the District Court and not challenged by the opinion of the Court of Appeals. In 1910 Lilienfeld in a paper published in Annalen der Physik, vol. 32, on 'The Conduction of Electricity,' made a complete and explicit disclosure of the essentials of all the structures and methods of the Langmuir patent. The paper described methods of obtaining the 'extreme vacuum' desired by freeing electrical discharge devices of occluded gas in the manner already described and at the same time evacuating the tube. He described the space charge effect, not mentioned in Langmuir's original specification, but later recited in the claims of the patent, in the following language: 'One can formulate more generally the conditions for high voltage and large current density as follows: The production of a state in which the volume density of the electrons carrying the current is as large as possible compared with the density of gas molecules in which there exists therefore a tendency for the formation of the maximum possible space charge in the path of the current.' To one skilled in the art, this could only mean that increased effectiveness of an electrical discharge device, to which a suitable current is applied, could be obtained by raising the vacuum in the manner which the writer had described. He also stated that 'from a definite maximum density of the gas downwards, the discharge phenomena are independent of the gas density in the region investigated,' a statement equivalent to the fifth characteristic of the discharge in the Langmuir specification, namely, that it is independent of degree of vacuum within the intended limit for the particular tube.\n Lilienfeld also deduced from meter readings and stated, the 3\/2 power relation of current to voltage, as Langmuir \n\n[283 U.S. 664, 680]\n\u00a0\n later stated it in his patent. From this the conclusion is inescapable that Lilienfeld knew and stated, in terms which could be understood by those skilled in the art, that in a high vacuum the current produced is under control, stable, and reproducible; and, as he employed high voltages, that high power levels of the discharge may be obtained by the employment of a high voltage in a high vacuum tube. Space charge effect was also described by Lilienfeld in Physikalische Zeitschrift, in 1908, in which he pointed out that by raising the vacuum there is an increase in the number ( volume density) of the negative electrons, and said: 'The higher the vacuum, the greater the current density, the more pronounced this new kind of discharge becomes.'\n The very fact that Lilienfeld knew and described the methods of the patent for obtaining high vacuum carrier with it as a necessary corollary that the device itself, apart from its functioning and use, is lacking in patentable novelty. Hence, invention, if any there be, is embraced in the discovery of the principle that discharges above ionization voltages can be produced without substantial ionization if the vacuum be sufficiently high, and the disclosure that the device of the claims constitutes suitable means for putting the principle into practice. But Lilienfeld, in his paper of 1910, disclosed that he obtained discharges free from the effects of ionization, as Langmuir testified in interference proceedings in the Patent Office, and that he accomplished this through the attainment of high vacua by the very methods later described in the Langmuir patent.\n Fleming, the inventor of the Fleming valve, in a paper read before the Royal Society on the conversion of electric oscillations into continuous current by means of a vacuum valve, February 9, 1905, pointed out the possibility of creating 'an ideal and perfect rectifier for electric oscillations' by enclosing within a tube a hot carbon fila- \n\n[283 U.S. 664, 681]\n\u00a0\n ment and a cold metal anode 'in a very perfect vacuum'; and he described a method of procuring the vacuum by exhausting the bulb while freeing it of occluded air. In his Patent, No. 803,634, November 7, 1905, he describes the method of securing a high vacuum within the bulb by freeing it of occluded gas by heating the blub and filaments to incandescence and at the same time evacuating it. In an article in 'The Scientifc Am erican,' supplement for January 20, 1906, on 'electric conductivity of a vacuum,' he defined a high vacuum as one reduced to 'one hundred millionth of an atmosphere,' which is less than the 1\/100 of a micron, the pressure in the tube of the patent; and he disclosed not only that electrons are emitted by hot cathodes in a high vacuum, but also 'that a high vacuum may be a very good conductor, provided the negative electrode is rendered incandescent.' Thus Fleming knew, and stated, the advantages of the high vacuum, its definition, and the method of procuring it. The state of the art and the progress of scientific knowledge in this field was accurately summed up in the statement of the law examiner in the Patent Office who passed on the Langmuir claims:\n'It is apparent after a review of the record that there is no single element which is broadly novel in the assemblage of elements making up an electron discharge device of the character defined in the issue. An evacuated tube having therein an incandescent electron emitting cathode and an anode was old prior to the filing of Langmuir's application, and methods of attaining high vacua, sufficient to gave a relatively pure electron discharge in a properly designed tube were also well known and available to persons skilled in the art.'\n\n The narrow question is thus presented whether, with the knowledge disclosed in these publications, invention was involved in the production of the tube, that is to say, whether the production of the tube of the patent, with the \n\n[283 U.S. 664, 682]\n\u00a0\n aid of the available scientific knowledge that the effect of ionization could be removed by increasing the vacuum in an electric discharge device, involved the inventive faculty or was but the expected skill of the art. The question is not, as respondent argues, whether Lilienfeld or others made a practical high vacuum tube, but whether they showed how it could be made and demonstrated and disclosed the relationship of the discharge to reduced pressure, and how to reduce it. See Corona Co. v. Dovan Corporation, \n276 \nU.S. 358, 384\n, 48 S. Ct. 380. That the production of the high vacuum tube was no more than the application of the skill of the art to the problem in hand is apparent when it is realized that the invention involved only the application of this knowledge to the common forms of law vacuum discharge devices such as the Fleming and De Forest tubes. Once known that gas ionization in the tube caused irregularity of current which did not occur in a high vacuum, it did not need the genius of the inventor to recognize and act upon the truth that a better tube for amplifying could be made by taking out the gas. Arnold, who was skilled in the art, and who had made studies of electrical discharges in high vacua, when shown a De Forest audion for the first time on November 14, 1912, immediately recognized and said that by increasing the vacuum the discharge would be sufficiently stable and have adequate power levels to enable the tube to be employed as a relay device in transcontinental telephony. The very fact that all of significance in the Langmuir improvement was obvious to one skilled in the art as soon as he saw the unimproved tube, as the District Court said, 'lies athwart a finding of invention.'\n Respondent recognizes the force of this objection to patentability, but seeks to avoid it by insisting that the invention claimed is not as we have described it, but that 'Langmuir's invention consisted in taking out ( of the tube) the gaseous conductor upon which the prior art \n\n[283 U.S. 664, 683]\n\u00a0\n relied, and putting nothing (a vacuum) in its place.' It adopts also the statement in the opinion of the court below, upon which its decision turned, 'a vacuum, or indeed, change of vacuum, isolated and standing by itself, is not the Langmuir invention, but it is a working tube in which all the elements, cathode, plate, vacuum, so co-ordinate and interwork that current flow is not affected by gas,' a statement which, as we have already pointed out, takes no account of the scientific knowledge, available before Langmuir, that increase of vacuum in well known devices was all that was necessary to produce the desired result. Respondent elaborates, by saying that 'in the practical prior art devices (that is to say, low vacuum tubes) the conduction of current depended upon gas ionization; the art, moreover, believed that unless there was enough gas to act as a conductor no current could flow and the tube would not work.' It says that the high vacuum tube of the patent works on a different principle, that of the 'pure electron discharge' and it was the recognition of this scientific truth and the adaptation of the device to it in which the invention consists.\n But if Langmuir's invention is so to be defined, it is not the invention claimed by the patent. Respondent puts forth as sustaining this definition, statements in the specifications of the patent, to the effect that in the device of the patent, in which gas ionization is absent, the discharge is 'distinct in its characteristics' from the described discharge taking place in an ionized gas, and again that it is 'characterized by regularity and reproducibility with given conditions.' But, while these and many other statements in the patent indicate that high vacuum was an effective means of producing in the old tubes of the art the stable current which could not be produced in the presence of ionization, they do not suggest any discovery of a scientific truth that essentially different principles control the discharge in low vacuum tubes from those \n\n[283 U.S. 664, 684]\n\u00a0\n which operate in high, other than that ionization, present when gas is present, has certain effects, notably on stability of current in a low vacuum, which is absent in the high, when ionization is absent, as Lilienfeld and others had disclosed.\n If it were necessary to a decision we could not find that any such scientific truth is established by this record. Respondent, to support the contention, does not rely on evidence, but on a collection of more or less casual statements by various writers, made before 1915, to the effect that the gas or ionized gas of the low vacuum tube is a conductor. Before the development of the election theory, 'conductivity' of substances was a convenient expression for explaining the flow of electric currents. Fleming, in a statement in 1906, already quoted, referred to the high vacuum as a good 'conductor' if a not cathode was used. The present tendency is to ascribe the flow of current from a hot cathode through both high and low vacua to the flow or discharge of electrons. Millikan, the eminent physicist, testified that this theory was generally accepted before 1912. Langmuir himself so explained the flow of current in a gaseous tube in his specifications. The known truth is that current flows through both low and high vacua and is unfavorably affected by ionization in the former; but that the flow is due to conductivity of the ionized gas in one and to something different, pure electron discharge, in the other, is not established by the evidence before us. There is some testimony to the contrary. Nor is our attention directed to anything which suggests that Langmuir though there was such a difference, or relied upon it to remove ionization effects, rather than upon the simple expedient of removing the gas known to be responsible for them.\n Even if the asserted difference were established, it is no more than the scientific explanation of what Lilienfeld and others knew, before Langmuir, of the effect of the high vacuum on the discharge, and the methods and devices for procuring the vacuum. It is method and de- \n\n[283 U.S. 664, 685]\n\u00a0\n vice which may be patented and not the scientific explanation of their operation. See Le Roy v. Tatham, 14 How. 156, 174-176.\n Only when invention is in doubt may advance made in the art be thrown in the scale to support it. If we were to assume that invention here was doubtful, we can find little to suggest that the high vacuum tube when produced satisfied a long felt want or that its present utility is indicatve o f anything more than the natural development of an art which has passed from infancy to its present maturity since Langmuir filed his application. There was little or no practical use for a high vacuum tube in 1913. The De Forest audion was not in general use and Langmuir did not see one until that year. The many amendments of Langmuir's application during its long pendency, disclosing his uncertainty as to what he had invented, and the exhibits in this case, constitute a history of the development of the art, which indicate unmistakably that the resort to the high vacuum tube for discharges above ionization voltages was but the adaptation to the natural development of the art, by those skilled in it, of the scientific knowledge which had been accumulated by investigation and experimentation. When the need became apparent, De Forest and Arnold, as well as Langmuir, found ready at hand the knowledge which would enable one skilled in the art to satisfy it.\n The court below, contenting itself with finding invention, said nothing of the finding of prior use by the District Court. We hold that this finding of the District Court was supported by the evidence and should have been given effect. As we have concluded that the Langmuir patent did not involve invention, we refer only briefly to the facts which establish prior use. In 1911 and until September of 1912, De Forest was in the employ of the Federal Telegraph Co. of California, then engaged in the commercial transmission and reception of radio messages, in which audion detectors as well as \n\n[283 U.S. 664, 686]\n\u00a0\n audion amplifiers were used. August 20, 1912, the earliest date claimed for Langmuir, was rejected rightly, we think, by the District Court, which held that Langmuir was anticipated by Arnold in November, 1912. But before the earlier date, De Forest sought and obtained a high vacuum in the audions used as amplifiers, and observed that when the vacuum was too low the blue glow effect occurred at from 15 to 20 volts. In order to secure higher voltages from the audions used as amplifiers and to procure the requisite high vacuum, he had some of the bulbs re-exhausted while superheated. By August 1912, the Telegraph Company used De Forest amplifying audions at 54 volts, and by November, they were used by another at 67 1\/2 volts. This was possible only because the tubes had thus been exhausted of gas, which would otherwise have ionized with blue glow at from 20 to 30 volts. The vacuum was lower than that obtained by later and improved methods; but the effect of high vacuum upon voltages above the point of ionization was then known, and the knowledge was thus availed of in practice. Whether De Forest knew the scientific explanation of it is unimportant, since he did know and use the device and employ the methods, which produced the desired results, and which are the device and methods of the patent.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The order of Oct. 19, 1931, amending the opinion reads as follows:\n Ordered, that the opinion in this case be amended as follows:\n (1) By substituting for the words 'In July, 1912,' in the twelfth line of the last paragraph of the opinion, as follows: 'August 20, 1912, the earliest date claimed for Langmuir, was rejected rightly, we think, by the District Court, which held that Langmuir was anticipated by Arnold in November, 1912.

UNITED STATES(1931)\n\nArgued: October 16, 1931Decided: November 23, 1931\n\n\n\n Messrs. John Spalding Flannery, of Washington, D. C., and George C. Holton, of New York City, for petitioner.[ De Laval Steam Turbine Co. v. United States \n284 U.S. 61\n (1931) ]\n\n\n[284 U.S. 61, 65]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Charles B.Rugg, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n\n[284 U.S. 61, 68]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the court.\n Petitioner, a manufacturer of marine steam turbines, prior to January 12, 1918, had entered into thirteen written contracts with various firms and corporations for the manufacture of steam turbine propulsion units for ships. In the early part of 1918, after petitioner had commenced work under the contracts, the United States, acting through the Emergency Fleet Corporation, requisitioned these contracts, and advised the parties that it would make just compensation for the turbine equipment which the petitioner was required to complete, and that the Emergency Fleet Corporation would assume the responsibility of the contracts, and make payment to petitioner.\n The present controversy concerns three of these contracts (the other ten having been fully performed), the first for the construction of four marine turbine sets at the contract price of $150,000, the second for the construction of ten marine turbine sets at the contract price of $735,000, and the third for the construction of four marine turbine sets at the contract price of $216,000. Petitioner continued to perform its obligations under these contracts as directed by the Fleet Corporation, for about a year, at which time, following the signing of the Armistice, it became necessary in the public interest to suspend op- \n\n[284 U.S. 61, 69]\n\u00a0\n erations under the contracts; and upon the several orders of the Fleet Corporation, petitioner suspended operations, stored the materials on hand, which had been assembled for the performance of the contracts, until January 14, 1920, when, by agreement, they were released from the effect of the requisition, and were taken over by petitioner at an agreed salvage value.\n The Fleet Corporation awarded compensation to petitioner, but the latter thought the award insufficient and sought by this suit in the Court of Claims to have the amount of just compensation determined. The Court of Claims gave judgment in favor of petitioner for its actual costs and expenditures over the cash payments received, amounting to $116,231.66, together with $30,000 damages for extraordinary expenses resulting from the stopping of work, and $15,000 for expenses and rental incident to the storing of materials during the period after the order to stop work. From the total of these items, certain deductions, including a payment by the Fleet Corporation of 75 per cent. of the amount which it had awarded, were made, resulting in an award of $84,074.34, with interest thereon from August 17, 1920. To this award the court added $8,500, with interest from March 17, 1919, as the value of the three contracts at the time of their cancellation, and the loss sustained by the petitioner by reason thereof. According to the findings, the petitioner, if it had been allowed to complete the performance of the three contracts, would have realized a profit of over $300,000. But the court below declined to include any amount for anticipated profits. 70 Ct. Cl. 51.\n The sole question presented for our determination is whether petitioner was entitled to an allowance of the amount, or any part of the amount, of these anticipated profits as a part of the just compensation. \n\n[284 U.S. 61, 70]\n\u00a0\n In Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 514\n, 43 S. Ct. 428, the contract involved had been made directly with the government for the manufacture of certain war supplies. Following the Armistice, and while the contract was in process of being performed, the Secretary of the Navy directed its cancellation. Suit was brought in the Court of Claims to recover just compensation. That court found that if the manufacturer had been permitted to complete the contract according to its terms, a very large amount would have been earned as profits, but refused to include in its award any part of these anticipated profits. We affirmed this determination and held that the statute (Act June 15, 1917,  1, 40 Stat. 182) which empowered the President '(b) To modify, suspend, cancel, or requisition any existing or future contract for the building, production, or purchase of ships or material,' applied to the government's own contracts as well as to private contracts, and that just compensation for the cancellation of such contracts should include 'the value of the contract at the time of its cancellation, not what it would have produced by way of profits for the Car Company, if it had been fully performed.'\n A distinction is sought to be drawn between the Russell Motor Car Company Case and the present case, on the ground that there the contract was made directly with the government, and here they were made between private parties. The question, therefore, is whether this circumstance alters the rule in respect of just compensation. In determining that question, the cardinal point to be borne in mind is that whether the contract requisitioned or canceled be one with the government or one between private individuals, the person whose property rights are taken or destroyed is entitled to receive just compensation, not damages as for a breach. A sufficient ground for the distinction lies in the fact that in the one case the requisition or cancellation is a \n\n[284 U.S. 61, 71]\n\u00a0\n lawful act under the power of eminent domain, while in the other the act constituting the breach is unlawful.\n In the present case, the government requisitioned the purchasers' rights in the contracts, not for the purpose of putting an end to the contracts, but of keeping them alive for the benefit of the government. Its action being in pursuance of law, the government succeeded to all the rights of the purchasers under the contracts. The effect was the same as though the contracts had been assigned by the purchasers with the consent of the manufacturer. There resulted, by operation of law, a substitution of purchasers, and the government became possessed of the right to enforce the contracts as though it had been an original contracting party. In effect, the old contracts became new contracts between the government and the petitioner. See F. Haag & Bro. v. Reichert, 142 Ky. 298, 301, 134 S. W. 191. Compare Wiggins Ferry Co. v. O. & M. R. Co., \n142 \nU.S. 396, 408\n, 12 S. Ct. 188; Chicago, Rock Island R. Co. v. Denver & Rio Grande R. Co., \n143 \nU.S. 596, 608\n, 12 S. Ct. 479.\n In this view, the government canceled its own contracts, and it is hard to see why the Russell Motor Car Company Case is not strictly applicable. Moreover, the Act of June 15, 1917, c. 29, 40 Stat. 182, authorized the President to cancel 'any existing or future contract,' ( setion 1), etc., and this language, as we have held, applies whether the contract is with the government or between private parties. In either case, cancellation is an exercise of the power of eminent domain, and the liability of the government is for just compensation. There is no warrant for saying that the elements to be considered in fixing just compensation are different in respect of the two classes of contracts. The Russell Motor Car Company Case dealt with a government contract, but Brooks- Scanlon Corp. v. U. S., \n265 U.S. 106\n, page 123, 44 S. Ct. 471, 475, involved the requisition of a private contract, and this court, holding that the claimant was entitled to just compensation, defined the term as follows: \n\n[284 U.S. 61, 72]\n\u00a0\n 'It is the sum which, considering all the circumstances-uncertainties of the war and the rest-probably could have been obtained for an assignment of the contract and claimant's rights thereunder; that is, the sum that would in all probability result from fair negotiations between an owner who is willing to sell and a purchaser who desires to buy.'\n Obviously, this does not justify the allowance of anticipated profits, although, of course, the fact that the contract, if carried out, would be profitable is one of the circumstances which naturally would be considered by one seeking an assignment of the contract, and must be given its proper weight in fixing just compensation. But that is very different from an allowance of anticipated profits as in the case of a breach. Whether the contract taken or canceled is one with the government or is a private contract, the result of the two cases is that just compensation means the same; 'the value of the contract at the time of its cancellation, not what it would have produced by way of profits ... if it had been fully performed.' Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, supra, 261 U. S. page 523, 43 S. Ct. 428, 431.\n The court below found that the value of the contracts at the time of their cancellation and the loss sustained by reason thereof was $8,500, and in its judgment included this amount as a separate item. In the course of its opinion, the court said (page 65 of 70 Ct. Cl.) that the amount of this item was to be determined 'from all of the facts and circumstances in the case which bear thereon, as shown by the evidence, and (the court) has fixed the amount thereof in the findings at $8,500.00.' The amount, it is true, seems small, but the evidence is neither before us nor open for our consideration, and there is nothing in the findings which would justify this court in saying that the court below did not give weight to all proper elements entering into the determination of the amount of just compensation, including the fact that large profits would have \n\n[284 U.S. 61, 73]\n\u00a0\n resulted from the full performance of the contract. To what extent, in the opinion of the lower court, the realization of profits was rendered highly improbable by other facts and circumstances does not appear, and is not open to speculation. We perceive no basis for substituting our judgment in the matter for that of the court below.\n The fact that the contracts were made prior to the passage of the Act of June 15, 1917, does not alter the situation. They were entered into subject to the power of Congress to enact legislation authorizing the government to take them over for its benefit, or to modify, suspend, or cancel them, as required by the necessities of war, and an implied condition to that effect must be read into the contracts. See cases cited in Omnia Commercial Co. v. United States, \n261 U.S. 502\n, 511-513, 43 S. Ct. 437. Congress, in the exercise of its lawful powers, provided by the act for such taking over, etc., and expressly included 'existing' as well as 'future' contracts. Whether the contracts here involved were entered into before or after the passage of that act, therefore, becomes immaterial. It is true that in the Russell Motor Car Company Case the contract was after the statute, and it was said that the contract was entered into with the prospect of its cancellation in view, since the statute was binding and must be read into the contract; but it was not intended thereby, in the face of the precise terms of the statutory provision, to include within the reach of the implication only future contracts and exclude therefrom existing contracts. The contract there and the contracts here were entered into not only subject to statutes already in force, but to those which should thereafter be passed. Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, \n219 \nU.S. 467, 480\n, 31 S. Ct. 265, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 671. In that case, this court held that the prohibition of the Act of February 4, 1887, c. 104,  2, 24 Stat. 379, as amended (49 USCA  2), prohibiting a carrier from charging compensation differing from that specified in its published tariff, meant that transportation should be paid for by all alike \n\n[284 U.S. 61, 74]\n\u00a0\n and only in cash, and that it had the effect of rendering invalid a contract, valid when made, for the issue of free transportation. The court said (page 482 of 219 U. S., 31 S. Ct. 265, 270): 'The agreement between the railroad company and the Mottleys must necessarily be regarded as having been made subject to the possibility that, at some future time, Congress might so exert its whole constitutional power in regulating interstate commerce as to render that agreement unenforceable, or to impair its value. That the exercise of such power may be hampered or restricted to any extent by contracts previously made between individuals or corporations is inconceivable. The framers of the Constitution never intended any such state of things to exist.'\n There is nothing in the findings or in the circumstances to suggest that the manufacturer sustained any injury from the requisition itself, since the government undertook to carry out the contracts, and its credit was certainly not inferior to that of the original purchaser. The injury resulted, not from the requisition, but from the subsequent cancellation of the contracts.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDENMAN v.

That for the purposes of this title ... the term 'gross income'-...\n\n'(b) Does not include the following items, which shall be exempt from taxation under this title: ...\n\n'(4) Interest upon (a) the obligations of a State, Territory, or any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia. ...'\n\n'Sec. 214 (a) That in computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions: ...\n\n'(2) All interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness, except on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry obligations or securities (other than obligations of the United States issued after September 24, 1917, and originally subscribed for by the taxpayer) the interest upon which is wholly exempt from taxation under this title. ...'\n\n By original petition in the District Court, Northern District of Ohio, Slayton asserted that the exception found in paragraph (2),  214(a), conflicts wtih the Federal Constitution, in that by necessary operation it causes discrimination against the owners of nontaxable securitis, and nullifies their immunity from taxation. Also that the act is discriminatory and unconstitutional, in that necessary expenses incident to all other kinds of business, including interest paid for purchasing and carrying merchandise and inventories, are allowed as part of the operating cost, whereas deduction of interest paid by plaintiff upon funds borrowed to carry nontaxable securities (an ordinary operating expense) is prohibited. Also \n\n[282 U.S. 514, 519]\n\u00a0\n that the act is arbitrary and unconstitutional because it discriminates against plaintiff, whose resources do not permit him to purchase tax free securities for cash and in favor of those whose resources permit them to purchase and carry such securities without borrowing.\n The collector unsuccessfully demurred to the petition upon the ground that it states no cause of action. Judgment went for the plaintiff, and was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Both courts were of opinion that, under the doctrine announced in National Life Ins. Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 508\n, 48 S. Ct. 591, enforcement of paragraph (2),  214(a), would deprive respondent of rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.\n The challeged judgment must be reversed. The case will be remanded to the District Court with instructions to enter judgment for the collector.\n The circumstances disclosed in National Life Ins. Co. v. United States were radically different from those now presented, and the doctrine upon which that cause turned does not control the present one. The respondent here was not in effect required to pay more upon his taxable receipts than was demanded of others who enjoyed like incomes solely because he was the recipient of interest from tax free securities-a result which we found would have followed enforcement of the literal provisions of section 245(a), Revenue Act 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 261. While guaranteed exemptions must be strictly observed, this obligation is not inconsistent with reasonable classification designed to subject all to the payment of their just share of a burden fairly imposed.\n The manifest purpose of the exception in paragraph 2,  214(a), was to prevent the escape from taxation of income properly subject thereto by the purchase of exempt securities with borrowed money.\n Under the theory of the respondent, A, with an income of $10,000 arising from nonexempt securities by \n\n[282 U.S. 514, 520]\n\u00a0\n the simple expedient of purchasing exempt ones with borrowed funds and paying $10,000 interest thereon, would escape all taxation upon receipts from both sources. It was proper to make provision to prevent such a possibility. The classification complained of is not arbitrary, makes no improper discrimination, does not result in defeating any guaranteed exemption, and was within the power of Congress. The fact that respondent engaged in the business of buying and selling is not important. See Willcuts, etc., v. Bunn, \n282 \nU.S. 216\n, 51 S. Ct. 125, decided January 5, 1931\n\n\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","46":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDENTON v. YAZOO & M. V. R. CO.(1931)\nNo. 242\nArgued: December 11, 1931Decided: January 4, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 305, 306]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John P. Bramhall, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. H. D. Minor, of Memphis, Tenn., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 305, 307]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, a United States railway postal clerk, sustained an injury due to the alleged negligence of one Hunter, a porter in the general service of the two railroad companies named as respondents. Hunter was hired and paid by the Illinois Central Railroad Company. At the time of the injury, he was engaged in loading United States mail into a mail car, under the direction of a United States postal transfer clerk, and was not, as to that work, under the direction or control of either of the railroad companies.\n The mail was being transported by the railroad companies under chapter 261,  5, 39 Stat. 412, 429, U. S. C., title 39,  541 (39 USCA  541), which requires all railway common carriers to transport such mail 'in the manner, under the conditions, and with the service prescribed by the Postmaster General.' A regulation of the Postmaster General, adopted by authority of this statute, provides: 'Section 1293. ... 2. Railroad companies shall furnish the men necessary to handle the mails, to load them into and receive them from the doors of railway post office cars, and to load and pile the mails in and unload them from storage and baggage cars, under the direction of the transfer clerk, or clerk in charge of the car, if one is on duty, except as provided in Section 1290. Mails intended for delivery to postal clerk shall never be placed in a postal car unless there is a clerk on duty to receive and care for them.'\n Petitioner brought an action in a Mississippi state court of first instance, against the railroad companies and \n\n[284 U.S. 305, 308]\n\u00a0\n Hunter, to recover damages for the injury, joining the railroads upon the theory that, in performing the work of loading the mail, Hunter was their servant. A verdict against all of the defendants was returned by the jury, and a judgment thereon entered. The judgment, as to the railroad companies, was reversed by the state Supreme Court on the ground that what Hunter was doing at the time of his alleged negligent act was not for them but for the United States. 133 So. 656.\n Whether the railroad companies may be held liable for Hunter's act depends not upon the fact that he was their servant generally, but upon whether the work which he was doing at the time was their work or that of another; a question determined, usually at least, by ascertaining under whose authority and command the work was being done. When one person puts his servant at the disposal and under the control of another for the performance of a particular service for the latter, the servant, in respect of his acts in that service, is to be dealt with as the servant of the latter and not of the former. This rule is elementary and finds support in a large number of decisions, a few only of which need be cited. In Standard Oil Co. v. Anderson, \n212 \nU.S. 215, 220\n, 225 S., 29 S. Ct. 252, 253, this court said:\n'The servant himself is, of course, liable for the consequences of his own carelessness. But when, as is so frequently the case, an attempt is made to impose upon the master the liability for those consequences, it sometimes becomes necessary to inquire who was the master at the very time of the negligent act or omission. One may be in the general service of another, and, nevertheless, with respect to particular work, may be transferred, with his own consent or acquiescence, to the service of a third person, so that he becomes the servant of that person, with all the legal consequences of the new relation. ...\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 305, 309]\n\u00a0\n 'To determine whether a given case falls within the one class or the other we must inquire whose is the work being performed,-a question which is usually answered by ascertaining who has the power to control and direct the servants in the performance of their work. Here we must carefully distinguish between authoritative direction and control, and mere suggestion as to details or the necessary coo peration, where the work furnished is part of a larger undertaking . ...\n'In many of the cases the power of substitution or discharge, the payment of wages and other circumstances bearing upon the relation are dwelt upon. They, however, are not the ultimate facts, but only those more or less useful in determining whose is the work and whose is the power of control.'\n\n And see Linstead v. Ches. & Ohio Ry., \n276 \nU.S. 28\n, 48 S. Ct. 241; Harrell v. Atlas Portland Cement Co. (C. C. A.) 250 F. 83, 85; Brady v. Chicago & G. W. Ry. Co. (C. C. A.) 114 F. 100, 107, 57 L. R.

(1876-1877) 205.\n The statutory obligation imposed upon the railroad carriers is simply to transport mail offered for transportation by the United States. They are not required to handle, load, or receive mail matter, but only to furnish the men necessary for those purposes. The men so furnished handle the mails and load them into, and receive them from, the railway post office cars, as the regulation prescribes, 'under the direction of the transfer clerk, or clerk in charge of the car.' The work they do is that of the government. It is said that 'direction' means nothing more than the right to point out or indicate to the men fur- \n\n[284 U.S. 305, 310]\n\u00a0\n nished the disposition to be made of the mail. The scope of the word, as it is here used, is not to be thus limited. The phrase, 'under the direction of the transfer clerk,' would be practically meaningless unless it comprehended the power to supervise and control the movement. Obviously, as the evidence shows, a direction by the transfer clerk carries with it the duty, on the part of the men directed, to obey, and has, and was intended to have, the force of a command. See Warner Valley Stock Company v. Smith, \n165 \nU.S. 28, 34\n, 17 S. Ct. 225; Kellyville Coal Co. v. Bruzas, 223 Ill. 595, 600, 79 N. E. 309.\n The Anderson Case, supra, and Driscoll v. Towle, 181 Mass. 416, 63 N. E. 922, 923, are relied upon by petitioner to sustain the verdict of the jury. In the Anderson Case, a winchman in the general service of the Standard Oil Company was furnished by the company to a master stevedore under contract with it to load a ship with oil. The winchman, in operating the winch, depended upon signals to be given by an employee of the stevedore to determine the proper time for hoisting and lowering the cargo. The negligence charged was that a draft of cases had been lowered before receiving the signal. This court held upon the facts, in the light of the rule which we have just stated and discussed, that the power, the winch, and the winchman were those of the company, and that the company did not furnish them, but furnished the work they did to the stevedore; and that this work was done by the company as its own work, by its own instrumentalities and servant under its control. A judgment for Anderson against the company was affirmed.\n In the Driscoll Case, the defendant was engaged in a general teaming business. Plaintiff was struck and injured by a horse or wagon driven by a servant of the defendant. This driver, for some time, had been carrying property for an electric light company under some \n\n[284 U.S. 305, 311]\n\u00a0\n arrangement between that company and the defendant. He was told by an employee of the company, from time to time, what to do and where to go, and was sometimes directed to drive fast, in which event he did so. He selected his own route, and had exclusive management of his horse. At the time of the accident, he was going to get some supplies in pursuance of an order from the foreman of the company. It was held that there was evidence to go to the jury that the driver was the servant of the defendant. The court said that it fairly could be found that the contract between defendant and the company was an ordinary one by the defendant to do his regular business by his servants in the common way; that in such cases the one who employs the contractor controls the servant only in the sense that he indicates the work to be done; but that the person who receives such orders is not subject to the general orders of the one who gives them. 'He does his own business in his own way, and the orders which he receives simply point out to him the work which he or his master has undertaken to do.'\n In each of these cases, the facts plainly demonstrated that the work was that of the general master, and that in doing it, the servant had not passed under the direction and control of the person for whom the immediate work was being done; the latter being looked to not for commands, but for information. As already shown, the facts of the present case require a different conclusion.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","47":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEAST OHIO GAS CO. v. TAX COMMISSION OF OHIO(1931)\nNo. 453\nArgued: Decided: May 18, 1931\n\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 465, 466]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William B. Cockley and T. H. Hogsett, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for appellant. \n\n[283 U.S. 465, 467]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Gilbert Bettman, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellees, acting under the tax laws of Ohio, assessed against appellant additional excise taxes for 1927, 1928, and 1929. The latter brought this suit to restrain collection on the ground that, when construed to cover the amounts demanded, the state legislation is repugnant to the commerce clause of the federal Constitution. Plaintiff applied to the court consisting of three judges for a temporary injunction; and, pursuant to stipulation made at the hearing, the case was submitted for final determination upon an agreed statement of facts. The court announced an opinion (43 F.(2d) 170) sustaining the state enactments, and entered its decree dismissing the complaint.\n Under the Ohio Code every corporation engaged in the business of supplying to consumers within the state natural gas for light, heat, or power is a natural gas company, section 5416, and is required to report to the tax commission, section 5470. The latter is directed annually to determine the entire gross receipts of such company, for the year ending on the then next proceding first day of May, excluding \n\n[283 U.S. 465, 468]\n\u00a0\n therefrom all receipts 'derived wholly from interstate busines,'  ection 5475, and to certify the amount so determined to the auditor of state, section 5481. He is directed to charge each such company 'a sum in the nature of an excise tax, for the privilege of carrying on its intra-state business, to be computed on the amount so fixed and reported by the commission as the gross receipts of such company on its intra-state business ... by taking one and thirty-five one-hundredths per cent. of all such gross receipts. ...' Section 5483\n\n\n Appellant, an Ohio corporation, is engaged as a public utility in the business of furnishing natural gas to consumers in more than 50 municipalities in that state. During the years in question it obtained approximately 25 per cent. of its supply from its own Ohio wells, 72 per cent. from the Hope Natural Gas Company of West Virginia, and 3 per cent. from the People's Natural Gas Company of Pennsylvania. The West Virginia gas is gathered to a station in that state, there freed from gasoline vapors and pumped at a pressure of from 200 to 300 pounds per square inch into transmission lines which connect, at the boundary between the states, with appellant's high-pressure transmission lines. By means of these the gas is transmitted to a station in Stark county, whence it is taken by other lines to pressure reducing stations. The lines there connect with distribution lines in which is maintained pressure of from 30 to 50 pounds per square inch and which are a part of the distribution system in each municipality served. From the latter the gas enters the local supply mains wherein pressure is reduced to that necessary-a few ounces per square inch- to carry the gas through the service pipes extending to the premises of consumers and suitably to supply their burners. The consumers control the flow of gas on their premises. The Pennsylvania gas is collected, treated, compressed for transmission, delivered to appellant at the state line \n\n[283 U.S. 465, 469]\n\u00a0\n and by it transported, relieved of pressure, and conducted through such mains and service pipes to consumers' appliances precisely as is West Virginia gas. The Ohio gas is gathered and conducted from the fields in that state to the high-pressure distribution lines and thereafter treated and brought to consumers as is the gas brought from the other states. Appellant's contracts with consumers do not specify any source from which it is to obtain gas. To an extent not disclosed by the record, appellant collects minimum charges for service and charges for readiness to serve without regard to the quantity of gas consumed. It furnishes to some communities exclusively gas from outside the state, to some only that from Ohio and to others a mixture of that from West Virginia and Ohio.\n In accordance with the statute, as then construed by the Attorney General, appellant, in its reports to the Tax Commission for the years in question, returned as receipts from interstate business all sums collected from customers receiving only gas from wells outside Ohio, treated as intrastate earnings the receipts from those using only Onio gas and apportioned between intrastate and interstate business, on the relation of the quanity of each to the total, receipts from those served by a mixture of Ohio and other gas. The commission accepted that classification, and the taxes were computed and paid on that basis. In 1930, appellees, construing the laws to require the inclusion of all receipts, without regard to the source of the gas furnished, applied the prescribed rate to the amounts theretofore treated as receipts from interstate business, and demanded from appellant payment of the sums so arrived at, together with penalties prescribed for failure to pay excise taxes when due.\n The question is whether the state statute, construed to include the amounts reported as receipts from interstate business, operates directly to regulate or burden interstate commerce. \n\n[283 U.S. 465, 470]\n\u00a0\n Admittedly the exaction is not a tax on property nor in lieu of a property tax. The statute calls it, and in fact it is, a tax for the privilege ofcarr ying on intrastate business. Receipts from interstate business are expressly excluded from the calculation. It is elementary that a state can neither lay a tax on the act of engaging in interstate commerce nor on gross receipts therefrom. Pullman Co. v. Richardson, \n261 \nU.S. 330, 338\n, 43 S. Ct. 366. New Jersey Tel. Co. v. Tax Board, \n280 \nU.S. 338, 346\n, 50 S. Ct. 111. And, while a state may require payment of an occupation tax by one engaged in both intrastate and interstate commerce, the exaction, in order to be valid, must be imposed solely on account of the intrastate business without enhancement because of the interstate business done, and it must appear that one engaged exclusively in interstate business would not be subject to the imposition, and that the taxpayer could discontinue the intrastate business without withdrawing also from the interstate business. Sprout v. South Bend, \n277 U.S. 163\n, 170-171, 48 S. Ct. 502, 62 A. L. R. 45, and cases cited.\n The transportation of gas from wells outside Ohio by the lines of the producing companies to the state line and thence by means of appellant's high pressure transmission lines to their connection with its local systems is essentially national-not local-in character and is interstate commerce within as well as without that state. The mere fact that the title or the custody of the gas passes while it is en route from state of state is not determinative of the question where interstate comminative ends. Public Utilities Comm. v. Landon, \n249 \nU.S. 239, 245\n, 39 S. Ct. 268; Missouri v. Kansas Gas Co., \n265 U.S. 298\n, 307-309, 44 S. Ct. 544; People's Gas Co. v. Pub. Ser. Comm., \n270 \nU.S. 550, 554\n, 46 S. Ct. 371; Pub. Util. Comm. v. Attleboro Co., \n273 \nU.S. 83, 89\n, 47 S. Ct. 294. But when the gas passes from the distribution lines into the supply mains, it necessarily is relieved of nearly all the pressure put upon it at the stations of the producing \n\n[283 U.S. 465, 471]\n\u00a0\n companies, its volume thereby is expanded to many times what it was while in the high pressure interstate transmission lines, and it is divided into the many thousand relatively tiny streams that enter the small service lines connecting such mains with the pipes on the consumers' premises. So segregated the gas in such service lines and pipes remains in readiness or moves forward to serve as needed. The treatment and division of the large compressed volume of gas is like the breaking of an original package, after shipment in interstate commerce, in order that its contents may be treated, prepared for sale, and sold at retail. State v. Flannelly, 96 Kan. 372, 383-384, 152 P. 22; W. Va. & Md. Gas Co. v. Public S. Com., 134 Md. 137, 143-145, 106 A. 265. Cf. Atlantic Coast Line v. Standard Oil Co., \n275 \nU.S. 257, 269\n, 48 S. Ct. 107; Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat, 419; Leisy v. Hardin, \n135 \nU.S. 100\n, 10 S. Ct. 681. It follows that the furnishing of gas to consumers in Ohio municipalities by means of distribution plants to supply the gas suitably for the service for which it is intended is not interstate commerce, but a business of purely local concern exclusively within the jurisdiction of the state.\n Appellant relies on Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm., \n252 \nU.S. 23\n, 40 S. Ct. 279. There the question was whether the New York commission had jurisdiction to prescribe the rates to be charged local consumers of gas transported to that state from Pennsylvania. This court, following the findings of the highest court of New York (225 N. Y. 397, 403-404, 122 N. E. 260), held that the entire movement of the gas was interstate commerce, and that, in the absence of contrary regulation by the Congress, the state commission had jurisdiction to prescribe such rates. The theory on which that conclusion was reached is not wholly consistent with the views expressed in Public Utilities Comm. v. Landon, supra, and in Missouri v. Kansas Gas Co., sura. In the former the court \n\n[283 U.S. 465, 472]\n\u00a0\n said at page 245 of 249 U. S., 39 S. Ct. 268, 270: 'Interstate movement ( of natural gas being transported from State to State) ended when the gas passed into local mains.' In the latter, it was said at page 308 of 265 U. S., 44 S. Ct. 544, 546: 'With the delivery of the gas (transported from one State to another) to the distributing companies ... the interstate movement ends. Its subsequent sale and delivery by these companies to their customers at retail is intrastate business and subject to state regulation. ... In such case the effect on interstate commerce, if there be any, is indirect and incidental ... (page 309 of 265 U. S., 44 S. Ct. 544, 546). The business of supplying, on demand, local consumers is a local business, even though the gas be brought from another state and drawn for distribution directly from interstate mains; and this is so whether the local distribution be made by the transporting company or by independent distributing companies. In such case the local interest is paramount, and the interference with interstate commerce, if any, indirect and of minor importance.' It does not appear that there were presented, in Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm., to the state court or here the considerations on which it is held that interstate commerce ends and intrastate business begins when gas flowing through pipe lines from outside the state passes into local distribution systems for delivery to consumers in the municipalities served. But, however that may be, the opinion in that case must be disapproved to the extent that it is in conflict with our decision here.\n The Ohio statute does not purport to affect interstate commerce. The specified excise taxes are laid for the privilege of carrying on intrastate business. The amounts were calculated on gross receipts derived wholly from appellant's intrastate business, notwithstanding the gas used had moved in interstate commerce.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","48":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEASTERN TRANSP CO, EX PARTE(1931)\n\nArgued: Decided: March 23, 1931\n\n\n Messrs.

The petitioner claimed a deduction from income of $22400 as a bad debt. The deduction was disallowed by the Commissioner, by the Board of Tax Appeals and, in \n\n[283 U.S. 140, 141]\n\u00a0\n review, by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 42 F.(2d) 158. A writ of certiorari was allowed by this Court. \n282 \nU.S. 826\n, 51 S. Ct. 76. 75 L. Ed. -.\n The petitioner's tax return was on the cash basis. The facts of the transaction concerned were that the petitioner and his partner were joint endorsers of notes issued by a corporation that they had formed. There remained due upon these notes $44800, that the corporation was unable to pay. In 1925 the petitioner and his partner in settlement of their liability made a joint note for that sum to the bank that held the corporation's paper, received the old notes, marked paid, and destroyed them. The petitioner claims the right to deduct half that sum as a debt 'ascertained to be worthless and charged off within the taxable year' under the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27,  214(a)(7), 44 Stat. 9, 27 (26 USCA  955(a)(7).\n It seems to us that the Circuit Court of Appeals sufficiently answered this contention by remarking that the debt was worthless when acquired. There was nothing to charge off. The petitioner treats the case as one of an investment that later turns out to be bad. But in fact it was the satisfaction of an existing obligation of the petitioners, having, it may be, the consequence of a momentary transfer of the old notes to the petitioner in order that they might be destroyed. It is very plain we think that the words of the statute cannot be taken to include a case of that kind. We do not perceive that the case is bettered by the fact that some of the original notes years before were given for property turned over to the corporation by the partnership that formed it. For the purpose of a return upon a cash basis there was no loss in 1925. As happily stated by the Board of Tax Appeals the petitioner 'merely exchanged his note under which he was primarily liable for the corporation's notes under which he was secondarily liable, without any outlay of cash or property having a cash value.' A deduction may be per- \n\n[283 U.S. 140, 142]\n\u00a0\n missible in the taxable year in which the petitioner pays cash. The petitioner says that it was definitely ascertained in 1925 that thepet itioner would sustain the losses in question. So it was, if the petitioner ultimately pays his note. So was the tax considered in United States v. Mitchell, \n271 \nU.S. 9, 12\n, 46 S. Ct. 418, but it could not be deducted until it was paid.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","50":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEDUCATIONAL FILMS CORPORATION v.

The tax is payable in advance for each year beginning November 1st, and is at the rate of 4 1\/2 per cent. of so much of the corporation's entire net income for its preceding fiscal year as is, under other sections, allocated to the business carried \n\n[282 U.S. 379, 386]\n\u00a0\n on within the state. By section 209 the net income embraces 'income from any source,' and 'is presumably the same as the entire net income' reported for income taxation to the United States, 'plus ... dividends on stocks or any interest received on bonds of any character.' Subdivision 3 of section 208 provides: 'The term 'entire net income' means the total net income, including all dividends received on stocks and all interest received from federal, state, municipal or other bonds. ...' Appellant's bill of complaint sets up that during its fiscal year ending June 30, 1929, it was the owner of copyrights granted by the United States upon motion picture films, and had received royalties from the licensing of them. It challenges the tax assessed against it under the statute, for the year beginning November 1, 1929, so far as it is measured by the amount of the royalties.\n Appellant's contention is based on two propositions, both essential to its conclusion that the tax is invalid. They are, first, that the copyrights and all income derived from them are immune from state taxation since they, like patents, are instrumentalities of the federal government, taxation of which the Constitution impliedly forbids (see Long v. Rockwood, \n277 \nU.S. 142\n, 48 S. Ct. 463); and, secon, t hat the present tax, measured by net income, is void, so far as the measure includes income from the copyrights, because a tax on federal instrumentalities. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n For present purposes it is enough if we direct our attention to the second proposition. At the outset appellant contends that the tax, although stated in the Taxing Act \n\n[282 U.S. 379, 387]\n\u00a0\n to be on corporate franchises, is in reality a tax on income, and as such falls within the class of taxes which concededly may not be directly imposed on federal instrumentalities. In support of the contention, it points to the language of the statute (sections 214-A and 214(8), dealing with the computation of the tax), and to an opinion of the New York Court of Appeals (People ex rel. Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Knapp, 230 N. Y. 48, 57, 129 N. E. 202), which refer to the tax as one 'upon income.'\n So far as these considerations are of weight, they are counterbalanced by the later pronouncement of the same court in People ex rel. Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton v. State Tax Commission, 232 N. Y. 42, 46, 133 N. E. 122: '... Although we have said in another connection (People ex rel. Alpha P. C. Co. v. Knapp, supra, 230 N. Y. 57, 129 N. E. 205) that 'the tax imposed upon this franchise must be held in practical operation to be a tax upon the income. ... This tax is equivalent to a tax upon relator's income,' it is primarily a tax levied for the privilege of doing business in the state.'\n But the nature of a tax must be determined by its operation rather than by particular descriptive language which may have been applied to it. As was said in Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, \n279 \nU.S. 620, 625\n, 626 S., 49 S. Ct. 432, 434, '... neither state courts nor Legislatures by giving the tax a particular name, or by using some form of words, can take away our duty to consider its nature and effect. ... This court must determine for itself by independent inquiry whether the tax here is what, in form and by the decision of the state court, it is declared to be. ...' On \n\n[282 U.S. 379, 388]\n\u00a0\n appeal from the state court in People ex rel. Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton v. State Tax Commission, supra, this court upheld the tax and defined its nature, saying, \n266 \nU.S. 271, 280\n, 45 S. Ct. 82, 83: 'It is not a direct tax upon the allocated income of the corporation in a given year, but a tax for the privilege of doing business in one year measured by the allocated income accruing from the business in the preceding year. See New York v. Jersawit, \n263 \nU.S. 493, 496\n, 44 S. Ct. 167.' See, also, Home Insurance Co. v. New York, \n134 \nU.S. 594\n, 10 S. Ct. 593; People ex rel. United States Aluminum Printing Plate Co. v. Knight, 174 N. Y. 475, 67 N. E. 65, 63 A. L. R. 87; Anderson v. Forty-two Broadway Co., \n239 \nU.S. 69\n, 36 S. Ct. 17.\n If we look to the operation of the present statute, it is plain that it can have no application independent of the corporation's enjoyment of the privilege of exercising its franchise. If appellant had ceased to do businss before November 1, 1929, it would not have been subject to any tax under this statute, although it had received, during its preceding fiscal year, income which the statute makes the measure of the tax. Since it can be levied only when the corporation both seeks or exercises the privilege of doing business in one year and has been in receipt of net income during its preceding fiscal year, the tax, whatever descriptive terms are properly applicable to it, obviously is not exclusively on income apart from the franchise. Hence we pass to the chief objection urged against it, that such a tax, however described, and even though deemed to be a tax on franchises, is invalid so far as it is measured by income derived from a federal instrumentality.\n Under the Constitution the privilege of exercising the corporate franchise is the legitimate object, and the immunity of federal instrumentalities from taxation, a legitimate restriction, of the state power to tax. To give both to the power and to the immunity such a practical construction as will not unduly restrict the power of the government imposing the tax, or the exercise of the func- \n\n[282 U.S. 379, 389]\n\u00a0\n tions of the government which may be affected by it, is the problem necessarily involved in determining the extent of the immunity. See Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514, 523\n, 524 S., 46 S. Ct. 172. So far as it concerns the power of a state to impose a tax on corporate franchises, the problem has long since ceased to be novel. While this court, since McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, has consistently held that the instrumentalities of either government, or the income derived from them, may not be made the direct object of taxation by the other, Weston v. City Council of Charleston, 2 Pet. 449; Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County, 16 Pet. 435; Home Savings Bank v. Des Moines, \n205 \nU.S. 503\n, 27 S. Ct. 571; Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, \n240 \nU.S. 522\n, 36 S. Ct. 453; Federal Land Bank v. Crosland, \n261 \nU.S. 374\n, 43 S. Ct. 385, 29 A. L. R. 1, it has held with like consistency that the privilege of exercising the corporate franchise is no less an appropriate object of taxation by one government merely because the corporate property or net income, which is made the measure of the tax, may chance to include the obligations of the other, or the income derived from them. The constitutional power of one government to reach this permissible object of taxation may not be curtailed because of the indirect effect which the tax may have upon the other.\n The precise question now presented was definitely answered in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 U.S. 107\n, 162, et seq., 31 S. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312, which upheld a federal tax, levied upon a corporate franchise granted by a state, but measured by the entire corporate income, including, in that case, income from tax exempt municipal bonds. In reaching this conclusion, the court reaffirmed the distinction, repeatedly made in earlier decisions, between a tax, invalid because laid directly on governmental instrumentalities or income derived from them, and an excise which is valid because imposed on corporate franchises, even though the corporate property or income which is the measure of the \n\n[282 U.S. 379, 390]\n\u00a0\n tax embraces tax exempt securities or their income. See Society for Savings v. Coite, 6 Wall. 594; Provident Institution v. Massachusetts, 6 Wall. 611; Hamilton Mfg. Co. v. Massachusetts, 6 Wall. 632; Home Insurance Co. v. New York, supra.\n Upon a like principle other forms of excise tax have been upheld, although the statutory measure of the tax included securities constitutionally immune from any form of direct taxation. A state inheritance or legacy tax is valid, although measured by the value of United States bonds which are transmitted. Plummer v. Coler, \n178 \nU.S. 115\n, 20 S. Ct. 829. See, also, Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. . 2 78, 22 S. Ct. 213: Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1\n, 48 S. Ct. 410. Cf. Greiner v. Lewellyn, \n258 \nU.S. 384\n, 42 S. Ct. 324; Willcutts, Collector v. Bunn (No. 22) \n282 \nU.S. 216\n, 51 S. Ct. 125, decided January 5, 1931. By parity of reasoning an inheritance tax may be levied by a state on a bequest to the United States, United States v. Perkins, \n163 \nU.S. 625\n, 16 S. Ct. 1073, and by the United States on a bequest to a municipality, Snyder v. Bettman, \n190 \nU.S. 249\n, 23 S. Ct. 803. Similarly, state laws, taxing to stockholders, at full value, shares in national banks, are upheld, although the banks own tax exempt United States bonds. Van Allen v. Assessors, 3 Wall. 573, 583; Duer v. Commissioners, 4 Wall. 244, 255; People's National Bank of Kingfisher v. Board of Equalization, \n260 \nU.S. 702\n, 43 S. Ct. 98; Des Moines National Bank v. Fairweather, \n263 U.S. 103\n, 112 et seq., 44 S. Ct. 23. A tax on net income is not a forbidden tax on exports because it includes receipts from exports in the computation of the income, Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165\n, 38 S. Ct. 432; Barclay & Co. v. Edwards, \n267 \nU.S. 442\n, 45 S. Ct. 135, 348; nor is the inclusion in a state income tax of receipts from interstate commerce a prohibited burden on commerce, United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321\n, 38 S. Ct. 499, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 748; Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 57\n, 40 S. Ct. 221; cf. Interborough Rapid Transit Co. v. Sohmer, \n237 \nU.S. 276, 283\n, 284 S., 35 S. Ct. 549. It has been held that a state tax upon the franchise of a corporation, \n\n[282 U.S. 379, 391]\n\u00a0\n measured by its receipts from transportation, properly apportioned to the business done within the state, is valid, although including receipts from interstate commerce. Maine v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co., \n142 \nU.S. 217\n, 12 S. Ct. 121; cf. Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Ry. Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217\n, 28 S. Ct. 638. A state may not tax tangible property located beyond its boundaries, Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194\n, 26 S. Ct. 36, 4 Ann. Cas. 493; but it may measure a tax on franchises of domestic corporations by corporate property, even though without the state. Kansas City, Ft. S. & M. R. Co. v. Botkin, \n240 \nU.S. 227\n, 36 S. Ct. 261; Cream of Wheat Co. v. Grand Forks County, \n253 \nU.S. 325\n, 40 S. Ct. 558. So well settled is this last-mentioned application of the doctrine that an excise may be measured by tax immune property, that an appeal in which such a tax was assailed on the very grounds urged here, was dismissed per curiam during the present term. No. 108, Nebraska ex rel. Beatrice Creamery Co. v. Marsh, \n282 \nU.S. 799\n, 51 S. Ct. 38, 75 L. Ed. -, decided October 20, 1930\n\n\n It is said that there is no logical distinction between a tax laid on a proper object of taxation, measured by a subject-matter which is immune, and a tax of like amount imposed directly on the latter; but it may be said with greater force that there is a logical and practical distinction between a tax laid directly upon all of any class of government instrumentalities, which the Constitution impliedly forbids, and a tax such as the present, which can in no case have any incidence, unless the taxpayer enjoys a privilege which is a proper object of taxation, and which would not be open to question if its amount were arrived at by any other nondiscriminatory method.\n This court, in drawing the line which defines the limits of the powers and immunities of state and national governments, is not intent upon a mechanical application of the rule that government instrumentalities are immune from taxation, regardless of the consequences to the op- \n\n[282 U.S. 379, 392]\n\u00a0\n erations of government. The necessity for marking those boundaries grows out of our constitutional system, under which both thefed eral and the state governments exercise their authority over one people within the territorial limits of the same state. The purpose is the preservation to each government, within its own sphere, of the freedom to carry on those affairs committed to it by the Constitution, without undue interference by the other. McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, page 405 of 4 Wheat.; The Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 125; Union P. Railroad Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 31; South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437, 461\n, 26 S. Ct. 110, 4 Ann. Cas. 737; Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., supra, pages 154, 172 of 220 U. S., 31 S. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312; Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, supra, pages 523, 524 of 269 U. S., 46 S. Ct. 172.\n Having in mind the end sought, we cannot say that the rule applied by this court for some seventy years, that a nondiscriminatory tax upon corporate franchises is valid, notwithstanding the inclusion of tax exempt property or income in the measure of it, has failed of its purpose, or has worked so badly as to require a departure from it now, or that the present tax, viewed in the light of actualities, imposes any such real or direct burden on the federal government as to call for the application of a different rule.\n The decision of this court in Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, supra, upon which appellant relies, was not such a departure. That case did not overrule Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., supra. Instead, the opinion rested the decision on the distinguishing fact that the tax exempt securities were included in the measure of the franchise tax by virtue of an amendment to the taxing statute which, it was held, was specifically intended to reach the income from tax exempt national and municipal bonds which had previously not been included in the measure of the tax. The case was thus brought within the purview of Miller v. Milwaukee, \n272 \nU.S. 713\n, 47 S. Ct. 280, in which this court had stated, with respect to a state tax on income, no franchise or \n\n[282 U.S. 379, 393]\n\u00a0\n privilege tax being involved: 'If the avowed purpose or self-evident operation of a statute is to follow the bonds of the United States and to make up for its inability to reach them directly by indirectly achieving the same result, the statute must fail even if but for its purpose or special operation it would be perfectly good.' But, as the court in that case was careful to point out, in language later quoted with approval in Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, page 631 of 279 U. S., 49 St. Ct. 432, 435, 'A tax very well may be upheld as against any casual effect it may have upon the bonds of the United States when passed with a different intent and not aimed at them. ...'\n It cannot be said that the present tax was aimed at copyrights. Appellant insists that it is, for the same reason as the tax held invalid in Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, supra, in that amendments of the Taxing Act, sufficiently broad to include income from tax immune property in the measure of the tax, were specifically intended to accomplish that result. Reference is made to the legislative history of the statute. In People ex rel. Standard Oil Co. v. Law, 237 N. Y. 142, 142 N. E. 446, it was held as a matter of statutory construction that the 'entire net income' specified by the act then in force was gross income as defined by the applicable provisions of the federal income tax law, less specified deductions, and that consequently income from state and municipal bonds and some federal bonds was not included in the measure of the tax. After that decision subdivision 3 of section 208 was amended, Laws N. Y. 1924, c. 329, to include in the definition of income 'all interest received from federal, state, municipal or other bonds'; and section 209 was amended, Laws N. Y. 1927, c. 479, so as to include in the measure of the tax 'income from any source.'\n But the statute, before these amendments, was sufficiently broad to include income from copyrighs w ithin the measure of the tax; and neither before nor after the \n\n[282 U.S. 379, 394]\n\u00a0\n amendments did it make any mention of copyrights or their income. There is nothing to suggest that the Legislature could at any time have had in mind the addition of income from copyrights to the measure of the tax, or that the statute or the amendments were adopted 'for the very purpose of subjecting' it 'pro tanto to the burden of the tax,' which was declared to be the vice of the statute in Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, supra, page 631 of 279 U. S., 49 S. Ct. 432. That the royalties play some part in the measure of the tax is the result of the application of the general language of the statute to particular circumstances to which the statute makes no specific reference. In this respect, the present statute differs in no substantial way from that upheld in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., supra.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND (dissenting).\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice BUTLER, and myself entertain a different view.\n The duty of this court to examine taxing acts to see that the use of federal tax exempt subjects as a measure for taxes imposed in terms upon taxable subjects is not a cloak, under which the former in substance and effect are taxes, was never more imperative than now, when, by reason of increased and increasing public expenditures, states and municipalies are driven to search in every direction for additional sources of revenue.\n The self-evident operation of the provisions of the New York Tax Law is to cause the tax here in question to fall on an instrumentality of the United States. The statute necessarily exacts tribute from the income derived from that instrumentality. The amount of this tax is the same, and its effect, in every respect, is the same, as though it had been imposed upon the income in precise terms. Were it not for Flint v. Stone Tracy Co. it would be difficult to suggest any reason for ignoring the rule so \n\n[282 U.S. 379, 395]\n\u00a0\n often laid down in the earlier cases, that the validity of the tax will depend not on what is named as the subject of the tax, but on its effect. Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, \n279 U.S. 620\n, 625-627, 49 S. Ct. 432, 435.\n It is true that this court in the Macallen Case did not overrule the Flint Case, but it did characterize that case as 'the extreme example' of the doctrine that a tax may be measured by income, although a part of such income is derived from nontaxable property. But the Macallen Case definitely determined that such a tax must be held to be invalid if the legislative purpose to lay the tax upon the nontaxable subject to 'fairly inferable from a consideration of the history, the surrounding circumstances, or the statute itself considered in all its parts.' In the present case, we are of opinion that the legislative purpose, though not as clear as it is in respect of income derived from federal bonds, is 'fairly inferable' in respect of copyrights. And, although it may be conceded that a tax measured by income derived from copyrights does not impose a burden upon the exercise of a vital power of the federal government, as it would in the case of federal bonds, it is, nevertheless, a tax falling upon income which is exempt in virtue of an implied prohibition of the Federal Constitution. Long v. Rockwood, \n277 \nU.S. 142\n, 48 S. Ct. 463.\n A former act of the state had been held not to reach certain federal bonds (People ex rel. Standard Oil Co. v. Law, 237 N. Y. 142, 149, 142 N. E. 446), and that act was amended so as to include 'all interest received from federal, state, municipal or other bonds.' The amendment by definite words thus clearly manifests the legislative purpose to include in the measure of the tax, income derived from federal bonds of every description, and there by to disregard the exemption of federal instrumentalities from state taxation. So far, then, as federal bonds are concerned, the case falls precisely within the test laid down in the Macallen Case, and substantially within the facts \n\n[282 U.S. 379, 396]\n\u00a0\n of that case. The Legislature, however, was not content with this, but later amended the Taxing Act so as to include in the measure of the tax 'income from any source.' The history of these amendments, successively broadening the terms of the statute, fairly justifies the inference that the aim of the Legislature was to reach income from every source, including that derived from all varieties of nontaxable subjects, and therefore necessarily including copyrights and patents. That aim the state cannot make effective consistently with constitutional principles long respected and vital to the preservation of our dual system of government.\n What was said by this court in Home Savings Bank v. Des Moines, \n205 \nU.S. 503\n, 27 S. Ct. 571, is peculiarly apposite. In that case a statute of Iowa provided that 'shares of stock of state and savings banks and loan and trust companies shall be assessed to such banks and loan and trust companies, and not to individual stockholders.' The statute was assailed on the ground that the tax, though in form upon shares of stock, was in fact upon the property of the banks, etc., and invalid because the value of United States bonds which they owned were included in the valuation of the property assessed to them. The court, looking through the words of the act to its purpose and effect, sustained the contention of the banks. In deciding the question, the court said (page 509 of 205 U. S., 27 S. Ct. 571):\n'It is conceded, and cannot be disputed, that these securities are beyond the taxing power of the state, and the only question, therefore, is whether in point of fact, the state has taxed them. The first step useful in the solution of this question is to ascertain with precision the nature of the tax in controversy, and upon what property it was levied, and that step must be taken by an examination of the taxing law as interpreted by the supreme court of the state. A superficial reading of the law would lead \n\n[282 U.S. 379, 397]\n\u00a0\n to the conclusion that the tax authorized by it is a tax upon the shares of stock. The assessment is expressed to be upon 'shares of stock of state and savings banks and loan and trust companies.' But the true interpretation of the law cannot rest upon a single phrase in it. All its parts must be considered in the manner pursued by this court in New Orleans v. Houston, \n119 \nU.S. 265, 278\n, 7 S. Ct. 198, 415, and Home Insurance Co. v. New York, \n134 \nU.S. 594\n, 10 S. Ct. 593, with the view of determining the end accomplished by the taxation, and its actual and substantial purpose and effect. We must inquire whether the law really imposes a tax upon the shares of stock as the property of their owners, or merely adopts the value of those shares as the measure of valuation of the property of the corporation, and by that standard taxes that property itself.'\n\n And at page 521 of 205 U. S., 57 S. Ct. 571, 577:\n'If, by the simple device of adopting the value of corporation shares as the measure of the taxation of the property of the corporation, that property loses the immunities which the supreme law gives to it, then national securities may easily be taxed whenever they are owned by a corporation, and the national credit has no defense against a serious wound.'\n\n That the principle, 'an act may become unlawful when done to accomplish an unlawful end,' applies to statutes imposing taxes is well established. Federal Land Bank v. Crosland, \n261 \nU.S. 374, 378\n, 43 S. Ct. 385, 386, 29 A. L. R. 1.\n But, wholly apart from extrinsic circumstances, the statute itself in terms seems clearly to impose an income tax. The tax is not one upon the privilege of doing business, but it is an annual tax for the privilege of doing business, to be computed upon the basis of the net income for the year next preceding. The highest court of the state, in People ex rel. Alpha P. C. Co. v. Knapp, 230 N. Y. 48, 56, 57, 129 N. E. 202, 205, so held in an opinion by Judge Cardozo, from the \n\n[282 U.S. 379, 398]\n\u00a0\n reasoning of which it is had t o escape. After citing and discussing pertinent decisions of this court, he concludes:\n'Tested by these precedents, the tax imposed upon this franchise must be held in practical operation to be a tax upon the income. Such, indeed, it would be in form as well as in substance, if the Legislature had not stated (section 209) that the 'privilege of doing business' was the consideration for the payment. Nothing but that recital stands between the statute and conceded invalidity. How the Legislature itself looked upon the substance of the burden is indicated by other provisions of the same and later statutes. The tax is to be in lieu of all other taxes on personal property or capital stock. Tax Law,  219j. It is to be in lieu of all other taxes upon income. Section 350, subd. 7. There surely was no intention that all mercantile and manufacturing corporations, foreign and domestic, should in very truth be exempt from taxes upon property so fundamental in importance as capital and the fruits of capital. The reason for the apparent exemption was that, under the form of a tax upon the franchise, the property of such corporations had already been subjected to its share of public burdens.\n\n'I think, therefore, that in substance, though not in form, in tendency, though not in name, this tax is equivalent to a tax upon relator's income.'\n\n There is nothing in the later case of People ex rel. Bass, Ratcliff, etc., v. Tax Comm., 232 N. Y. 42, 133 N. E. 122, which, in our opinion, challenges Judge Cardozo's cogent view. That case involved the question whether income which arose in part from property outside the state of New York could be constitutionally included in the basis for computing the tax. The court held it could, being 'based on a comparison of the total assets with the assets in New York.' The court quoted what Judge Cardozo had said in the preceding case, that \"the tax imposed upon this \n\n[282 U.S. 379, 399]\n\u00a0\n franchise must be held in practical operation to be a tax upon the income . ... This tax is equivalent to a tax upon relator's income\"; and then added, 'it is primarily a tax levied for the privilege of doing business in the state.' This amounts to nothing more than a repetition in brief of what Judge Cardozo, more at length, already had said, namely, that in practical operation the tax is one upon income for the privilege of doing business; and it leaves the conclusion set forth in the quotation we have made from the Knapp Case wholly without modification.\n These views, we submit, require a reversal of the judgment below. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n]  209.

For the privilege of exercising its franchise in this state in a corporate or organized capacity every domestic corporation, and for the privilege of doing business in this state, every foreign corporation, except corporations specified in the next section, shall annually pay in advance for the year beginning November first next succeeding the first day of July in each and every year an annual franchise tax, to be computed by the tax commission upon the basis of its entire net income, as defined in subdivision three of section two hundred and eight of the tax law, for its fiscal or the calendar year next preceding, as hereinafter provided, which entire net income is presumably the same as the entire net income which such corporation is required to report to the United States, plus any income received as dividends on stocks or any interest received on bonds of any character, and without deduction for taxes paid on either profits or net income to the government of the United States or for any specific deduction allowed by any other authority, except that the entire net income of a corporation not organized under the laws of any state within the United States which shall be taken as the basis of computation by the tax commission shall be the entire net income in fact and determined as hereinbefore provided rather than the amount earned in the United States or the amount returned to the United States treasury department, or as otherwise provided by section two hundred and fourteen of the tax law. However, in determining the entire net income, for purposes of equitable taxation under this article of the tax law, the tax commission may include income from any source, provided only that the assets from which the income arose shall be included in any segregation for the purpose of computing the tax. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The equity jurisdiction to enjoin collection of the tax is not challenged. The legal remedy provided by the statute for the recovery of taxes after payment falls short of adequacy in at least two respects. Refund, if any, is expressly without interest. Section 219-d. See Proctor & Gamble Distributing Co. v. Sherman (D. C.) 2 F.(2d) 165; Southern California Telephone Co. v. Hopkins (C. C. A.) 13 F.(2d) 814, 820, aff'd \n275 \nU.S. 393\n, 48 S. Ct. 180. If judicial review of the action of the state tax commission in assessing the tax results in a determination that such action was illegal, the statute calls for the credit of so much of the tax as was illegally exacted, or refund at the direction of the commission. But it is at least doubtful whether any refund can be compelled. Section 219-d. See Gorham Mfg. Co. v. Travis (D. C.) 274 F. 975, aff'd \n266 \nU.S. 265\n, 45 S. Ct. 80; Dawson v.

Ellery Edwards, of New York City, and Harold Elno Smith, of Cleveland, Ohio, for petitioners.[ Ensten v. Simon, Ascher & Co. \n282 U.S. 445\n (1931) ]\n\n\n[282 U.S. 445, 447]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John F. Neary, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By an original bill presented to the District Court, Southern District of New York, November 9, 1929, petitioners sought to prevent respondent from further infringing Letters Patent No. 1,313,080, for improvements in knitted caps and to recover damages. They asked a preliminary injunction; affidavits were presented by both sides; the facts are not controverted.\n It appears-\n That the patent, 6 claims, issued to Louis H. Ensten August 12, 1919. In the first suit upon it-Ensten v. Rich-Sampliner Co., et al.-commenced in the District Court, Northern District of Ohio, an interlocutory decree, \n\n[282 U.S. 445, 448]\n\u00a0\n dated May 24, 1922, adjudged claims 1, 3, 4 and 5 valid and infringed; claim 2 invalid.\n That within 30 days the defendants appealed from so much of that decree as upheld the four claims; the complainant might have but did not appeal. The Circuit Court of Appeals approved the decree so far as challenged June 20, 1923; the validity of claim 2 was not before it. Rehearing was denied October 4, 1923; mandate issued October 18, 1923. 291 F. 1003\n\n\n That after such remittance the District Court ordered an accounting. The complainant offered to show damages to his exclusive licensee, Lion Knitting Mills Company. As that Company was not party to the cause, the Master rejected the offer; the court affirmed his action.\n That on April 30, 1924, Ensten disclaimed as to claim 2 in the Patent Office. Thereafter, he and the Lion Knitting Mills Company presented a joint bill against the original defendants. A motion to dismiss because of unreasonable neglect and delay in making the disclaimer was sustained April 5, 1926, 13 F. (2d) 132-Judge Westenhaver. The Circuit Court of Appeals, May 9, 1927, 19 F. (2d) 66, held the second bill was in effect an amendment to the original one; declared the objection based upon failure to disclaim more promptly moot; reversed the decree of the District Court; and remanded the cause for appropriate proceedings. Subsequently, the parties settled their differences; the defendant paid substantial damages; and final decree went for the complainants November 1, 1928.\n No facts except those above detailed are relied upon.\n Having heard the parties to the present proceeding, the trial court held that Ensten, the patentee, unreasonably neglected and delayed to disclaim claim 2 after the District Court in Ohio had declared in invalid, denied an application for injunction and dismissed the bill.\n The \n\n[282 U.S. 445, 449]\n\u00a0\n Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this action February 3, 1930, Ensten et al. v. Simon, Ascher & Co., 38 F.(2d) 71; called attention to the conflict between its views and those of the Circuit Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, Excelsior Steel Furnace Co. v. Meyer & Bro. Co., 36 F.(2d) 447, 449, and suggested the desirability of an authoritative determination of the controverted question of law.\n The petition here for certiorari asked for the writ because the conflict of opinion in the two Circuits. The point contested below and differently ruled in the Circuit Courts of Appeals concerns the effect of the delay in disclaiming. According to the usual practice we will consider nothing else.\n Determination of the issue presented must turn upon the construction and effect of sections 65 and 71,tit le 35, U. S. C. (35 USCA  65, 71, Rev. St.  4917, 4922; sections 7 and 9, Act of 1837, 5 Stat. 193), copied in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[282 U.S. 445, 450]\n\u00a0\n The first of these sections provides in substance that whenever, through inadvertence, accident, or mistake, and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention, a patentee has claimed more than that of which he was the original or first inventor or discoverer, he may be permitted to make disclaimer of such parts of the thing patented as he shall not choose to claim or hold by virtue of his patent. The other permits the patentee to maintain a suit on his patent, although through inadvertence, accident, or mistake, and without any willful default or intention to mislead the public, he has claimed some material or substantial part as an invention of which he was not the original or first inventor. He is deprived, however, of the right to recover costs, unless he has filed proper disclaimer before commencement of his suit. And it further provides: 'But no patentee shall be entitled to the benefits of this section if he has unreasonably neglected to delayed to enter a disclaimer.'\n In order properly to apply these Sections consideration must be given to the provisions touching review of inter- \n\n[282 U.S. 445, 451]\n\u00a0\n locutory decrees by Federal courts. Formerly, federal practice permitted appeals only from final decrees. Section 7, Act March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 828, empowered Circuit Courts of Appeals to review an interlocutory decree granting or continuing an injunction. Ex parte National Enameling Co., \n201 \nU.S. 156\n, 26 S. Ct. 404.Thi  section was modified by Act of 1895, c. 96, 28 Stat. 666, and by Act of June 6, 1900, 31 Stat. 660. And the Act of April 14, 1906, 34 Stat. 116, amended it to read thus:\n'Sec. 7. That where, upon a hearing in equity in a district or in a circuit court, or by a judge thereon in vacation, an injunction shall be granted or continued, or a receiver appointed by an interlocutory order or decree, in any cause an appeal may be taken from such interlocutory order or decree granting or continuing such injunction, or appointing such receiver, to the circuit court of appeals.'\n\n The Judicial Code, Act March 3, 1911, 36 Stat. 1134, provided:\n'See. 129. Where upon a hearing in equity in a district court, or by a judge thereof in vacation, an injunction shall be granted, continued, refused, or dissolved by an interlocutory order or decree, or an application to dissolve an injunction shall be refused, or an interlocutory order or decree shall be made appointing a receiver, an appeal may be taken from such interlocutory order or decree granting, continuing, refusing, dissolving, or refusing to dissolve, an injunction, or appointing a receiver, to the circuit court of appeals, notwithstanding an appeal in such case might, upon final decree under the statutes regulating the same, be taken directly to the Supreme Court: Provided, That the appeal must be taken within thirty days from the entry of such order or decree. ...'\n\n See Act of 1925,  227, title 28, U. S. C. (28 USCA  227) which further enlarged the right. \n\n[282 U.S. 445, 452]\n\u00a0\n Did the patentee Ensten unreasonably neglect or delay to make disclaimer of claim 2 after May 24, 1922, when the District Court in Ohio declared it invalid? He disclaimed April 30, 1924; and only the facts narrated above are relied on the explanation or excuse.\n Under the early accepted general rule a patent with an invalid claim was wholly void, and this defect effectually barred suit upon it. Congress undertook to modify this by sections 7 and 9, c. 45, Act of 1837, 5 Stat. 193. In substance these became sections 4917 and 4922, Revised Statutes, and 65 and 71, Title 35, U. S. C. (35 USCA  65, 71). The two sections 'are parts of one law, having one general purpose, and that purpose is to obviate the inconvenience and hardship of the common law, which made a patent wholly void if any part of the invention was wrongfully claimed by the patentee, and which made such a defect in a patent an effectual bar to a suit brought upon it.' Hailes v. Albany Stove Co., \n123 U.S. 582\n, 8  Ct. 262, 266; Sessions v. Romadka, \n145 \nU.S. 29, 41\n, 12 S. Ct. 799. Construed together they 'enact that where a patentee claims materially more than that which he was the first to invent, his patent is void, unless he has preserved the right to disclaim the surplus; and that he may fail to preserve that right, by unreasonable neglect or delay to enter a disclaimer in the Patent Office.' Walker on Patents (6th Ed.)  254.\n The statute is remedial; the intent is to aid the inventor free from wilful default or intention to mislead the public by permitting him to avoid the consequence of inadvertence, accident or mistake through prompt disavowal of the apparent right to exclude others from something improperly included in the words of his grant. Escape is permitted only to one who acted originally in good faith and who has complied with the prescribed conditions. 'The same principle which forbids a patentee to assert a right to more than he has actually invented compels him to disavow the right as soon as he discovers that it \n\n[282 U.S. 445, 453]\n\u00a0\n has been unjustly claimed. Unreasonable delay in disclaiming is thus tantamount to an original fraudulent claim, and through it the patentee loses the privilege of making the amendment by which alone his patent could be saved. The question of unreasonable delay is a question for the court, upon the facts as found either by its own investigation or the verdict of a jury. Delay begins whenever the patentee becomes aware that he has claimed more than e h as invented or described. In cases where the excess is not apparent at once upon the inspection of the patent by the patentee, the allowance of his claim by the patent office raises such a presumption in its favor that he may rely on its validity until a court of competent jurisdiction decides that it is broader than his real invention.' Robinson on Patents (1890) Volume II, page 284.\n The petitioners say that after Judge Westenhaver by interlocutory decree declared claim 2 invalid the patentee had several options. He might have made disclaimer immediately; he might have appealed from the interlocutory decree within 30 days; he might have awaited the final decree and appealed from that; he might have sued again in another Circuit and prosecuted such suit to final decree. Accordingly, they maintain that the delay which actually occurred cannot be declared unreasonable.\n Under this view a patentee having procured allowance of an invalid claim may hold it in the face of the public for years (here nearly two years) with large possible advantage to himself and much injury to others. By the assertion of his apparent monopoly he may deter others from legitimate action and seriously prejudice the public. See Miller v. Brass Co., \n104 U.S. 350\n, 355.\n To support their position petitioners rely especially upon O'Reilly v. Morse (1853) 15 How. 62,121, and Seymour v. McCormick (1856) 19 How. 96,106.\n O'Reilly v. Morse was decided here when appeals in federal courts lay only from final decrees. The Circuit \n\n[282 U.S. 445, 454]\n\u00a0\n Court has sustained all claims of the patent. This Court held one invalid and then disposed of the contention that because of the failure to disclaim there could be no right to recover under the valid ones. Mr. Chief Justice Taney for the court said:\n'It appears that no disclaimer has yet been entered at the patent office. But the delay in entering it is not unreasonable. For the objectionable claim was sanctioned by the head of the office; it has been held to be valid by a circuit court, and differences of opinion in relation to it are found to exist among the justices of this court. Under such circumstances the patentee had a right to insist upon it, and not disclaim it until the highest court to which it could be carried had pronounced its judgment. The omission to disclaim, therefore, does not render the patent altogether void; and he is entitled to proceed in this suit, for an infringement of that part of his invention which is legally claimed and described. But as no disclaimer was entered in the patent office before this suit was instituted, he cannot, under the act of Congress, be allowed costs against the wrongdoer, although the infringement should be proved. And we think it is proved by the testimony.'\n\n Seymour v. McCormick declared: 'In respect to the question of unreasonable delay in making the disclaimer, as going to the whole cause of action, the court are of opinion that the granting of the patent for this improvement, together with the opinion of the court below maintaining its validity, repel any inference of unreasonable delay in correcting the claim; and that, under the circumstances, the question is one of law. This was decided in the case of The Telegraph ((O'Reilly v. Morse), 15 How. (62) 121 (14 L. Ed. 601)).'\n Neither of these cases lends support to the petitioners. Attention also has been called to United States v. American Bell Tel. Co., \n167 \nU.S. 224\n, 17 S. Ct. 809, Simmons Co. v. Grier \n\n[282 U.S. 445, 455]\n\u00a0\n Bros., \n258 \nU.S. 82, 91\n, 42 S. Ct. 196, and other causes; but their facts differ so materially from those now presented that special comment upon them is unnecessary.\n In certain definitely defined circumstances and to the end that the mistaken but honest inventor may obtain relief from the old rule, the disclaimer provisions permit him to deprive the public temporarily of complete freedom from the assertion of a monopoly apparently valid, but not so in fact. When a competent court has declard h is pretentions without sufficient foundation, we think good faith and the spirit of the enactment demands that he act with such promptness as the circumstances permit either to vindicate his position or to relieve the public from further evil effects of his false assertion. But for the benign provisions of the statute, such an assertion would invalidate the whole patent; and these provisions were intended to protect only those who by prompt action either seek to overturn an adverse ruling or retreat from a false position.\n When the District Court in Ohio declared claim 2 invalid the owner of the patent might have appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals within thirty days and thus secured an early determination of his rights. He did not choose this course but continued to hold himself out as possessor of the sole right to 'make, use and vend' under the rejected claim for nearly two years. Then he abandoned it. He made no effort promptly to vindicate what he had asserted nor did he surrender it. Thus he failed to earn the offered exemption and now he may not complain.\n A similar view of the meaning and effect of sections 65 and 71 has been often accepted by District Courts and Circuit Courts of Appeals. The doctrine there commonly approved is that where one claim of a patent is declared invalid, the trial court may refuse a decree sustaining the \n\n[282 U.S. 445, 456]\n\u00a0\n others until there is disclaimer as to the invalid one or a prompt appeal.

Dow, Jones & Co., 168 F. 703, decided in 1909 prior to the enlarged appeal provision in the Judicial Code, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals expressed disapproval of the them prevailing practice upon the ground that an inventor should not be required to accept the opinion of a single judge. The principle reason for this objection disappeared when the Judicial Code became effective and broader appeals from interlocutory orders were permitted.\n In Excelsior Steel Furnace Co. v. Meyer & Bro. Co., the Circuit Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, declared that 'in no case would a court be justified in finding that a patentee unreasonably delayed the filing of a disclaimer until after the expiration of the statutory period within which he might further litigate the question of the validity of the contested claims.' But, in the Liquid Carbonic Co. v. Gilchrist, supra, the same court had said 'that under the circumstances indicated in these statutes ( sections 4917, 4922, R. S.), benefit of any recovery by the patentee is denied unless or until disclaimer is filed.' So far as we are advised no other court has sustained the theory advanced by the petitioners.\n Certainly, in this case where an appeal was taken by the defendants, it would have entailed no unreasonable hardship upon the patent owner promptly to have submitted the legality of the rejected claim for determination by \n\n[282 U.S. 445, 458]\n\u00a0\n the appellate court. The route to that end was obvious, easy, inexpensive. He deliberately failed to defend his assertion of right by appealing. He has been guilty of unreasonable delay and has not brought himself within the beneficent provisions of the statute.\n The judgment below must be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] ' 65. Disclaimer. Whenever, through inadvertence, accident, or mistake, and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention, a patentee has claimed more than that of which he was the original or first inventor or discoverer, his patent shall be valid for all that part which  truly and justly his own, provided the same is a material or substantial part of the thing patented; and any such patentee, his heirs or assigns, whether of the whole or any sectional interest herein, may, on payment of the fee required by law, make disclaimer of such parts of the thing patented as he shall not choose to claim or to hold by virtue of the patent or assignment, stating therein the extent of his interest in such patent. Such disclaimer shall be in writing, attested by one or more witnesses, and recorded in the Patent Office; and it shall thereafter be considered as part of the original specification to the extent of the interest possessed by the claimant and by those claiming under him after the record thereof. But no such disclaimer shall affect any action pending at the time of its being filed, except as far as may relate to the question of unreasonable neglect or delay in filing it. (R. S.  4917.)\n's 71. Suit for infringement where specification too broad. Whenever, through inadvertence, accident, or mistake, and without any willful default or intent to defraud or mislead the public, a patentee has, in his specification, claimed to be the original and first inventor or discoverer of any material or substantial part of the thing patented, of which he was not the original and first inventor or discoverer, every such patentee, his executors, administrators, and assigns, whether of the whole or any sectional interest in the patent, may maintain a suit at law or in equity, for the infringement of any part thereof, which was bona fide his own, if it is a material and substantial part of the thing patented, and definitely distinguishable from the parts claimed without right, notwithstanding the specifications may embrace more than that of which the patentee was the first inventor or discoverer. But in every such case in which a judgment or decree shall be rendered for the plaintiff no costs shall be recovered unless the proper disclaimer has been entered at the Patent Office before the commencement of the suit. But no patentee shall be entitled to the benefits of this section if he has unreasonably neglected or delayed to enter a disclaimer. (R. S.  4922).' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'Sec. 260. An important question arises when a District Court, before any disclaimer has been filed, decides that a part of the claims of the patent in suit are valid, and have been infringed by the defendant, while another part are void for want of novelty, or for want of invention, and ought therefore to be disclaimed. Ought the judge in such a case, to enter a decree for an injunction and an account on the valid claims, and allow the complainant to disclaim the others or not, as he deems most prudent; or should he decline to enter any decree till the complainant shall have filed a disclaimer? The second of these courses has been the practice in the first circuit, in the sixth, in the seventh, and, prior to the decision of Page Machine Co. v. Dow, Jones & Co., in the second circuit (168 F. 703); prior to the Page Machine Co. Case one of the judges in the second circuit criticised that practice as arbitrary and unjust, and in at least one case in the sixth circuit the practice has not been followed by the Circuit Court, the reason being given that such a requirement would deprive the complaint of the benefit of an appeal from the decree in so far as it held the disclaimed claim invalid. The same reason is stated in the Page Machine Co. Case. And one of the judges of the third circuit has held the first course to be the proper practice.\n'Where a patentee through inadvertence claimed that of which he was not the original inventor, but a disclaimer was not filed before suit, no recovery can be allowed or injunction, unless a disclaimer be filedwit hin a reasonable time.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","52":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFARBWERKE VORMALS MEISTER LUCIUS & BRUNING v.

And the Act of November 4, 1918, 40 Stat. 1020, 1021 (50 USCA Appendix  7(c), amended subsection (c) of section 7 to read:\n'If the President shall so require any money or other property including (but not thereby limiting the generality of the above) patents, copyrights, applications therefor, and rights to apply for the same, trade marks, choses in action, and rights and claims of every character and description owing or belonging toor h eld for, by, on account of, or on behalf of, or for the benefit of, an enemy or ally of enemy not holding a license granted by the President hereunder, which the President after investigation shall determine is so owing or so belongs or is so held, shall be conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid over to the Alien Property Custodian, or the same may be seized by the Alien Property Custodian; and all property thus acquired shall be held, administered and disposed of as elsewhere provided in this Act.\n\n'Any requirement made pursuant to this Act, or a duly certified copy thereof, may be filed, registered, or recorded in any office for the filing, registering, or recording of conveyances, transfers, or assignments of any such property or rights as may be covered by such requirement (including the proper office for filing, registering, or recording conveyances, transfers, or assignments of patents, copyrights, trade-marks, or any rights therein or any other rights); and if so filed, registered, or recorded shall impart the same notice and have the same force and effect as a duly executed conveyance, transfer, or assignment to the Alien Property Custodian so filed, registered, or recorded.'\n\n By three separate, similar written instruments, issued one February 3 and two March 22, 1919, the Alien Property Custodian declared concerning each of the letters patent numbered as above stated: 'I do seize said letters patent and every right, title and interest with respect \n\n[283 U.S. 152, 157]\n\u00a0\n thereto, including all damages and profits recoverable at law or in equity from any person, firm, corporation or government, for past infringement thereof, subject to the rights of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, Wilmington, Delaware.' And by an instrument dated April 10, 1919, he declared: 'I do sell, assign, transfer and set over unto the said the Chemical Foundation (Inc.), its successors and assigns, the whole right, title, and interest acquired by me and by said A. Mitchell Palmer (former Custodian), each as said Alien Property Custodian' in and to the same letters patent.\n June 23, 1922, the Chemical Foundation, Inc., brought suit against E. I. du Pont de Nemours Co. and Frank White, Treasurer of the United States. It alleged the grant of the license to the defendant company January 21, 1918, to make, use, and vend the inventions described and operation thereunder, but declared complainant was not informed whether any moneys were 'paid or are payable by said defendant to the Alien Property Custodian, as required by the terms of said license, nor as to what moneys, if any, are now held by the defendant Treasurer of the United States by virtue thereof'; further, that subsequent to the license the Alien Property Custodian seized and sold to complainant all of the specified letters patent, together with every right, title, and interest with respect thereto. The prayer asked discovery and accounting; also that the court determine reasonable compensation for use of the letters patent after complainant acquired them; and, further, for judgment to be satisfied from funds on deposit in the Treasury, if sufficient, otherwise, by the Du Pont Company. The reason for limiting the prayer to compensation after date of acquisition is not disclosed.\n June 30, 1922, petitioners in causes Nos. 180, 181, and 182 brought separate suits against the same defendants. \n\n[283 U.S. 152, 158]\n\u00a0\n Each alleged ownership of one of the letters patent, described in the license to the Du Pont Company, and asked recovery for the use thereof, the judgment to be paid out of funds in the Treasury, if sufficient; otherwise by that company.\n Answering the bill of the Chemical Foundation, the Du Pont Company admitted use of the letters patent under the license; alleged payment of $ 61,884.98, as reasonable compensation, to the Alien Property Custodian for deposit in the Treasury, termination of the license September 1, 1920, etc.\n October 6, 1927, the District Court ordered consolidation of the four causes 'to the extent of th iss ues therein relating to Federal Trade Commission License No. 19.'\n November 9, 1927, Frank White, Treasurer, moved to dismiss the bill of the Chemical Foundation because it was not owner of the patents within intendment of section 10, Trading with the Enemy Act, also because no adequate ground for relief had been shown. He also answered; admitted assignment of the letters patent to the Foundation; denied that it was the 'owner' within section 10; admitted the payment into the Treasury of $61, 884.98. On the same date he answered the bills in causes Nos. 180, 181, and 182, demanded proof of the allegations, etc.\n January 16, 1928, the Du Pont Company moved to dismiss the bills in causes Nos. 180, 181, and 182 because the complainants were not owners of the letters patent within section 10, and because the facts alleged were insufficient to justify relief. It also answered; denied that the complainants had owned any interest in the letters patent since April 10, 1919; admitted that it had been licensed to make, use, and vend the inventions covered by the letters patent, and had paid the agreed royalty; denied the right of the complainants to recover anything for such use, etc. \n\n[283 U.S. 152, 159]\n\u00a0\n April 28, 1928, in each of the causes Nos. 180, 181, and 182 the Alien Property Custodian moved that he be substituted for the complainant. He alleged that under the seizures of February 3 and March 22, 1919, his predecessor became owner of the letters patent and that he alone was authorized to sue within one year after the war ended, under section 10(f), Trading with the Enemy Act, to recover the reasonable royalty; also that under section 19, Act of March 10, 1928 (Settlement of War Claims Act), 45 Stat. 254, 277 (50 USCA Appendix  10(f), he should be substituted.\n The District Court denied the Treasurer's motions to dismiss, also those of the Alien Property Custodian for substitution as complainant. It held the German corporations were not 'owners' of the accrued royalties; that the Chemical Foundation by assignment from the Alien Property Custodian April 10, 1919, became the owner of the patents, together with accrued royalties, and was entitled to an accounting to ascertain the reasonable compensation for their use and enjoyment during the period between April 10, 1919, and September 1, 1920, and, when determined, this should be satisfied from funds in the Treasury derived from payments by the licensee, if sufficient, and, if not, by the Du Pont Company.\n Except the Chemical Foundation and the Du Pont Company, all parties appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court (39 F.(2d) 366), affirmed the action of the District Court (29 F.(2d) 597).\n Joint and several petitions for certiorari by the three German corporations were granted in causes Nos. 179, 180, 181, and 182, \n282 \nU.S. 819\n, 51 S. Ct. 25, 75 L. Ed. -.\n Writs were also allowed upon the petitions of Woods, Treasurer of the United States, and Sutherland, Alien Property Custodian, in Nos. 271, 272, 273, and 274, \n282 \nU.S. 819\n, 51 S. Ct. 25, 75 L. Ed. -. These petitioners do not now seek affirmative relief. They brought the causes here in order to save possible rights. \n\n[283 U.S. 152, 160]\n\u00a0\n The Chemical Foundation limits its demand to compensation for the period between April 10, 1919, and September 1, 1920. This demand was sustained below and is not now opposed.\n The German corporations, former owners, limit their demands to compensation for the period between January 21, 1918, and April 10, 1919. These demands were denied below. They are the subjects of the only substantial controversy before us; and its solution depends upon whether the Alien Property Custodian acquired the rights of the owners to collect for their previous use under license No. 19 when he seized the patents February 3 and March 22, 1919. Both courts below decided against the German corporations, and properly so we think.\n The Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended, in very definite terms authorized seizure of the patents in question; also 'ight  and claims of every character and description owing or belonging to or held for, by, on account of, or on behalf of, or for the benefit of, an enemy. ...' This court has said: 'At the time of the passage of the act, a large amount of property was owned and much business was carried on by alien enemies and their allies in this country. Congress determined that their property should be taken over and that trade with them should cease. The purpose was to weaken enemy countries by depriving their supporters of power to give aid.' Miller v. Robertson, \n266 \nU.S. 243, 248\n, 45 S. Ct. 73, 75. 'There is nothing to support a strict construction of the act in respect of the seizure and disposition of enemy property. On the other hand, contemporaneous conditions and war legislation indicate a purpose to employ all legitimate means effectively to prosecute the war. The law should be liberally construed to give effect to the purposes it was enacted to subserve.' United States v. Chemical Foundation, \n272 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 47 S. Ct. 1, 4. \n\n[283 U.S. 152, 161]\n\u00a0\n The Alien Property Custodian declared: 'I do seize said letters patent and every right, title and interest with respect thereto,' subject to the rights of the Du Pont Company. Considering the general purpose of Congress to weaken the enemy, this language certainly is broad enough to include the right of the owners of the seized patents to recover for their use under the outstanding license. We can discover no reason for thinking that the Custodian intended to seize the patents but to leave with enemies a right to sue for compensation on account of their use during earlier months of the war.\n The validity of the seizure by the Alien Property Custodian and of the subsequent sale and transfer to the Chemical Foundation was affirmed in United States v. Chemical Foundation, \n272 \nU.S. 1\n, 47 S. Ct. 1.\n The most plausible argument against the conclusion below rests upon section 7, Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended November 4, 1918. This provides that any requirement under the act may be filed for registration, and, 'if so filed, registered, or recorded shall impart the same notice and have the same force and effect as a duly executed conveyance, transfer, or assignment to the Alien Property Custodian so filed, registered, or recorded.'\n It is said that a mere transfer of letters patent by voluntary conveyance would not pass the right to recover accrued compensation for use by a licensee; and that under the statute this rule must be applied to the seizure. Answering this, the court below well said:\n'Accepting this law in the abstract, it is pertinent to note that we are not here concerned with an assignment of a patent or of royalties by the German owners to the Alien Property Custodian. We are concerned with their capture-an act of war. We are not dealing with an assignment of patents where there is a question of what was in the minds of the contracting parties as to royalties and as \n\n[283 U.S. 152, 162]\n\u00a0\n to what passed and what was retained under the terms of an instrument they had drawn and signed. We are dealing with an act of seizure and have to determine wholly outside the law of assignments whether by the terms of the symbol of seizure the royalties in question were included. Having in mind the purpose of the law and observing that the Custodian manifestly attempted to seize the German patents and everything 'in respect' to them and to their ownership, we are of opinion that he accomplished what he attempted by words that embrace the royalties in question, and that, in consequence, the German plaintiffs were owners of neither the patents nor the royalties at the time they instituted their suits. ...'\n\n The Settlement of War Claims Act of March 10, 1928, 45 Stat. 254, 277 ( 50 USCA Appendix  10(f), provides:\n'Sec. 19. Subsection (f) of section 10 of the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended, is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new paragraph:\n\n\"In the case of any such patent, trademark, pint, label, or copyright, conveyed, assigned, transferred or delivered to the Alien Property Custodian or seized by him, any suit brought under this subsection, within the time limited therein, shall be considered as having been brought by the owner within the meaning of this subsection, in so far as such suit relates to royalties for the period prior to the sale by the Alien Property Custodian of such patent, trade-mark, print, label, or copyright, if brought either by the Alien Property Custodian or by the person who was the owner thereof immediately prior to the date such patent, trade-mark, print, label, or copyright was seized or otherwise acquired by the Alien Property Custodian.\"\n\n Counsel suggest that, although this enactment came long after transfer of the patents and rights incident thereto to the Chemical Foundation, and years after the present suits began, it authorized the German claimants \n\n[283 U.S. 152, 163]\n\u00a0\n to recover as if owners according to the terms of the original act and the license to the Du Pont Company. Manifestly, such an interpretation would give rise to a grave constitutional objection-deprivation of the Chemical Foundation of property without due process. Moreover, the licensee accepted the grant under the provision that any suit for compensation should be brought by the owner within one year after termination of the war, 'for all use and enjoyment of the said patented invention,' and, if not, 'then the licensee shall not be liable to make any further deposits, and all funds deposited by him shall be repaid to him on order of the alien property custodian.' In the circumstances, the act cannot be interpreted and applied as suggested.\n The decree below must be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND and Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","53":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFAWCUS MACH. CO. v. UNITED STATES(1931)\nNo. 40\nArgued: December 12, 1930Decided: January 5, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 375, 376]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James S. Y. Ivins, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Claude R. Branch, of Providence, R. I., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 375, 377]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Certiorari was granted to the Court of Claims, \n281 \nU.S. 711\n, 50 S. Ct. 346, to review a judgment, 68 Ct. Cl. 784, in favor of the United States in an action to recover an alleged overpayment of excess profits tax for the calendar year 1919. The petitioner, a corporation, kept its books and made its returns of income and excess profits taxes on the accrual basis. In its return for the year ended December 31, 1919, it did not deduct from invested capital any amount on account of income and excess profits taxes for 1918 assessed and paid in 1919\n\n\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the invested capital for 1919 should be reduced by the amount of income and profits taxes for 1918 as of the dates in 1919 when the instalments of taxes fell due and were paid. To accomplish this he computed an average deduction for the year 1919, and diminished the earned surplus as of January 1, 1919, by subtracting from it the amount so ascertained.\n The Commissioner's action was in accordance with article 845 of Treasury Regulations 45, promulgated April 17, 1919, applicable to the Revenue Act of 1918. The pertinent portion follows:\n'Federal income ... taxes are deemed to have been paid out of the net income of the taxable year for which they are levied.'\n\n Section 326(a) of the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1092) provided that 'as used in this title the term 'invested capital' for any year means:\n'...;\n\n'(1) Actual cash bona fide paid in for stock or shares;\n\n'(2) Actual cash value of tangible property, other than cash, bona fide paid in for stock or shares; ...\n\n'(3) Paid-in or earned surplus and undivided profits; not including surplus and undivided profits earned during the year.'\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 375, 378]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner asserts that article 845 was based on the erroneous assumption that income taxes are payable out of the net income of the taxable year for which they are levied.\n The United States replies that it is, and since 1914 it has been, required that a taxpayer shall keep his books and make his returns on a basis which will reflect true income; that while the taxes for any year are not payable until the following year, good accounting practice requires an accrual of them as a liability of the current year's business; and that the regulation in question was not only reasonable, but necessary for proper administration of the Revenue Act.\n The position of the government is sound. A corporation cannot claim to have accumulated any net income in any year until provision is made for taxes accrued, based on net income for the same year.\n The reasonableness of the regulation is further shown by the fact that 'invested capital' was merely a legislative definition of an element in the formula prescribed for computation of excess profits tax. Congress might have expressly declared that taxes should be excluded from invested capital. It did not do so in section 326(a), or elsewhere in the act. The regulations were made pursuant to express authority (see section 1309 of the Revenue Act of 1918). They are valid unless unreasonable or inconsistent with the statute. United States v. Grimaud, \n220 \nU.S. 506, 517\n, 518 S., 31 S. Ct. 480; International Ry. Co. v. Davidson, \n257 \nU.S. 506, 514\n, 42 S. Ct. 179. They constitute contemporaneous construction by those charged with the administration of the act, are for that reason entitled to respectful consideration, and will not be overruled, except for weighty reasons. United States v. Moore, \n95 U.S. 760\n, 763; Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327, 336\n, 50 S. Ct. 115.\n Petitioner insists that article 845 is unreasonable as applied to 1918 taxes; that no one could know what those taxes would be at the close of the year, because the so- \n\n[282 U.S. 375, 379]\n\u00a0\n called Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057) was not passed until February, 1919, and made changes in the rates. But the 1917 act (40 Stat. 300) was in force, and required the payment of the same sort of taxes, and petitioner concedes it accrued its taxes for 1918 and set them up in a reserve at the end of the year. The Act of 1918 was retroactive and replaced the prior act of October 3, 1917 (40 Stat. 300), and taxpayers understood that the policy of the United States with respect to income and profits tax was continuous. In February, 1919, the Treasury promulgated decision 2791, applicable to the 1917 act, and in substance the same as article 845, which was issued under the 1918 act on April 17, 1919. The taxes in question were provided for by an act passed in February, 1919, but they were for the year 1918. The act was passed in ample time to allow the taxpayer to readjust its accounts for that year by including these taxes; and, since its books were kept on an accrual basis, it was necessary that this should be done in order clearly to reflect the income for 1918.\n United States v. Woodward, \n256 \nU.S. 632\n, 41 S. Ct. 615, on which petitioner relies, is clearly distinguishable on the grounds stated in United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422, 441\n, 46 S. Ct. 131.\n We cannot hold that the regulation on which the Commissioner relied was unreasonable or in conflict with the provisions of the statute. The judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","54":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION v. RALADAM CO.(1931)\nNo. 484\nArgued: April 24, 1931Decided: May 25, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 643, 644]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. John Lord O'Brian, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. L. W. McCandless, of Detroit, Mich., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, c. 311, 38 Stat. 717, 719 (U. S. C., Title 15,  45 (15 USCA  45)), the relevant parts of which are copied in the margin,1 the Commission issued its complaint charging the respondent with using unfair methods of competition in interstate commerce.\n Respondent manufactures a preparation for internal use, denominated an 'obesity cure.' The complaint charges that this preparation is sold by respondent in and throughout the several states, generally to wholesalers who resell to retail dealers, and these, in turn, to consumers; that it is offered for sale and sld i n competition with other persons who are engaged 'in offering for sale, \n\n[283 U.S. 643, 645]\n\u00a0\n and selling, printed professional advice, books of information and instruction, and other methods and means and certain remedies and appliances for dissolving or otherwise removing excess flesh of the human body'; that respondent advertises in newspapers, etc., circulated generally in the United States, and in printed labels, etc., that the preparation is the result of scientific research, knowledge, and accuracy, that it is safe and effective and may be used without discomfort, inconvenience, or danger of harmful results to health. Among the ingredients is 'desiccated thyroid,' which, it is alleged, cannot be prescribed to act with reasonable uniformity on the bodies of all users, or without impairing the health of a substantial portion of them, etc., or with safety, without previous consultation with, and continuing observation and advice of, a competent medical adviser. The complaint further avers that many persons are seeking obesity remedies, and respondent's advertisements are calculated to mislead and deceive the purchasing public into the belief that the preparation is safe, effective, dependable, and without danger of harmful results. By way of conclusion, it is said that 'the acts and practices of the respondent are all to the prejudice of the public and of competitors of respondent, ... and constitute unfair methods of competition.' \n\n[283 U.S. 643, 646]\n\u00a0\n Respondent answered, and hearings were had before an examiner. The Commission found against respondent, and issued a cease and desist order. The findings in general follow the language of the complaint. There was no finding of prejudice or injury to any competitor, but the conclusion was drawn from the findings of fact that the practice of respondent was to the prejudice of the public and respondent's competitors, and constituted an unfair method of competition.\n The Court of Appeals reviewed the action of the Commission upon respondent's petition, and reversed the order. 42 F.(2d) 430. We brought the case here by certiorari, limiting the briefs and argument to the question of the jurisdiction of the Commission. \n282 \nU.S. 829\n, 51 S. Ct. 86, 75 L. Ed. -.\n In substance, the Commission ordered the respondent to cease and desist from representing that its preparation is a scientific method for treating obesity, is the result of scientific research, or that the formula is a scientific formula; and from representing its preparation as a remedy for obesity, unless accompanied by the statement that it cannot be taken safely except under medical advice and direction. Findings, supported by evidence, warrant the conclusion that the preparation is one which cannot be used generally with safety to physical health except under medical direction and advice. If the necessity of protecting the public against dangerously misleading advertisements of a remedy sold in interstate commerce were all that is necessary to give the Commission jurisdiction, the order could not successfully be assailed. But this is not all.\n By the plain words of the act, the power of the Commission to take steps looking to the issue of an order to desist depends upon the existence of three distinct prerequisites: (1) That the methods complained of are unfair; (2) that they are methods of competition in commerce; and ( 3) that a proceeding by the Commission to \n\n[283 U.S. 643, 647]\n\u00a0\n prevent the use of the methods appears to be in the interest of the public. We assume the existence of the first and third of these requisites; and pass at once to the consideration of the second.\n Section 5 of the Trade Commission Act (15 USCA  45) is supplementary to the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (15 USCA  1-7, 15) and the Clayton Act (38 Stat. 730). Federal Trade Comm. v. Beech Nut Co., \n257 \nU.S. 441, 453\n, 42 S. Ct. 150, 19 A. L. R. 882. The latter was discussed and passed at the same session of Congress. The Sherman Act deals with contracts, agreements, and combinations which tend to the prejudce o f the public by the undue restriction of competition or the undue obstruction of the due course of trade, United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n221 \nU.S. 106, 179\n, 31 S. Ct. 632; and which tend to 'restrict the common liberty to engage therein,' United States v. Patten, \n226 \nU.S. 525, 541\n, 33 S. Ct. 141, 145, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 325.\n The Clayton Act, so far as it deals with the subject, was intended to reach in their incipiency agreements embraced within the sphere of the Sherman Act. Standard Co. v. Magrane-Houston Co., \n258 U.S. 346\n, 355-357, 42 S. Ct. 360. The object of the Trade Commission Act was to stop in their incipiency those methods of competition which fall within the meaning of the word 'unfair.' 'The great purpose of both statutes was to advance the public interest by securing fair opportunity for the play of the contending forces ordinarily engendered by an honest desire for gain.' Federal Trade Comm. v. Sinclair Co., \n261 \nU.S. 463, 476\n, 43 S. Ct. 450, 454. All three statutes seek to protect the public from abuses arising in the course of competitive interstate and foreign trade. In a case arising under the Trade Commission Act, the fundamental questions are whether the methods complained of are 'unfair,' and whether, as in cases under the Sherman Act, they tend to the substantial injury of the public by restricting competition in interstate trade and 'the common liberty to engage therein.' The paramount aim of the act is the \n\n[283 U.S. 643, 648]\n\u00a0\n protection of the public from the evils likely to result from the destruction of competition or the restriction of it in a substantial degree, and this presupposes the existence of some substantial competition to be affected, since the public is not concerned in the maintenance of competition which itself is without real substance. Compare International Shoe Co. v. Commission, \n280 U.S. 291\n, 297-299, 50 S. Ct. 89.\n The bill which was the foundation of the act, as it first passed the Senate, declared 'unfair competition' to be unlawful. Debate apparently convinced the sponsors of the legislation that these words, which had a wellsettled meaning at common law, were too narrow. When the bill came from conference between the two Houses, these words had been eliminated and the words 'unfair methods of competition' substituted. Undoubtedly the substituted phrase has a broader meaning, but how much broader has not been determined. It belongs to that class of phrases which does not admit of precise definition, but the meaning and application of which must be arrived at by what this court elsewhere has called 'the gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion.' Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 U.S. 97\n, 104. The question is one for the final determination of the courts and not of the Commission. Federal Trade Comm. v. Gratz, \n253 \nU.S. 421, 427\n, 40 S. Ct. 572; Federal Trade Comm. v. Beech Nut Co., supra, page 453 of 257 U. S., 42 S. Ct. 150.\n The authority of the Commission to proceed, if that body believes that there has been or is being used any unfair method of competition in commerce, was then qualified in conference by the further requirement, not in the original bill,-'and if it shall appear to the commission that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public.' By these additional words, protection to the public interest is made of paramount importance, but, nevertheless, they are not sub- \n\n[283 U.S. 643, 649]\n\u00a0\n stantive words of jurisdiction, but complementary words of limitation upon the jurisdiction conferred by the language immediately preceding. Thus the Commission is called upon first to determine, as a necessary prerequisite to the issue of a complaint, whether there is reason to believe that a given person, partnership, or corporation has been or is using any unfair method of competition in commerce; and, that being determined in the affirmative, the Commission still may not proceed, unlss i t further appear that a proceeding would be to the interest of the public, and that such interest is specific and substantial. Federal Trade Comm. v. Klesner, \n280 \nU.S. 19, 28\n, 50 S. Ct. 1, 68 A. L. R. 838. Unfair trade methods are not per se unfair methods of competition.\n It is obvious that the word 'competition' imports the existence of present or potential competitors, and the unfair methods must be such as injuriously affect or tend thus to affect the business of these competitors-that is to say, the trader whose methods are assailed as unfair must have present or potential rivals in trade whose business will be, or is likely to be, lessened or otherwise injured. It is that condition of affairs which the Commission is given power to correct, and it is against that condition of affairs, and not some other, that the Commission is authorized to protect the public. Official powers cannot be extended beyond the terms and necessary implications of the grant. If broader powers be desirable, they must be conferred by Congress. They cannot be merely assumed by administrative officers; nor can they be created by the courts in the proper exercise of their judicial functions.\n The foregoing view of the powers of the Commission under the act finds confirmation, if that be needed, in the committee reports and the statements of those in charge of the legislation, as well as in the debate which took place in the Senate, extending over weeks of time and covering hundreds of pages in the Congressional Record. \n\n[283 U.S. 643, 650]\n\u00a0\n In that debate the necessity of curbing those whose unfair methods threatened to drive their competitors out of business was constantly emphasized. It was urged that the best way to stop monopoly at the threshold was to prevent unfair competition; that the unfair competition sought to be reached was that which must ultimately result in the extinction of rivals and the establishment of monopoly; that by the words 'unfair methods' was meant those resorted to for the purpose of destroying competition or of eliminating a competitor or of introducing monopoly-such as tend unfairly to destroy or injure the business of a competitor; that the law was necessary to protect small business against giant competitors; that it was an effort to make competition stronger in its fight against monopoly; that unfair competition was that practice which destroys competition and establishes monopoly. These and similar statements run through the debate from beginning to end. Although protection to the public interest was recognized as the ultimate aim, comparatively little was said about it.\n It is true, at least generally, that statements made in debate cannot be used as aids to the construction of a statute. But the fact that throughout the consideration of this legislation there was common agreement in the debate as to the great purpose of the act may properly be considered in determining what that purpose was and what were the evils sought to be remedied. In Ho Ah Kow v. Nunan, Fed. Cas. No. 6,546, 5 Sawy. 552, it appeared that the board of supervisors of San Francisco had adopted an ordinance which provided that every male person imprisoned in the county jail, etc., should immediately upon his arrival at the jail have the hair of his head 'cut or clipped to an uniform length of one inch from the scalp thereof.' The ordinance was attacked as being hostile and discriminating legislation against the Chinese, and, in order to demonstrate this, in spite of the general terms of the ordinance, statements of supervisors made in debate were \n\n[283 U.S. 643, 651]\n\u00a0\n put in evidence. Mr. Justice Field, speaking for himself and Judge Sawyer, said (Fed. Cas. No. 6,546, 5 Sawy. page 560):\n'The statements of supervisors in debate on the passage of the ordinance cannot, it is true, be resorted to for the purpose of explaining the meaning of the terms used; but they can be resorted to for the purpose of ascertaining the general object of the legislation proposed, and the mischiefs sought t he remedied.'\n\n While it is impossible from the terms of the act itself, and in the light of the foregoing circumstances leading up to its passage, reasonably to conclude that Congress intended to vest the Commission with the general power to prevent all sorts of unfair trade practices in commerce apart from their actual or potential effect upon the trade of competitors, it is not necessary that the facts point to any particular trader or traders. It is enough that there be present or potential substantial competition, which is shown by proof, or appears by necessary inference, to have been injured, or to be clearly threatened with injury, to a substantial extent, by the use of the unfair methods complained of.\n In Federal Trade Comm. v. Winstead Co., \n258 \nU.S. 483\n, 42 S. Ct. 384, it appeared that a manufacturer engaged in selling underwear and other knit goods made partly of wool labeled them as 'natural merino,' 'natural wool,' 'Australian wool,' etc. It was shown that a substantial part of the consuming public and some buyers and retailers understood the words used in the labels to mean that the underwear was all wool. Part of the public was thereby misled into selling or into buying, as all wool, underwear which was in large part cotton. The labels were false and calculated to deceive, and did in fact deceive, a substantial portion of the purchasing public. This court, after saying that the facts show that a proceeding to stop the practice was in the interest of the public, added (page 493 of 258 U. S., 42 S. Ct. 384, 385): \n\n[283 U.S. 643, 652]\n\u00a0\n 'And they show also that the practice constitutes an unfair method of competition as against manufacturers of all wool knit underwear and as against those manufacturers of mixed wool and cotton underwear who brand their product truthfully. For when misbranded goods attract customers by means of the fraud which they perpetrate, trade is diverted from the producer of truthfully marked goods. That these honest manufacturers might protect their trade by also resorting to deceptive labels is no defense to this proceeding brought against the Winstead Company in the public interest.'\n And again, at page 494 of 258 U. S., 42 S. Ct. 384, 386, after reaffirming the existence of the public interest, the court said:\n'... Since the business of its trade rivals who marked their goods truthfully was necessarily affected by that practice, the Commission was justified in its conclusion that the practice constituted an unfair method of competition. ...'\n\n The court below thought that the trade to be protected 'was that legitimate trade which was entitled to hold its own in the trade field without embarrassment from unfair competition.' There is much force in this conception of the act, and the language just quoted from the Winstead Case seems inferentially to lend it support. Certainly, it is hard to see why Congress would set itself to the task of devising means and creating administrative machinery for the purpose of preserving the business of one knave from the unfair competition of another. In the present case, however, we do not find it necessary further to consider the merits of this view or to determine whether the facts are such as to bring the case within it.\n Findings of the Commission justify the conclusion that the advertisements naturally would tend to increase the business of respondent; but there is neither finding nor evidence from which the conclusion legitimately can be drawn that these advertisements substantially injured, or tended thus to injure, the business of any competitor or \n\n[283 U.S. 643, 653]\n\u00a0\n of competitors generally, whether legitimate or not. None of the supposed competitors appeared or was called upon to show what, if any, effect the misleading advertisements had, or were likely to have, upon his business. The only evidence as to the existence of competitors comes from medical sources not engaged in making or selling 'obesity cures,' and consists in the main of a list of supposed producers and selles of 'anti-fat remedies' compiled from the files and records of the Bureau of Investigation of the American Medical Association, a list which appears to have been gathered mainly from newspapers and advertisements. The only specific evidence was that of a witness who said that he had purchased in drug stores in Chicago five different anti-fat treatments and could have purchased a sixth. How long they had been in stock, what was their nature, whether they were intended to be used internally, or in what way they competed or could compete with respondent's preparation, does not appear. Of course, medical practitioners, by some of whom the danger of using the remedy without competent advice was exposed, are not in competition with respondent. They follow a profession and not a trade, and are not engaged in the business of making or vending remedies but in prescribing them. It is impossible to say whether, as a result of respondent's advertisements, any business was diverted, or was likely to be diverted, from others engaged in like trade, or whether competitors, identified or unidentified, were injured in their business, or were likely to be injured, or, indeed, whether any other anti-obesity remedies were sold or offered for sale in competition, or were of such a character as naturally to come into any real competition, with respondent's preparation in the interstate market. All this was left without proof, and remains, at best, a matter of conjecture. Something more substantial than that is required as a basis for the exercise of the authority of the Commission. \n\n[283 U.S. 643, 654]\n\u00a0\n Whether the respondent, in what it was doing, was subjecting itself to administrative or other proceeding under the statute relating to the misbranding of foods and drugs we need not now inquire, for the administration of that statute is not committed to the Federal Trade Commission.\n A proceeding under section 5 is not one instituted before the Commission by one party against another. It is instituted by the Commission itself, and is authorized whenever the Commission has reason to believe that unfair methods of competition in commerce are being used, and that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public. Acting upon its belief, the Commission issues charges and enters upon an inquiry which, of course, it has jurisdiction to make. But one of the facts necessary to support jurisdiction to make the final order to cease and desist is the existence of competition; and the Commission cannot, by assuming the existence of competition, if in fact there be none, give itself jurisdiction to make such an order. If, as a result of the inquiry, it turn out that the preliminary assumption of competition is without foundation, jurisdiction to make that order necessarily fails, and the proceeding must be dismissed by the Commission. Compare Federal Trade Comm. v. Klesner, supra, pages 29, 30 of 280 U. S., 50 S. Ct. 1, 68 A. L. R. 838. That course should have been followed here.\n The decree of the court below is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] That unfair methods of competition in commerce are hereby declared unlawful.\n The commission is hereby empowered and directed to prevent persons, partnerships, or corporations, except banks, and common carriers subject to the Acts to regulate commerce, from using unfair methods of competition in commerce.\n Whenever the commission shall have reason to believe that any such person, partnership, or corporation has been or is using any unfair method of competition in commerce, and if it shall appear to the commission that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public, it shall issue and serve upon such person, partnership, or corporation a complaint stating its charges in that respect, and containing a notice of a hearing upon a day and at a place therein fixed at least thirty days after the service of said complaint. The person, partnership, or corporation so complained of shall have the right to appear at the place and time so fixed and show cause why an order should not be entered by the commission requiring such person, partnership, or corporation to cease and desist from the violation of the law so charged in said complaint. ... If upon such hearing the commission shall be of the opinion that the method of competition in question is prohibited by this Act, it shall make a report in writing in which it shall state its findings as to the facts, and shall issue and cause to be served on such person, partnership, or corporation an order requiring such person, partnership, or corporation to cease and desist from using such method of competition. \n\n\n\n\n","55":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFETTERS v. UNITED STATES EX REL. CUNNINGHAM(1931)\nNo. 720\nArgued: April 16, 1931Decided: May 25, 1931\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Claude R. Branch, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Ruby R. Vale, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent. \n\n[283 U.S. 638, 639]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On April 20, 1928, an indictment was returned by a grand jury in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, charging the respondent, Cunningham, with a violation of section 102, R. S.1 (U. S. C. title 2,  192 (2 USCA  192)), in having refused to answer pertinent questions put to him by a committee of the United States Senate. It is not necessary to reproduce the indictment. For present purposes, the facts pleaded therein sufficiently appear in the opinion of this court in Barry v. United States ex rel. Cunningham, \n279 \nU.S. 597\n, 49 S. Ct. 452. After indictment, respondent was arrested in Pennsylvania upon a warrant issued under section 1014, R. S. (U. S. C. title 18,  591 (18 USCA  591)), and taken before a United States District Judge sitting as a committing magistrate. Section 1014 provides:\n'For any crime or offense against the United States, the offender may, by any justice or judge of the United States, or by any commissioner of a circuit court to take bail, or by any chancellor, judge of a supreme or superior court, chief or first judge of common pleas, mayor of a city, justice of the peace, or other magistrate, of any State where he may be found, and agreeably to the usual mode of process against offenders in such State, and at the expense of the United States, be arrested and imprisoned, or bailed, as the case may be, for trial before such court of the United States as by law has cognizance of the offense.' \n\n[283 U.S. 638, 640]\n\u00a0\n That section further provides for the removal of the offender, if committed, to the district where the offense is to be tried.\n\n At the hearing before the District Judge, the government, to show probable cause, in troduced in evidence a certified copy of the indictment, and rested. Respondent challenged the sufficiency of the indictment upon the ground that the questions set forth therein, which he had refused to answer, were not pertinent to the committee's inquiry, and introduced a transcript of the proceedings before the committee. The District Judge ordered respondent's commitment and his removal to the District of Columbia. Respondent thereupon sought his discharge from the custody of the United States marshal, and filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to that end in the federal District Court presided over by the same judge. That court held the indictment sufficient to support the commitment and removal, and dismissed the petition. U. S. ex rel. Cunningham v. Mathues, 26 F.(2d) 272. On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the order of the District Court was reversed on the ground that the indictment disclosed that the questions propounded to respondent were not pertinent to the inquiry, and, therefore, there was not probable cause for respondent's commitment and removal to another district for trial. 33 F.(2d) 261.\n After our decision in the Barry Case, supra, the Court of Appeals granted a rehearing, but, upon consideration, adhered to its former decision. 50 F.(2d) 411. Thereupon the United States marshal applied to this court for a writ of certiorari, which was granted, but with an order vacating the judgments of both lower courts and remanding the cause to the District Court with directions to dismiss the proceeding as abated. Mathues v. United States ex rel. Cunningham, \n282 \nU.S. 802\n, 51 S. Ct. 84, 75 L. Ed. -. This was done because the United States marshal named in the petition had gone out of office and no substitution had been made within the statutory \n\n[283 U.S. 638, 641]\n\u00a0\n period. Respondent then surrendered himself to United States Marshal Fetters, who was then in office, and filed a new habeas corpus petition; and, upon that petition, after a hearing, the District Court ordered the respondent to be discharged, 50 F.(2d) 449, deeming itself bound by the opinion of the Court of Appeals upon the former appeal. It is this last order which is now here for review; this court having granted a writ of certiorari pending the disposition of an appeal therefrom to the court below.\n In proceedings under section 1014, R. S., the inquiry is limited to the question whether there is probable cause to believe the prisoner guilty, so as to justify his commitment and removal for trial. This inquiry may take place in advance of indictment or without the production of the indictment if one has been returned. When the indictment is produced before the committing magistrate, it is received not as a pleading, but as evidence establishing or tending to establish the commission of an offense; and the magistrate has authority to pass upon it only in that aspect. He has no authority to determine its sufficiency as a pleading. Morse v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 80, 83\n, 45 S. Ct. 209, and cases cited.\n Whether the indictment in this case properly could be held sufficient by the trial court upon demurrer, we have no occasion to consider. Without going into particulars, we think it clearly sufficient for removal purposes. The most that can be said is that the question whether the indictment is sufficient to put the respondent on trial is fairly debatable. It was never intended by section 1014 that an examining magistrate should have the power in removal proceedings to hold the facts pleaded in an indictment insufficient to charge an offense when that question is reasonably open to a difference of opinion. Doubtful questions of law relating to the sufficiency of the indictment or the validity of the statute upon which the indict- \n\n[283 U.S. 638, 642]\n\u00a0\n ment is based, as well as all doubtful questions of fact, are matters to be left for the trial court to determine. Parker v. United States (C. C. A .) 3 F.(2d) 903, 904, and cases cited.\n In U. S. ex rel. Hughes v. Gault, \n271 \nU.S. 142\n, 46 S. Ct. 459, 460, this court, after pointing out that the proceedings under section 1014, R. S., were intrusted not only to judges and commissioners of the United States and judges of state courts, but to any 'mayor of a city, justice of the peace, or other magistrate, of any State where (the accused) may be found,' said (page 150 of 271 U. S., 46 S. Ct. 459, 460):\n'Obviously, in order to make it the duty of the judge to issue the warrant a mayor or a magistrate not a lawyer cannot be expected to do more than to decide in a summary way that the indictment is intended to charge an offense against the laws of the United States, that the person before him is the person charged and that there is probable cause to believe him guilty, without the magistrate's being held to more than avoiding palpable injustice.'\n\n A rule in respect of the power of one of the magistrates named in the statute, of course, applies to all.\n And see Rodman v. Pothier, \n264 \nU.S. 399, 402\n, 44 S. Ct. 360; Henry v. Henkel, \n235 \nU.S. 219, 229\n, 35 S. Ct. 54.\n The first order of commitment and removal made by the District Judge was proper and should have been sustained. In the trial court the accused will have every opportunity to test the sufficiency of the indictment, since there it is not evidence, but the very 'foundation of the charge.' Benson v. Henkel, \n198 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 25 S. Ct. 569, 571.\n The judgment of the District Court must be reversed, and the cause remanded to that court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 102.

UNITED STATES(1931)\nNo. 124\nArgued: March 4, 1931Decided: April 13, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 142, 143]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harold V. Amberg, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Charles B. Rugg, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The First National Bank of Chicago made a consolidated corporation income and profits tax return for the year 1922 which, among other things, disclosed results from operations of two affiliated corporations, the First Trust Joint Stock Land Banks of Chicago and Dallas, organized under the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916. It claimed the right to deduct from total receipts the amounts paid (or accrued) during the year by the land banks for interest upon their outstanding bonds. The Commissioner refused to allow the deductions. Payment as demanded was followed by suit to recover in the Court of Claims. Judgment went against the bank, and the matter is here upon certiorari.\n From the findings, based upon a stipulation of facts, it appears:\n'The First Trust Joint Stock Land Bank of Chicago and the First Trust Joint Stock Bank of Dallas, which were organized under the Federal farm loan act of July 17, 1916, issued to and\/or had outstanding in the hands of the public in the year 1922 their joint-stock land bank bonds, respectively, on which interest was paid and\/or accrued in the year 1922, in the aggregate sum of $78,807.80, part of which was the intercompany transaction in the amount of $5,810.25, leaving a balance paid or \n\n[283 U.S. 142, 144]\n\u00a0\n accrued of $72,997.55. As security for the payment of said joint- stock land bank bonds said joint-stock land banks, as provided in the Federal farm loan act, deposited with the proper farm loan registrars farmers' promissory notes evidencing loans to said farmers, which in turn were secured as to payment by said farmers' first mortgages on their farms.\n\n'The proceeds coming into the hands of said joint-stock land banks from the issuance and sale of said joint-stock land banks bonds were used by said joint-stock land banks to make new additional loans to farmers, which new loans made from the proceeds of said joint-stock land bank bonds issued and\/or outstanding in 1922, were made in each instance in consideration of the making and delivery by the borrowing farmers, respectively, of their promissory notes secured as to payment by first mortgages on their farms. All of said loans, respectively, and the farmers' notes and mortgages, respectively, evidencing said loans, were designed to be and were of such a nature as to comply with (1) all the terms, conditions, restrictions, limitations, and requirements specified in the Federal farm loan act, as requisite to qualify said loans, notes, and mortgages, as 'first mortgages' in contemplation of said act, so as to make them available as collateral security against the issue of joint-stock land bank bonds; and (2) all terms, conditions, restrictions, limitations, and requirements, statutory or otherwise, specified in the laws of the State in which the farm which was the subject of the particular loan was located (to wit, the States of Illinois, Iowa, Texas, and Oklahoma, respectively), as requisite to qualify said loans, notes, and mortgages as valid and subsisting first mortgages, in contemplation of such laws. Said notes and mortgages contain an agreement providing for the repayment of the loan on the amortization plan, as provided in section 12, second, of the Federal farm loan act, \n\n[283 U.S. 142, 145]\n\u00a0\n and such agreement in respect of each note and\/or mortgage was not extinguished within a period of less than thirty-three years, except, of course, at the option of the borrower.\n\n'The interest received by the plaintiff on such farmers' notes and mortgages was not taxable as income to the plaintiff and was not so taxed in respect of plaintiff's etu rn for the year 1922.'\n\n Decision of the cause must turn upon the construction of pertinent portions, Revenue Act 1921, Title 2, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 237, 238, 252, 254.\n Section 213 provides that the term 'gross income' does not include interest upon 'securities issued under the provisions of the Federal Farm Loan Act of July 17, 1916.'\n Section 230 imposes a tax at specified rates upon the net income of every corporation.\n Section 234 provides: '(a) That in computing the net income of a corporation subject to the tax imposed by section 230 there shall be allowed as deductions: ... (2) All interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on its indebtedness, except on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry obligations or securities (other than obligations of the United States issued after September 24, 1947, and originally subscribed for by the taxpayer) the interest upon which is wholly exempt from taxation under this title.'\n The Federal Farm Loan Act 1916, c. 245, 39 Stat. 360, 372, 374, 380, provides (section 16 (12 USCA  811, 813)) for the formation of joint- stock land banks 'for carrying on the business of lending on farm mortgage security and issuing farm loan bonds' which 'shall have the powers of, and be subject to all the restrictions and conditions imposed on, Federal land banks by this chapter, so far as such restrictions and conditions are applicable.' Section 13 (12 USCA  781) authorizes federal \n\n[283 U.S. 142, 146]\n\u00a0\n land banks: 'First. To issue, subject to the approval of the Federal Farm Laon Board, and to sell farm loan bonds of the kinds authorized in this chapter, to buy the same for its own account, and to retire the same at or before maturity. Second. To invest such funds as may be in its possession in the purchase of qualified first mortgages on farm lands situated within the Federal land bank district within which it is organized or for which it is acting.' Section 26 (12 USCA  931): 'That every Federal land bank and every national farm loan association, including the capital and reserve or surplus therein and the income derived therefrom, shall be exempt from Federal, State, municipal, and local taxation, except taxes upon real estate held, purchased, or taken by said bank or association under the provisions of section eleven and section thirteen of this Act. First mortgages executed to Federal land banks, or to joint-stock land banks, and farm loan bonds issued under the provisions of this Act, shall be deemed and held to be instrumentalities of the Government of the United States, and as such they and the income derived therefrom shall be exempt from Federal, State, municipal, and local taxation.'\n As pointed out by the court below: 'Joint-stock land banks, not being permitted to engage in any business, except that of making loans to farmers and issuing their bonds to procure the necessary funds therefor, do not ordinarily have income subject to taxation, and so long as such banks operate as individual and separate institutions, it cannot make the slightest difference whether they have or do not have the right to deduct the interest paid on their bonds. Their income is tax exempt, and consequently the right to make deductions therefrom means nothing. When, as in the instant case, joint-stock land banks are affiliated with banking corporations that do \n\n[283 U.S. 142, 147]\n\u00a0\n have taxable incomes, the question assumes importance, as the interest deduction, if allowed, reduces the tax liability of the affiliated group- even then, however, it in no way affects the joint-stock land banks included in such consolidation. They have no taxable income and they pay no taxes.'\n Considering the circumstances, we find no reason to conclude that Congress intended to permit any ordinary commercial bank, with income subject to taxation, to secure partial relief therefrom through affiliation with a joint-stock land bank. That result would follow approval of the petitioner's position.\n In Denman etc., Nauts, Collector, v. Slayton, \n282 \nU.S. 514\n, 51 S. Ct. 269, 270,dec ided February 24, 1931, we said: 'The manifest purpose of the exception in (Revenue Act 1921) paragraph 2,  214 (a), was to prevent the escape from taxation of income properly subject thereto by the purchase of exempt securities with borrowed money.'\n The Federal Farm Loan Act (sections 16 and 13) empowers joint-stock land banks to invest their funds 'in the purchase of qualified first mortgages on farm lands.' The obvious meaning is that loans might be made on such security. Loans, so made, become 'securities issued under the provisions of the' act, and interest upon them is wholly exempt from taxation under title 2, Revenue Act of 1921\n\n\n Interpreting the language of the exception in section 234 in view of the legislative purpose, we think that the farm mortgages owned by the affiliated joint-stock land bank must be regarded as 'obligations or securities ... the interest upon which is wholly exempt from taxation under this title,' and that the bonds issued by them constituted indebtedness incurred to purchase or carry such obligations.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","58":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFLYNN v. NEW YORK, N H & H R CO(1931)\nNo. 235\nArgued: March 12, 1931Decided: March 23, 1931\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. F. Geenty and Thomas R. Fitz Simmons, both of New Haven, Conn., for petitioner. \n\n[283 U.S. 53, 54]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward R. Brumley, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[283 U.S. 53, 55]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit under the Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59) for negligently causing the death of Edward L. Flynn, brought on May 15, 1929, by Flynn's executor for the benefit of Flynn's dependent widow and children. It is alleged that the injury was suffered on December 4, 1923, and that it caused Flynn's death on September 1, 1928. \n\n[283 U.S. 53, 56]\n\u00a0\n The defendant, respondent here, demurred to the declaration on the ground that more than two years having elapsed since the date when Flynn's cause of action accrued his right to sue was barred, and that therefore the suit could not be maintained. Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149,  1, 6, 35 Stat. 65, 66; Act of April 5, 1910, c. 143,  1, 36 Stat. 291; Code, tit. 45,  51, 56 (45 USCA  51, 56). The demurrer and judgment for the defendant were sustained by the Supreme Court of Connecticut. 111 Conn. 196, 149 A. 682. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n282 \nU.S. 821\n, 51 S. Ct. 30, 75 L. Ed. -.\n The Act of 1908 gives a right of action to the employee or, in case of his death, to his personal representative for the benefit of the widow and children and provides that no action shall be maintained 'unless commenced within two years from the day the cause of action accrued.' Section 6 (45 USCA  56). Obviously Flynn's right of action was barred, but it is argued that the right on behalf of the widow and children is distinct; that their cause of action could not arise until Flynn's death, and that therefore the two years did not begin to run until September 1, 1928.

MCNEAL-EDWARDS CO.(1931)\nNo. 490\nArgued: Decided: May 18, 1931\n\n\n\n Messrs. Walter B. Leach, Jr., and John G. Palfrey, both of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n Mr. Asa P. French, of Boston, Mass., for respondent. \n\n[283 U.S. 398, 399]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the question whether under the Conformity Act, U. S. Code, title 28,  724 (28 USCA  724), and the Massachusetts statute, Gen. Laws, c. 227,  2, 3, the District Court acquired jurisdiction over the respondent. The Conformity Act provides that 'the practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding in civil causes, ... in the district courts, shall conform, as near as may be, to the practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding existing at the time in like causes in the courts of record of the State within which such district courts are held.' By the Massachusetts Laws,  2, supra, 'If an action is brought by a person not an inhabitant of the commonwealth ... he shall be held to answer to any action brought against him here by the defendant in the former action, if the demands are of such a nature that the judgment or execution in the one case may be set off against the judgment or execution in the other.' By section 3 'The writ in such cross action may be served on the attorney of record for the plaintiff in the original action.' In this case the McNeal-Edwards Company, a corporation of Virginia, sold to the Frank L. Young Company of Massachusetts 1,107 drums of Menhaden oil; buyers to return the drums. The buyers later sued the Virginia Company for breach of warranty of quality and attached the drums, but the attachment was inadequate security for damages and was the limit of the jurisdiction. Later the Virginia Corporation sued the buyers for the conversion of the drums, and thereupon at a still later date the buyers brought a second suit against the Virginia Corporation for the same cause of action as before, had the writ served upon the attorney of record in the Virginia Corporation's suit, and discontinued its former action. The petitioner in short is plainly within the Massachusetts statute, for although there is some sugges- \n\n[283 U.S. 398, 400]\n\u00a0\n tion that by reason of the petitioner's former suit the suit by the Virginia Corporation was not the 'original action' within section 3 supra, we regard this as a mere quibble, and have no doubt that the Massachusetts law applies if the Conformity Act brings it in. The case was dismissed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for want of jurisdiction. 42 F.(2d) 362; 43 F.( 2d) 99. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. 51 S. Ct. 89.\n We have to consider the Massachusetts law so far as it applies to counterclaims arising out of the same contract that was sued upon by the Virginia Company. If there should be any objections to a wider application, they do not affect the respondent and are not open here. Hatch v. Reardon, \n204 \nU.S. 152, 160\n, 27 S. Ct. 188, 9 Ann. Cas. 736. Thus limited the law is only a slight extension of the doctrine of recoupment recognized in Massachusetts apart from statute. Home Savings Bank v. Boston, 131 Mass. 277, 280. We take it that there is no doubt that the Massachusetts principle would be appied in the Courts of the United States, Dushane v. Benedict, \n120 \nU.S. 630\n, 7 S. Ct. 696; and no greater doubt if the principle were established by a code. Clement v. Field, \n147 \nU.S. 467, 475\n, 13 S. Ct. 358; Pacific Express Co. v. Malin, \n132 \nU.S. 531\n, 10 S.

Mr. Langdell observes that there is no necessity for such ceremony in the nature of things 'for, the plaintiff being already in court qua plaintiff by his own voluntary act, it is reasonable to treat him as being there for all the purposes for which justice to the defendant requires his presence.'

Blatchford & Co., 175 Mass. 369, 56 N. E. 700.\n The case is within the jurisdiction of the District Court in all other respects if the respondent has been served with process effectively.

The case was tried without a jury. The defense was payment. It appeared that, upon delivery of the car, the carrier had, as customary, accepted the defendant's check on a local bank for the amount of the charges; that it had delayed presenting the check for payment; and that meanwhile the bank had failed. The defendant contended that it was relieved from liability because of the carrier's unjustifiable delay in presenting the check. The trial court ruled that the Interstate Commerce Act requires that a carrier's charges be paid strictly in currency; and that since the check had not been paid, the defendant was liable even if the carrier's failure to receive the money was due wholly to its own negligence. Judgment entered for the carrier was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 36 F.(2d) 180. This Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n281 \nU.S. 709\n, 50 S. Ct. 249\n\n\n It has long been settled that payment of a carrier's charges must be made in money; and that the payment must be cash as distinguished from credit. \n1\n The purpose \n\n[282 U.S. 520, 522]\n\u00a0\n of the requirement is solely to prevent rebates or unjust discrimination and to ensure observance of the tariff rates. Compare Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co. v. Lindell, \n281 \nU.S. 14, 16\n, 50 S. Ct. 200. The Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  6(7)) does not in terms prescribe that the charges shall be paid in money; that is, in coin or currency. There is no reason for denying to the parties the convenience and safety incident to making payment, in accordance with the prevailing usage of business, by means of a check payable on demand drawn on a going bank in which the drawer has an ample deposit.\n Whether in the case at bar the defendant is liable depends, not upon any provision of the Interstate Commerce Act, but upon the rules of law generally applicable to payment by check. These, and other questions which have been argued, need not be considered by us.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Conference Ruling No. 207 of Interstate Commerce Commission ( September 15, 1906); Louisville & Nashville R.

Frank Nesbit and Jesse C. Adkins, both of Washington, D. C., for appellants. \n\n[282 U.S. 493, 494]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiffs, copartners doing business in Freeport, Ill., brought this suit in the circuit court of Bradley county, Ark., against James G. Brewster, of Warren, Ark., to recover for goods sold and delivered to him pursuant to a contract, the performance of which was alleged to have been guaranteed by the defendants E. A. Davis and H. M. Beaty. By the terms of the contract, the firm of Furst & Thomas agreed to sell and deliver to Brewster, on board cars at Freeport, Ill., or at their option at their nearest branch warehouse, at their current wholesale prices, their products in reasonable quantities as ordered by him, so long as the contract was in force and his account was in a satisfactory condition. Furst & Thomas agreed to give to Brewster free advice as to the best methods of selling to consumers the goods purchased by him under the contract. Brewster agreed to pay Furst & Thomas the regular wholesale prices, with specified discounts, the payments to bemad e weekly according to his cash sales and collections. On the termination of the contract, Brewster was to have the privilege of returning to Furst & Thomas his stock of unsold goods. The defendants pleaded that the goods delivered by the \n\n[282 U.S. 493, 495]\n\u00a0\n plaintiffs to Brewster were manufactured by a corporation, the Furst- McNess Company, organized under the laws of Illinois, with its principal place of business is Freeport, Ill.; that, in making the contract, and the deliveries of goods thereunder, Furst & Thomas acted as the agents of the Furst-McNess Company; and that the Furst-McNess Company had failed to comply with the statute of Arkansas pertaining to foreign corporations, by filing a copy of its charter and a statement of its assets and liabilities, by designating its general offices in the state of Arkansas, and by designating an agent for the service of process in that state. It was alleged that, in consequence, this suit could not be maintained, as the statutes of Arkansas expressly forbade it. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[282 U.S. 493, 496]\n\u00a0\n At the trial, the terms of the contract, as above stated, and the transactions under it, were shown. It appeared that Furst & Thomas did business at Freeport, Ill.; that they received at that place orders from the defendant Brewster; and that the goods so ordered were shipped to Brewster at Warren, Ark., from the branch warehouse of Furst & Thomas at Memphis, Tenn. The goods thus shiped had been obtained by Furst & Thomas in Illinois from the Furst-McNess Company, an Illinois corporation doing business at Freeport, Ill. It was admitted that this corporation had not been authorized to do business under the laws of Arkansas. Evidence was also introduced for the purpose of showing that Furst & Thomas were agents of the Furst-McNess Company and to support the contention that the transactions between Furst & Thomas and the defendant Brewster under the contract in suit were those of principal and agent.\n The evidence was submitted to the jury upon the question of agency. The court refused to give the instruction, which the plaintiffs requested, that the statutes o Ar kansas, supra, had no application, for the reason that, if applied, they would contravene article 1, section 8, clause 3, of the Constitution of the United States, giving to the Congress power to regulate commerce among the states. The jury found in favor of the defendants. A motion to set aside the verdict upon the ground, among others, of error in refusing the request above-mentioned, was denied. The Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed the judgment, following its earlier decision in a similar case (Furst & Thomas v. Hartzell, 172 Ark. 1118, 291 S. W. 828), where it \n\n[282 U.S. 493, 497]\n\u00a0\n was held that the determinative question was whether the relationship between the parties was that of vendor and vendee or principal and agent; that the contract in suit was ambiguous; and that it was proper to submit the question of the effect of the contract to a jury for its determination. Furst & Thomas v. Brewster, 180 Ark. 1167, 21 S.W.(2d) 863. The plaintiffs bring their appeal to this court, contending that the statutory provisions in question, as they have been applied by the state court, are repugnant to the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution.\n The question is not as to sales made by Brewster in Arkansas, but as to the tranactions between Brewster and Furst & Thomas. These transactions were clearly in interstate commerce, whether or not Furst & Thomas were agents of the Furst-McNess Company, and whether or not Brewster was an agent of Furst & Thomas. In pursuance of orders sent by Brewster in Arkansas to Furst & Thomas in Illinois, goods were shipped to Arkansas from the branch warehouse of Furst & Thomas in Tennessee. The ordering and shipment of the goods constituted interstate commerce, and the obligation to pay and the right to recover the amount due, according to the contract pursuant to which the goods were sent, arose in the course of that commerce. In International Text-Book Company v. Pigg, \n217 \nU.S. 91, 107\n, 30 S. Ct. 481, 27 L. R. A. (N. S.) 493, 18 Ann. Cas. 1103, this court quoted with approval the language of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, speaking by Judge Sanborn, in Butler Bros. Shoe Company v. United States Rubber Company, 156 F. 1, 17, 2 a case of consignments to a factor, that 'all interstate commerce is not sales of goods. Importation into one state from another is the indispensable element, the test, of interstate commerce; and every negotiation, \n\n[282 U.S. 493, 498]\n\u00a0\n contract, trade, and dealing between citizens of different states, which contemplates and causes such importation, whether it be of goods, persons, or information, is a transaction of interstate commerce.' Such commerce comprehends all the component parts of commercial intercourse between different states, and, according to established principle, any state statute which obstructs or lays a direct burden on the exercise of the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce is void under the commerce clause. Crutcher v. Kentucky, \n141 \nU.S. 47, 57\n, 11 S. Ct. 851; Western Union Telegraph Company v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1, 27\n, 30 S. Ct. 190; Dahnke-Walker Milling Company v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282, 290\n, 291 S., 42 S. Ct. 106. Accordingly, when a corporation goes into a state other than that of its origin to collect, according to the usual or prevailing methods, the amount which has become due in transactions in interstate commerce, the state cannot, consistently with the limitation arising from the commerce clause, obstruct the attainment of that purpose. Sioux Remedy Company v. Cope, \n235 \nU.S. 197, 204\n, 35 S. Ct. 57, 60.\n In the case last cited, it was recognized that a foreign corporation seeking to enforce such a right in the courts of a state may be required to conform to the prevailing modes of proceeding in those courts and to submit to the usual rules respecting costs, the giving of security therefor, and the like. But the court, examining the conditins imposed by the state statute, which were similar to those of the provisions here in question, found that they had 'no natural or reasonable relation to the right to sue which they are intended to restrict'; that the statutory requirements relating to the appointment of a resident agent upon whom process might be served was particularly burdensome because it required the foreign corporation to subject itself to the jurisdiction of the courts of the state in general, as a prerequisite to suing in any of them even in a single instance. The court said that in that way corporations engaged in interstate commerce could 'be \n\n[282 U.S. 493, 499]\n\u00a0\n subjected to great embarrassment and serious hazards in the enforcement of contractual rights directly arising out of and connected with such commerce.' See, also, international Text Book Company v. Pigg, supra, at pages 112, 114 of 217 U. S., 30 S. Ct., 481; Buck Stove Company v. Vickers, \n226 \nU.S. 205, 215\n, 216 S., 33 S. Ct. 41; Dahnke-Walker Milling Company v. Bondurant, supra.\n We are of the opinion that the provisions of the statutes of Arkansas, as applied in this case, are in conflict with the commerce clause.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The statutory provisions thus invoked are found in sections 1826 and 1832 of Crawford & Moses Digest of the Statutes of Arkansas (Acts 1907, p. 744), which provide as follows:\n'1826.

Marsh, of New York City, and Robert Hale, of Portland, Me., for petitioner.\n Mr. Horace G. McKeever, of Enid, Okl., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner brought suit in the District Court for Maine, to recover royalties alleged to be due under a contract by which it licensed respondent to use two 'Cross cracking units,' structures adapted to the use of the 'Cross cracking process' for increasing the production of gasoline from crude oil. Respondent pleaded, by way of counterclaim, in two separate counts, a contract by petitioner to construct a 'Cross vapor treating tower' for treatment of gasoline, produced by the cracking units, necessary to make it marketable. The consideration for this contract was alleged to be the execution of the license contract already referred to and of two related contracts, one by a third party for the construction of the cracking units, and another by which petitioner guaranteed that they would work. Performance of these contracts is admitted.\n Both counts of the counterclaim were based on the same seres o f transactions. The first alleged a contract arising from an oral proposal by petitioner's vice presi- \n\n[283 U.S. 494, 496]\n\u00a0\n dent in January, 1926, to construct for respondent a Cross vapor system treating tower, the cost of which was to be repaid by respondent to petitioner if the tower functioned in a satisfactory manner. This proposal was alleged to have been accepted by the execution of the other contracts. The second count alleged a written proposal of like tenor by petitioner to respondent, accepted by respondent on February 6, 1926, and confirmed by the later execution of the other contracts. Both counts charged that, by reason of petitioner's failure to construct the treating system, and pending the construction of a substitute system by respondent, the latter was compelled to store large quantities of the cracked gasoline awaiting treatment, resulting in four principal items of damage: 'The expenses of storage; depreciation of the gasoline by evaporation and other causes; the loss incident to shutting down respondent's plant because of the lack of treating apparatus; and the loss of anticipated profits from the sale of gasoline.\n The jury returned a verdict on petitioner's cause of action, and a verdict for respondent on the counterclaim, leaving a balance in petitioner's favor for which the District Court gave judgment. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed because of errors in the charge of the trial court with respect to the measure of damages on the counterclaim; but, in directing a new trial, it restricted the issues to the determination of damages only, 39 F.(2d) 521, following in this respect its earlier decisions in Farrar v. Wheeler (C. C. A.) 145 F. 482; Calaf v. Fernandez (C. C. A.) 239 F. 795; Atteaux & Co. v. Pancreon Mfg. Corp. (C. C. A.) 22 F.(2d) 749.

Ed. -, October 20, 1930, to review the single question whether the court below erred in thus limiting the new trial, upon a petition setting up a conflict of the decision with that of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in McKeon v. Central Stamping Co., 264 F. 385. See, also, Kean v. National City Bank (C. C. A.) 294 F. 214, 226.\n Petitioner contends that the withdrawal from consideration of the jury, upon the new trial, of the issue of liability on the contract set up in the counterclaim, is a denial of its constitutional right to a trial by jury. The Seventh Amendment provides: 'In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re- examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.' It is argued that as, by the rules of the common law in force when the amendment was adopted, there could be no new trial of a part only of the issues of fact, a resubmission to the jury of the issue of damages alone is a denial of the trial by jury which the amendment guarantees.\n It is true that at common law there was no practice of setting aside a verdict in part. If the verdict was erroneous with respect to any issue, a new trial was directed as to all. \n1\n This continued to be the rule in some states after the adoption of the Constitution;2 but in many it has not been followed, notwithstanding the presence in their Constitutions of provisions preserving trial by jury. The Massachusetts courts early modified it to permit a new \n\n[283 U.S. 494, 498]\n\u00a0\n trial of less than all the issues of fact when they were clearly separable. Bicknell v. Dorion, 16 Pick. (Mass.) 478; see Simmons v. Fish, 210 Mass. 563, 565 97 N. E. 102, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 588. The rule as thus modified has been generally accepted in the New England States (see Zaleski v. Clark, 45 Conn. 397, 404; McKay v. New England Dredging Co., 93 Me. 201, 44 A. 614; Lisbon v. Lyman, 49 N. H. 553, 582 et seq.; Clark v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 33 R. I. 83, 80 A. 406, Ann. Cas. 1913B, 356; Parizo v. Wilson, 101 Vt. 514, 144 A. 856), and consistently followed by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n Lord Mansfield, in applying the common-law rule where the verdict, correct as to one issue, was erroneous as to another. said: '... For form's sake, we must set aside the whole verdict. ...' Edie v. East India Co., 1 W. Bl. 295, 298. But we are not now concerned with the form of the ancient rule. It is the Constitution which we are to interpret; and the Constitution is concerned, not with form, but with substance. All of vital significance in trial by jury is that issues of fact be submitted for determination with such instructions and guidance by the court as will afford opportunity for that consideration by the jury which was secured by the rules governing trials at common law. See Herron v. Southern Pacific Co., \n283 \nU.S. 91\n, 51 S. Ct. 383, decided April 13, 1931. Beyond this, the Seventh Amendment does not exact the retention of old forms of procedure. See Walker v. New Mexico & Southern Pacific R. Co., \n165 \nU.S. 593, 596\n, 17 S. Ct. 421. It does not prohibit the introduction of new methods for ascertaining what facts are in issue (see Ex parte Peterson, \n253 \nU.S. 300, 309\n, 40 S. Ct. 543), or require that an issue once correctly determined, in accordance with the constitutional command, be tried a second time, even though justice demands that another distinct issue, because erroneously determined, must again be passed on by a jury.\n If, in the present case, the jury has found, in accordance with the applicable legal rules, the amount due to \n\n[283 U.S. 494, 499]\n\u00a0\n petitioner on the contract for royalties and all the elements fixing its liability on the treating plant contract, there is no constitutional requirement that those issues should again be sent to a jury merely because the exigencies of the litigation require that a separable issue be tried again. Such is not the effect of Slocum v. New York Life Insurance Co., \n228 \nU.S. 364\n, 33 S. Ct. 523, which decided only that an appellate federal court may not direct judgment non obstante veredicto, solely because the verdict given is not sustained by the evidence, but in that event must order a new trial. There it was held that the Seventh Amendment does not permit the entry of judgment on a trial at law before a jury upon an issue of fact, without the verdict of the jury. Here we hold that, where the requirement of a jury trial has been satisfied by a verdict according to law upon one issue of fact, that requirement does not compel a new trial of that issue even though another and separable issue must be tried again.\n As the issues arising upon petitioner's cause of action on the royalty contract are clearly separable from all others and the verdict as to them already given is free from error, it need not be disturbed. But the question remains whether the issue of damages is so distinct and independent of the others, arising on the counterclaim, that it can be separately tried. The verdict on the counterclaim may be taken to have established the existence of a contract and its breach. Nevertheless, upon the new trial, the jury cannot fix the amount of damages unless also advised of the terms of the contract; and the dates of formation and breach may be material, since it will be open to petitioner to insist upon the duty of respondent to minimize damages.\n But it is impossible from an inspection of the present record to say precisely what were the dates of formation and breach of the contract found by the jury, or its terms. Different dates are alleged in the counterclaim as that of the contract-one, February 6, 1926; the other, the date \n\n[283 U.S. 494, 500]\n\u00a0\n of final execution of the related contracts, fixed by some of the testimony at March 20th. No date was set for performance, and what the jury, by its verdict, found to be the reasonable time for performance, is not disclosed by the record.\n The contract alleged was to construct a single treating tower; but there was a sharp conflict in the testimony as to whether the oral proposal was for one, two, or three towers. To pass on the claim for loss of profits, the jury must know whether the contract to construct was the extent of the undertaking, and, if so, the number of towers to be built, or whether petitioner also agreed that the plant, whatever the number of towers, was to be adequate to treat all gasoline produced by respondent. In addition, the jury must know whether there was a guaranty that the treating system would work satisfactorily, or, of not, whether in fact it would have done so. But the present verdict, awarding as damages on the counterclaim less than the total of the items claimed by respondent, exclusive of alleged loss of profits, cannot be taken as establishing any of these material facts.\n Where the practice permits a partial new trial, it may not properly be resorted to unless it clearly appears that the issue to be retried is so distinct and separable from the others that a trial of it alone may be had without injustice.

Co., 97 Vt. 342, 358, 123 A. 211. Here the question of damages on the counterclaim is so interwoven with that of liability that the former cannot be submitted to the jury independently of the latter without confusion and uncertainty, which would amount to a denial of a fair trial. \n\n[283 U.S. 494, 501]\n\u00a0\n See Simmons v.

U.S.(1931)\nNo. 555\nArgued: April 30, 1931Decided: June 1, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 765, 766]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edgar Watkins, of Atlanta, Ga., John S. Burchmore, of Chicago, Ill., Mac Asbill, of Atlanta, Ga., and Luther M. Walter, of Chicago, Ill., for appellants.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Daniel W. Knowlton, of Washington, D. C., for appellee Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 765, 767]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert C. Alston, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellees Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. and others.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Rates on Chert, Clay, Sand, and Gravel Within States of Georgia, 122 I. C. C. 133, was a proceeding under section 13, paragraphs (3) and (4), of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  13, pars. 3, 4), in which the Commission was petitioned to determine whether certain intrastate carload rates on these products, prescribed by the Georgia Public Service Commission, were unduly prejudicial to persons or localities engaged in interstate commerce. Several related cases, arising out of complaints concerning interstate rates on like products between points in the southern territory, were heard on the same record and dealt with in the same report. \n1\n Therein and InterstateComm erce Commission prescribed certain distance scales as a maximum reasonable for interstate single-line and joint-line rates between points in Georgia and points in other states; and found that there was no transportation reason for the maintenance of a different basis of intrastate carload rates for these commodities within the state of Georgia. It did not then enter an order in respect to the intrastate rates, because it \n\n[283 U.S. 765, 768]\n\u00a0\n believed 'that the Georgia commission will co-operate in authorizing such revisions as might be necessary to bring their rates into harmony with the interstate adjustment herein approved.' 122 I. C. C. 169, 170.2\n Thereafter the carriers applied to the Georgia Public Service Commission for leave to establish the same distance scales for intrastate traffic. The state commission refused the application and directed them to establish a scale differing from that applicable to interstate traffic. With that direction the carriers complied; but they petitioned the federal Commission to reopen its proceedings and to determine whether the prescribed intrastate rates result, and will result, in undue prejudice to persons or localities in interstate commerce and in unjust discrimination against such commerce. The petition to reopen the case was granted; the state authorities were again given due notice; and various parties intervened to oppose or support the contested intrastate rates. Upon the supplemental hearing, the Interstate Commerce Commission found that such prejudice and discrimination had resulted, and will result, from the rates prescribed by the Georgia commission; and ordered the carriers to establish intrastate rates 'which shall not be \n\n[283 U.S. 765, 769]\n\u00a0\n lower, distance considered, than those (the rates) contemporaneously applicable' to the interstate commerce. 160 I. C. C. 309, 326.\n To enjoin and set aside that order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and to restrain the carriers from establishing intrastate rates pursuant thereto, two suits (now consolidated) were brought, under the Urgent Deficiencies Act, October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219 ( 28 USCA  41(27), in the federal court for Northern Georgia. The plaintiffs are the Public Service Commission and the state highway board of Georgia; the defendants, the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission. Carriers operating in Georgia and shippers intervened as defendants. The cases were heard by the District Court on an application for an interlocutory injunction, the bills and answers alone being introduced. The injunction was denied. Georgia Public Service Commission v. United States 39 F.(2d) 167. After final hearing on the full record of the proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission, the consolidated bill was dismissed. 42 F.(2d) 467. This appeal is from the final decree.\n First. Appellant con tend that the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission is void, because it was entered without the full hearing prescribed by section 13(4). The argument is this: Paragraph 4 prescribes that 'Whenever ... the Commission, after full hearing, finds' a state rate to be unlawful because it causes undue prejudice or unjust discrimination, 'it shall prescribe the rate, fare, or charge, or the maximum or minimum, or maximum and minimum, thereafter to be charged.' Act of February 28, 1920, c. 91,  416, 41 Stat. 456, 484, amending Act of February 4, 1887, c. 104,  13, 24 Stat. 379, 383 (49 USCA  13(4). The claim is that there was no 'full hearing' before entry of the challenged order, because the Commission limited the supplemental hearing to the question of prejudice and discrimination, and refused to consdier anew \n\n[283 U.S. 765, 770]\n\u00a0\n the question of the reasonableness of the interstate scales. It is true that, when state rates are assailed on the ground that they result in undue prejudice to interstate shippers or discriminate against interstate commerce, the Commission must determine whether the existing interstate rates are reasonable, as it may not require intrastate rates to be raised above a reasonable level. State Corporation Commission of Virginia v. Aberdeen & Rockfish R. R. Co., 136 I. C. C. 173, 180. But the reasonableness of the interstate rates had already been found when they were established in the earlier stage of the proceedings; and at those hearings the Georgia commission and the highway board were represented. Nearly eighteen months had elapsed since the original order,3 but no evidence was offered at the supplemental hearing to show that conditions had so changed since the interstate rates were prescribed as to require reconsideration of the issue. The appellants' objection to the procedure is unfounded. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Second. Appellants contend that, while the order prescribes a minimum and a maximum basis for intrastate rates, the minimum basis is so vague and uncertain as to \n\n[283 U.S. 765, 771]\n\u00a0\n render the entire order void. The order requires the carriers to establish intrastate rates 'which shall not be lower, distance considered, than those contemporaneously applicable to interstate transportation of the same commodities, in straight or mixed carloads, between points in the State of Georgia, and from points in other States in southern territory, except Florida, to points in the State of Georgia, not exceeding the rates set forth in the Appendix to this report and heretofore found and prescribed as reasonable in No. 17517 for the interstate transportation of said commodities in straight or mixed carloads.' The claim is that this language leaves it doubtful whether the word 'contemporaneously' refers only to rates in force at the time of the effective date of the original order, or also to such rates as may be made by the carriers from time to time thereafter, thereby raising or lowering future intrastate rates without the fll h earing provided for by section 13(4). We think it clear from the terms of the order that the interstate rates referred to are those now applicable and maintained Compare Shreveport Case, \n234 \nU.S. 342, 346\n, 347 S., 34 S. Ct. 833; Alabama v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 229\n, 49 S. Ct. 266. When the order is read, as must be done, in the light of the report, American Express Co. v. South Dakota ex rel. Caldwell, \n244 \nU.S. 617, 627\n, 37 S. Ct. 656, this and other alleged uncertainties are removed. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n - \n\n[283 U.S. 765, 772]\n\u00a0\n The order here callenged is statewide in operation; and it governs a vast multitude of rates. Because of divergent conditions, a doubt may well arise in applying the rule prescribed to some particular situation. But possible uncertainty of application in isolated instances is not a sufficient ground for setting aside in its entirety, by judicial process, a carefully drawn order, otherwise valid and practicable of operation over a wide territory. The appropriate remedy under such circumstances is an application to the Commission requesting it to suspend the operation of the order is so far as it may affect the isolated cases; and, if necessary, to enter an independent order dealing specifically with them. American Express Co. v. South Dakota ex rel. Caldwell, \n244 \nU.S. 617, 627\n, 37 S. Ct. 656. Such specific order, if appropriate for review under the Urgent Deficiencies Act, could be dealt with by the courts without interfering with the operation of the order as a whole of with the flexible administrative processes by which it may from time to time be modified. Compare Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington , & Quincy R. R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563, 591\n, 42 S. Ct. 232, 22 A. L. R. 1086; Interstate Commerce Commission Rules of Practice, Rule XV ( c); and the practice in State Corporation Commission of Virginia v. Aberdeen & Rockfish R. R. Co., 136 I. C. C. 173; 161 I. C. C. 273, 286; 165 I. C. C. 31; 169 I. C. C. 728; Southern Class Rate Investigation, 100 I. C. C. 513; 109 I. C. C. 300; 113 I. C. C. 200; 128 I. C. C. 567; Eastern Class Rate Investigation, 164 I. C. C. 314; 171 I. C. C. 481. It is true that the Georgia Bublic Service Commission petitioned the federal Commission for an interpretation of the order now challenged. But its petition, which occupies fourteen pages of the printed record, was in effect a petition for rehearing of the state-wide order. \n6\n Compare New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 204\n, 43 S. Ct. 270. \n\n[283 U.S. 765, 773]\n\u00a0\n Third. The appellants contnd t hat the order is void because there are no adequate findings of undue disparity between the rates charged for intrastate transportation in Georgia and the rates actually in force for interstate transportation; and also because there was no finding that the intrastate rates imposed an undue burden upon the carriers' interstate revenues or that the alteration of the intrastate rates would produce additional revenue. The findings in the report are definite and comprehensive. There are, moreover, illustrative specific findings which confirm the general ones, and show that in a real sense, and to a substantial degree, undue prejudice and discrimination to interstate shippers and localities have resulted and will result. \n7\n The requirement of definiteness, to which attention was called in Beaumont, Sour Lake & Western R. R. Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 74\n, 86 S. Ct. 1, and in Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194, 208\n, 51 S. Ct. 119, is also met. \n\n[283 U.S. 765, 774]\n\u00a0\n Fourth. The appellants contend that the findings are unsupported by the evidence. When an investigation involves shipments from and to many places under varying conditions, typical instances justify general findings. Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quinch R. R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563, 579\n, 42 S. Ct. 232, 22 A. L. R. 1086. Compare Beaumont, Sour Lake & Western Ry. Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 74, 83\n, 51 S. Ct. 1. While the order relates only to a few commodities, the scales of rates are state-wide in operation; and they apply to shipments between hundreds of points of origin and destination. To require specific evidence and separate adjudication in respect to each would be tantamount to denying the possibility of granting relief. Compare New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184\n, 43 S. Ct. 270; Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., loc. cit. supra. The evidence was comprehensive in scope. It occupies 556 pages of the printed record; and there were besides 337 exhibits. \n8\n The proof of the discrimination against interstate commerce was specific and typical, and was clearly sufficient to establish the undue prejudice to interstate shippers. Compare Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Tennessee, \n262 \nU.S. 318\n, 43 S. Ct. 583; United States v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., \n263 \nU.S. 515\n, 44 S. Ct. 189.\n Fifth. Appellants contend that the order was an arbitrary exercise of the Commission's limited power over intrastate rates, and that it constitutes an invasion of the sovereign rights of the state. It is urged, among other things, that, while the findings require intrastate rates no lower, distance considered, than those contemporaneously applicable on interstate traffic, the Commission had theretofore consistently held that distance is not the sole controlling factor in rates;9 and also that \n\n[283 U.S. 765, 775]\n\u00a0\n the Commission'sallo wance of higher rates for joint-line hauls is inconsistent with uniform scales established by it in other decisions. \n10\n The argument is, in effect, an appeal to this Court to review the exercise of administrative discretion. It is not our province to enquire into the soundness of the Commission's reasoning, the wisdom of its decisions, or the consistency of its conclusion with those reached in similar cases. Western Paper Makers' Chemical Co. v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 268, 271\n, 46 S. Ct. 500. The facts to which our attention is called furnish no support for the charge of arbitrariness or of invasion of the sovereign rights of the state. Compare Shreveport Case, \n234 \nU.S. 342, 354\n, 34 S. Ct. 833; American Express Co. v. South Dakota ex rel. Caldwell, \n244 \nU.S. 617, 625\n, 37 S. Ct. 656\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The original report embraced eight cases. It was followed by a further report (140 I. C. C. 85), which, after a further hearing, prescribed scales for certain specific points of origin and destination in Florida. In some respects all these orders are involved in the suit at bar. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In 1917 the Georgia Commission had undertaken to revise all intrastate class and commodity rates, but, because of intervening federal control, its order never became effective. After extensive hearings between 1921 and 1925, intrastate commodity rates for Georgia were prescribed. On April 1, 1925, these rates were revised on the commodities here involved. As a result of this order, eight carriers filed the petition which initiated the present proceeding. 122 I. C. C. 140.\n In the original hearing, the federal Commission found that the prescribed 1925 intrastate rates had not theretofore been unjustly discriminatory against interstate traffic, but that existing interstate distance scales were virtually broken down by the maintenance of so-called depressed rates which were almost wholly unrelated to distance, and that comprehensive interstate distance scales should be established. 122 I. C. C. 154, 163, 169. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] This order, establishing the so-called 17517 scales, was entered on January 21, 1927, and rates under it became effective October 1, 1927. The supplementary order of the Georgia Public Service Commission was entered March 13, 1928. The proceedings before the federal Commission were reopened on June 4, 1928. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Commission stated: 'For the purpose of determining whether or not this (the alleged discrimination) is the fact, the proceedings were reopened and the further hearing had. The scope of the further hearing was properly limited to the question indicated. If the contention made ... in this regard were sound, then our efforts to secure co-operative action in situations such as here presented, instead of bringing about that result, could be made the instrument of burdening the commission with endless investigations covering the same subject matter and would result in litigation being prolonged indefinitely.' 160 I. C. C. 313. Compare Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563, 591\n, 42 S. Ct. 232, 22 A. L. R. 1086. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Two other ambiguities are charged. It is urged that the phrase, 'distance considered,' is not complete, since it does not indicate whether the distance of joint-line or single-line hauls is meant. Under the original order establishing the 17517 scales, the rate is determined by the distance scale comprised in the shortest route over which carload traffic can be moved without transfer of lading, irrespective of whether such route necessitates a single or joint-line haul. This formula is readily applicable to intrastate shipments. It is also argued that, since several carriers are charging less than the 17517 scales, the order is uncertain because it does not indicate whether the minimum intrastate scale is to be determined by the prescribed interstate scale or by the actual departures from it. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The State Commission requested a rehearing or a further order that the carriers file, within a definite time, complete intrastate schedules so that specific objection might be made. Since there were hundreds of shipping and receiving points, every local municipality and county being a potential customer for these roadbuilding products, the enforcement of this request would have involved a complete reopening of the proceedings. A few specific difficulties in application were outlined in the state commission's petition, but these were offered, not for definite rulings, but merely by way of illustrating defects in the order. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The findings as to prejudice to interstate shippers embraced almost all of the commodities considered, and included large scale producers which were able to absorb rate differentials in some parts of the state but could not compete in all parts. Moreover, rate differences were found to be highly detrimental because the commodities here involved are among the lowest valued for shipment, and the cost of transportation is a relatively large, and often conclusive, factor in the cost to consumers. The Commission compiled from the exhibits a series of tables which indicated that the rates prescribed by the state commission were, within the usual intrastate traffic distances, either equal to or less than the 17517 scales for single-line hauls, and uniformly less than the interstate scales for joint-line hauls. 160 I. C. C. 314, 316. Similarity of operating and transportation conditions was clearly established and found. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] By stipulation these, and the various tariff schedules, were not reprinted, but were brought here in their original form. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] It is pointed out that, where traffic density varies or transportation conditions are different, the Commission has recognized that distance alone should not be a controlling factor. But the cost elements involved in the movement of the low grade commodities here concerned were adequately considered in the first hearing in which the reasonableness of the 17517 distance scales was determined. Those rates took 'fully into consideration the very low values of these commodities and all characteristics, transportation and otherwise, which entitle them to relatively low rates. It will be a scale, in our opinion, from which the carriers ought not to depart.' 122 I. C. C. 148. In part as a result of the order then entered and in part by voluntary extensions by the carriers, these scales were put into force throughout most of the southern territory, and were also adopted intrastate in four states. The further finding as to the similarity in transportation conditions in interstate and intrastate shipments was amply sustained by the evidence. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] It is argued that the federal Commission has never permitted dual scales in similar cases; that, even where allowed, the two scales have merged after relatively short distances; and that the evidence and findings in either report are insufficient to support a higher joint-line scale for the class of commodities here in question. \n\n\n\n\n","64":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGO-BART IMPORTING CO. v. U.S.(1931)\nNo. 111\nArgued: November 25, 1930Decided: January 5, 1931\n\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 344, 346]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward F. Colladay, of Washington, D. C. (Messrs. Benjamin B. Pettus and Joseph C.

C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 344, 348]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In a criminal proceeding before a United States commissioner in the Southern District of New York in which Gowen, Bartels, and others are defendants, the petitioners applied to the district court for an order enjoining the use as evidence of books and papers alleged to have been seized and taken from petitioners in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments and directing their return. The court made an order that the United States show cause why the relief prayed should not be granted. The United States attorney appeared and opposed the motion, and affidavits of W. J. Calhoun, special agent in charge of special agents of the Bureau of Prohibition, and certain of his subordinates were filed in opposition. The district court denied the applications. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed as to the United States attorney and held that as to the special agent in charge the order to show cause should have been discharged. 40 F.( 2d) 593.\n Petitioners' applications to the district court, which are in form affidavits, set forth the following: \n\n[282 U.S. 344, 349]\n\u00a0\n June 5, 1929, Calhoun went before the United States commissioner and, in order to have a warrant issued for the arrest of Gowen, Bartels and others, verified and filed a complaint. He alleged, upon information and belief, that beginning January 1, 1929, and continuing down to the filing of the complaint Gowen, Bartels, and other defendants conspired in that district to commit a nuisance against the United States, that is to say, to possess, transport, sell, and solicit and receive orders for intoxicating liquor in violation of the National Prohibition Act, and that, in pursuance of the conspiracy and to effect its objects, one Heath purchased an automobile on May 23, 1929. See 27 U. S. Code,  33, 35 (27 USCA  33, 35). The complaint did not specify any builing , structure, location, or place, or set forth any particulars or other overt act or show any connection between the purchase of the automobile and any offense referred to in the complaint. On the same day the commissioner issued a warrant in the usual form commanding the marshal of the district and his deputies to apprehend the persons so accused and to bring them before the commissioner or some judge or justice of the United States to be dealt with according to law.\n On the next day Calhoun's subordinates, prohibition agents O'Brien, Collins, and Sipe, went to the petitioning company's office at No. 200 Fifth avenue. Bartels, the secretary-treasurer of the company, was there when they entered. O'Brien said he had a warrant to search the premises and exhibited a paper which he falsely claimed was such a warrant. The agents arrested Bartels, searched his person, and took papers therefrom. While they were there Gowen, the president of the company, came to the office. O'Brien told him that he had a warrant for his arrest and a warrant to search the premises. The agents arrested and searched Gowen and took papers from him. They took his keys and by threat of force compelled him to open a desk and safe, searched and took papers from \n\n[282 U.S. 344, 350]\n\u00a0\n them, searched other parts of the office and took therefrom other papers, journals, account books, letter files, insurance policies, cancelled checks, index cards, and other things belonging respectively to Gowen, Bartels, and the company. For brevity these will be referred to herein as 'papers.'\n Gowen and Bartels were on the same day arraigned before the commissioner and held on bail further to answer the complaint. A date was set for the examination, hearing has been postponed from time to time, and no examination has been had. The papers so seized were taken to the office of Calhoun in the Subtreasury Building where they were examined by him and the United States attorney and their subordinates, and such papers have since been kept and held there, as is later herein shown, under the control of the United States attorney in the care and custody of the special agent in charge, for use as evidence against Gowen and Bartels.\n Soon after the seizures were made, each of the petitioners brought a suit in equity in the federal court for that district against the special agent in charge and the United States attorney, to enjoin them from using such papers as evidence and to have them returned. The court dismissed these suits on the ground that the proper remedy was by motion in the criminal proceedings.\n Then Gowen and Bartels, each in his own behalf, and the company, acting through Bartels, made these applications. The court made its order that the United States show cause why an injunction should not issue restraining it and its officers from using as evidence the papers so seized and why an order should not issue directing their return.\n In opposition, the affidavit of one Braidwood was submitted. It tends to show that in 1927 and 1928 petitioners and others acting together engaged in the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor, that at the company's office \n\n[282 U.S. 344, 351]\n\u00a0\n they exhibited and took orders for intoxicating liquor some of which was delivered there and some elsewhere, and that in April, 1929, he reported these facts to Calhoun. Calhoun's affidavit states that Braidwood had so reported and that by independent investigations he had corroborated such statements and thus knew that a conspiracy unlawfully to sell intoxicating liquors in 1928 and 1929 had been entered into and overt acts in furtherance thereof had been performed within the district and that he believed the petitioners had been parties to such conspiracy, that prior to the day of the arrests he communicated such statements and belief to O'Brien and assigned him to further investigate the case.\n O'Brien's affidavit states: From the information given him by Calhoun he believed petitioners and others had so conspired. Calhoun described to him the company's office in detail and the personal appearnce of Gowen and Bartels. On June 6, 1929, he took a certified copy of the complaint and warrant 'for the purpose of reference as to the names of the various defendants' and went to petitioners' office. It consisted of a suite of three rooms fitted up with office furniture including desks, filing cabinets, and a safe. He told Bartels and Gowen that he was an officer of the United States and placed them under arrest for such conspiracy. No warrant was 'served' upon either of them. The office was searched and there were found and taken therefrom approximately a dozen bottles of assorted intoxicating liquor, a large number of memoranda, books of account, records, filing cases, and other papers all of which pertained to unlawful dealings by Gowen and Bartels in intoxicating liquors.\n O'Brien's affidavit also states that the papers so seized are of such quantity and bulk tnat it is impracticable to attach copies to the affidavit, that such papers are 'specifically incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof and are further made available for inspection at \n\n[282 U.S. 344, 352]\n\u00a0\n any time, if desired by the Court, in connection with the consideration of this order to show cause.'\n In reply to O'Brien's affidavit, petitioners submitted affidavits of Gowen, Bartels and other defendants who were arrested at the company's office on that occasion and affidavits of other persons who were present during some part of the time that the prohibition agents were there. These affidavits show that O'Brien said he had a warrant of arrest and produced a paper which several of these affiants say they read and believe to be the warrant issued by the commissioner, a copy of which was filed with the moving papers. As to these details there is no conflict in the evidence.\n The district court refused to sustain the contention that no use was made of the warrant and accepted the statements that O'Brien claimed to have warrants for the arrests and searches. The Circuit Court of Appeals did not definitely express opinion as to that matter. We have examined the evidence. It requires a finding that O'Brien did so claim, that he had the warrant issued by the commissioner or a copy of it, and that when he arrested Gowen and Bartels he claimed and purported to act under the warrant. No warrant for the search of the premises was issued.\n The orders dismissing petitioners' suits in equity are not before us. The question whether the district court had jurisdiction summarily to deal with petitioner's applications, while not brought forward by the parties, arises upon the record, was considered by the Circuit Court of Appeals and suggested during the argument here.\n United States commissioners are inferior officers. \n1\n United States v. Allred, \n155 \nU.S. 591, 594\n, 15 S. Ct. 231; Rice v. Ames, \n\n[282 U.S. 344, 353]\n\u00a0\n \n180 \nU.S. 371, 377\n, 378 S., 21 S. Ct. 406. Cf. Ex parte Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 257, et seq.. The Act of May 28, 1896, 29 Stat. 184, abolished commissioners of the circuit courts, authorized each district court to appoint United States commissioners, gave to them the same powers and duties that commissioners of the circuit courts had, required such appointments to be entered of record in the district courts, provided that the commissioners should hold their office subject to removal by the court appointing them (28 U. S. Code,  526 (28 USCA  526 )), and required them to keep records of proceedings before them in criminal cases and deliver the same to the clerks of the courts on the commissioners' ceasing to hold office. Id., section 529 (28 USCA  529). They are authorized by statute in respect of numerous matters 2 and the relations between them and the district courts vary as do their official acts. Cf. United States v. Allred, ubi supra; Grin v. Shine, \n187 \nU.S. 181, 187\n, 23 S. Ct. 98; Todd v. United States, \n158 \nU.S. 278, 282\n, 15 S. Ct. 889; Collins v. Miller, \n252 \nU.S. 364, 369\n, 40 S. Ct. 347; United States v. Berry (D. C.) 4 F. 779; Ex part Perkins (C. C.) 29 F. 900; The Mary (D. C.) 233 F. 121.\n We need not consider what power the district court may exert over the commissioners dealing with matters unlike \n\n[282 U.S. 344, 354]\n\u00a0\n that now before us. Here the commissioner acted under Rev. St.  1014, which provides that for any crime or offense against the United States, the offender may by any justice or judge of the United States or by any commissioner of the circuit court to take bail (now United States commissioner) be arrested and imprisoned, or bailed, as the case may be, for trial before such court of the United States as by law has cognizance of the offense. 18 U. S. Code  591 (18 USCA  591). All the commissioner's acts and the things done by the prohibition officers in respect of this matter were preparatory and preliminary to a consideration of the charge by a grand jury and, if an indictment should be found, the final disposition of the case in the district court. The commissioner acted not as a court, or as a judge of any court, but as a mere officer of the district court in proceedings of which that court had authority to take control at any time. Todd v. United States, ubi supra; Collins v. Miller, ubi supra; United States v. Berry, supra; United States v. Casino ( D. C.) 286 F. 976, 979.\n Notwithstanding the order to show cause was addressed to the United States alone, this is in substance and effect a proceeding against the United States attorney and the special agent in charge. The special agent in charge was the prosecuting witness. It was his duty under the statute to report violations to the United States attorney. Donnelley v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 505\n, 48 S. Ct. 400. And he was authorized, subject to the control of the United States attorney, to 'conduct the prosecution at the committing trial for the purpose of having the offenders held for the action of a grand jury.' 27 U. S. Code,  11 (27 USCA  11). It is immaterial whether he intended or was personally to conduct the prosecution before the commissioner. As the United States attorney had control of the prosecution before the commissioner, whether conducted by his assistants or prohibition agents, the papers were held subject to his control and direction although in the immediate care ad c ustody \n\n[282 U.S. 344, 355]\n\u00a0\n of the prohibition officers. He and they voluntarily came before the court to defend the seizure, the retention and proposed use of the papers and so in effect became parties to the proceeding. By making the papers a part of O'Brien's affidavit they brought the papers within the power of the court and constructively into its possession, if indeed the papers had not already come within its reach. In so far as it purports to run against the United States, the form of the order may be treated as a mere irregularity.\n The United States attorney and the special agent in charge, as officers authorized to conduct such prosecution and having control and custody of the papers for that purpose, are, in respect of the acts relating to such prosecution, alike subject to the proper exertion of the disciplinary powers of the court. And on the facts here shown it is plain that the district court had jurisdiction summarily to determine whether the evidence should be suppressed and the papers returned to the petitioners. Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383, 398\n, 34 S. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177; Wise v. Henkel, \n220 \nU.S. 556, 558\n, 31 S. Ct. 599; Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 385, 390\n, 40 S. Ct. 182, 24 A. L. R. 1426; Cogen v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 221, 225\n, 49 S. Ct. 118; United States v. Mills (C. C.) 185 F. 318; United States v.

A.) 32 F.(2d) 873, 874.\n The Government concedes that the warrant did not authorize O'Brien or other prohibition agents to make the arrests. The complaint, which in substance is recited in the warrant, was verified merely on information and belief and does not state facts sufficient to constitute an offense. Ex parte Burford, 3 Cranch, 448, 453; Rice v. Ames, supra, page 374 of 180 U. S., 21 S. Ct. 406; Byars v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 28\n, 47 S. Ct. 248; United States v. Cruikshank, \n92 U.S. 542\n, 558; United States v. Hess, \n124 \nU.S. 483\n, 8 S. Ct. 571; United States v. Ruroede (D. C.) 220 F. 210, \n\n[282 U.S. 344, 356]\n\u00a0\n 212, 213. The warrant was improvidently issued and invalid on its face. It does not purport to authorize anyone other than the marshal and his deputies.\n The company is not mentioned in the complaint or warrant and is a stranger to the proceeding before the commissioner. Unquestionably the order of the district court as to it was final and appealable. Cogen v. United States, ubi supra; Ex parte Tiffany, \n252 \nU.S. 32\n, 40 S. Ct. 239; Savannah v. Jesup, \n106 \nU.S. 563\n, 1 S. Ct. 512; Gumbel v. Pitkin, \n113 \nU.S. 545\n, 5 S. Ct. 616. When the application was made, no information or indictment had been found or returned against Gowen or Bartels. There was nothing to show that any criminal proceeding would ever be instituted in that court against them. Post v. United States, \n161 \nU.S. 583, 587\n, 16 S. Ct. 611. And, as above shown, the complaint does not state an offense. It follows that the order of the district court was not made in or dependent upon any case or proceeding there pending and therefore the order as to them was appealable. Cogen v. United States, ubi supra; Perlman v. United States, \n247 \nU.S. 7, 13\n, 38 S. Ct. 417; Burdeau v. McDowell, \n256 \nU.S. 465\n, 41 S. Ct. 574, 13 A. L. R. 1159\n\n\n Without pausing to consider the matter, we assume, as held by the lower courts, that the facts of which Calhoun and O'Brien had been informed prior to the arrests are sufficient to justify the apprehension without a warrant of Gowen and Bartels for the conspiracy referred to in Braidwood's affidavit and on that basis we treat the arrests as lawful and valid.\n No question is here raised as to the search of the persons. There remains for consideration the ues tion whether the search of the premises, the seizure of the papers therefrom and their retention for use as evidence may be sustained. The first clause of the Fourth Amendment declares: 'The right of the people to be se- \n\n[282 U.S. 344, 357]\n\u00a0\n cure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.' It is general and forbids every search that is unreasonable; it protects all, those suspected or known to be offenders as well as the innocent, and unquestionably extends to the premises where the search was made and the papers taken. Gouled v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 298, 307\n, 41 S. Ct. 261. The second clause declares: 'And no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.' This prevents the issue of warrants on loose, vague or doubtful bases of fact. It emphasizes the purpose to protect against all general searches. Since before the creation of our government, such searches have been deemed obnoxious to fundamental principles of liberty. They are denounced in the constitutions or statutes of every State in the Union. Agnello v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 20, 33\n, 46 S. Ct. 4, 51 A. L. R. 409. The need of protection against them is attested alike by history and present conditions. The Amendment is to be liberally construed and all owe the duty of vigilance for its effective enforcement lest there shall be impairment of the rights for the protection of which it was adopted. Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 623\n, 6 S. Ct. 524. Weeks v. United States, supra, pages 389-392 of 232 U. S., 34 S. Ct. 341.\n There is no formula for the determination of reasonableness. Each case is to be decided on its own facts and circumstances. It is not, and could not be, claimed that the officers saw conspiracy being committed. And there is no suggestion that Gowen or Bartels was committing crime when arrested. In April, 1929, Braidwood reported to Calhoun the existence of a conspiracy and that in pursuance of it sales and deliveries of intoxicating liquor had been made in 1927 and 1928. The record does not show \n\n[282 U.S. 344, 358]\n\u00a0\n any criminal overt act in 1929. Calhoun's description to O'Brien of the company's office in detail and of Gowen and Bartels shows that he knew the place and offenders. Notwithstanding he had an abundance of information and time to swear out a valid warrant, he failed to do so. O'Brien falsely claimed to have a warrant for the search of the premises and he made the arrests under color of the invalid warrant. By pretension of right and threat of force he compelled Gowen to open the desk and the safe and with the others made a general and apparently unlimited search, ransacking the desk, safe, filing cases and other parts of the office. It was a lawless invasion of the premises and a general exploratory search in the hope that evidence of crime might be found. Federal Trade Commission v. American Tobacco Co., \n264 \nU.S. 298, 306\n, 44 S. Ct. 336, 32 A. L. R. 786.\n Plainly the case before us is essentially different from Marron v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 192\n, 48 S. Ct. 74. There, officers executing a valid search warrant for intoxicating liquors found and arrested one Birdsall who in pursuance of a conspiracy was actually engaged in running a saloon. As an incident to the arrest they seized a ledger in a closet where the liquor or some of it was kept and some bills beside the cash register. These things were visible and accessible and in the offender's immediate custody. There was no threat of force or general search or rummaging of the place.\n The uncontradicted evidence requires a finding that here the search of the premises was unreasonable. Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, supra; Marron v. United States, supra, page 199 of 275 U. S., 48 S. Ct. 74. United States v. Kirschenblatt (C. C. A.) 16 F.(2d) 202, 51 A. L. R. 416. The judgments below must be reversed andthe case remanded to the district court with directions to enjoin the United States attorney and the special agent in charge from using the papers as evidence and to order the same returned to petitioners.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As to the office of United States commissioner, see: Section 4, Act of March 2, 1793, 1 Stat. 334; Section 1, Act of February 20, 1812, 2 Stat. 679; Act of March 1, 1817, 3 Stat. 350; sections 1, 2, Act of August 23, 1842, 5 Stat. 516; Rev.

Goodcell, is typical of this group of cases. On March 22, 1918, petitioners filed their partnership income and excess- profits tax returns for the year 1917 and paid the taxes thereby shown to be due. Additional taxes were assessed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in January, 1920. The petitioners filed a claim for the abatement of this assessment on February 11, 1920, and the Commissioner rejected the claim on December 27, 1922. Under section 250(d) of the Revenue Act of 1921 (c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 265), the five-year period for the collection of the taxes for 1917 expired on March 22, 1923. The Collector served notice and demand for payment on November 19, 1924, threatening distraint, and on November 29, 1924, and December 3, 1924, the petitioners paid the additional taxes under protest. On September 25, 1925, they filed a claim for refund upon the ground that the taxes were collected after the statute of limitations had run. The claim was \n\n[282 U.S. 409, 415]\n\u00a0\n rejected by the Commissioner on January 13, 1926, and this suit to recover the money paid was brought on December 23, 1927, in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of California. The judgment entered in favor of the petitioners by the District Court was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 35 F.(2d) 586. This Court granted a writ of certiorari, \n281 \nU.S. 708\n, 50 S. Ct. 240\n\n\n There are variations in the other cases, but the determining features are the same. A claim in abatement was filed and collection was delayed; the collection was made after the statute of limitations had run, and before the enactment of the Act of 1928. In some of the cases, the suit to recover the amount paid was brought after, and in other cases before, the Act of 1928 became a law on May 29, 1928. The suits were either in the Court of Claims against the United States, or in the District Courts of the United States against the Collector, either individually or officially, or in both capacities. In all these cases the decisions below were in favor of the Government2 and writs of certiorari were issued by this Court. 3 \n\n[282 U.S. 409, 416]\n\u00a0\n The contentions presented are, in substance, that sections 607 and 611 of the Revenue Act of 1928 (26 USCA  2607, 2611) do not apply retroactively; that their provisions are not applicable to payments made under duress; that the stay contemplated by section 611 is not a mere voluntary delay in collecting the tax; that these sections were intended to control administrative action only and not to affect judicial proceedings; that section 611 should not be construed to apply to a personal action against the Collector to recover taxes illegally collected; that section 611 was repealed by the Act of May 29, 1928, c. 901,  3, 45 Stat. 986, 996 (26 USCA  149); that section 250(d) of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 265) extinguished the liability for taxes upon the expiration of the five-year period specified; that the Congress having extinguished the liability had no power under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution to revive it; and that, if section 611 is construed to authorize the collection of the tax in the circumstances shown, it further violates the Fifth Amendment because the statute is unreasonable and arbitrary.\n First. As to the construction of the statute: Section 607 provides that a tax assessed or paid after the expiration of the period of limitation applicable thereto shall be considered an 'overpayment' and shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer, if claim therefor is duly filed. Section 611 enacts a qualification by providing that in stated circumstances the payment of the tax shall not be considered an overpayment under the provisions of section 607. These circumstances are ( a) an assessment of the tax within the time applicable thereto and before June 2, 1924, (b) the filing of a claim in abatement, (c) the stay of the collection of any part of the tax, and (d) the payment of such part of the tax before, or within one year after, the enactment of the Act of 1928.\n The occasion for this legislation, and the general purpose of the Congress in enacting it, are apparent. The \n\n[282 U.S. 409, 417]\n\u00a0\n Revenue Act of 1918, by section 250(d), (c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1083) provided that 'no suit or proceeding' for the collection of taxes should be begun 'after the expiration of five years after the date when the return was due or was made.' This provision applied only to taxes assessed under that Act. Section 250(d) of the Revenue Act of 1921 (c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 265) prescribed the same period of limitation for collection by suit or proceeding, and the provision was made applicable to the collection of taxes both under that Act and under prior income, excess-profits, or war- profits tax Acts, the five years running from the date of the filing of the return. The Treasury Department ruled that this limitation applied only to judicial proceedings and not to collection by distraint, the common method of enforcing payment. \n4\n Section 1106(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 113 (26 USCA  1249 note)) provided that the statute of limitations should 'not only operate to bar the remedy' but should 'extinguish the liability,' but that 'no credit or refund in respect of such tax' should be allowed unless the taxpayer had 'overpaid the tax.' In Bowers v. New York & Albany Lighterage Co., \n273 \nU.S. 346\n, 47 S. Ct. 389 (decided February 21, 1927), this court held that the period of limitation fixed by section 250(d) of the Revenue Act of 1921 did apply to collection by distraint proceedings. It thus appeared that many of the collections theretofore made had been barred by the statute, and suits were brought to recover the moneys paid. \n5\n In many cases claims in abatement had been filed and proceedings for collection had been delayed until the claims had been acted upon, and thereupon the taxes had been collected despite the fact that the statute of limitations had run. Large \n\n[282 U.S. 409, 418]\n\u00a0\n amounts had been paid into the Treasury in this way, and it was the purpose of the Congress that payments made in the circumstances described in section 611 of the Revenue Act of 1928 (26 USCA  2611) should not be refunded. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioners urge that section 611, read in its relation to section 607, was intended to apply only prospectively, that is, to action to be taken by the Treasury Department on refund claims filed after the enactment of the Act. Stress is laid upon the language of section 607 that a payment made after the expiration of the period of limitation 'shall be considered' an overpayment and 'shall be credited or refunded' if claim therefor 'is filed.' But section 611 was manifestly intended to operate retroactively according to its terms. That is, it expressly applied to internal revenue taxes which had been assessed prior to June 2, 1924, and within the period of limitation applicable to the assessment. The section \n\n[282 U.S. 409, 419]\n\u00a0\n applied to taxes, so assessed, which had been paid before the enactment of the Act of 1928, as well as to those which would be paid within one year thereafter. The provision was applicable to such payments although the period of limitation on assessment and collection had expired when the payments were made; and the provision of section 611 related to such payments only when a claim in abatement had been filed and collection had been stayed. The words of section 607 did apply to future action as to credits and refunds by requiring recognition of the right of the taxpayer, as stated in the section, to have a return of the moneys paid, but that right, under section 611, was not to exist when the payments had been made in the circumstances there described. It was the circumstances in which the tax had been paid, and not the time of filing the claim for a refund of the money, that section 611 made determinative; and it would be inconsistent with the plain \n\n[282 U.S. 409, 420]\n\u00a0\n intendment of that section to say that taxpayers should be denied a refund in those circumstances ony w here their claims for refund were made after the enactment, but not if they had been made before. The words of section 607, if a claim for refund 'is filed within the period of limitation for filing such claim', established the appropriate condition that a claim for refund should be duly filed, but do not require the construction that the scheme of the statute, which embraced the important prohibition of section 611, should be limited to those cases where claims for refund should be filed after the statute was enacted.\n We are also of the opinion that the statute embraces involuntary payments. The argument of the petitioners points to the provision of section 611 which made it applicable not only to payments before the enactment but to those within one year thereafter. It is said that the latter must be voluntary payments, and that the Treasury Department so construed the statute, as the statute did not purport to authorize collections after the period of limitation had expired. \n7\n But the statute also applied to payments which had been made in the past. The concern of the Congress lay with the fact that payments had been made after the statute of limitations had run and with the particular situation of taxpayers where claims in abatement had been filed and the collection stayed. Section 611 was to prevent refunding the money if collection had thus been postponed. That situation existed where, after the expiration of the period of limitation, payment had been compelled, and the statute made no exception of such payments. The practice of collecting taxes by distraint, and the mistaken view of the law that the statute of limitations had not barred collection in that manner, had exposed the Treasury to demands which it was the intention of the legislation to defeat. \n\n[282 U.S. 409, 421]\n\u00a0\n Petitioners contend that the stay to which section 611 referred was not simply a voluntary delay in enforcing payment. 'Stay' is said to be a term of art, with a meaning opposed to a mere voluntary postponement of action. There would be much force in the point, if the word could be taken out of its particular setting. A 'stay' compelled, rather than voluntarily granted, would be either under a judicial order or by virtue of statutory compulsion. Section 3224 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Code, tit. 26,  154 (26 USCA  154)) provides that 'no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court.' See Graham v. Du Pont, \n262 \nU.S. 234, 254\n, 255 S., 43 S. Ct. 567. Statutory provisions for stay of collection were limited in application. See Revenue Act of 1918,  214(a)(12)(a); sec. 234(a)(14)(a) ( 40 Stat. 1068, 1079). United States v. Barth, \n279 \nU.S. 370\n, 49 S. Ct. 366.8 There was no mandatory stay, that is, in the absence of agreement, without bond. But section 611 expressly applies where a claim in abatement was filed 'with or without bond.' The word 'stay' cannot therefore be taken to be limited to a mandatory stay. It is said, however, that the words 'without bond' were inserted in order to include those cases where there was a contractual stay, as in cases where the Government had been protected by a deposit of money in escrow, or by a deposit in bank as a guarantee of payment, or by other forms of binding agreements, where bonds were not filed. Such cases were exceptional, and to confine the statute to such instances would be to limit it so narrowly as to ignore its apparent purpose. In the case of a taxpayer, believed to be solvent, who had filed a claim in abatement, the postponement of collection would normally \n\n[282 U.S. 409, 422]\n\u00a0\n take place without agreement. It is urged that if the statute is applied to voluntary delays, the clause as to stay is surplusage. If so, such a construction would be preferable to one that would make the statute virtually inoperative. But the clause is not inappropriate, as it is descriptive of the situation which followed the filing of the claim in abatement. It is true that the statutes and regulations relating to the filing of such claims did not require that there must be a postponement of collection pending decision. The collector was still put to his duty of due diligence, but he had authority to postpone the collection pending the determination of the claim, unless he believed that such action would jeopardize the ultimate recovery. \n9\n Such postponement, on the assumption that the statute or regulations did not bar proceedings for collection by distraint, created the situation to which section 611 was directed. The view that the word 'stay' was intended to embrace this voluntary delay is supported by the statements in the reports of the committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n In most of the cases now under review, it appears that the claim in abatement was rejected after the expiration of the period of limitation for collection. In No. 36, Graham v. Goodcell, however, the claim in abatement was rejected in December, 1922, and the period of limitation did not expire until March, 1923. It is urged that, for this reason, that case falls outside the purview of section 611. The statute makes no such exception, and we are not warranted in implying one. The claim in abatement had been filed and was pending for nearly three years. \n\n[282 U.S. 409, 423]\n\u00a0\n There is room for the inference that had it not been for this delay, the tax would have been collected before the statute ran. The tax was collected later and the statute, by its terms, is applicable.\n It is further insisted on behalf of the petitioners that sections 607 and 611 relate solely to administrative action and not to judicial proceedings. In support of this argument, an elaborate analysis of the revenue acts is presented in order to establish the meaning of the statutory words 'credit and refund' and 'overpayment' and the aptness of their reference to administrative proceedings. It is not necessary to review this analysis, for there can be no doubt that these words do have appropriate reference to action in the course of administration. But it does not follow that by the use of these words the statute is limited to such action. There is no basis for the suggestion that there were questions involved of such a character as to make it appropriate to submit them to the exclusive judgment of the Commissioner. \n11\n The question was not as to the merits of the tax but simply as to the existence of certain facts of time and procedure. These facts were matters of record, easily ascertained and definite in character. It would be anomalous that the right of the taxpayer to obtain a refund from the Department, to which he was under obligation to resort (Rev. St. 3226, U. S. Code tit. 26,  156 ( 26 USCA  156)), should be denied, while the right to recover by suit the same amount under exactly the same circumstances should remain unaffected. In the attempt to explain this anomaly, it is said that the provision was inserted because of a distrust of administrative refunds. \n12\n But section 611 contains no exception \n\n[282 U.S. 409, 424]\n\u00a0\n as to judicial proceedings, and its prohibition is one which can be enforced appropriately by the courts when the taxpayer demands relief by suit. We are brought back to the fundamental purpose of the statute, and we are unable to conclude that it established one rule for the Department and another for the courts. We think that it was intended to prevent refunds in the circumstances stated and not merely a particular wy o f getting the money from the Treasury; that the effect of the provision was to deny a right to recover the amount paid and that the provision governs equally wherever the right is asserted.\n In this view, it is not material whether the suit was brought by the taxpayer before or after section 611 was enacted. The validity of the statute with respect to its effect upon existing causes of action is a distinct question. So far as the construction of the statute is concerned, it is apparent that the mere pendency of the suit was not made a criterion of the right to recover. Nor is there any warrant for making a distinction in this respect between suits which had been brought against the collector individually and those pending against the United States.\n There is also a contention that section 611 does not apply when the tax was paid by the credit of the amount of an overpayment for another taxable year. But the application of a credit against an assessment at a time when collection was barred must be regarded as an erroneous collection, and we see no reason for taking such a case out of the statute.\n Second. As to the question of repeal: It is insisted that section 611 was repealed on the same day that it was enacted. This effect is ascribed to section 3 of the Act of May 29, 1928, c. 901, 45 Stat. 986, 996 (26 USCA  149). That section amended section 3220 of the Revised Statutes which contained provisions as to the refunding of taxes erroneously or illegally collected. Section 3220 had been amended \n\n[282 U.S. 409, 425]\n\u00a0\n by section 1111 of the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 115) so as to except the cases provided for in sections 284 and 319 of the latter Act (26 USCA  1065, 1120) which placed limitations on credits and refunds. Section 619(b) of the Revenue Act of 1928 (45 Stat. 878) amended section 3220 by striking out this exception and inserting in lieu thereof 'except as otherwise provided by law in the case of income, war-profits, excess- profits, estate and gift taxes.' The amendment made by section 3 of chapter 901, Act of May 29, 1928 (45 Stat. 996 (26 USCA  149)) omitted this exception, and hence, it is contended, repealed section 611 of the Revenue Act of 1928. The Revenue Act was approved May 29, 1928, 8 A. M. ( 45 Stat. 883 (26 USCA  2716)). The hour of the approval of chapter 901 of the same date does not appear. Section 3 of the latter Act does not expressly repeal section 611 of the Revenue Act of 1928, and the question is whether there is repeal by implication. The familiar principle that repeal will not be implied unless there is a positive repugnancy between the provisions of the new law and those of the old, has most appropriate application, as stated by Mr. Justice Story, to the interpretation of laws for the collection of revenue (Wood v. United States, 16 Pet. 342, 363), and the presumption against such an intention to repeal is strongest when the two acts are passed not only at the same session but on the same day. Beals v. Hale, 4 How. 37, 53; Rodgers v. United States, \n185 \nU.S. 83, 89\n, 22 S. Ct. 582. 13 In the present instance, there is no irreconcilable \n\n[282 U.S. 409, 426]\n\u00a0\n conflict between the two provisions. Section 611 established a special rule for a particular situation in order to embody a policy deliberately adopted by the Congress, and there is no ground for concluding that contemporaneously with that enactment the policy was abandoned and the enactment repealed. Rodgers v. United States, supra; Washington v. Miller, \n235 \nU.S. 422, 428\n, 35 S. Ct. 119.\n Third. As to the validity of section 611. This is not a case of an attempt retroactively to create a liability in relation to a transaction as to which no liability had previously attached. \n14\n There is no question here as to the original liability of the taxpayers. The tax was a valid one, and the fact that the taxpayers had been indebted to the Government for the amount which was subsequently collected is not now open to dispute. Delay in collection had followed upon the taxpayers' request for a consideration of their claim that the tax should be abated, and, in the mistaken belief on the part of the administrative authorities that the statute of limitations did not bar collection by the appropriate proceeding of distraint, the delay had been continued until after the statute had run. On the discovery of the mistake, as pointed out by the decision of this Court, the Congress sought to prevent a refund of the amount thus collected. The question is whether these circumstances remove the case from the operation of the general rule that it is not consistent with due process to take away from a private party a right to recover the amount that is due when the act is passed. Pacific Mail Steamship Co. v. Joliffe, 2 Wall. 450, 457, 458; Ettor v. Tacoma, \n228 \nU.S. 148, 156\n, 33 S. Ct. 428; Forbes Pioneer Boat Line v. Board of Commissioners, \n258 \nU.S. 338, 340\n, 42 S. Ct. 325. \n\n[282 U.S. 409, 427]\n\u00a0\n This rule is well illustrated by the case of Forbes Pioneer Boat Line v. Board of Commissioners, supra, where the suit was brought to recover tolls unlawfully collected for passage through the lock of a State canal. The passage was free under the law as it stood at the time, and the subsequent legislation of the State which attempted to validate the illegal collection was held to be in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court said that the legislature in 1919 could not compel plaintiff to pay for a passage made in 1917 without promise of reward 'any more effectively than it could have made a man pay a baker for a gratuitous deposit of rolls.' But while the legislature could not in such a case retroactively create a liability, the court recognized that there is a class of cases in which defects in the administration of the law may be cured by subsequent legislation without encroaching upon constitutional right, although existing causes of action may thus be defeated.\n In United States v. Heinszen & Co., \n206 \nU.S. 370\n, 27 S. Ct. 742, 11 Ann. Cas. 688, it appeared that after the Philippine Islands had come under the military control of the United States, the President had issued an order establishing a system of tariff duties which were levied on goods coming into the Islands whether from the United States or other countries. The tariff was in force when the treaty of peace was ratified and was subsequently continued, with modifications. The President, as commander-in-chief, had authority to impose tariff duties prior to the ratification of the treaty, but not thereafter. \n15\n Accordingly, those who had been compelled to pay such duties after the ratification, and before the Congress established the tariff, were entitled to recover the amounts paid. \n16\n Subsequently, the Con- \n\n[282 U.S. 409, 428]\n\u00a0\n gress passed an act purporting to ratify and confirm the collection of such duties. This Court upheld the statute, as against the claim under the Fifth Amendment, stating that the contention ignored the fact that when the goods were brought into the Philippine Islands, there was a tariff in existence under which duties were exacted in the name of the United States, and that Congress had power to ratify the collection. With respect to the effect of the act of Congress upon existing causes of action, the Court observed (Id. page 387 of 206 U. S., 27 S. Ct. 742, 747) that 'the mere commencement of the suit did not change the nature of the right' or 'operate to deprive government of the power to enact curative statutes which, if the actions had not been brought, would have been unquestionably valid.'\n Another illustration is found in Chuoco Tiaco v. Forbes, \n228 \nU.S. 549\n, 33 S. Ct. 585, 586. Suits had been brought to make the Governor General of the Philippine Islands personally answerable in damages for the deportation of a Chinese person resident in the Philippines, and after the bringing of the suit the Philippine legislature had passed an act purporting to ratify the Governor General's action. Referring to the doubt that naturally would occur whether, if a right of action had vested previously, it could be taken away by such a statute, the court said that 'it generally is recognized that in cases like the present, where the act originally purports to be done in the name and by the authority of the state, a defect in that authority may be cured by the subsequent adoption of the act.'\n The doctrine of the Heinszen Case, supra, was left unquestioned in MacLeod V. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 416, 434\n, 435 S., 33 S. Ct. 955 (where the application of the Act of Congress with respect to Philippine duties was limited so as to carry out its true intent) and was definitely applied in the case of Rafferty v. Smith, Bell & Co., Limited, \n257 \nU.S. 226, 232\n, 42 S. Ct. 71. Taxes on the value of exports from the Philippine Islands had been collected under a Philip- \n\n[282 U.S. 409, 429]\n\u00a0\n pine act while duties on such exports were forbidden by an act of Congress. The taxpayers had recovered judgments for restitution in March, 1920. The Congress, by Act of June 5, 1920 (c. 253, 41 Stat. 1015, 1025), confirmed the collections. The Court held that the enactment was within the power of Congress, and the fact that the taxpayers had recovered judgments for the amounts collected gave them no higher rights than those possessed by the taxpayers in the Heinszen Case. See also, Charlotte Harbor & Northern Railway Co. v. Welles, \n260 \nU.S. 8, 11\n, 12 S., 43 S. Ct. 3, 4; Hodges v. Snyder, \n261 \nU.S. 600, 603\n, 604 S., 43 S. Ct. 435. In Forbes Pioneer Boat Line v. Board of Commissioners, supra, the Heinszen and Rafferty Cases were invoked without success; the court expressed the view that 'a tax may be imposed in respect of past benefits' and that in those cases the principle of ratification was not necessarily involved, citing Wagner v. Leser, \n239 U.S. 20\n, 2 16, 217, 36 S. Ct. 66, and Stockdale v. Atlantic Insurance Co., 20 Wall. 323.\n It is apparent, as the result of the decisions, that a distinction is made between a bare attempt of the legislature retroactively to create liabilities for transactions which, fully consummated in the past, are deemed to leave no ground for legislative intervention, and the case of a curative statute aptly designed to remedy mistakes and defects in the administration of government where the remedy can be applied without injustice. Where the asserted vested right, not being linked to any substantial equity, arises from the mistake of officers purporting to administer the law in the name of the Government, the legislature is not prevented from curing the defect in administration simply because the effect may be to destroy causes of action which would otherwise exist. \n17\n 'The \n\n[282 U.S. 409, 430]\n\u00a0\n power is necessary that government may not be defeated by omissions or inaccuracies in the exercise of functions necessary to its administration.' Charlotte Harbor & Northern Railway Co. v. Welles, supra. This principle covers the present case. The petitioners had been indebted to the Government for the amount which was subsequently collected. They had asked for a review of the assessment and collection was postponed. The Treasury Department had mistakenly assumed that the statute of limitations did not apply to distraint proceedings and before the mistake was discovered the period of limitation had expired. The Congress could correct this defect in administration without violating any substantial equity, and this was accomplished by section 611 of the Revenue Act of 1928 (26 USCA  2611).\n Having reached this conclusion, it is not necessary to consider the authority of the Congress to withdraw the consent of the United States to be sued. See United States v. Heinszen & Co., supra, at page 391 of 206 U. S., 27 S. Ct. 742. The argument of the Government in this respect is not adequate to dispose of the controversy. Some of the present suits were brought against the collector individually and were based upon the right to recover as against him by reason of his illegal acts. Such an action is personal and not against the United States. Sage v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 33, 37\n, 39 S. Ct. 415; Smietanka v. Indiana Steel Co., \n\n[282 U.S. 409, 431]\n\u00a0\n \n257 \nU.S. 1, 4\n, 5 S., 42 S. Ct. 1.18 If the Congress did not have the authority to deal by a curative statute with the taxpayers' asserted substantive right, in the circumstances described, it could not be concluded that the Congress could accomplish the same result by denying to the taxpayers all remedy both as against the United States and also as against the one who committed the wrong. See Brinkerhoff-Faris Trust & Savings Co. v. Hill, \n281 \nU.S. 673, 679\n, 680 S., 50 S. Ct. 451.\n The objection to section 611 upon the ground that it is arbitrary and capricious in its classification, and hence offends the Fifth Amendment, is without merit. The broad discretion of the Congress in the exercise of its constitutional power as to taxation (Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railway Co., \n240 U.S. 1\n, 24-26, 36 S. Ct. 236, L. R. A. 1917D, 414, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713; Evans v. Gore, \n253 \nU.S. 245, 256\n, 40 S. Ct. 550, 11 A. L. R. 519; Barclay & Co. v. Edwards, \n267 \nU.S. 442, 450\n, 45 S. Ct. 135, 348) necessarily extends to the whole field \n\n[282 U.S. 409, 432]\n\u00a0\n of supervision and control of the processes of enforcement. It cannot be deemed to be unreasonable that the Congress in the present instance provided for cases in which a claim in abatement had been filed and the collection stayed. In its selection the Congress dealt with an appropriate class and was not bound to include others. Nor is the statute rendered invalid by the provision as to payments made within a year after its enactment. As already stated, the Treasury Department did not construe section 611 as authorizing collections in the future, after the expiration of the period of limitation;19 and if the Congress saw fit to make the statute applicable to future voluntary payments, it was clearly entitled to fix a limit of time within which it might be so applied.\n In some of the cases under review, it is insisted that section 611 does not preclude the recovery of interest, upon the ground that the interest had not been assessed and therefore lay outside the prohibition of the statute. But it does not appear that there was any statutory requirement that interest as such should be assessed, and the valid denial of the right to recover the principal should be deemed to apply also to the interest.\n Judgments affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] These sections are as follows:\n'Sec. 607.

Ct. 471. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Section 611 as it appeared in the bill introduced in the House of Representatives provided not only for the retention of the moneys paid, but also that, in similar circumstances, amounts not yet paid might be collected within a year after the new enactment. The Committee on Ways and Means in its report on the bill stated: 'Sec. 611. Collections in Cases in which Claims in Abatement were filed. Prior to the enctm ent of the Revenue Act of 1924 it was the administrative practice to assess immediately additional taxes determined to be due. Upon the assessment, taxpayers were frequently permitted to file claims in abatement with the collector and thus delay the collection until the claim in abatement could be acted upon. If this practice had not been followed, undue hardship undoubtedly would have been imposed upon the taxpayer. It was supposed that there was no limitation upon the collection by distraint of the amount ultimately determined to be due. However, the Supreme Court has recently held in a case in which the period for assessment expired prior to the enactment of the 1924 Act, that the period for collection was limited to five years from the date on which the return was filed. Decisions upon claims in abatement are being made every day. Amounts have been paid, are being paid, by the taxpayer even though the statute of limitations may have run. Exceptionally large amounts are involved. Accordingly, it is of utmost importance to provide that the payments already made should not be refunded. In order to prevent inequality, it is also provided that the amounts not yet paid may be collected within a year after the enactment of the new Act. Your Committee appreciates the fact that this provision will probably be subjected to severe criticism by some of the taxpayers affected. However, it must be borne in mind that the provision authorizes the retention and collection only of amounts properly due, and merely withdraws the defense of the statute of limitations. If it is determined that the amount paid is in excess of the proper tax liability, computed without regard to the statute of limitations, such excess will constitute an overpayment which may be refunded or credited as in the case of any other overpayment.' (70th Cong., 1st Sess., H. R. Rep. No. 2, p. 34.)\n The Finance Committee of the Senate opposed the provision of section 611 (70th Cong., 1st Sess., Sen. Rep. 960, p. 42). In conference, an amendment was adopted (70th Cong., 1st Sess., H. R. Rep. No. 1882, pp. 6, 7, 22, 23), with the result that section 611 was enacted in its present form, that is, with the provision eliminated as to the collection of amounts not yet paid. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Mimeograph 3360, July 27, 1928; Cumulative Bulletin VII-2, pp. 82, 85. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See also Act of October 3, 1917, c. 63,  205(b), 40 Stat. 305; Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234,  279(a), 43 Stat. 300 (26 USCA  1063 note); Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27,  279(f), 44 Stat. 60, 26 USCA  1051(f); Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, sec. 273(f)(g)(h), 45 Stat. 855, 26 USCA  2273(f, g, h). \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Rev.

But after an Act of Congress had required collectors to pay over such monies, it was held, against the dissent of Mr. Justice Story, that the personal liability was gone. Cary v. Curtis, 3 How. 236. Later statutes however recognize suits against collectors in such cases, and the plaintiff contends that they should be construed to create a new statutory liability attached to the office and passing to successors, as was held in this case, the formal defendant being saved from harm by the United States. This however is not the language of the statutes and hardly can be reconciled with the decision of this Court in Sage v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 33\n, 39 S.

C., for appellant.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Graniteville Manufacturing Company, a corporation of South Carolina, brought this suit in the District Court of the United States to restrain the collection of certain stamp taxes imposed upon its promissory notes under Act No. 574, p. 1089, of the Acts of 1928 of that State. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[283 U.S. 376, 378]\n\u00a0\n A motion for an interlocutory injunction was heard by three judges, as required by section 266 of the Judicial Code (U. S. C., tit. 28,  380 (28 USCA  380)). Holding that the plaintiff had no adequate remedy at law, the court granted an injunction with respect to notes made outside the state, but denied relief as to notes which were signed within the state. 44 F.(2d) 64.\n There is no controversy as to the facts, which were stipulated and found by the court substantially as follows:\n'These notes were executed at various times from July 24, 1923, to March 12, 1930. The notes were all payable to banks, at their banking houses, respectively, outside of South Carolina; none of them being located or doing any business within that state. The custom and practice between the plaintiff and each of the banks was that in each instance, at the office of the bank, a line of credit was first established; that is, an agreement was made that the plaintiff's borrowing from the bank should never exceed a certain amount, each specific loan to be made thereafter being subject to acceptance by the bank. When a loan was desired, the bank having been notified that a loan would be desired at a certain date and an inquiry having been made of it as to the then existing discount rate, the note would be signed by the president or other executive officer of the plaintiff, and forwarded to the bank by mail. The note was subject to withdrawal and revocation by the plaintiff until it was actually received and accepted by the bank and the proceeds actually placed to the credit of the plaintiff in the bank. ... Payment of the note \n\n[283 U.S. 376, 379]\n\u00a0\n was made to the bank at its banking house by the plaintiff sending checks from its office at Graniteville upon other banks; and when the note was paid, it was marked paid, or canceled, and returned to the plaintiff at Graniteville, S. C., and there kept. ...\n\n'The foregoing facts apply to all of the notes; but with reference to the place where the notes were signed, they may be divided into two classes. Prior to December 1, 1924, the plaintiff's executive officers resided in Angusta, Ga., and all of its notes, up to that time, were signed by its executive officers in Augusta, Ga., and mailed from there to banks outside of South Carolina, and those notes were never in the state of South Carolina until after they were paid and returned to the plaintiff at its office at Graniteville, S. C. But after December 1, 1924, plaintiff's executive officers resided at Graniteville, S. C., and the notes executed subsequent to that time were signed by those officers at Graniteville, S. C., placed in the mail there for delivery to the bank outside of South Carolina, and, upon payment, were later returned to the plaintiff at Graniteville, S. C.'\n\n It is only as to the latter class of notes which were signed in South Carolina that the District Court upheld the tax. The tax as thus sustained is an excise tax, of a familiar sort, levied with respect to the creation of instruments within the state. So laid, the tax was not imposed upon property, or upon the transfer of property, situated beyond the jurisdiction of the state as was found to be the case in Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194\n, 26 S. Ct. 36, 4 Ann. Cas. 493; Frick v. Pennsylvania. \n268 \nU.S. 473\n, 45 S. Ct. 603, 42 A. L. R. 316; Farmers Loan & Trust Co. v.

CO. v. DELMAR CO.(1931)\nNo. 563\nArgued: Decided: May 25, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 686, 687]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. R. J. Hagman and F. G. Dorety, both the St. Paul, Minn., for petitioner.\n Mr. Fred W. Putnam, of Minneapolis, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Interstate Commerce Commission awarded Delmar Company reparation against the Great Northern Railway Company for certain charges made on shipments of grain. \n1\n Suit was brought on the award and judgment rendered against the railway by the District Court, 34 F.(2d) 221. On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, that judgment was affirmed. \n2\n This Court granted certiorari. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n The pertinent facts are that numerous shipments of grain originated at points on the line of the railway in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota. They were originally billed to Minneapolis. After arrival there, they were reconsigned by the Delmar Company, in the same cars, to Superior, Wis. where delivery was made. The entire movement from the points of origin to Supe- \n\n[283 U.S. 686, 688]\n\u00a0\n rior was over the rails of the Great Northern. The shorter route from the places of shipment to Superior is via Willmar. The longer, which the cars in question traveled, via Minneapolis, involvespass age through the congested railroad terminals in that city, with incident traffic difficulties and delays not encountered on the more direct one. The difference between the two in mileage from the shipping points to Superior varies by from 12 to 23 per cent. The carrier collected its local rates from origin points to Minneapolis, plus a proportional rate of 6.5 cents beyond. The combinations of rates so exacted were higher than the through rates specified in the tariffs for the transportation of grain from these points to Superior.\n The Commission found that it had previously been the custom to apply the through rate only upon shipments via the direct route, and to apply the proportional rate beyond Minneapolis to such as were reconsigned at that point. The advantage to the Delmar Company of originally consigning to that city and reconsigning to Superior is that the former is a grain market, and the grain may be sold en route and delivered at Minneapolis pursuant to such sale, or reconsigned if not sold on its arrival.\n It is conceded that the shipper had the right of reconsignment without additional charge for that priviledge, and that the situation is the same as if the shipments had originally been billed to Superior via Minneapolis.\n The Commission sustained the contention of the Delmar Company that the quoted through rates from points of origin to Superior applied to shipments routed via Minneapolis, since the tariff did not expressly restrict their application to the shorter and more direct route via Willmar. This finding was the basis of the award of reparation.\n The railway maintains that in the circumstances here presented the tariff may not be so construed as to render the specified through rate applicable to shipments by way of Minneapolis. This would be contrary to established \n\n[283 U.S. 686, 689]\n\u00a0\n custom, and would occasion violation of the long and short haul clause of the Interstate Commerce Act.\n The Commission has repeatedly decided that, where two or more routes are 'open,' which means that in the judgment of the Commission none of them is unreasonably circuitous, the shipper has the option as to route, at the quoted rate, in the absence of a contrary statement in the tariff. Van Dusen Harrington Co. v. C., M. & St. P. Ry. Co., 47 I. C. C. 59; Meeds L. Co. v. Director General, 59 I. C. C. 243; Freeman Grain Co. v. Director General 68 I. C. C. 559; Baker-Reid L. Co. v.

Here the difference is, in no instance, more than 23 per cent. It is claimed that the longer route is more burdensome, due to congestion at Minneapolis, but there is no definite evidence and no finding on this point. We cannot say that there was error in the Commission's conclusion that the longer route was not unreasonably circuitous.\n It is undisputed that there are destinations on the railway's line between Minneapolis and Superior as to which the rate from the points of origin, consisting of the local rate to Minneapolis plus the proportional rate beyond that city, is greater than the quoted through rate from such points to Superior. Consequently, if shipments should be made to Superior via Minneapolis at the through rate, they will be carried for less than would be charged for similar shipments to these intermediate destinations. The railway insists that this would result in violations of section 4 of the Interstate Commerce Act. \n4\n That section is in part: \n\n[283 U.S. 686, 690]\n\u00a0\n 'It shall be unlawful for any common carrier ... to charge or receive any greater compensation in the aggregate for the transportation ... of like kind of property, for a shorter than for a longer distance over the same line or route in the sam dir ection, the shorter being included within the longer distance, or to charge any greater compensation as a through rate than the aggregate of the intermediate rates subject to the provisions of this chapter, but this shall not be construed as authorizing any common carrier within the terms of this chapter to charge or receive as great compensation for a shorter as for a longer distance. ...'\n The Commission decided that, while the facts recited would render the railway liable for the penalties prescribed by the act, the tariff rate must be applied. The Circuit Court of Appeals (43 F.(2d) 780, 782), under what we think was a misapprehension of the facts, held to violation of section 4 would result. It said:\n'That section applies to 'the same line or route in the same direction, the shorter being included within the longer distance.' As to these shipments, the shorter haul is not included within the longer distance.'\n\n The quotation indicates a failure to note the fact that the comparison of rates is made between points which are all upon the longer of the two routes, and that the shorter distance on that line is included within the longer distance to Superior. The Commission filed a brief in this Court taking issue with the conclusion of the Court of Appeals on this feature of the case.\n The railway can transport the shipments over the shorter and customary route without violating section 4; but, if the tariff is construed to require it to take them over the longer route, it must violate that section and incur the resulting penalties. In this situation we think the tariff should be construed as applying only to the shorter route, and not as giving the shipper the option between the two \n\n[283 U.S. 686, 691]\n\u00a0\n routes at the through rate. This conclusion is in accord with the principle that, where two constructions of a written contract are possible, preference will be given to that which does not result in violation of law.

Bruce, both of Houston, Tex ., for petitioner.\n Mr. Thomas D. Thacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.

It set up that in those years it received income derived from the sale of oil and gas produced under leases to it by the state of Texas; that these leases were instrumentalities of the state for the development of its public domain; and that petitioner's income derived from them was constitutionally immune from the tax as one imposed by the federal government on an instrumentality of the state. The District Court gave judgment for petitioner, 38 F.(2d) 680, which the Circuit Court of Appeals for he F ifth Circuit reversed, holding that the immunity, if any, had been waived by the state by section 27 of chapter 83, Laws of 1917, which provided that rights acquired under leases, including the present ones, were to be 'subject to taxation as is other property.' 41 F.(2d) 483. This Court granted certiorari, \n282 \nU.S. 830\n, 51 S. Ct. 88, 75 L. Ed. -, November 24, 1930. \n\n[283 U.S. 279, 281]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner's leases relate to parts of the public domain of the state, set apart by the Legislature for the benefit of the state university, under a mandate of the state constitution of 1876, art. 7,  10-15, inclusive. See Texas Laws 1917, c. 83. In terms they 'grant and lease' for a period of ten years, with renewal privileges, the right to enter on designated lands for the purpose of 'drilling and operating' for petroleum and gas, and to erect and maintain all necessary structures for the production, transportation, and storage of petroleum and gas. The lessee or 'owner of the rights ... conveyed' is required to pay the state the value of one-eighth of the petroleum produced and of one-tenth of the gas sold. The challenged tax is measured by the net profits derived by petitioner from the sale of oil and gas produced, after making allowed deductions from gross receipts, including the royalties paid to the state.\n Section 12 of article 7 of the state Constitution, as interpreted by the highest court of the state, 'requires the Legislature to dispose of the University lands by sale only.' Theisen v. Robison, 117 Tex. 489, 502, 8 S.W. (2d) 646, 648. Leases of university lands like those of petitioner have been held by that court to be in compliance with this provision of the Constitution as present sales to the lessees, upon execution of the leases, of the oil and gas in place. Theisen v. Robison, supra. In so construing them, the court applied the settled rule of the state with respect to oil and gas leases. Texas Co. v. Daugherty, 107 Tex. 226, 176 S. W. 717, L. R.

Robison, supra, pages 510, 511 of 117 Tex., 8 S.W.(2d) 646, 652:\n'They (the leases) do not authorize the purchaser to take and use seven-eighths or any other mere fractional part of the oil or gas in the land leased. The purchaser instead buys all the oil and gas for a stipulated price, part \n\n[283 U.S. 279, 282]\n\u00a0\n of the price being measured by the value of a certain fraction of the produced oil and gas, which is a very different thing from the value of that fraction of the oil and gas in place. The leases convey all the oil and gas in granting the right to find, produce, and appropriate all of them, in consideration of the payment of stipulated sums and also the value of a stated fraction of the oil and gas produced.'\n\n Property sold or otherwise disposed of by the government, either state or national, in order to raise revenue for government purposes, is in a broad sense a government instrumentality, with respect to which neither the property itself before sale, nor its sale by one government, may be taxed by the other. But it does not follow that the same property in the hands of the buyer, or his use or enjoyment of it, or the income he derives from it, is also tax immune. City of New Brunswick v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 547\n, 48 S. Ct. 371; Forbes v. Gracey, \n94 U.S. 762\n; Tucker v. Ferguson, 22 Wall. 527; see Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 468; Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 547. Theoretically, any tax imposed on the buyer with respect to the purchased property may have some effect on the price, and thus remotely and indirectly affect the selling government. We may assume that, if the property is subject to tax after sale, the governmental seller will generally receive a less favorable price than if it were known in advance that the property in the hands of later owners, or evenof t he buyer alone, could not be taxed.\n But the remote and indirect effects upon the one government of such a nondiscriminatory tax by the other have never been considered adequate grounds for thus aiding the one at the expense of the taxing power of the other. See Willcuts v. Bunn, \n282 \nU.S. 216, 231\n, 51 S. Ct. 125; Educational Films Corporation v. Ward, \n282 \nU.S. 379\n, 51 S. Ct. 170, decided January 12, 1931; Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514, 523\n, 524 S., 46 S. Ct. 172. This Court has consistently held that, where property or any interest in it has \n\n[283 U.S. 279, 283]\n\u00a0\n completely passed from the government to the purchaser, he can claim no immunity from taxation with respect to it, merely because it was once government owned, or because the sale of it effected some government purpose.

Charleston, supra, page 468 of 2 Pet.\n Property which has thus passed from either the national or a state government to private ownership becomes a part of the common mass of property and subject to its common burdens. Denial to either government of the power to tax it, or income derived from it, is order to insure some remote and indirect antecedent benefit to the other, would be an encroachment on the sovereign power to tax, not justified by the implied constitutional restriction. See Weston v. Charleston, supra, page 468 of 2 Pet. The interest which passed to petitioner here, as defined by the laws of the state, is not distinguishable from the mining claims, acquired in lands of the United States under its statutes, which, together with minerals and ores derived from them, were held subject to state taxation in Forbes v.

U.S.(1931)\nNo. 141\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1931\n\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 753, 755]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Webster Ballinger, of Washington, D. C., and Overton G. Ellis, of Tacoma, Wash., for petitioners.\n Mr. Seth W. Richardson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These suits were brought in the District Court for the Western District of Washington to establish and enforce asserted rights to allotments, each of 80 acres, in the Quinaielt Indian Reservation in the southwestern part of that State. Authority for bringing the suits is found in the statute providing that any person who is 'in whole or in part of Indian blood or descent' and claims to be entitled to an allotment of land under any law of Congress may prosecute a suit against the United States to determine and give effect to such right. 1 The suits were heard together in the District Court, where decrees were given for the plaintiffs, and again in the Circuit Court of Appeals, where those decrees were reversed. \n2\n The cases are here on certiorari. \n282 \nU.S. 818\n, 51 S. Ct. 23, 75 L. Ed. -.\n The plaintiffs are all of Indian blood and descent, but none is a full-blood Indian. Some are members of the Chehalis, Chinook and Cowlitz Tribes, and the question is presented whether these tribes are among those whose members are entitled to allotments from lands within \n\n[283 U.S. 753, 756]\n\u00a0\n the Quinaielt Reservation. Many do not personally reside on the reservation, and we are asked to decide whether this defeats their claims. Some are the issue, either children or grandchildren, of a marriage between an Indian woman and a white man, and whether this is an obstacle to allowing their claims is a further question.\n In 1855 the Quinaielt, Quillehute (also called Quileute), Chehalis, Chinook and Cowlitz Indians were neighboring tribes in the southwesterly section of what is now the State of Washington. They were all known as 'fisheating Indians' and lived in small villages adjacent to the Pacific Coast and the lower reaches of the Columbia River. The Quits and Ozettes were also fish-eating tribes living in coast villages a little north of the others, the Ozettes being farther north than the Quits.\n During the early part of 1855 negotiations were had between a representative of the United States and representatives of the Quinaielt, Quillehute, Chehalis, Chinook, Cowlitz and Quit Tribes looking towards a cession by these tribes of much territory and their consolidation within a single reservation. These negotiations failed of their full purpose, but resulted in a treaty between the United States and the Quinaielts and Quillehutes which was signed on July 1, 1855, and January 25, 1856.3 By this treaty the Quinaielts and Quillehutes ceded a large district to the United States, and the latter engaged to reserve for their use and occupancy a tract 'sufficient for their wants,' to which when established they were to remove. There were also provisions in the treaty securing to the Indians the right of taking fish 'at all usual and accustomed grounds and stations,' in common with all citizens of that section, and of erecting temporary houses to be used in that connection; authorizing the President, at his discretion, to survey the whole or any \n\n[283 U.S. 753, 757]\n\u00a0\n part of the reserved lands and assign the same to such individuals or families 'as are willing to avail themselves of the privilege and will locate on the same as a permanent home'; and consenting that the President might 'consolidate' the Quinaielts and Quillehutes and 'other friendly tribes,' whenever in his opinion the public interest and the welfare of the Indians would be promoted b it. \n Under the treaty a reservation of about 10,000 acres at the mouth of the Quinaielt River was provisionally selected and its boundaries surveyed. Some years later the local superintendent reported that the reservation, by reason of being small and containing but a small amount of agricultural and pasture lands, had proved unattractive to the Indians; that the Chehalis, Chinook and other coastal tribes in southwestern Washington, like the Quinaielts and Quillehutes, who were parties to the treaty, were all 'emphatically fish-eaters,' drawing their subsistence almost wholly from the water, and that all of these fish-eating tribes should be collected on a single reservation, including suitable fisheries. To that end he recommended that the existing reservation be greatly enlarged and designated the territory which he believed should be included in it. This recommendation led to an order of November 4, 1873, by the President, the material parts of which are as follows:4\n'In accordance with the provisions of the treaty with the Quinaielt and Quillehute Indians, concluded July 1, 1855, and January 25, 1856, and to provide for other Indians in that locality, it is hereby ordered that the following tract of country in Washington Territory ... be withdrawn from sale and set apart for the use of the Quinaielt, Quillehute, Hoh, Quit, and other tribes of fish-eating Indians on the Pacific Coast. ...' \n\n[283 U.S. 753, 758]\n\u00a0\n This enlarged reservation contained about 200,000 acres and included the prior provisional reservation of 10,000 acres.\n\n By an Act of March 4, 1911,5 Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior to make allotments on the Quinaielt Reservation under the provisions of the allotment laws 'to all members of the Hoh, Quileute, Ozette or other tribes of Indians in Washington who are affiliated with the Quinaielt and Quileute Tribes in the treaty (before named) and who may elect to take allotments on the Quinaielt Reservation rather than on the reservations set aside for these tribes.' This direction was followed by a proviso declaring, 'The allotments authorized herein shall be made from the surplus lands of the Quinaielt Reservation after the allotments to the Indians thereon have been completed.' The reference to 'other reservations' may be sufficiently explained by stating that some small reservations6 had been set aside theretofore for particular villages of the Hoh, Quileute, Ozette, Quit, Chehalis and other fish-eating tribes, but that these reservations were in some instances limited to 640 acres and were in no instance large enough to provide allotments to more than a small fraction of the Indians thereon.\n When the bill which became the Act of March 4, 1911, was introduced in Congress it contained a direction that allotments be made to 'all members of the Hoh, Quileute and Ozette tribes of Indians in Washington who may elect,' etc., and said nothing about other tribes; but in the course of its passage this provision was amended so as to read: 'to all members of the Hoh, Quileute, 7 Ozette or other tribes of Indians in Washington who are \n\n[283 U.S. 753, 759]\n\u00a0\n affiliated with the Quinaielt and Quileute7 Tribes in the treaty (before named) and who may elect,' etc. This shows that Congress intended to include tribes not included in the original provision; and it shows further that they were to be tribes having, like the Hoh and Ozette tribes, some affiliation with the Quinaielt and Quileute Tribes 'in the treaty.' Probably 'in' was used in the sense of 'under' or 'through.' Strictly speaking there was no affiliation in the treaty. But the treaty did contain a provision under which affiliation might be brought about. It authorized the President to consolidate the Quinaielt and Quileute Tribes with other friendly tribes. Under this provision he made the orer e stablishing the enlarged reservation for the use, not only of the Quinaielt and Quileute Tribes, but also of the Hoh, Quit and other coastal tribes of fish-eating Indians 'in that locality,' evidently meaning in that section of the Territory of Washington.\n That was a step towards consolidation. Other steps followed, one being that in 1905 the Indian Bureau began making allotments to members of all of these tribes. This work was carried on under the treaty, the executive order and the general allotment law, and it had progressed prior to the Act of 1911 to the point where over 750 allotments had been completed, more than half of which were to members of the various fish- eating tribes in that section other than the Quinaielt and Quillehute. It therefore was altogether appropriate at that time to speak of these other tribes as affiliated with the Quinaielt and Quillehute under the treaty.\n The action of the administrative officers under the Act of 1911 has been almost uniformly in accord with the view just stated. In 1913 a bill was introduced in Congress to amend the Act of 1911 by specifically including the Cowlitz and some other fish-eating tribes in southwestern Washington not before named in the act; and in a letter \n\n[283 U.S. 753, 760]\n\u00a0\n responding to an inquiry about the need for the bill the Indian Bureau said: 'It is believed that the Indians referred to in the pending bill may be allotted on the Quinaielt Reservation and that further legislation is unnecessary.' The Solicitor for the Department of the Interior so construed the treaty, executive order and Act of 1911 in an opinion rendered to the Secretary of the Interior, and that opinion was accepted as a guide in making further allotments. Possibly it was not followed when the administrative officers were dealing with the applications of the plaintiffs in these suits. As to that we are not advised. The record contains a stipulation showing that the applications were rejected but not disclosing the grounds of that ruling.\n Our conclusion on the first question presented is that the Chehalis, Chinook and Cowlitz Tribes are among those whose members are entitled to take allotments within the Quinaielt Reservation, if without allotments elsewhere. The Circuit Court of Appeals held otherwise in some of the suits and in this we think it erred.\n The Act of 1911 does not purport to make the right to an allotment dependent on a personal residence on the reservation. It is a special act relating only to this reservation. The land within the reservation is generally covered with a heavy growth of timber and is difficult of clearing. As a rule the Indians are poor and would be without means of supporting themselves while attempting to clear the land. The treaty secures to them the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed grounds. Most of them are fishermen, but a few find employment in lumber camps. Most of them have for many years resided in small villages outside the reservation. Some of the villages are within small reservations made by executive orders; but the majority of the Indians have always lived outside any reservation. When the Act of 1911 was passed more than 750 had been given allot- \n\n[283 U.S. 753, 761]\n\u00a0\n ments. Of these not more than 1 out of 5 had over resided on the reservation. It is probable that Congress was advised of the situation of these Indians when the special act was passed and carefully refrained from placing anything in the act indicative of a purpose to make personal residence on the reservation an element of the right to an allotment.\n These Indians are not the usual reservation Indians. They never were placed on the reservation or required to live within its limits. Their situation is quite like that of the Walla Walla Tribe which at one time engaged the attention of this Court. \n8\n A special act directed the allotment of the lands of that tribe. In its title the act was described as providing for allotments to the Indians 'residing upon' he r eservation, and in its first sentence there was a direction that allotments be made to members of the tribe 'residing upon' the reservation. After stating the situation to which the act was to be applied this Court said:\n'When such a large percentage of allottees upon this reservation resided, as did the appellee, elsewhere than actually upon the reservation at the date of the passage of the act of 1885, it cannot be that the act passed was intended to limit the right to an allotment to those actually residing on the reservation, to the exclusion of a majority of the members of the different bands or tribes. The fact of such nonresidence is presumed to have been known by Congress, and the act should be construed with reference to that knowledge. ... The purpose of the act would fall very far short of accomplishment were the allotments confined exclusively to those actually residing within the limits of the reservation.'\n\n While the Act of 1911 provides that the allotments shall be made under the 'allotment laws of the United \n\n[283 U.S. 753, 762]\n\u00a0\n States,' we think this provision hardly could have been intended to make any provision in those laws requiring residence applicable to the situation we have described. The Act of 1911 is not merely silent respecting residence; it directs that allotments be made to 'all members' of the tribes designated who elect to take allotments upon the Quinaielt Reservation rather than on 'the reservations set aside for these tribes.' These words are indicative of a purpose to exclude a residential requirement.\n The record shows that the officers administering the act did not confine the allotments to Indians actually residing on this reservation or one of the small ones, and also that they informed applicants that residence was not required. Counsel for the government admit that such has been the practice, and they set forth in their brief a letter of June 13, 1930, from the Secretary of the Interior to the Attorney General reading as follows:\n'The matter of residence upon the reservation was not insisted upon as a prerequisite to allotment, either before or after the passage of the Act of March 4, 1911 (36 Stat. L., 1345) so far as the Quinaielt and other Indians mentioned in the Act or those who were affiliated with the Quinaielt in the Treaty of 1855 and 1856 are concerned. A number of allotments have been made to those who have resided away from the reservation.'\n\n These considerations require, as we think, that personal residence on the reservation be held not essential under the Act of 1911 to the right to an allotment. The Circuit Court of Appeals took and applied the opposite view and in this we think it erred.\n We come then to the question respecting the status of the issue, either children or grandchildren, of a marriage between an Indian woman and a white man.\n The rule is general that, in the absence of provision to the contrary, the right of individual Indians to share \n\n[283 U.S. 753, 763]\n\u00a0\n in tribal property, whether lands or funds, depends on tribal membership and is terminated when the membership is ended. \n9\n Under the operation of this rule an Indian woman loses her tribal membership where she marries a white man, separates from the tribe and lives with him among white people. But it is the separation from the tribe rather than the marriage which puts an end to the membership. The marriage usually serves to explain the separation and illustrate that it is intentional and permanent. But where the woman remains in the tribal environment and continues the tribal affiliation the membership is not affected. If the husband be a citizen of the United States, the woman by the marriage becomes also a citizen, 10 but there is no incompatibility between tribal membership and United States citizenship.\n The children of a marriage between an Indian woman and a white man usually take the status of the father; but if the wife retains her tribal membership and the children are born in the tribal environment and these reared by her, with the husband failing to discharge his duties to them, they take the status of the mother.\n Whether grandchildren of such a marriage have tribal membership or otherwise depends on the status of the father or mother as the case may be, and not on that of a grandparent.\n As to marriages occurring before June 7, 1897 (as the marriages here did), between a white man and an Indian woman, who was Indian by blood rather than by adoption-and who on June 7, 1897, or at the time of her death, was recognized by the tribe-the children have \n\n[283 U.S. 753, 764]\n\u00a0\n the same right to share in the division or distribution of the property of the tribe of the mother as any other member of the tribe, but this is in virtue of the Act of June 7, 1897.11\n So far as can be determined from the record the District Court rightly applied the rules stated in this opinion. The record does not purport to contain, and evidently does not contain, all the evidence that was produced on the hearing. The statement of it was prepared by counsel for the Government and the certificate is that the statement contains 'all the evidence essential to the decision of the questions presented by the appeal of the defendant.' The assignment of errors, which was then before the District Court, does not challenge the decision of any question of fact, but only rulings on questions of law. It is thus rather plain that the statement of evidence contains only so much of the evidence as was deemed essential to the decision of the latter. We now are asked to consider questions not raised by the assignment of errors and which cannot be properly decided without appropriate assurance that the record contains all the evidence that is material to their decision. We must decline to consider them.\n Decrees of Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.\n Decrees of District Court affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act Feb. 6, 1901, c. 217, 31 Stat. 700 (25 USCA  345, 346). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] U. .s. v.

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue held \n\n[284 U.S. 136, 138]\n\u00a0\n them not affiliated, rejected petitioner's claim for abatement for 1918, and asserted a deficiency for 1919. The Board of Tax Appeals approved the Commissioner's determination (17 B. T. A. 980), and upon petition for review the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 47 F.(2d) 184. That decision being in conflict with decisions in other Circuit Courts of Appeals,1 this Court granted certiorari. \n283 \nU.S. 813\n, 51 S. Ct. 353\n\n\n The pertinent provisions of the section follow (40 Stat. 1081):\n'Sec. 240. (a) That corporations which are affiliated within the meaning of this section shall, under regulations to be prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary, make a consolidated return of net income and invested capital for the purposes of this title (Title II) and Title III, and the taxes thereunder shall be computed and determined upon the basis of such return: ...\n\n'(b) For the purpose of this section two or more domestic corporations shall be deemed to be affiliated ... (2) if substantially all the stock of two or more corporations is owned or controlled by the same interests.'\n\n Petitioner carried on the business of dealing in gold and silver bullion and specie and furnishing to silversmiths silver rolled into sheets or coils. In 1916 its officers caused Hamilton & De Loss, Inc., to be organized, to erect a factory and to take over the work of its stamping depart- \n\n[284 U.S. 136, 139]\n\u00a0\n ment. During the taxable periods six men owned 93.71 per cent. of the stock of petitioner. The same men owned over 75 per cent. of the stock of Hamilton & De Loss, Inc. Hamilton did not own or control any of the stock of petitioner. Twenty per cent. of the stock of the new company was issued to him and he became its president. He gave to a bank his notes indorsed by De Loss to obtain money to pay for the stock. Before the beginning of 1918 he executed an irrevocable stock power to one Higgins, and the latter, by like instrument, assigned the stock to De Loss who deposited it with the bank as collateral security for the payment of Hamilton's notes. Hamilton failed to pay, and February 1, 1919, after the expiration of the tax periods, De Loss paid the notes and took over the stock.\n Prior to that time Hamilton attended all the stockholders' meetings but never voted in opposition to the owners of the majority stock of both corporations. Hamilton & De Loss, Inc., paid him a salary at the rate of $ 10,000 per year, but the other officers of that corporation, being officers, directors, or employees of the petitioner, received their compensation from the latter although a large part of their time was devoted to the business of the former. During the taxable periods the corporations were operated as a business unit, and Hamilton & De Loss, Inc ., sustained a net loss.\n It may be assumed that the pledge as collateral was also to protect De Loss as indorser. But it does not appear that as between him and Hamilton he was entitled to control voting power or to have the stock transferred to him of record or to have any use or benefit therefrom unless and until required to pay the notes. It was not held by or for him. The losses sustained by Hamilton & De Loss, Inc., did not, in respect of that stock, directly or indirectly result to his disadvantage. The section requires control of substantially all of the stock; control of \n\n[284 U.S. 136, 140]\n\u00a0\n the corporations is not enough. \n2\n The carrying on of a business unit by two or more corporations does not in itself constitute affiliation. The shares of Hamilton & De Loss, Inc., owned by the six shareholders did not constitute substantially all of its stock. \n3\n We assume in favor of petitioner that they, through their power over Hamilton's official position and salary, their ability to dominate both corporations or by other means, were in position effectually to influence him in respect of the voting, use, or disposition of the stock issued to him, and thus as a practical matter to exert a kind of control called by counsel 'actual' to distinguish it from a legally enforceable control.\n The purpose of section 240 was, by means of consolidated returns, to require taxes to be levied according to the true net income and invested capital resulting from and employed in a single business enterprise even though it was conducted by means of more than one corporation. Subsection ( b) clearly reflects the intention, by means of such returns, to secure substantial equality as between shareholders who ultimately bear the burden. That intention is shown by the legislative history and was given effect by the regulations contemporaneously promulgated. \n4\n It re- \n\n[284 U.S. 136, 141]\n\u00a0\n quires no discussion to show that such returns will not make against inequality or evasion unless the same interests are the beneficial owners in like proportions of substantially all of the stock of each of such corporations. Alameda Investment Co. v. McLaughlin (D. C.) 28 F.(2d) 81; Montana Mercantile Co. v. Rasmusson (D. C.) 28 F.(2d) 916; Commissioner v. Adolph Hirsch & Co. (C. C. A.) 30 F.(2d) 645, 646; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. City Button Works (C. C. A.) 49 F.(2d) 705. Affiliation on any other basis would not make against inequality or evasion. It would require very plain language to show that Congress intended to permit consolidated returns to depend on a basis so indefinite and uncertain as control of stock without title, beneficial ownership or legal means to enforce it. Control resting solely on acquiescence, the exigencies of business or other considerations having no binding force is not sufficient to satisfy the statute.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Ice Service Co. v.

MAXWELL(1931)\nNo. 334\nArgued: March 18, 1931Decided: April 13, 1931\n\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 123, 124]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Louis H. Porter and F. Carroll Taylor, both of New York City, for appellant. \n\n[283 U.S. 123, 125]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Dennis G. Brummitt, of Raleigh, N. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, Hans Rees' Sons, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of New York, began this action by an application to the commissioner of revenue of the state of North Carolina for the readjustment of the income tax assessed against the appellant by that state. The assessment was for the years 1923, 1924, 1925, and 1926, in accordance with the applicable state laws,1 and the controversy related to the proper allocation of income to the state of North Carolina. The commissioner of revenue made his findings of fact and conclusions of law, the appellant's exceptions were overruled, and the prayer for revision of the taxes was disallowed. Appeal, waiving a jury, was taken to the superior court of Buncombe county, N. C. On the trial in that court, evidence was introduced by the appellant with respect to the course of business and the amount and sources of income for the years in question. The appellant admitted that '(a) in assessing the tax the Commissioner of Revenue followed the statutory method; ... (b) that the valuation of the real estate and tangible property of the taxpayer 'both within and without the State' is correct; (c) that the total net income used as a basis for the calculation of the tax is correct; (d) that the allocation of the net income for purposes of taxation was in full accord with the statute.' The contention of the appellant was that the income tax statute as applied to the appellant, upon the facts disclosed, was arbitrary \n\n[283 U.S. 123, 126]\n\u00a0\n and unreasonable, and was repugnant to the commerce clause and to section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The superior court struck out the testimony offered by the appellant, as being immaterial, and held that the statute, as applied did not violate constitutional rights. The judgment dismissing the action was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State 199 N. C. 42, 153 S. E. 850, 853. The case comes here on appeal.\n As to the portions of the taxes for the years in question, which had been paid by the appellant voluntarily and as to which recovery was denied upon that ground, no question is raised here.\n The Supreme Court of the state sustained the ruling of the trial court in striking out the evidence offered by the appellant, but held that, if the evidence were deemed to be competent, it would not change the result. The case may therefore be viewed as though the evidence had been received and held to have no bearing on the validity of the statute. Fairmont Creamery Company v. Minnesota, \n274 \nU.S. 1, 5\n, 47 S. Ct. 506, 52 A. L. R. 163. The evidence was thus summarized by the state court:\n'This evidence tended to show that the petitioner (the appellant here) was incorporated in the state of New York in 1901 and is engaged in the business of tanning, manufacturing, and selling belting and other heavy leathers. Many years prior to 1923 it located a manufacturing plant at Asheville, N. C., and, after this plant was in full operation, dismantled and abandoned all plants which it had heretofore operated in different states of the Union. The business is conducted upon both wholesale and retail plans. The wholesale part of the business consists in selling certain portions of the hide to shoe manufacturers and others in carload lots. The retail part of the business consists in cutting the hide into innumerable pieces, finishing it in various ways nd man \n\n[283 U.S. 123, 127]\n\u00a0\n ners, and selling it in less than carload lots. In order to facilitate sales a warehouse is maintained in New York from which shipments are made of stock on hand to various customers. The tannery at Asheville is used as the manufacturing plant and a supply house, and, when the quantity or quality of merchandise required by a customer is not on hand in the New York warehouse, a requisition is sent to the plant at Asheville to ship to the New York werehouse or direct to the customer. The sales office is located in New York, and the salesmen report to that office. Sales are made throughout this country and in Canada and Continental Europe. Some sales are also made in North Carolina. Certain finishing work is done in New York. The evidence further tended to show that 'between forty and fifty per cent. of the output of the plant in Asheville is shipped from the Asheville tannery to New York. The other sixty per cent. is shipped direct on orders from New York. ... Shipment is made direct from Asheville to the customer.'\n\n'The petitioner also offered evidence to the effect that the income from the business was derived from three sources, to wit: (1) buying profit; (2) manufacturing profit; (3) selling profit. It contends that buying profit resulted from unusual skill and efficiency in taking advantage of fluctuations of the hide market; that manufacturing profit was based upon the difference between the cost of tanning done by contract and the actual cost thereof when done by the petitioner at its own plant in Asheville, and that selling profit resulted from the method of cutting the leather into small parts so as to meet the needs of a given customer.\n\n'Without burdening this opinion with detailed compilations set out in the record, the evidence offered by the petitioner tends to show that, for the years 1923, 1924, 1925, and 1926, the average income having its source in the manufacturing and tanning operations within the state of North Carolina was 17 per cent.' \n\n[283 U.S. 123, 128]\n\u00a0\n According to the assessments in question, as revised by the commissioner of revenue and sustained, there was allocated to the state of North Carolina, pursuant to the prescribed statutory method, for the year 1923, 83k per cent. of the appellant's income; for 1924, 85k per cent; for 1925, 66k per cent; and for 1926, 85k per cent.\n\n The applicable statutory provisions, as set forth by the state court, are as follows:\n'Every corporation organized under the laws of this State shall pay annually an income tax, equivalent to four per cent. of the entire net income as herein defined, received by such corporation during the income year; and every foreign corporation doing business in this State shall pay annually an income tax equivalent to four per cent. of a proportion of its entire income to be determined according to the following rules:\n\n'(a) In case of a company other than companies mentioned in the next succeeding section, deriving profits principally from the ownership, sale or rental of real estate or from the manufacture, purchase, sale of, trading in, or use of tangible property, such proportion of its entire net income as the fair cash value of its real estate and tangible personal property in this State on the date of the close of the fiscal year of such company in the income year is to the fair cash value of its entire real estate and tangible personal property then owned by it, with no deductions on account of encumbrances thereon.\n\n'(b) In case of a corporation deriving profits principally from the holding or sale of intangible property, such proportion as its gross receipts in this State for the year ended on the date of the close of its fiscal year next preceding is to its gross receipts for such year within and without the State.\n\n'(c) The words 'tangible personal property' shall be taken to mean corporeal personal property, such as ma- \n\n[283 U.S. 123, 129]\n\u00a0\n chinery, tools, implements, goods, wares and merchandise and shall not be taken to mean money deposits in bank, shares of stock, bonds, ote s, credits or evidence of an interest in property and evidences of debt.'\n\n Relying upon the decisions of this court with respect to statutes of a similar sort enacted by other states, the Supreme Court of the state held that the statute of North Carolina was not invalid upon its face. Underwood Typewriter Company v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113, 120\n, 121 S., 41 S. Ct. 45; Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton, Limited, v. State Tax Commission, \n266 U.S. 271\n, 280-283, 45 S. Ct. 82; National Leather Company v. Massachusetts, \n277 \nU.S. 413, 423\n, 48 S. Ct. 534, 536. In Underwood Typewriter Company v. Chamberlain, supra, a statute of Connecticut imposed upon foreign corporations doing business partly within and partly without the state, an annual tax of 2 per cent. upon the net income earned during the preceding year on business carried on within the state, ascertained by taking such proportion of the whole net income on which the corporation was required to pay a tax to the United States as the value of its real and tangible personal property within the state bore to the value of all its real and tangible personal property. All the manufacturing by the corporation was done in Connecticut, but the greater part of its sales were made from branch offices in other states. It was contended that the tax was an unconstitutional burden upon interstate commerce, and that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment, in that it imposed a tax on income arising from business conducted without the state. In support of the latter objection, the corporation showed that, while 47 per cent. of its real estate and tangible personal property was located in Connecticut, almost all its net profits were received in other states. This court said: 'But this showing wholly fails to sustain the objection. The profits of the corporation were largely earned by a series of trans- \n\n[283 U.S. 123, 130]\n\u00a0\n actions beginning with manufacture in Connecticut and ending with sale in other states. In this it was typical of a large part of the manufacturing business conducted in the state. The Legislature, in attempting to put upon this business its fair share of the burden of taxation, was faced with the impossibility of allocating specifically the profits earned by the processes conducted within its borders. It, therefore, adopted a method of apportionment which, for all that appears in this record, reached, and was meant to reach, only the profits earned within the state. 'The plaintiff's argument on this branch of the case,' as stated by the Supreme Court of Errors, 'carries the burden of showing that 47 per cent. of its net income is not reasonably attributable, for purposes of taxation, to the manufacture of products from the sale of which 80 per cent. of its gross earnings was derived after paying manufacturing costs.' The corporation has not even attempted to show this; and for aught that appears the percentage of net profits earned in Connecticut may have been much larger than 47 per cent. There is, consequently, nothing in this record to show that the method of apportionment adopted by the state was inherently arbitrary, or that its application to this corporation produced an unreasonable result.' In this view, the validity of the Connecticut statute was sustained.\n In the case of Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton, Limited, v. State Tax Commission, supra, the state of New York imposed an annual franchise tax at the rate of 3 per cent. upon the net income of the corporation. The Court, describing the statute, said that, 'if the entire business of the corporation is not transacted within the State, the tax is to be based upon the portion of such ascertained net income determined by the proportion which the aggregate value of specified classes of the assets of the corporation within the State bears to the aggregate value of all such classes of \n\n[283 U.S. 123, 131]\n\u00a0\n assets wherever located.' The corporation in that case was British, engaged in brewing and selling Bass' ale. Its brewing was done, and a large part of its sales were made, in England, ut it had imported a portion of its product into the United States which it sold in branch offices located in New York and Chicago. The Court regarded the question of the constitutional validity of the New York tax as controlled in its essential aspect by the decision in Underwood Typewriter Company v. Chamberlain, supra. And, referring to the facts of that case, the Court said: 'So in the present case we are of opinion that as the Company carried on the unitary business of manufacturing and selling ale, in which its profits were earned by a series of transactions beginning with the manufacture in England and ending in sales in New York and other places- the process of manufacturing resulting in no profits until it ends in sales-the State was justified in attributing to New York a just proportion of the profits earned by the Company from such unitary business. ... Nor do we find that the method of apportioning the net income on the basis of the ratio of the segregated assets located in New York and elsewhere, was inherently arbitrary or a mere effort to reach profits earned elsewhere under the guise of legitimate taxation. ... It is not shown in the present case, any more than in the Underwood Case, that this application of the statutory method of apportionment has produced an unreasonable result.'\n In the instant case, the state court, having considered these decisions, held that the statute of North Carolina was valid upon its face, and sought to justify its view that the evidence offered by the appellant was without effect, upon the following grounds:\n'The fallacy of this conclusion' (that is, the appellant's contention that the application of the statute had been shown to be unreasonable and arbitrary, and hence \n\n[283 U.S. 123, 132]\n\u00a0\n repugnant to the Federal Constitution) 'lies in the fact that the petitioner undertakes to split into independent sources income which the record discloses was created and produced by a single business enterprise. Hides were bought for the purpose of being tanned and manufactured into leather at Asheville. N. C., and this product was to be shipped from the plant and sold and distributed from New York to the customer. The petitioner was not exclusively a hide dealer or a mere tanner or a leather salesman. It was a manufacturer and seller of leather goods, involving the purchase of raw material and the working up of that raw material into acceptable commercial forms, for the ultimate purpose of selling the finished product for a profit. Therefore, the buying, manufacturing, and selling were component parts of a single unit. The property in North Carolina is the hub from which the spokes of the entire wheel radiate to the outer rim.' And, in its final conclusion, the state court said that, if it were conceded that the evidence offered by the appellant was competent, still, as it showed that the appellant 'was conducting a unitary business as contemplated and defined by the courts of final jurisdiction,' it was 'not permissible to lop off certain elements of the business constituting a single unit, in order to place the income beyond the taxing jurisdiction of this state.'\n\n We are unable to agree with this view. Evidence which was found to be lacking in the Underwood and Bass Cases is present here. These decisions are not authority for the conclusion that, where a corporation manufactures in one state and sells in another, the net profits of the entire transaction, as a unitary enterprise, may be attributed, regardless of evidence, to either state. In the Underwood Case, it was not decided that the entire net profits of the total business were to be allocated to Connecticut because that was the place of manufacture, or, in the Bass Case, \n\n[283 U.S. 123, 133]\n\u00a0\n that the entire net profits were to be allocated to New York because that was the place where sales were made. In both instances, a method of apportionment was involved which, as was said in the Underwood Case, 'for all that appears in this record, reached, and was meant to reach, only the profits earned within the state.' The difficulty with he evidence offered in the Underwood Case was that it failed to establish that the amount of net income with which the corporation was charged in Connecticut under the method adopted was not reasonably attributable to the processes conducted within the borders of that state; and in the Bass Case the court found a similar defect in proof with respect to the transactions in New York.\n Undoubtedly the enterprise of a corporation which manufactures and sells its manufactured product is ordinarily a unitary business, and all the factors in that enterprise are essential to the realization of profits. The difficulty of making an exact apportionment is apparent, and hence, when the state has adopted a method not intrinsically arbitrary, it will be sustained until proof is offered of an unreasonable and arbitrary application in particular cases. But the fact that the corporate enterprise is a unitary one, in the sense that the ultimate gain is derived from the entire business, does not mean that for the purpose of taxation the activities which are conducted in different jurisdictions are to be regarded as 'component parts of a single unit' so that the entire net income may be taxed in one state regardless of the extent to which it may be derived from the conduct of the enterprise in another state. As was said in the Bass Case with regard to 'the unitary business of manufacturing and selling ale' which began with manufacturing in England and ended in sales in New York that state 'was justified in attributing to New York a just proportion of the profits earned by the Company from such unitary business.' \n\n[283 U.S. 123, 134]\n\u00a0\n And the principle that was recognized in National Leather Company v. Massachusetts, supra, was that a tax could lawfully be imposed upon a foreign corporation with respect to 'the proportionate part of its total net income which is attributable to the business carried on within the State.' When, as in this case, there are different taxing jurisdictions, each competent to lay a tax with respect to what lies within, and is done within, its own borders, and the question is necessarily one of apportionment, evidence may always be received which tends to show that a state has applied a method, which, albeit fair on its face, operates so as to reach profits which are in no just sense attributable to transactions within its jurisdiction.\n Nor can the evidence be put aside in the view that it merely discloses such negligible criticisms in allocation of income as are inseparable from the practical administration of a taxing system in which apportionment with mathematical exactness is impossible. The evidence in this instance, as the state court puts it, 'tends to show that for the years 1923, 1924, 1925, and 1926, the average income having its source in the manufacturing and tanning operations within the State of North Carolina was seventeen per cent.,' while under the assessments in question there was allocated to the state of North Carolina approximately 80 per cent. of the appellant's income.\n An analysis has been submitted by the appellant for the purpose of showing that the percentage of its income attributable to North Carolina, for the years in question, did not in any event exceed 21.7 per cent. As pointed out by the state court, the appellant's evidence was to the effect that the income from its business was derived from three sources, buying profit, manufacturing profit, and selling profit. The appellant states that its sales were both wholesale and retail; that the profits from the wholesale business were in part attributable to the manufacturing in Asheville and in part to the selling in New York. \n\n[283 U.S. 123, 135]\n\u00a0\n but that the appellant's accountants made no attempt to separate this, and that the entire wholesale profit was credited to manufacturing and allocated to North Carolina. Similarly, it is said that no attempt was made to separate profits from manufacturing in New York from profits derived from manufacturing in Asheville, and that all manufacturing profits were allocated to North Carolina. Itis insisted that, in the retail part of the business, the leather is cut into small pieces and finished in particular ways and supplied in small lots to meet the particular needs of individual customers and that this part of the business is essential to the retail merchandising business conducted from the New York office. The so-called 'buying profit' is said to result from the skill with which hides are bought, and the contention is that these buying operations were not conducted in North Carolina. If as to the last it be said that the buying of raw material for the manufacturing plant should be regarded as incident to the manufacturing business, and as reflected in the value at wholesale of the manufactured product as turned out at the factory, still it is apparent that the amount of the asserted buying profit is not enough to affect the result so far as the constitutional question is concerned.\n For the present purpose, in determining the validity of the statutory method as applied to the appellant, it is not necessary to review the evidence in detail, or to determine as a matter of fact the precise part of the income which should be regarded as attributable to the business conducted in North Carolina. It is sufficient to say that, in any aspect of the evidence, and upon the assumption made by the state court with respect to the facts shown, the statutory method, as applied to the appellant's business for the years in question operated unreasonably and arbitrarily, in attributing to North Carolina a percentage of income out of all appropriate proportion to the business transacted by the appellant in that state. In this view, \n\n[283 U.S. 123, 136]\n\u00a0\n the taxes as laid were beyond the state's authority. Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 52\n, 53 S., 57, 40 S.

W. 310.\n Appellant, a Wisconsin corporation licensed to carry on the business of writing fire insurance in Minnesota, issued, within the state, its policy insuring appellees' assignor against loss, by fire, of personal property located there. The policy was in standard form, the use of which is enjoined by statutes of Minnesota on all fire insurance companies licensed to do business in the state. Mason's Minn. Stat. 1927,  3314, 3366, 3512, 3515, 3711. Failure to comply with the command of the statute is ground for revocation of the license to do business, section 3550, and willful violation of it by any company or agent is made a criminal offense, punishable by fine or imprisonment. Sections 3515, 9923\n\n\n A fire loss having occurred, the insured appointed an arbitrator, and demanded of petitioner that the amount be determined by arbitration as provided by the policy. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[284 U.S. 151, 156]\n\u00a0\n The appellant having refused to participate in the arbitration, the insured, in accordance with the arbitration clause, procured the appointment of an umpire to act with the arbitrator designated by the insured. The arbitrator and umpire thus selected proceeded to determine the amount of the loss, and made their award accordingly.\n In the present suit, brought to recover the amount of the award, the appellant set up by way of defense, the single point relied on here, that so much of the statutes of Minnesota as require the use by petitioner of the arbitration provisions of the standard policy infringes the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. In rejecting this contention and in sustaining a recovery of the amount of the award, the Supreme Court of Minnesota, consistently with its earlier decisions, ruled that the authority of the arbitrators did not extend to a determination of the liability under the policy, which \n\n[284 U.S. 151, 157]\n\u00a0\n was a judicial question, reserved to the courts, but that their decision as to the amount of the loss is conclusive upon the parties, unless grossly excessive or inadequate, or procured by fraud. See Glidden Co. v. Retail Hardware Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 181 Minn. 518, 521, 522, 233 N. W. 310; Abramowitz v. Continental Ins. Co., 170 Minn. 215, 212 N. W. 449; Harrington v. Agricultural Ins. Co., 179 Minn. 510, 229 N. W. 792, 68 A. L. R. 1340.\n This type of arbitration clause has long been commonly used in fire insurance policies, both in Minnesota and elsewhere, and, when voluntarily placed in the insurance contract, compliance with its provisions has been held to be a condition precedent to an action on the policy. Gasser v. Sun Fire Officer, 42 Minn. 315, 44 N. W. 252; Hamilton v. Liverpool, London & Globe Ins. Co., \n136 \nU.S. 242\n, 10 S. Ct. 945; Scott v. Avery, 5 House of Lords, 811, 854. See Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co ., \n264 \nU.S. 109, 121\n, 44 S. Ct. 274.\n Appellees insist that the use of the clause here was voluntary, since the appellant was not compelled to write the policy, and that in any case appellant, by long acquiescence in the statute, is estopped to challenge, after the loss, the right of the insured to rely upon it. Without stopping to examine these contentions, we assume that appellant's freedom of contract was restricted by operation of the statute, and pass directly to the question decided by the state court, whether the Fourteenth Amendment precludes the exercise of such compulsion by the legislative power.\n The right to make contracts embraced in the concept of liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment is not unlimited. Liberty implies only freedom from arbitrary restraint, not immunity from reasonable regulations and prohibitions imposed in the interests of the community. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co. v. McGuire, \n219 \nU.S. 549, 567\n, 31 S. Ct. 259. Hence legislation otherwise within the scope of acknowledged state power, not unreasonably \n\n[284 U.S. 151, 158]\n\u00a0\n or arbitrarily exercised, cannot be condemned because it curtails the power of the individual to contract. McLean v. Arkansas, \n211 \nU.S. 539\n, 29 S. Ct. 206; Schmidinger v. Chicago, \n226 \nU.S. 578\n, 33 S. Ct. 182; German Alliance Insurance Co. v. Kansas, \n233 \nU.S. 389\n, 34 S. Ct. 612, L. R.

Ct. 856.\n The present statute substitutes a determination by arbitration for trial in court of the single issue of the amount of loss suffered under a fire insurance policy. As appellant's objection to it is directed specifically to the power of the state to substitute the one remedy for the other, rather than to the constitutionality of the particular procedure prescribed or followed before the arbitrators, it suffices to say that the procedure by which rights may be enforced and wrongs remedied is peculiarly a subject of state regulation and control. The Fourteenth Amendment neither implies that all trials must be by jury, nor guarantees any particular form or method of state procedure. See Missouri ex rel. Hurwitz v. North, \n271 \nU.S. 40\n, 46 S. Ct. 384. In the exercise of that power and to satisfy a public need, a state may choose the remedy best adapted, in the legislative judgment, to protect the interests concerned, provided its choice is not unreasonable or arbitrary, and the procedure it adopts satisfies the constitutional requirements of reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard.\n The record and briefs present no facts disclosing the reasons for the enactment of the present legislation or the effects of its operation, but, as it deals with a subject within the scope of the legislative power, the presumption of constitutionality is to be indulged. O'Gorman & Young, Inc., v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 251\n, 51 S. Ct. 130; see Standard Oil Co. v. Marysville, \n279 \nU.S. 582, 584\n, 49 S. Ct. 430; Ohio ex rel. Clarke v. Deckebach, \n274 \nU.S. 392, 397\n, 47 S. Ct. 630. We cannot assume that the Minnesota Legislature did not have knowledge of conditions supporting its judgment that the legislation was in the public interest, and it is enough that, \n\n[284 U.S. 151, 159]\n\u00a0\n when the statute is read in the light of circumstances generally known to attend the recovery of fire insurance losses, the possibility of a rational basis for the legislative judgment is not excluded.\n Without the aid of the presumption, we know that the arbitration clause has long been voluntarily inserted by insurers in fire policies, and we share in the common knowledge that the amount of loss is a fruitful and often the only subject of controversy between insured and insurer; that speedy determination of the policy liability such as may be secured by arbitration of this issue is a matter of wide concern, see Fidelity Mut. Life Ass'n v. Mettler, \n185 \nU.S. 308\n, 22 S. Ct. 662; Farmers' & Merchants' Ins. Co. v. Dobney, \n189 \nU.S. 301\n, 23 S. Ct. 565; that, in the appraisal of the loss by arbitration, expert knowledge and prompt inspection of the damaged property may be availed of to an extent not ordinarily possible in the course of the more deliberate processes of a judicial proceeding. These considerations are sufficient to support the exercise of the legislative judgment in requiring a more summary method of determining the amount of the loss than that afforded by traditional forms. Hence the requirement that disputes of this type arising under this special class of insurance contracts be submitted to arbitrators cannot be deemed to be a denial of either due process or equal protection of the laws.\n Granted, as we now hold, that the state, in the present circumstances, has power to prescribe a summary method of ascertaining the amount of loss, the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, so far as now invoked, are satisfied if the substitute remedy is substantial and efficient.

SOUTHERN PAC. CO.(1931)\nNo. 131\nArgued: Decided: April 13, 1931\n\n\n\n Messrs. P. H. Hayes, of Phoenix, Ariz., M. J. Dougherty, of Mesa, Ariz., and J. A. Walsh, of Mesa, Ariz., for Herron.\n Messrs. Charles H. Bates, of Washington, D. C., and Alexander B. Baker and Louis B. Whitney, both of Phoenix, Ariz., for Southern Pac. Co. \n\n[283 U.S. 91, 92]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought in the District Court of the United States for the District of Arizona to recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a collision between the plaintiff's automobile and the defendant's train. The accident occurred in Phoenix, Ariz. At the close of the testimony on the part of the plaintiff, the court directed a verdict for the defendant, upon the ground that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. The plaintiff appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court states that, if the court below was at liberty to follow the settled rule in the courts of the United States that 'whenever, in the trial of a civil case, it is clear that the state of the evidence is such as not to warrant a verdict for a party, and that if such a verdict were rendered the other party would be entitled to a new trial, it is the right and duty of the judge to direct the jury to find according to the views of the court' (Barrett v. Virginian Railway Company, \n250 \nU.S. 473, 476\n, 39 S. Ct. 540, 541), the action of the trial court was justified. But section 5, article 18, of the Constitution of Arizona, provides: 'The defense of contributory negligence or of assumption of risk shall, in all cases whatsoever, be a question of fact and shall, at all times, be left to the jury.'\n In view of this requirement, the Circuit Court of Appeals has certified the following questions of law for the decision of this Court:\n'First. Is the above provision of the constitution of the State of Arizona binding and controlling upon a Federal court sitting in that State? Or, putting the question in another form:\n\n'Second. May a Federal court sitting in the State of Arizona direct a verdict for the defendant in an action to recover damages for personal injuries, when it appears as a matter of law that the plaintiff was guilty of contribu- \n\n[283 U.S. 91, 93]\n\u00a0\n tory negligence, notwithstanding the state constitutional provision to the contrary?'\n\n Construing the constitutional provision, the Supreme Court of Arizona in Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company v. Conwell, 21 Ariz. 480, 486, 487, 190 P. 88, 90, 91, said: 'The language of the provision is plain and unambiguous, and to our minds clearly indicates that the power or duty to finally and conclusively settle the question of contributory negligence or assumption of risk is by its terms, transferred from the court to the jury . ... We think that the evident purpose and intent of the provision is to make the jury the sole arbiter of the existence or nonexistence of contributory negligence or assumption of risk in all actions for personal injuries.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n It does not appear to be insisted by the appellant, and it could not be maintained, that this constitutional provision must be followed by the federal courts by virtue of the Conformity Act, U. S. C. tit. 28,  724 ( 28 USCA  724). The state, without violating the requirements of due process, may provide such a rule for its own courts, as it may do away with the jury altogether (Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company v. Cole, \n251 \nU.S. 54, 56\n, 40 S. Ct. 68), but, in view of its nature and effect, the rule cannot be regarded as one that relates merely to practice or to a 'form' or 'mode of proceeding.' The provision 'cuts deep into the right, observed at common law, by which a defendant can obtain a decision by the court upon a proven state of facts.' Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company v. Spencer (C. C. A.) 20 F.(2d) 714, 718. Even with respect to the burden of proof as to contributory negligence, this Court has said: 'But it is a misnomer to say that the question as to the burden of proof as to contributory negligence is a mere matter \n\n[283 U.S. 91, 94]\n\u00a0\n of state procedure. For, in Vermont, and in a few other states, proof of plaintiff's freedom from fault is a part of the very substance of his case . ... But the United States courts have uniformly held that, as a matter of general law, the burden of proving contributory negligence is on the defendant. The Federal courts have enforced that principle even in trials in states which hold that the burden is on the plaintiff.' Central Vermont Railway Company v. White, \n238 \nU.S. 507, 512\n, 35 S. Ct. 865, 867, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 252. See, also, Beutler v. Grand Trunk Junction Railway Company, \n224 \nU.S. 85, 88\n, 32 S. Ct. 402.\n Nor is the provision applicable, which the appellant invokes, that 'the laws of the several states, except where the Constitution, ereaties, or statutes of the United States otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law, in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply.' U. S. C. tit. 28,  725 (28 USCA  725). The controlling principle governing the decision of the present question is that, state laws cannot alter the essential character or function of a federal court. The function of the trial judge in a federal court is not in any sense a local matter, and state statutes which would interfere with the appropriate performance of that function are not binding upon the federal court under either the Conformity Act or the 'Rules of Decision' Act. Thus, a federal court is not subject to state regulations, whether found in constitutional provisions or in statutes, providing that the court shall not give an instruction to the jury unless reduced to writing, or that written instructions shall be taken by the ury in their retirement (Nudd v. Burrows, \n91 \nU.S. 426, 441\n, 442 S.; Lincoln v. Power, \n151 \nU.S. 436, 442\n, 14 S. Ct. 387); or that the court shall require the jury to answer special interrogatories in addition to their general verdict (Indianapolis & St. Louis Railroad Company v. Horst, \n93 U.S. 291\n, 300); or that the court shall not express any opinion upon the facts (Vicksburg & Meridian Railroad Company v. Putnam, \n118 \nU.S. 545, 553\n, 7 S. Ct. 1); or charge the jury with regard to matters of fact (St. Louis, \n\n[283 U.S. 91, 95]\n\u00a0\n Iron Mountain & Southern Railway Company v. Vickers, \n122 \nU.S. 360, 363\n, 7 S. Ct. 1216); or shall not direct a verdict, where the evidence is such that a verdict the other way would be set aside (Barrett v. Virginian Railway Company, supra).\n In a trial by jury in a federal court, the judge is not a mere moderator, but is the governor of the trial for the purpose of assuring its proper conduct and of determining questions of law. This discharge of the judicial function as at common law is an essential factor in the process for which the Federal Constitution provides. As was said by Mr. Justice Story, in United States v. Battiste, 2 Summn. 240, 243, Fed. Cas. No. 14,545: 'It is the duty of the court to instruct the jury as to the law; and it is the duty of the jury to follow the law, as it is laid down by the court.'\n'Trial by jury,' said the court in Capital Traction Company v. Hof, \n174 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 14 S., 19 S. Ct. 580, 585, 'in the primary and usual sense of the term at the common law and in the American constitutions, is not merely a trial by a jury of 12 men before an officer vested with authority to cause them to be summoned and empaneled, to administer oaths to them and to the constable in charge, and to enter judgment and issue execution on their verdict; but it is a trial by a jury of 12 men in the presence and under the superintendence of a judge emplowered to instruct them on the law and to advise them on the facts, and (except on acquittal of a criminal charge) to set aside their verdict, if, in his opinion, it is against the law or the evidence.' See, also, United States v. Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Company, \n123 \nU.S. 113, 114\n, 8 S. Ct. 77; Patton v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 276, 288\n, 289 S., 50 S. Ct. 253, 70 A. L. R. 263.\n\n Where, in an action in a federal court to recover damages for personal injuries, contributory negligence or assumption of risk constitutes a defense, 2 and, by reason of \n\n[283 U.S. 91, 96]\n\u00a0\n the facts being undisputed and of the absence of conflicting inferences, the evidence of contributory negligence or assumption of risk is conclusive and the question is one of law, the judge has the right and duty to direct a verdict for the defendant.

TAX COMMISSION OF WIS.(1931)\nNo. 17\nArgued: Decided: November 30, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 206, 207]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Claire B. Bird, of Wausau, Wis., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 206, 208]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Reynolds, Atty. Gen., and Harold M. Wilkie, of Madison, Wis., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 206, 212]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant, a resident of Marathon county, Wis., married in the year 1927. Subsequent to his marriage he was in receipt of income taxable to him under the income tax statute of the state. His wife, during the same period, received taxable income, composed of a salary, interest, and dividends, and a share of the profits of a partnership with which her husband had no connection. The assessor of incomes assessed against the appellant a tax computed on the combined total of his and his wife's incomes as shown by separate returns, treating the aggregate as his income. The amount so ascertained and assessed exceeded the sum of the taxes which would have been due had their taxable incomes been separately as \n\n[284 U.S. 206, 213]\n\u00a0\n sessed. \n1\n The authority for the assessor's procedure is found in the following sections of the act:\n Section 71.05(2)(d): '... In computing taxes and the amount of taxes payable by persons residing together as members of a family, the income of the wife and the income of each child under eighteen years of age shall be added to that of the husband or father, or if he be not living, to that of the head of the family and assessed to him except as hereinafter provided. The taxes levied shall be payable by such husband or head of the family, but if not paid by him may be enforced against any person whose income is included within the tax computation.'\n Section 71.09(4)(c): 'Married persons living together as husband and wife may make separate returns or join in a single joint return. In either case the tax shall be computed on the combined average taxable income. The exemptions provided for in subsection (2) of section 71.05 shall be allowed but once and divided equally and the amount of tax due shall be paid by each in the proportion that the average income of each bears to the combined average income.'\n Appellant paid the tax under protest, and, after complying with requisite conditions precedent, instituted proceedings to recover so much thereof as was in excess of the tax computed on his own separate income. He asserted that the statute as applied to him violates the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin overruled this contention, and affirmed a judgment for appellees. The question is whether the state law as interpreted and applied deprives the taxpayer of due process and of \n\n[284 U.S. 206, 214]\n\u00a0\n the equal protection of the law. The appellant says that what the state has done is to assess and collect from him a tax based in part upon the income received by his wife, and that such exaction is arbitrary and discriminatory, and consequently violative of the constitutional guaranties.\n At common law the wife's property, owned at the date of marriage or in any manner acquired thereafter, is the property of her husband. Her earnings and income are his, he may dispose of them at will, and he is liable for her debts. Were the status of a married woman in Wisconsin that which she had at common law, the statutory attribution of her income to her husband for income tax would, no doubt, be justifiable. But her spouse's ownership and control of her property have been abolished by the laws of the state. Women are declared to have the same rights as men in the exercise of suffrage, freedom of contract, choice of residence for voting purposes, jury service, holding office, holding and conveying property, care and custody of children, and in all other respects. \n2\n Under the title 'Property Rights of Married Women,' it is enacted that a wife's real estate and its rents, issues, and profits shall be her sole and separate property as if she were unmarried, and shall not be subject to the disposal of her husband;3 and this is true of her personal property as well, whether owned at the date of marriage or subsequently acquired. \n4\n She may convey, devise, or bequeath her property, real and personal, as if she were unmarried, and her husband has no right of disposal thereof, nor is it liable for his debts. \n5\n Either spouse may convey his or her property to the other or create a lien thereon in favor of the other. \n6\n The individual earnings \n\n[284 U.S. 206, 215]\n\u00a0\n of every married woman, except those accruing from labor performed for her husband, or in his employ or payable by him, are her separate property, and are not subject to his control or liable for his debts. \n7\n She may sue in her own name and have all the remedies of an unmarried woman in regard to her separate property or business and to recover her earnings, and is liable to suit and to the rendition of a judgment, which may be enforced against her separate property as if she were unmarried. \n 8\n\u00a0\n\n Since, then, in law and in fact the wife's income is in the fullest degree her separate property and in no sense that of her husband, the question presented is whether the state has power by an income tax law to measure his tax, not by his own income, but, in part, by that of another. To the problem thus stated, what was said in Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 77\n, 20 S. Ct. 747, 762, is apposite:\n'It may be doubted by some, aside from express constitutional restrictions, whether the taxation by Congress of the property of one person, accompanied with an arbitrary provision that the rate of tax shall be fixed with reference to the sum of the property of another, thus bringing about the profound inequality which we have noticed, would not transcend the limitations arising from those fundamental conceptions of free government which underlie all constitutional systems.'\n\n We have no doubt that, because of the fundamental conceptions which underlie our system, any attempt by a state to measure the tax on one person's property or income by reference to the property or income of another is contrary to due process of law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. That which is not in fact the taxpayer's income cannot be made such by calling it income. Compare Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531, 540\n, 47 S. Ct. 710, 52 A. L. R. 1081\n\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 206, 216]\n\u00a0\n It is incorrect to say that the provision of the Wisconsin income tax statute retains or re-establishes what was formerly an incident of the marriage relation. Wisconsion has not made the property of the wife that of her husband nor has it made the income from her propertly the income of her husband. Nor has it established joint ownership. The effort to tax B for A's property or income does not make B the owner of that property or income, and whether the state has power to effect such a change of ownership in a particular case is wholly irrelevant when no such effort has been made. Under the law of Wisconsin, the income of the wife does not at any moment or to any extent become the property of the husband. He never has any title to it, or controls any part of it. That income remains hers until the tax is paid, and what is left continues to be hers after that payment. The state merely levies a tax upon it. What Wisconsin has done is to tax as a joint income that which under its law is owned separately, and thus to secure a higher tax than would be the sum of the taxes on the separate incomes.\n The court below assigned two reasons which it thought removed the constitutional objections to the application of the statute in the instant case. It cited and followed the Income Tax Cases, 148 Wis. 456, 134 N. W. 673, 135 N. W. 164, where the statute here in question was sustained on the ground that the provisions under attack are necessary to prevent frauds and evasions of the tax by married persons, and stated that the decision of this court in Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, \n270 \nU.S. 230\n, 46 S. Ct. 260, 261, 43 A. L. R. 1224, was not inconsistent with the views expressed by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in its earlier decision. To this we cannot agree. In the Schlesinger Case this court held invalid a statute which, for purposes of inheritance tax, classified all gifts inter vivos, effective within six years of death, as gifts made in contemplation of death. To the \n\n[284 U.S. 206, 217]\n\u00a0\n argument of the necessity for such classification to prevent frauds and evasions, it was answered:\n'That is to say, A. may be required to submit to an exactment forbidden by the Constitution if this seems necessary in order to enable the state readily to collect lawful charges against B. Rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution are not to be so lightly treated; they are superior to this supposed necessity. The state is forbidden to deny due process of law or the equal protection of the laws for any purpose whatsoever.'\n\n The claimed necessity cannot justify the otherwise unconstitutional exaction.\n The second reason assigned as a justification for the imposition of the tax is that it is a regulation of marriage. It is said that the marital relation has always been a matter of concern to the state, and has properly been the subject of legislation which classified it as a distinct subject of regulation. It is suggested that a difference of treatment of married as compared with single persons in the amount of tax imposed may be due to the greater and different privileges enjoyed by the former, and, if so, the discrimination would have a reasonable basis, and constitute permissible classification. This view overlooks several important considerations. In the first place, as is pointed out above, the state has, except in its purely social aspects, taken from the marriage status all the elements which differentiate it from that of the single person. In property, business, and economic relations they are the same. It can hardly be claimed that a mere difference in social relations so alters the taxable status of one receiving income as to justify a different measure for the tax.\n Again, it is clear that the law is a revenue measure, and not one imposing regulatory taxes. It levies a tax on 'every person residing within the state,' and defines the word 'person' as including 'natural persons, fiduciaries and corporations,' and 'corporations' as including 'cor- \n\n[284 U.S. 206, 218]\n\u00a0\n porations, joint stock companies, associations or common law trusts.' It lays graduated taxes on the incomes of natural persons and corporations at different rates. It is comprehensive in its provisions regarding gross income and allowable deductions and exemptions, and is in most respects the analogue of the federal income tax acts in force since 1916. It is obvious that the act does not purport to regulate the status or relationships of any person, natural or artificial. Arbitrary and discriminatory provisions contained in it cannot be justified by calling them special regulations of the persons or relationships which are the object of the discrimination. The present case does not fall within the principle that, where the Legislature, in prohibiting a traffic or transaction as being against the policy of the state, makes a classification, reasonable in itself, its power so to do is not to be denied simply because some innocent article comes within the proscribed class. Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, \n226 \nU.S. 192, 204\n, 33 S. Ct. 44. Taxing one person for the property of another is a different matter. There is no room for the suggestion that qua the appellant and those similarly situated the act is a reasonable regulation, rather than a tax law.\n Neither of the reasons advanced in support of the validity of the statute as applied to the appellant justifies the resulting discrimination. The exaction is arbitrary, and is a denial of due process.\n The judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES.\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin sustaining the constitutionality of a tax levied under the laws of the state. The appellant married a widow. Both parties had separate incomes and made separate returns. A tax was assessed upon the appellant for the total of both, as if both belonged to \n\n[284 U.S. 206, 219]\n\u00a0\n him. By R. S. Wis.  71.05(2)(d), 'In computing taxes and the amount of taxes payable by persons residing together as members of a family, the income of the wife and the income of each child under eighteen years of age shall be added to that of the husband of father, or if he be not living, to that of the head of the family and assessed to him except as hereinafter provided. The taxes levied shall be payable by such husband or head of the family, but if not paid by him may be enforced against any person whose income is included within the tax computation.' By R. S.  71. 09(4)(c), 'Married persons living together as husband and wife may make separate returns or join in a single joint return. In either case the tax shall be computed on the combined average taxable income. The exemptions provided for in subsection (2) of section 71.05 shall be allowed but once and divided equally and the amount of tax due shall be paid by each in the proportion that the average income of each bears to the combined average income.' The result of adding the incomes was to increase the rate of the plaintiff's income tax and to charge him with a portion of the tax otherwise payable by Mrs. Hoeper. He sets up the Fourteenth Amendment and says that he has been deprived of due process of law.\n This case cannot be disposed of as an attempt to take one person's property to pay another person's debts. The statutes are the outcome of a thousand years of history. They must be viewed against the background of the earlier rules that husband and wife are one, and that one the husband, and that, as the husband took the wife's chattels, he was liable for her debts. They form a system with echoes of different moments none of which is entitled to prevail over the other. The emphasis in other sections on separation of interests cannot make us deaf to the assumption in the sections quoted of community when two spouses live together and when usually each \n\n[284 U.S. 206, 220]\n\u00a0\n would get the benefit of the income of each without inquiry into the source. So far as the Constitution of the United States is concerned, the Legislature has power to determine what the consequences of marriage shall be, and, as it may provide that the husband shall or shall not have certain rights in his wife's property and shall or shall not be liable for his wife's debts, it may enact that he shall be liable for taxes on an income that in every probability will make his life easier and help to pay his bills. Taxation may consider not only command over but actual enjoyment of the property taxed. See Corliss v. Bowers, \n281 \nU.S. 376, 378\n, 50 S. Ct. 336. In some states, if not in all, the husband became the owner of the wife's chattels on marriage without any trouble from the Constitution, and it would require ingenious argument to show that there might not be a return to the law as it was in 1800. It is all a matter of statute. But for statute the income taxed would belong to the husband and there would be no question about it.\n I will add a few words that seem to me superfluous. It is said that Wisconsin has taken away the former characteristics of the marriage state. But it has said in so many words that it keeps this one. And when the Legislature clearly indicates that it means to accomplish a certain result within its power to accomplish, it is our business to supply any formula that the elegantia juris may seem to require. Sexton v. Kessler & Co., \n225 \nU.S. 90, 97\n, 32 S. Ct. 657.\n The statute is justified also by its tendency to prevent tax evasion. No doubt, if, as was held in Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, \n270 \nU.S. 230\n, 46 S. Ct. 260, 43 A. L. R. 1224, with regard to the measure then before the Court, there was no reasonable relation between the law and the evil, the statute could not be upheld. But the fact that it might reach innocent people does not condemn it. It has been decided too often to be open to question that administrative necessity may justify the inclusion of innocent objects or trans- \n\n[284 U.S. 206, 221]\n\u00a0\n actions within a prohibited class.

U. S.(1931)\nNo. 477\nArgued: January 22, 1931Decided: February 24, 1931\n\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 694, 696]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Percy F. Parrott, H. A. Kesler, and John B. McMahon, all of Toledo, Ohio, for petitioners.\n The Attorney General and \n\n[282 U.S. 694, 697]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Amos W. W. Woodcock, of Baltimore, Md., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 694, 699]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners were convicted in the District Court for Western Michigan upon two counts of an indictment, the first for transporting, and the second for possessing, intoxicating liquors in violation of the National Prohibition Act. They had been apprehended while in an automobile, and arrested without warrant. The officers had searched the automobile, without warrant, and found a quantity of intoxicating liquor, which they had seized. A motion by petitioners to suppress the use as evidence of the information thus acquired, on the ground that the arrest and the search and seizure were illegal, was denied. Each count of the indictment set forth a single offense; and the second, that for possession, alleged two prior convictions of petitioner Husty for unlawful possession. Petitioners were sentenced generally on the indictment, without reference to either court, Husty to five years' imprisonment and to pay a fine of $3,000, and Laurel to imprisonment for one year and six months.\n In the course of the proceedings before the District Court, petitioners, by appropriate motions and exceptions, challenged the correctness of the order denying the motion to suppress evidence; the sufficiency of the indictment; and the legality of the sentences, the last on the grounds that they were not authorized by the Jones Act of March 2, 1929, c. 473, 45 Stat. 1446 (27 USCA  91, 92), and exceeded the maximum penalties which could be imposed under section 29 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA  46).\n The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, without opinion, affirmed the convictions (30 F.(2d) 1012) under both counts, and held the sentences to be supported by the convictions upon the second count-that for possession-alone. This Court granted certiorari (\n282 \nU.S. 831\n, 51 S. Ct. 89, 75 L. Ed. -, Nov. 24, 1930), on a petition which asked review of the rulings of the District Court which have been \n\n[282 U.S. 694, 700]\n\u00a0\n mentioned; the government opposing on the ground, among others, that the sentences were proper under the possession count.\n\n 1. \nIn the proceeding to suppress evidence, one of the prohibition officers who made the arrest testified that he had known Husty to be a 'bootlegger' for a number of years before the arrest, and had arrested him in 1922 and 1928 for violations of the National Prohibition Act; both arrests resulting in conviction and the second in imprisonment. On the day of petitioners' arrest, the witness had received information over the telephone that Husty had two loads of liquor in automobiles of a particular make and description, parked in particular places on named streets. The witness was well acquainted with his informant, having known him for about eight years, and had come in frequent contact with him in business and socially. The same person had given similar information to the witness before, which had always been found to be reliable. The officer believed the information, and, acting upon it, found one of the cars described, at the point indicated, and unattended. Later, petitioners and a third man entered the car. Husty had started it when he was stopped by the officers. Laurel and the third man fled, and the latter escaped. The officers, believing that the car contained intoxicating liquor, searched it, and found eighteen cases of whisky.\n The Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the search, without warrant, of an automobile, for liquor illegally transported or possessed, if the search is upon probable cause; and arrest for the transportation or possession need not precede the search. Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132\n, 45 S. Ct. 280, 39 A. L. R. 790. We think the testimony which we have summarized is ample to establish the lawfulness of the present search. To show probable cause it is not necessary that the arresting officer should have had before him \n\n[282 U.S. 694, 701]\n\u00a0\n legal evidence of the suspected illegal act. Dumbra v. United tat es, \n268 \nU.S. 435, 441\n, 45 S. Ct. 546; Carroll v. United States, supra. It is enough if the apparent facts which have come to his attention are sufficient, in the circumstances, to lead a reasonably discreet and prudent man to believe that liquor is illegally possessed in the automobile to be searched. See Dumbra v. United States, supra; Stacey v. Emery, \n97 U.S. 642\n, 645\n\n\n Here the information, reasonably believed by the officer to be reliable, that Husty, known to him to have been engaged in the illegal traffic, possessed liquor in an automobile of particular description and location, the subsequent discovery of the automobile at the point indicated, in the control of Husty, and the prompt attempt of his two companions to escape when hailed by the officers, were reasonable grounds for his belief that liquor illegally possessed would be found in the car. The search was not unreasonable, because, as petitioners argue, sufficient time elapsed between the receipt by the officer of the information and the search of the car to have enabled him to procure a search warrant. He could not know when Husty would come to the car or how soon it would be removed. In such circumstances, we do not think the officers should be required to speculate upon the cnances of successfully carrying out the search, after the delay and withdrawal from the scene of one or more officers which would have been necessary to procure a warrant. The search was therefore on probable cause, and not unreasonable; and the motion to suppress the evidence was rightly denied. Carroll v. United States, supra.\n In the course of the hearing on the motion, questions by petitioners seeking to establish the name and identity of the officer's informant were excluded. Petitioners ask review of these rulings on the evidence, but we do not consider them, since they were not assigned as error on the ap- \n\n[282 U.S. 694, 702]\n\u00a0\n peal to the Court of Appeals, and it does not appear that they were presented or passed upon there. Duignan v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 195, 200\n, 47 S. Ct. 566.\n\n 2. \nThe indictment is in the form authorized by section 32 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA  49). It charges the transportation of intoxicating liquor as a first offense by both petitioners, and possession as a first offense by Laurel, and as a third offense by Husty, at a named time, and at a place within the jurisdiction of the court. Failure to state more specifically the amount of the liquor, and the time and place of the offenses charged, does not affect the validity of the indictment. It was at most ground for a bill of particulars, if timely application had been made. See Durland v. United States, \n161 \nU.S. 306, 315\n, 16 S. Ct. 508.\n It is urged that the indictment is defective, because it fails to state whether the offenses charged were felonies or misdemeanors, and whether the petitioners were charged with casual or slight violations, or habitual sales of intoxicating liquor, or attempts to commercialize violations of the law, which, petitioners argue, were made new or aggravated offenses by the Jones Act.\n But the Jones Act created no new crime. It increased the penalties for 'illegal manufacture, sale, transportation, importation, or exportation,' as defined by section 1, title 2 of the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA  4), to a fine not exceeding $10,000, or imprisonment not exceeding five years, or both, and added as a proviso, 'that it is the intent of Congress that the court, in imposing sentence hereunder, should discriminate between casual or slight violations and habitual sales of intoxicating liquor, or attempts to commercialize violations of the law.' As the act added no new criminal offense to those enumerated and defined in the National Prohibition Act, it added nothing to the material allegations required to be set out in indictments for those offenses. The proviso is only a \n\n[282 U.S. 694, 703]\n\u00a0\n guide to the discretion of the court in imposing the increased sentences for those offenses for whch an increased penalty is authorized by the act. See Ross v. United States (C. C. A.) 37 F. (2d) 557, certiorari denied \n281 \nU.S. 767\n, 50 S. Ct. 466; McElvogue v. United States (C. C. A.) 40 F.(2d) 889, certiorari denied \n282 \nU.S. 845\n, 51 S. Ct. 24, 75 L. Ed . -, Oct. 13, 1930.\n\n 3. \nThe sentence imposed on each of the petitioners exceeded the maximum penalty for illegal possession under section 29 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act, which is, for a first offense $500 fine, and for a third offense 'not less than $500' fine and not more than two years' imprisonment. As illegal possession is not one of the offenses enumerated in the Jones Act for which increased penalties are provided, and as the sentences imposed exceed any authorized by section 29 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act, the court below was in error in holding that they were supported by convictions on the second count, that for possession.\n Since the convictions were upheld under the first count, sentences under the Jones Act were authorized; transportation being one of the offenses enumerated in that act. But the possession alleged in the second count was not in itself necessarily an aggravation of the transportation charge which would warrant heavy sentences under the Jones Act, as to either petitioner, and could not be as to Laurel, who, so far as the evidence shows, was a first offender both as to the transportation and possession. While the District Court may have had before it facts other than those appearing of record which it was entitled to consider in imposing sentence under the Jones Act, we think, in view of the confusion which has arisen with respect to the propriety of the sentences under the possession count, that the District Court should be afforded an opportunity in its discretion to resentence the petitioners in the view of the applicable statutes, as stated. \n\n[282 U.S. 694, 704]\n\u00a0\n The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","76":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINDIAN MOTOCYCLE CO. v. UNITED STATES(1931)\nNo. 398\nArgued: Decided: May 25, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 570, 571]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Monte Appel and Frederick Schwertner, both of Washington, D. C., for Indian Motocycle Co.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Thomas D. Thacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 570, 572]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a certificate from the Court of Claims. At a prior term the certificate was dismissed as not in accord with applicable rules and then reinstated, as in Wheeler Lumber Bridge & Supply Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 572\n, 50 S. Ct. 419. It since has been amended, and further argument has been heard.\n The facts disclosed in the certificate are: In 1925 the plaintiff, a corporate manufacturer of motorcycles in Massachusetts, sold a motorcycle of its manufacture to the city of Westfield, a municipal corporation of that commonwealth, for use by the city in its police service. A tax in respect of the sale was assessed and collected from the plaintiff under section 600 of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 322 (26 USCA  881 note, 882). After due but unsuccessful effort to have the same refunded, the plaintiff brought suit in the Court of Claims to recover the money so exacted from it-the tax being assailed as invalid, as it had been in the application for a refund, on the ground that it was imposed in contravention of the constitutional immunity of the state and her governmental agencies from federal taxation. The parties submitted an agreed statement showing the facts here recited, and the Court of Claims then certified to this Court the question (we state its substance), where a motorcycle is sold by its manufacturer to a municipal \n\n[283 U.S. 570, 573]\n\u00a0\n corporation of a state for use by such corporation in its police service, can the transaction be taxed under section 600 of the Revenue Act of 1924 consistently with the constitutional immunity of the state and her governmental agencies from federal taxation.\n Our jurisdiction to entertain certificates from the Court of Claims, and the limitations on that jurisdiction, are explained in Wheeler Lumber Bridge & Supply Co. v. United States, supra. The present certificate when tested by the rules there stated is unobjectionable. It presents a question of law suitably distinct and definite. And while, with the facts settled by an agreed statement accepted below, it is apparent that a decision of the question either way will be decisive of the case, this affords no ground for declining to entertain the certificate. United States v. Mayer, \n235 \nU.S. 55, 66\n, 35 S. Ct. 16, and cases cited.\n Section 600 of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 243, 43 Stat. 253, 322 (26 USCA  881 note), is part of Title 6 entitled Excise Taxes. The section provides that there 'shall be levied, assessed, collected, and paid upon the following articles sold or leased by the manufacturer, producer, or importer, a tax equivalent to the following percentage of the price for which so sod or leased.' Motorcycles are among the articles enumerated and the applicable tax is five per centum of the price for which they are sold. Manufacturers, producers and importers are required severally to make returns of their sales and to pay the tax.\n This taxing provision is a reenactment, with minor changes not material here, of a provision which was included in the Revenue Act of 1917, c. 63,  600, 40 Stat. 300, 316, and repeated in succeeding enactments. It is now section 600 of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 93, U. S. C. title 26,  881, note (26 USCA  881, note).\n Both parties rightly regard the tax as an excise, and not a direct tax on the articles named. But they differ as \n\n[283 U.S. 570, 574]\n\u00a0\n to the transaction or act on which it is laid. Counsel for the plaintiff insist it is laid on the sale. Counsel for the government regard it as laid on manufacture, production or importation, or, in the alternative, on any one of these and the sale. We think it is laid on the sale, and on that alone. It is levied as of the time of sale and is measured according to the price obtained by the sale. It is not laid on all sales, but only on first or initial sales-those by the manufacturer, producer or importer. Subsequent sales, as where purchasers at first sales resell, are not taxed. Counsel for the government base their contention on the requirement that the tax be paid by 'the manufacturer, producer or importer'; but we think this requirement is intended to be no more than a comprehensive and convenient mode of reaching all first or initial sales, and that it does not reflect a purpose to base the tax in any way on manufacture, production or importation. Importation, as such, already was otherwise taxed, chapter 356,  1, par. 369, 42 Stat. 858, 885, U. S. C., Title 19,  121, par. 369 (19 USCA  121, par. 369), and in our opinion the words relied on fall short of expressing a purpose to subject it to a further tax.\n This view of the tax is not new. The administrative bureau adopted it at the outset and has adhered to it up to the present time. The regulations issued under the Revenue Act of 1917 said on this point, 'The tax is on the sale of the articles mentioned,' 20 Tr. Dec. Int. Rev. 365; and this is repeated in the later regulations. 21 Tr. Dec. Int. Rev. 412; 23 Tr. Dec. Int. Rev. 68; 24 Tr. Dec. Int. Rev. 56; 26 Tr. Dec. Int. Rev. 592. Indeed, the tax is frequently spoken of in the regulations as a sales tax. And it is so described in reports of congressional committees dealing with revenue bills in which it was retained. Sen. Rep. No. 398, p. 40, 68th Cong., 1st Sess.; House Rep. No. 1, p. 16, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. While not controlling, this administrative and legislative action \n\n[283 U.S. 570, 575]\n\u00a0\n strengthens our conclusion, drawn from the taxing provision, that the tax is laid on the sale, and on that alone.\n The cases of Cornell v. Coyne, \n192 \nU.S. 418\n, 24 S. Ct. 383, and American Manufacturing Co. v. St. Louis, \n250 \nU.S. 459\n, 39 S. Ct. 522, cited by counsel for the government, are not pertinent; for both related to taxes distinctly imposed on manufacturing.\n With this understanding of the nature of the tax, we come to the question propounded in the certificate.\n It is an established principle of our constitutional system of dual government that the instrumentalities, means and operations whereby the United States exercises it governmental powers are exempt from taxation by the states, and that the instrumentalities, means and operations whereby the states exert the governmental powers belonging to them are equally exempt from taxation by the United States. This principle is implied from the independence of the national and state governments within their respective spheres and from the provisions of the Constitution which look to the maintenance of the dual system. Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 125, 127; Willcuts v. Bunn, \n282 \nU.S. 216, 224\n, 225 S., 51 S. Ct. 125. Where the principle applies it is not affected by the amount f th e particular tax or the extent of the resulting interference, but is absolute. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 430; United States v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 17 Wall, 322, 327; Johnson v. Maryland, \n254 \nU.S. 51, 55\n, 56 S., 41 S. Ct. 16;1 \n\n[283 U.S. 570, 576]\n\u00a0\n Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501, 505\n, 42 S. Ct. 171; Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, 44-46.\n Of course, the reasons underlying the principle mark the limits of its range. Thus as to persons or corporations which serve as agencies of government, national or state, and also have private property or engage on their own account in business for gain, it is well settled that the principle does not extend to their private property or private business, but only to their operations or acts as such agencies;2 and, in harmony with this view, it also has been held where a state departs from her usual governmental functions and 'engages in a business which is of a private nature' no immunity arises in respect of her own or her agents' operations in that business. \n3\n While these decisions show that the immunity does not extend to anything lying outside or beyond governmental functions and their exertion, other decisions to which we now shall refer show that it does extend to all that lies within that field.\n It has been adjudged that bonds of the United States issued to raise money for governmental purposes, and the interest thereon, are immune from state taxation, because such a tax, even though inconsiderable in amount and imposed only on holders of the bonds, would burden the exercise by the United States of its power to borrow money. Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 468;4 The Banks v. Mayor of New York, 7 Wall. 16; Home Savings Bank v. Des Moines, \n205 \nU.S. 503, 513\n, 27 S. Ct. 571; Northwestern Insurance Co. v. Wisconsin, \n275 \nU.S. 136, 140\n, 48 S. Ct. 55. And this immunity has been held to \n\n[283 U.S. 570, 577]\n\u00a0\n include bonds of a municipal corporation in a territory issued to raise money for municipal purposes, the decision being put on the ground that such a corporation is an instrumentality of the United States exercising delegated governmental powers. Farmers' & Mechanics' Savings Bank v. Minnesota, \n232 \nU.S. 516, 525\n, 34 S. Ct. 354. It also has been adjudged that bonds of municipal corporations in the several states issued to raise money for public municipal purposes, and the interest thereon, are immune from federal taxation, and this on the ground that such corporations are representatives of the states and exercise some of heir powers, and that under the implications of the Constitution the governmental agencies and operations of the states have the same immunity from federal taxation that like agencies and operations of the United States have from taxation by the states. Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 U.S. 429\n, 584-586, 601, 652, 653, 15 S. Ct. 673; Id., \n158 \nU.S. 601, 618\n, 693 S., 15 S. Ct. 912\n\n\n It has been further adjudged that the salary of an officer of the United States is immune from state taxation because the salary is the 'means by which his services are procured and retained' and its taxation by a state would burden the exertion by the United States of powers belonging to the latter. Dobbins v. Commissioner of Erie County, 16 Pet. 435, 448, 449. And 'for like reasons' it has been held that the salary of a state officer is immune from federal taxation. Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 124.\n Other applications of the principle are shown in cases where it has been ruled that a state excise on the transmission of telegrams is void as to messages sent by officers of the United States on public business, because the excise, \n\n[283 U.S. 570, 578]\n\u00a0\n although exacted only of the telegraph company, is, so far as it is based on the government messages, a tax on the means employed by the United States in carrying its constitutional powers into effect, Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Texas, \n105 U.S. 460\n, 466; Williams v. Talladega, \n226 \nU.S. 404, 418\n, 419 S., 33 S. Ct. 116; and that bonds exacted by a municipal corporation of a State as a condition to granting licenses the issue of which is committed by the state to such corporation cannot be taxed by the United States, even though the tax be collected only from the licensees, because such a tax would burden the exercise of a function belonging to the State and city in their governmental capacity, Ambrosini v. United States, \n187 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 23 S. Ct. 1.\n In Panhandle Oil Co. v. State of Mississippi ex rel. Knox, \n277 \nU.S. 218\n, 48 S. Ct. 451, 452, 56 A. L. R. 583, this Court was called upon to determine whether a state excise laid on the sale of gasoline, and collected only from the dealer making the sale, could be applied to sales to the United States for the use of its coast guard fleet and its veterans' hospital, and the ruling, made after much consideration, was that the excise could not be so applied consistently with the constitutional principle. The Court there held that while a state may impose a tax on a dealer 'for the privilege of carrying on trade that is subject to the power of the State,' she may not lay any tax on sales to the United States by which it 'secures the things desired for its governmental purposes,' and further: 'It is immaterial that the seller and not the purchaser is required to report and make payment to the State. Sale and purchase constitute a transaction by which the tax is measured and on which the burden rests. ... To use the number of gallons sold the United States as a measure of the privilege tax is in substance and legal effect to tax the sale. (Citing cases.) And that is to tax the United States-to exact tribute on its transactions and apply the same to the support of the State.' \n\n[283 U.S. 570, 579]\n\u00a0\n We think it follows from these decisions, particularly from the one last cited, that the sale of motorcycles to a state agency, such as a municipal corporation, for use in its police service is not subject to taxation by the United States. The maintenance of a police service by such a state agency, like the maintenance of a coast guard service by the United States is a governmental function; and that function extends-in one instance as much as in the other-to the purchase of equipment and supplies needed to render the particular service efficient. Under the constitutional principle the exertion of such a function by a state or a state agency has the same immunity from federal taxation that like exertions by the United States or its agencies have from state taxation. Here the tax is laid directly on the sale to a governmental state agency of an article purchased for governmental purposes. The sale and purchase constitute a single transaction, in which the purchaser is an essential participant. Without that participation the sale could not be effected. Thus, the transaction falls within the class which the United States cannot tax consistently with the constitutional principle.\n The decisions in Metcalf & Eddy v.

Ct. 125, cited by counsel for the government, are all distinguishable, for the taxes there in question were not laid on transactions involving an exertion of governmental functions and their bearing on governmental operations was so indirect or remote as to place them outside the principle which is applicable here.\n The question propounded in the certificate is answered in the negative.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES regards Panhandle Oil Co. v. Knox as controlling in principle and upon that ground acquiesces in this decision. \n\n[283 U.S. 570, 580]\n\u00a0\n\n Dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice STONE.\n I think the question should be answered in the affirmative. The implied immunity of one government, either national or state, from taxation by the other should not be enlarged. Immunity of the one necessarily involves curtailment of the other's sovereign power to tax. The practical effect of enlargement is commonly to relieve individuals from a tax, at the expense of the government imposing it, without substantial benefit to the government for whose theoretical advantage the immunity is invoked. Compare Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 U.S. 514\n, 522-524, 46 S. Ct. 172; South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437, 455\n, 26 S. Ct. 110, 4 Ann. Cas. 737; Union Pac. Railroad Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 30, 31; see also Missouri v. Gehner, \n281 \nU.S. 313, 323\n, 50 S. Ct. 326; Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, \n279 \nU.S. 620, 637\n, 49 S. Ct. 432.\n This is especially the case where, as here, the sole ground of the immunity is that, although the tax is an excise collected by one government from an individual normally subject to it, the incidence of the tax may conceivably be shifted to the other government. In such a case it is not clear how a recovery by the taxpayer would benefit directly the government supposed to be burdened; and the assumption of indirect benefit in the case of a tax of this type necessarily rests upon speculation rather than reality. See Lash's Products Co. v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 175\n, 49 S. Ct. 100. It is significant that neither the federal nor any state government has appeared by intervention or otherwise to support this claim of immunity in cases in which the taxpayer has urged it upon us.\n The court has many times held, as recently as in Educational Films Corporation v. Ward, \n282 \nU.S. 379\n, 51 S. Ct. 170, 75 L. Ed. -, that an excise tax, imposed directly on the individual, is not invalid because indirectly it may burden either the state or the national government. See also Willcuts v. Bunn, \n282 \nU.S. 216, 225\n, 51 S. Ct. 125; Denman v. Slayton, \n282 \nU.S. 514\n, 51 S. Ct. 269. A bequest \n\n[283 U.S. 570, 581]\n\u00a0\n to the United States or a state may be subjected to an inheritance tax by the other, United States v. Perkins, \n163 \nU.S. 625\n, 16 S. Ct. 1073; Snyder v. Bettman, \n190 \nU.S. 249\n, 23 S. Ct. 803; see Greiner v. Lewellyn, \n258 \nU.S. 384\n, 42 S. Ct. 324; although the consequent indirect burden is apparent. Even if it could be said that there is some reason, which the Court has never attempted to state, for the distinction which was made by the decision in Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi, \n277 \nU.S. 218\n, 48 S. Ct. 451, 56 A. L. R. 583, between an excise on sales to a government and one on legacies, the fact of the shifting of the burden would seem to be at least less apparent in the case of a sale.\n In the Panhandle Oil Case, it was held that this shifting of the burden of a state tax from the seller to the buyer was sufficient to render the tax invalid where the buyer was an agency of the United States, and it was assumed that the burden of the sales tax involved was so inevitably passed on to the buyer as to require this result. With this assumption economists would not, I believe, generally agree. Many hold that whether the burden of any tax paid by the seller is actually passed on to the buyer depends upon considerations so various and complex as to preclude the assumption a priori that any particular tax at any particular time is passed on. \n5\n In some conditions of the market, the burden remains with the seller, or even may be shifted back from the seller to the producer by the reduction of the producer's price, rather than forward to the consumer by an increase of the seller's price. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[283 U.S. 570, 582]\n\u00a0\n Whatever factors determine whether the burden does in fact shift, I do not think it can be said that a tax paid by the seller in any given case necessarily burdens the purchaser either more or less, because in form laid on the sale, as in the Panhandle Oil Case, or upon transportation of goods sold f. o. b. destination, as in Wheeler Lumber Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 572\n, 50 S. Ct. 419, or on manufacture alone of articles intended for sale, see Cornell v. Coyne, \n192 \nU.S. 418\n, 24 S. Ct. 383, or on both manufacture and sale.\n These considerations are, to me, persuasive that the broad rule announced in the Panhandle Oil Case ought not to be extended, even if we were not required by our own decisions to limit it; and that we ought not to strain the words of the statute to bring this case within the authority of that one. It seems to be conceded that if the tax in the present case were levied on manufacture alone, we would be bound to hold it valid, Cornell v. Coyne, supra; see Lash's Products Co. v. United States, supra.\n The rule of the Panhandle Oil Case has been limited in Wheeler Lumber Co. v. United States, supra, holding that a tax on transportation, which in that case was necessary to effect delivery by the seller, was valid because no in terms a tax on the sale, as it was in the former. Even if verbal distinction, unfounded in economic realities, must be made between the two cases so that both may stand as authoritative expositions of the Constitution, consid- \n\n[283 U.S. 570, 583]\n\u00a0\n erations of substance rather than of form should lead us to choose that one which would restrict the doctrine of the Panhandle Oil Case to the tax imposed in unqualified terms on sales to which it was applied in that case. The present tax is not levied in such terms, exclusively on sales, but is effective only when the seller both manufactures or imports and sells. With respect to the incidence of its burden on the buyer, so far as we can know, it does not differ from a tax on the manufacture of goods, payable when sold. See Lash's Products Co. v. United States, supra. I think that the Wheeler Lumber Case, rather than the Panhandle Oil Case, should control in determining its validity.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Respecting the immunity from state taxes this Court there said: 'With regard to taxation, no matter how reasonable, or how iniversal and undiscriminating, the State's inability to interfere has been regarded as established since McCulloch v.

Angell, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 399, 402]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Claude R. Branch, of Providence, R. I., Sp. Asst. to Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n[282 U.S. 399, 404]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a proceeding by the petitioner to recover compensation for property rights in water of the Niagara River alleged to have been taken by the United States for war purposes. The Niagara Falls Power Company by private grant to it, Letters Patent from the State of New York and acts of the Legislature of that State, was the owner so far as the law of New York could make it owner of land and water rights on the American side of the River above the Falls. Included in them was a power canal through which the Power Company was authorized \n\n[282 U.S. 399, 405]\n\u00a0\n to divert 10,000 cubic feet per second, at the time of the alleged taking. From this canal the petitioner, the International Paper Company, was entitled, by conveyance and lease, to draw and was drawing 730 cubic feet per second,-a right that by the law of New York was a corporeal hereditament and real estate.\n On December 28, 1917, the Secretary of War wrote to the Power Company that 'The Presid ent of the United States by virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in him, and by reason of the exigencies of the national security and defence, hereby places an order with you for and hereby requisitions the total quantity and output of the electrical power which is capable of being produced and\/or delivered by you through the use of all waters diverted or capable of being diverted through your intake canal and for your plants and machinery connected therewith.' Immediate and continuous delivery of such power was directed and it was added 'You will be paid fair and just compensation for power delivered hereunder.' At the same time an agreement was made by the Secretary of War and the Power Company, (reciting that the President has requisitioned the power as above ,) to the effect that the Secretary of War 'acting for and in behalf of the United States' until further notice waives delivery of the power to the United States on the express condition that the Power Company shall distribute such power as provided in a schedule naming companies and amounts but not naming the petitioner, and on the other side the Power Company waives all right of compensation by reason of said requisition if permitted to carry on its business and to sell consistently with the exigencies of the national security and defence. On December 29, the representative of the Secretary of War wrote to the secretary of the Power Company 'Please note that the requisition order covers also all of the water capable of being diverted through your intake canal. ... This is intended to cut \n\n[282 U.S. 399, 406]\n\u00a0\n off the water being taken by the International Paper Company and thereby increase your productive capacity.' And on December 31 telegraphed to the counsel of the petitioner 'Power Company has been directed to take water hitherto used by International Paper Co.' The petitioner had been notified of what was to happen but was allowed time to run out its stock on hand. On February 7, 1918, its use of the water ceased and was not resumed until midnight November 30, 1918, when the order of December 28 was abrogated. The Court of Claims found that the shutting off of the water from the petitioner's mill cost it $304,685.36, direct overhead expense, but gave judgment that the petition be dismissed.\n The Government has urged different defences with varying energy at different stages of the case. The latest to be pressed is that it does not appear that the action of the Secretary was authorized by Congress. We shall give scant consideration to such a repudiation of responsibility. The Secretary of War in the name of the President, with the power of the country behind him, in critical time of war, requisitioned what was needed and got it. Nobody doubts, we presume, that if any technical defect of authority had been pointed out it would have been remedied at once. The Government exercised its power in the interest of the country in an important matter, without difficulty, so far as appears, until the time comes to pay for what it has had. The doubt is rather late. We shall accept as sufficient answer the reference of the petitioner to the National Defence Act of June 3, 1916, c. 134,  120, 39 Stat. 166, 213; U. S. Code, title 50,  80 (50 USCA  80), giving the President in time of war power to place an obligatory order with any corporation for such product as may be required, which is of the kind usually produced by such corporation. \n\n[282 U.S. 399, 407]\n\u00a0\n Then it is said that there was no taking, but merely a making of arrangements by contract. But all the agreements were on the footing that the Government had made a requisition that the other party was bound to obey. Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co. v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 215, 220\n, 47 S. Ct. 581. It is said that the Power Company and the petitioner could withdraw water from the River only by license from the United States, under the Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3621, 34 Stat. 626, and that the license was revoked by what was done. But the Secretary of War did not attempt to pervrt the powers given to him in the interest of navigation and international duties to such an end. He proceeded on the footing of a full recognition of the Power Company's rights and of the Government's duty to pay for the taking that he purported to accomplish. There is no room for quibbling distinctions between the taking of power and the taking of water rights. The petitioner's right was to the use of the water; and when all the water that it used was withdrawn from the petitioner's mill and turned elsewhere by government requisition for the production of power it is hard to see what more the Government could do to take the use. It is true that the petitioner did not come within the scope of the Government's written promise to pay. But the Government purported to be using its power of eminent domain to acquire rights that did not belong to it and for which it was bound by the Constitution to pay. It promised to pay for all the power that the canal could generate. If it failed to realize that the petitioner had a right to a part of the power, its clear general purpose and undertaking was to pay for the rights that it took when it took the power. Phelps v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 341, 343\n, 47 S. Ct. 611; Campbell v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 368, 370\n, 371 S., 45 S. Ct. 115; United States v. Great \n\n[282 U.S. 399, 408]\n\u00a0\n Falls Manufacturing Co., \n112 \nU.S. 645, 656\n, 5 S. Ct. 306. Of course it does not matter that by a subordinate arrangement it directed the use of the power to companies that would fulfill its purposes rather than to machinery of its own. That arrangement it was able to make only because it took the power.\n We perceive no difficulty arising from the case of Omnia Commercial Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 502\n, 43 S. Ct. 437. There the taking of the whole product of a company went no further than to make it practically impossible for that company to keep a collateral contract to deliver a certain amount of steel to the appellant. But here the Government took the property that the petitioner owned as fully as the Power Company owned the residue of the water power in the canal. Our conclusion upon the whole matter is that the Government intended to take and did take the use of all the water power in the canal; that it relied upon and exercised its power of eminent domain to that end; that, purporting to act under that power and no other, it promised to pay the owners of that power, and that it did not make the taking any less a taking for public use by its logically subsequent direction that the power should be delivered to private companies for work deemed more useful than the manufacture of paper for the exigencies of the national security and defence.

It is $500 a year for each vehicle seating more than twenty and less than thirty passengers. The tax for eight such busses was demanded of Interstate Transit, Inc., an Ohio corporation which operates, exclusively in interstate commerce, a line from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Atlanta, Ga. The company made a quarterly payment under protest, and brought this suit to recover the amount paid, on the ground that the statute as applied violates the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 3). The trial court allowed recovery, but its judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of the state. 161 Tenn. 56, 29 S.W.(2d) 257. The case is here on appeal.\n While a state may not lay a tax on the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce, Sprout v. South Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 163\n, 48 S. Ct. 502, 62 A. L. R. 45, it may impose even upon motor vehicles engaged exclusively in interstate commerce a charge, as compensation for the use of the public highways, which is a fair contribution to the cost of constructing and maintaining them and of regulating the traffic thereon. Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160, 168\n, 169 S., 37 S. Ct. 30; Clark v. Poor, 274 U. S. \n\n[283 U.S. 183, 186]\n\u00a0\n 554, 47 S. Ct. 702; Sprout v. South Bend, supra, pages 169, 170 of \n277 U.S. 48\n S. Ct. 502. As such a charge is a direct burden on interstate commerce, the tax cannot be sustained unless it appears affirmatively, in some way, that it is levied only as compensation for use of the highways or to defray the expense of regulating motor traffic. This may be indicated by the nature of the imposition, such as a mileage tax directly proportioned to the use, Interstate Busses Copr. v. Blodgett, \n276 \nU.S. 245\n, 48 S. Ct. 230, or by the express allocation of the proceeds of the tax to highway purposes, as in Clark v. Poor, supra,1 or otherwise. Where it is shown that the tax is so imposed, it will be sustained unless the taxpayer shows that it bears no reasonable relation to the privilege of using the highways or is discriminatory. Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 612\n, 35 S. Ct. 140; Interstate Busses Corp. v. Blodgett, \n276 U.S. 245\n, 250-252, 48 S. Ct. 230. Compare Interstate Busses Corp. v. Holyoke Street Ry., \n273 \nU.S. 45, 51\n, 47 S. Ct. 298. But the mere fact that the ax falls upon one who uses the highway is not enough to give it presumptive validity.\n A detailed examination of the statute under which the tax here challenged was laid makes it clear that the charge was imposed, not as compensation for the use of the highways, but for the privilege of doing the interstate bus business. Chapter 89 of the Public Acts of 1927 deals with practically all of the taxes laid by the state, except those relating to highways. It is entitled 'An Act do provide for General Revenue for the State of Tennessee and the counties and municipalities thereof, to be known as the General Revenue Bill.' The scope of this statute conforms to the title. It consists of twenty-one sections. \n\n[283 U.S. 183, 187]\n\u00a0\n The first three impose general property, inheritance, and merchants' capital taxes. Section 4, under which the tax challenged is laid, declares 'that each vocation, occupation and business hereinafter named in this section, is hereby declared to be a privilege. and the rate of taxes on such privileges shall be as hereinafter fixed.' Then follows a schedule occupying 53 pages, in which 160 businesses are arranged, in the main, alphabetically, and in which the several motorbus businesses have their appropriate places. This is followed by six additional sections which deal exclusively with similar privilege taxes. The remaining sections relate to enforcement.\n The tax on interstate busses is of the same character as the tax laid for the privilege of engaging in every other line of business. The taxes for the several businesses range from $2.50 to $5,000, and, since they differ widely in amount even for the same business, appear to be graduated according to the assumed earning capacity. In most, the amount demanded increases with the population of the city, town, or district in which the business is carried on. For some a different basis of gauging probable earning power is adopted. On warehouses the tax is graduated according to storage capacity. On theaters it is graduated according to seating capacity. On the business of operating busses it likewise varies according to seating capacity. The latter tax is specified separately for interstate busses, for intrastate busses operating in more than one county, and for those operating in a single county. But this separation appears to be made solely because of the allocation of the proceeds of the tax. \n2\n For the rate of taxation is the same for each, and varies solely with the carrying capacity of the bus; there being steep \n\n[283 U.S. 183, 188]\n\u00a0\n increases from $50 a year for one carrying not more than five passengers to $750 for one carrying over thirty. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The conclusion that the tax challenged is laid for the privilege of doing business and not as compensation for the use of the highways is confirmed by contrasting section 4 of the 1927 act with those statutes which admittedly provide for defraying the cost of constructing and maintaining highways and regulating traffic thereon. The former declares specifically in connection with the privilege tax on interstate uss es that the proceeds 'shall go and belong exclusively to the General Funds of the State.' On the other hand, in the legislation by which Tennessee has provided for defraying the cost of constructing and maintaining the state highways and regulating motor traffic, it has been the consistent practice to prescribe that moneys raised for this purpose shall be segregated and go into the highway fund. The present system of motor regulations was inaugurated in 1915.4 At the same session, the Legislature created a State Highway Commission with power to construct and maintain highways. \n5\n In \n\n[283 U.S. 183, 189]\n\u00a0\n these statutes and in many later ones-prescribing additional fees for the registration and licensing of motor vehicles,6 imposing gasoline taxes,7 laying a one-mill road tax,8 and authorizing the issue of bonds for the construction of highways and bridges9-the Legislature provided that the proceeds of the fees, taxes, and bonds, and of the tolls collected on bridges, should be set apart as state highway and bridge funds to be expended by the commission exclusively for the construction and maintenance of highways or bridges. The absence in section 4 of this provision, which characterizes almost every other Tennessee statute relating to the construction and maintenance of highways, or the regulation of motor vehicle traffic, is additional evidence that the present tax was not exacted for such purposes, but merely as a privilege tax on the carrying on of interstate business. \n\n[283 U.S. 183, 190]\n\u00a0\n It is suggested that a tax on busses graduated according to carrying capacity is common and is a reasonable measure of compensation for use of the highways. It is true that such a measure is often applied in taxing motor vehicles engaged in intrastate commerce. \n10\n n Being free to levy occupation taxes, states may tax the privilege of doing an intrastate bus business without regard to whether the charge imposed represents merely a fair compensation for the use of their highways. Compare Gundling v. Chicago, \n177 \nU.S. 183, 189\n, 20 S. Ct. 633. But since a state may demand of one carrying on an interstate bus business only fair compensation for what it gives, such imposition, although termed a tax, cannot be tested by standards which generally determine the validity of taxes. Being valid only if compensatory, the charge must be necessarily predicated upon the use made, or to be made, of the highways of the state. Clark v. Poor, supra. In the present act the amount of the tax is not dependent upon such use. It does not rise with an increase in mileage traveled, or even with the number of passengers actually carried on the highways of the state. Nor is it related to the degree of wear and tear incident to the use of motor vehicles of different sizes and weights, except in so far as this is indirectly affected by carrying capacity. \n11\n The tax is proportioned solely to the earning capacity of the vehicle. Accordingly, there is here no sufficient relation between the measure employed and the extent or manner of use to justify holding that the tax was a charge made merely as compensation for the use of the highways by interstate busses. We need not therefore consider whether the tax exacted from this appellant is unreasonably large or unjustly discriminatory.\n Reversed. \n\n[283 U.S. 183, 191]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Ohio statute there involved declared that the taxes were laid, and were to be used only for, the maintenance and repair of highways and for the regulation of motor traffic. Ohio General Code,  614-94, 614-96. The 'other purposes,' referred to in the opinion, 274 U. S. at page 557, 47 S. Ct. 702, were the general expenses of the state motor vehicle department as distinguished from expenditures specifically upon the highways. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Where an intrastate bus operates for more than half of its total mileage on a county maintained road, the act provides that one-half of the tax shall be retained by the county for road purposes. But taxes collected from interstate busses are not so allocated. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Four intermediate classifications are provided: $100 for busses carrying between five and ten passengers; $200 for one carrying between ten and fifteen; $350 for one carrying between fifteen and twenty; and the tax in suit, $500 for a bus carrying between twenty and thirty passengers. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] In 1915 an annual registration fee based upon seating capacity was required of all automobile owners.

The fact that the state may still have power to equalize the treatment of the petitioners and the competing domestic corporations by compelling the latter to pay hereafter the unpaid balance of the amounts assessed against them in 1919, 1920, 1921, and 1922 is not material. The petitioners' rights were violated, and the causes of action arose, when taxes at the lower rate were collected from their competitors. It may be assumed that all ground for a claim for refund would have fallen if the state, promptly upon discovery of the discrimination, had removed it by collecting the additional taxes from the favored competitors. By such collection the petitioners' grievances would have been redressed; for these are not primarily overassessment. The right invoked is that to equal treatment; and such treatment will be attained if either their competitors' taxes are increased or their own reduced. But it is well settled that a taxpayer who has been subjected to discriminatory taxation through the favoring of others in violation of federal law cannot be required himself to assume the burden of seeking an increase of the taxes which the others should have paid.

The Supreme Court of Iowa held that the right to complain of this discrimination had been lost by failure to avail of the method of review prescribed by the state. We have no occasion to consider this matter, as we hold that the more favorable taxation of the competing domestic corporations entitles the petitioners to the relief sought. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Iowa court describes (232 N. W. at page 451) the functions of the several taxing officers: 'The assessment is made in the first instance by the local assessor, who lists and classifies the property and makes valuations. He then lays the assessment rolls before the local board of review. The local board of review adjusts the assessments 'in such manner as to secure the listing of property at its actual value and the assessment of property at its taxable value' and adds 'to the assessment rolls any taxable property not included therein ... as the assessor should have done.' Code Supp. 1913,  1366, 1370. When the corrections have been made, the assessor makes up the assessor's book and returns it to the county auditor together with the assessment rolls. Id.  1366. The county board of review equalizes class valuations between political subdivisions of the county, and the state board of review equalizes between the counties. Id. Code 1897,  1375, 1379. The classification and assessment by the assessor, as approved by the board of review, determines the levy or rate to be applied. ... The assessments and the rate to be paid by the several taxpayers as between themselves are complete and are determined when the assessor returns the assessment rolls and assessment book to the county auditor, subject to class modification by the county and state boards of review and to change by the court if appeal has been taken. The remainder of the process of taxation is one of collection and enforcement of the taxes as so assessed. This is ministerial. The auditor's duty is to transcribe the assessments into the tax book and make the necessary computations and extensions and clerical corrections. This duty is merely clerical and ministerial.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Rippey v. Texas, \n193 \nU.S. 504, 509\n, 24 S. Ct. 516, 517, citing Missouri v. Dockery, \n191 \nU.S. 165, 171\n, 24 S.

Watkins, of Fort Worth, Tex., for Isaacs.\n Mr. John R. Duty, of Rogers, Ark., for Hobbs Tie & Timber Co.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this cause the Circuit Court of Appeals certified the following question:\n'After the bankruptcy court has acquired jurisdiction of the estate of the bankrupt and the referee therein has entered an order requiring sale, by the trustee, of all of the property of the bankrupt but before the trustee has taken any steps to sell land ( part of such estate) en- \n\n[282 U.S. 734, 736]\n\u00a0\n tirely located in another judicial district, can a suit to foreclose a valid mortgage thereon be commenced and an order of sale thereunder be made over the objection of the trustee, by the court of the latter district?'\n\n This Court ordered that the entire record be sent up.\n The question correctly states the issue rie d in the District Court which entered the judgment from which the trustee appealed.\n Henrietta E. Cunningham was adjudged bankrupt in the Northern District of Texas. The estate embraces land situate in the Western District of Arkansas. B. K. Isaacs was elected trustee. Thereafter appellee, the holder of a note secured by a mortgage on the said land, instituted foreclosure proceedings in a state court of Arkansas. It named the bankrupt and Isaacs, the trustee, as defendants, recited the bankruptcy proceeding in the Texas district, and that it had not filed its secured note as a claim therein.\n The bankrupt and the trustee specially appeared and petitioned for removal of the cause to the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas. After removal the trustee filed an answer in which he set up, inter alia, his right and title as trustee, his lack of information as to the execution of the note and mortgage, and the fact that the land had been scheduled in the Texas District Court as an asset of the bankrupt. He further averred that as trustee he had taken and then held peaceable possession of the land; that there was an equity in the same above the mortgage debt; that a sale in foreclosure would prejudice the rights of general creditors; that he required time for investigation as to the most favorable method of sale; that neither he nor the bankruptcy court had consented to the foreclosure of the mortgage; that the bankruptcy court had entered an order authorizing him to sell the land; that that court had exclusive jurisdiction to ascertain the facts and administer the property; that the federal District Court in Ar- \n\n[282 U.S. 734, 737]\n\u00a0\n kansas could proceed no further than to ascertain the interests of the defendants, the validity of the mortgage lien, and the amount of the debt. The answer prayed that after these preliminary steps the court should refuse an order of sale, because of its want of jurisdiction to enter one.\n On motion of the plaintiff the court struck out so much of the answer as sought to delay judgment and sale, and entered, on the pleadings, a decree of foreclosure and sale containing a proviso that, if there should be any surplus of purchase money, over the amount of the judgment, interest, and costs, the same should be paid to the trustee.\n Upon adjudication, title to the bankrupt's property vests in the trustee with actual or constructive possession, and is placed in the custody of the bankruptcy court. Mueller v. Nugent, \n184 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 22 S. Ct. 269. The title and right to possession of all property owned and possessed by the bankrupt vests in the trustee as of the date of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, no matter whether situated within or without the district in which the court sits. Robertson v. Howard, \n229 \nU.S. 254, 259\n, 260 S., 33 S. Ct. 854; Wells & Co. v. Sharp (C. C. A.) 208 F. 393; Galbraith v. Robson-Hilliard Grocery Co. ( C. C. A.) 216 F. 842. It follows that the bankruptcy court has exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the property of the bankrupt estate. It may order a sale of real estate lying outside the district. Robertson v. Howard, supra; In re Wilka (D. C.) 131 F. 1004. When this jurisdiction has attached, the court's possession cannot be affected by actions brought in other courts. White v. Schloerb, \n178 \nU.S. 542\n, 20 S. Ct. 1007; Murphy v. John Hofman Co., \n211 \nU.S. 562\n, 29 S. Ct. 154; Dayton v. Stanard, \n241 \nU.S. 588\n, 36 S. Ct. 695. This is but an application of the well-recognized rule that, when a court of competent jurisdiction takes possession of property through its officers, this withdraws the property from the jurisdiction of all other courts which, though of concurrent jurisdiction, may not disturb that possession; and \n\n[282 U.S. 734, 738]\n\u00a0\n that the court originally acquiring jurisdiction is competent to hear and determine all questions respecting title, possession, and control of the property. Murphy v. John Hofman Co., supra; Wabash R. R. Co. v. Adelbert Collee, \n208 \nU.S. 38\n, 28 S. Ct. 182; Harkin v. Brundage, \n276 \nU.S. 36\n, 48 S. Ct. 268. Thus, while valid liens existing at the time of the commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding are preserved, it is solely within the power of a court of bankruptcy to ascertain their validity and amount and to decree the method of their liquidation. In re City Bank of New Orleans, 3 How. 292; Houston v. City Bank of New Orleans, 6 How. 486; Ray v. Norseworthy, 23 Wall. 128; In re Wilka, supra; Nisbet v. Federal Title & Trust Co. (C. C. A.) 229 F. 644. The exercise of this function necessarily forbids interference with it by foreclosure proceedings in other courts, which, save for the bankruptcy proceeding, would be competent to that end. As mortgaged property ordinarily lies within the district in which the bankruptcy court sits, and the mortgagee can consequently be served with its process, the procedure usually followed is for that court to restrain the institution of foreclosure proceedings in any other. \n1\n Where the land lies outside the limits of the district in which the bankruptcy court sits, ancillary proceedings may be instituted in the District Court of the United States for the district in which the land is, and an injunction against foreclosure issued by the court of ancillary jurisdiction. In re Patterson Lumber Co. (D. C.) 228 F. 916; Id. (D. C.) 247 F. 578. Compare Security Mortgage Co. v. Powers, \n278 \nU.S. 149\n, 49 S. Ct. 84. Such injunctions are granted solely for the reason that the court in which foreclosure proceedings are instituted is without jurisdiction, after adjudi- \n\n[282 U.S. 734, 739]\n\u00a0\n cation of bankruptcy, to deal with the land or liens upon it save by consent of the bankruptcy court. The appellant-trustee might have instituted ancillary proceedings in the District Court for the Western District of Arkansas and there obtained an injunction to restrain the appellee from foreclosing its mortgage. There is no reason, however, why he should not have followed the course here pursued, of pleading the adjudication in Texas in abatement of the foreclosure proceeding. The state court in which the foreclosure action was begun was without jurisdiction to pursue it. Upon removal into the federal court upon the ground of diversity of citizenship, the latter court had no higher or different right to interfere with the bankruptcy administration than had the state court. The answer of the trustee stated a valid defense, and it was error to enter judgment against him on the pleadings.\n Appellee asserts that, inasmuch as the appellant removed the cause into the federal court, he waived any lack of jurisdiction in that court and estopped himself to set up exclusive jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. There is no merit in this contention. The jurisdiction in bankruptcy is made exclusive in the interest of the due administration of the estate and the preservation of the rights of both secured and unsecured creditors. This fact places it beyond the power of the court's officers to oust it by surrender of property which has come into its possession. Whitney v. Wenman, \n198 \nU.S. 539\n, 25 S. Ct. 778; In re Schermerhorn (C. C. A.) 145 F. 341. Indeed, a court of bankruptcy itself is powerless to surrender its control of the administration of the estate. United States F. & G. Co. v. Bray. \n225 \nU.S. 205\n, 32 S. Ct. 620. The action of the trustee in removing the cause could not, therefore, divest the Texas District Court of its jurisdiction.\n The judgment of the District Court must be reversed, and the cause remanded to that court, for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In re Pittelkow (D.

O'Sullivan, of Kansas City, Mo., for Buck and others.\n Mr. Charles M. Blackmar, of Kansas City. Mo., for Jewell-La Salle Realty Co.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, and one of its members sued the Jewell-La Salle Realty Company in the federal court for Western Missouri for an unauthorized orchestral performance of a musical composition for which they held the exclusive nondramatic performing rights. The infringement was proved, but there was no showing of actual damages. The defendant contended that the plaintiffs were entitled to only $10 statutory damages; the plaintiffs that $250 was the minimum allowable under the Copyright Act of 1909 (17 USCA  1-62). The court granted an injunction and awarded $250 damages (D. C.) 32 F.(2d) 366, 368. The defendant appealed; and the Circuit Court of Appeals certified questions numbered II, III, and IV, relating to the subject of damages. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Question II. 'In a case disclosing infringement of a copyright covering a musical composition, there being no proof of actual damages, is the court bound by the minimum amount of $250 set out in the so-called 'no other case' clause of Section 25(b) of the Copyright Act (17 U. S. C.  25 ), reading, 'and such damages shall in no other case exceed the sum of $5, 000 nor be less than the sum of $250, and shall not be regarded as a penalty?\" \n\n[283 U.S. 202, 204]\n\u00a0\n The provision referred to is section 25 of the Act of March 4, 1909, c. 320, 35 Stat. 1075, 1081, as amended by the ct o f August 24, 1912, 37 Stat. 488, 489, 17 USCA  25(b), which provides:\n'That if any person shall infringe the copyright in any work protected under the copyright laws of the United States such person shall be liable: ...\n\n'(b) To pay to the copyright proprietor such damages as the copyright proprietor may have suffered due to the infringement, ... or in lieu of actual damages and profits such damages as to the court shall appear to be just, and in assessing such damages the court may, in its discretion, allow the amounts as hereinafter stated, but (here follow limitations applicable specifically to newspaper reproductions of photographs, and certain motion picture infringements of undramatized or nondramatic work and of copyrighted dramatic or dramatic-musical work), and such damages shall in no other case exceed the sum of $5,000 nor be less than the sum of $250, and shall not be regarded as a penalty. But the foregoing exceptions shall not deprive the copyright proprietor of any other remedy given him under this law, nor shall the limitation as to the amount of recovery apply to infringements occurring after the actual notice to a defendant, either by service of process in a suit or other written notice served upon him.'\n\n Then follows the so-called schedule, of which the fourth item is:\n'In the case of a dramatic or dramaticomusical or a choral or orchestral composition, $100 for the first and $50 for every subsequent infringing performance; in the case of other musical compositions $10 for every infringing performance.'\n\n The Copyright Act confers two monopolies-that of making copies and that of giving public performances for profit. it was settled in Westerman Co. v. Dispatch Printing Co., \n249 \nU.S. 100\n, 39 S. Ct. 194, which dealt with the infringe- \n\n[283 U.S. 202, 205]\n\u00a0\n ment by a newspaper of the monopoly of copying, that for each publication $ 250 is the minimum damages. An unbroken line of decisions in the lower courts has since held that the rule declared in the Westerman Case is applicable also to infringement of the monopoly of giving public performances. It is now contended that, as applied to performances, the rule is burdensome and unreasonable; that it was followed unwillingly2 by the lower courts in the mistaken belief that the Westerman Case required them to do so; that the legislative history of section 25, when considered in the light of earlier Copyright Acts, indicates that the fourth subdivision, relating to musical compositions, was not intended to be controlled by the maximum and minimum provisions of the so-called 'no other case' clause; and that the decision in the Westerman Case is not decisive of the question certified.\n The argument is that section 25 was a codification of section 4965 and section 4966 of the Revised Statutes, which embodied a distinction recognized in earlier acts between the imposition of penalties for copying, and the awarding of damages for performing; that there is no language in section 25 indicating an intention to apply the maximum and minimum provisions, theretofore contained in the penal section 4965 which dealt with unauthorized copying, to cases falling \n\n[283 U.S. 202, 206]\n\u00a0\n within the former remedial section 4966 which gave damages for unauthorized performing; and that a contrary intention appears from the House Report of the 1909 act. \n3\n This argument overlooks the fact that the primary purpose of section 25 was to incorporate in one section all of the civil remedies theretofore given, including statutory damages where actual proof was lacking. It is true that the second subdivision, involved in the Westerman Case, had been part of the old penal section 4965 of the Revised Statutes. But there is nothing to show an intention to exclude the infringements mentioned in the other subdivisions from the operation of the maximum and minimum clause. The history of the section, as revealed in the extended hearings which preceded the act of 1909, makes the contrary clear. \n4\n We are of opinion that the maximum and minimum provisions were intended to be applicable alike to all types of \n\n[283 U.S. 202, 207]\n\u00a0\n infringement except those for which the section makes other specific provision.\n It is urged, however, that under such interpretation the suggested measure of $10 a performance, scheduled in the fourth subdivision of section 25, would not be applicable unless more than twenty-five infringing performances were proved. This appears to be the meaning of the section, read as a whole, particularly since the amounts in the scheduled subdivisions appear to have been inserted merely as an aid to the court in awarding such damages as 'shall appear to be just.' \n5\n The definite specification of a maximum and minimum in every case, is not contradicted in any way by these legislative suggestions as to what may be deemed reasonable allowances in cases falling within the prescribed limitations. See Westerman v. Dispatch Printing Co., \n249 \nU.S. 100, 106\n, 109 S., 39 S. Ct. 194. If as \n\n[283 U.S. 202, 208]\n\u00a0\n applied to musical compositions, the provisions of the entire section have proved unreasonable, the remedy lies with Congress. \n6\n Question II is answered in the affirmative.\n Question III. 'Is section 25(b) Fourth of the Copyright Act (17 U. S. C.  25), applicable in the discretion of the Court, to a case disclosing infringement of copyright covering a musical composition, there being no proof of actual damage?'\n This question has in part been necessarily answered by our discussion of question II, for, unless the number of infringing performances of a copyrighted musical composition exceeds twenty-five, the minimum allowance of $250 must be made. Where more than twenty-five infringing performances are proved, and there is no showing as to actual loss, the court must allow the statutory minimum, and may, in its sound discretion, employ the scheduled $10 a performance as a basis for assessing additional damages. See Westerman v. Dispatch Printing Co., \n249 \nU.S. 100, 106\n, 39 S. Ct. 194. Subject to this limitation, question III is answered in the affirmative.\n Question IV. 'In Section 25(b) of the Copyright Act (17 U. S. C.  25) is the clause reading, 'nor shall the limitation as to the amount of recovery apply to infringements occurring after the actual notice to a defendant,' confined in its scope to the particular cases of infringement theretofore specifically mentioned in said Section 25(b)?' \n\n[283 U.S. 202, 209]\n\u00a0\n Inasmuch as the plaintiffs did not ask for more than the minimum statutory damages of $250, and did not appeal from the decree awarding only this sum, the question whether the court might have awarded more than the maximum of $5,000 is not properly raised upon the facts presented in this certificate. We have no occasion to consider it. Dillon v. Strathearn S. S. Co., \n248 \nU.S. 182, 184\n, 39 S. Ct. 83; Reinecke v. Gardner, \n277 \nU.S. 239, 245\n, 48 S. Ct. 472; White v. Johnson, \n282 \nU.S. 367, 371\n, 51 S. Ct. 115.\n As to question IV, the certificate is dismissed.\n Question II, Yes.\n Question III, Yes.\n Question IV, not answered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The relief for the infringement was sought in the seventh count of the bill referred to in No. 139, decided this day. \n283 \nU.S. 191\n, 51 S. Ct. 410. The question here discussed was raised by a cross- appeal. The several questions presented by Nos. 138, 139, and 140 were embraced in a single certificate, but separate briefs were filed. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Defendant relies upon statements in several cases in which the courts have commented upon the ambiguity or severity of the Act. See Waterson, Berlin & Synder Co. v. Tollefson (D. C.) 253 F. 859; M. Witmark & Sons v. Pastime Amusement Co. (D. C.) 298 F. 470, 471, 481; Buck v. Jarvis ( E. D. Va. decided March 23, 1927) not for publication; Dreamland Ball Room, Inc., v. Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. (C. C. A.) 36 F.(2d) 354, 355. Compare Irving Berlin, Inc., v. Daigle (C. C. A.) 31 F.(2d) 832, 835. But in all of these cases the Westerman decision was followed. Occasionally, where the statutory measure appeared burdensome under the circumstances, courts have reduced or refused to allow counsel fees. Fred Fisher, Inc., v. Dillingham (D. C.) 298 F. 145, 152; Cravens v. Retail Credit Men's Ass'n ( D. C) 26 F.(2d) 833, 836. But see M. Witmark & Sons v. Calloway (D. C.) 22 F.(2d) 412, 415. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See H. Rep. No. 2222, 60th Cong. 2d Sess. February 22, 1909, p. 15. The statement relied upon is: 'The provision that in lieu of actual damages and profit such damages shall be awarded as shall appear to the court just, not exceeding the sum of $5,000, is a modification of existing law, decreasing instead of increasing the amount which may be obtained in this way.' Defendant contends that this sentence indicates an intention to continue the distinction between scheduled damages for unauthorized performances, and penalties for copying; the latter having been limited by the Act of March 2, 1895, c. 194, 28 Stat. 965, to $10,000. Compare infra, note 4. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] The suggested consolidation of Rev. Stat.  4965 and section 4966 was repeatedly attacked throughout the hearings which lasted three years. See Arguments before the Committee on Patents, on S. 6330 and H. R. 19853, 59th Cong. 1st Sess. June 6-9, 1906, pp. 124, 137, 177; Id., December 7-11, 1906, pp. 36, 144, 176. Compare Id., March 26-28, 1908, pp. 21, 362. This section was, however, retained in the bill. See H. Rep. No. 2222, supra, note 3, pp. 15, 16; Sen. Rep. No. 1108, 60th Cong. 2d Sess. p. 15. In commenting on the bill, which was the result of a series of conferences called by the Librarian of Congress, the latter said, concerning the remedies for infringements: 'One inconvenience is that they (the existing statutes) provide a different class of remedies and recoveries for different subject-matter; another is that they confuse the duty of the Government to punish a deliberate infringement ... with the right of the copyright proprietor for compensation for his particular loss. The bill attempts to provide uniform remedies, and it divorces the civil action from the criminal.' Arguments before the Committees on Patents, supra, June 6-9, 1906, p. 13. Compare Ann. Rep. of Register of Copyrights (1929) pp. 12-14. The provision to which reference was made was Rev. Stat.  4965, as amended by the Act of March 2, 1895, c. 194, 28 Stat. 965, which provided that one-half of all penalties collected should accrue to the United States. This section was repealed by section 63 (35 Stat. 1088) of the 1909 act. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] As originally proposed in June, 1906, the present act provided for a maximum and minimum applicable to all types of infringement, and, in the then appended schedule, for an additional minimum in the case of 'a dramatic or musical composition, (of) not less than one hundred dollars for the first and fifty dollars for every subsequent infringing performance.' Thus, where more than four infringing performances were proved, this original schedule may have imposed a higher minimum in such cases than the main clause. See section 23, S. 6330, 59th Cong. 1st Sess. in Arguments before the Committees on Patents, supra, note 4, p. ix. As finally enacted, it furnished merely a guide for the court's discretion. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The Westerman Case was decided in 1919. Since that time there have been repeated proposals to amend and\/or completely revise the Copyright Act. See Ann. Rep. Register of Copyrights (1928), pp. 6-11; Id. (1929), pp. 16-24; Id. (1930), pp. 8-13. No suggested elimination of the minimum provision has been found. Compare H. R. 11852, 71st Cong. 2d Sess.  10; H. R. 12549,  14(c) and (d), in H. Rep. No. 1732, 71st Cong. 2d Sess. pp. 8- 9; Sen. Rep. 1732, Id., on H. R. 12549,  14(c) and (e) as amended. \n\n\n\n\n","82":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKANSAS CITY SOUTHERN RY. CO. v. U.S.(1931)\nNo. 517\nArgued: January 16, 1931Decided: February 25, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 760, 761]\n\u00a0\n Messrs, Samuel W. Moore, of New York City, F. H. Moore and Cyrus Crane, both of Kansas City, Mo., for appellants.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Daniel W. Knowlton, of Washington, D. C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The suit was brought to set aside two orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission of November 4, 1929, and July 30, 1929, respectively ( 155 I. C. C. 775), relating to the transportation by carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  1 et seq.) of private passenger train cars, including so-called office cars, of other carriers free or at other than published tariff rates. The orders are the same as those under review in Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 740\n, 51 S. Ct. 297, decided this day. Treating the two orders, which deal with the same subject-matter, as substantially one requirement, the appellants challenge it 'so far as it prohibits the movement of an office car of another carrier upon such terms as the interested parties may mutually agree upon, when such office car is occupied exclusively by officers and employees of the company owning the car and traveling upon business in connection with the operation of their own railroad.' They also object to so much of the orders as purports to regulate movements which are strictly intrastate. The District Court, \n\n[282 U.S. 760, 762]\n\u00a0\n constituted as required by statute, sustained the orders of the Commission and dismissed the petition.\n This suit in the District Court for the Western District of Missouri was begun in February, 1930, some time after the suit of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company, supra, assailing the same orders, was brought in the District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. The petitioners in both suits were parties to the proceeding in which the orders of the Commission were made. The United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission made no reference in their answers in the present case to the pendency of the earlier suit, but, after decree in that suit, the Commission amended its answer herein, setting up that decision as an affirmative defense. The defense was that the Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913 (chapter 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219-221; U. S. Code, tit. 28 ,  43-47 (28 USCA  43-47)), which transferred to the several District Courts the jurisdiction to enjoin orders of the Commission, jurisdiction formerly vested in the Commerce Court, was not intended to create conflicting jurisdictions among the several District Courts and, after the jurisdiction of one District Court had been unsuccessfully invoked to enjoin an order of the Commission, to permit the jurisdiction of another District Court subsequently invoked to be exercised for a similar purpose.\n It is unnecessary to review the history of the legislation authorizing suits to be brought to set aside orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The effect of the Urgent Deficiencies Act was to redistribute the jurisdiction of the Commerce Court. Vicksburg, Shreveport & Pacific Railway Company v. Anderson-Tully Company, \n256 \nU.S. 408, 414\n, 41 S. Ct. 524. The venue provisions of the Urgent Deficiencies Act (U. S. Code tit. 28,  43 (28 USCA  43)) are as follows:\n'The venue of any suit brought to enforce, suspend, or set aside, in whole or in part, any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission shall be in the judicial dis- \n\n[282 U.S. 760, 763]\n\u00a0\n trict wherein is the residence of the party or any of the parties upon whose petition the order was made, except that where the order does not relate to transportation or is not made upon the petition of any party the vanue shall be in the district where the matter complained of in the petition before the commission arises, and except that where the order does not relate either to transportation or to a matter so complained of before the commission the matter covered by the order shall be deemed to arise in the district where one of the petitioners in court has either its principal office or its principal operating office. In case such transportation relates to a through shipment the term 'destination' shall be construed as meaning final destination of such shipment.'\n\n We find no provision of the applicable statutes which deprives a District Court of jurisdiction of a suit brought by a party entitled to attack an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission in accordance with these provisions as to venue. But the existence of jurisdiction does not mean that it must be exercised and that grounds may not be shown for staying the hand of the Court. Compare Langnes v. Green, \n282 \nU.S. 531\n, 51 S. Ct. 243, decided Feb. 24. The appellants, upon proper application, could have been allowed to intervene in the earlier suit brought for the same purpose in the District Court for the Western District of Kentucky (U. S. Code. tit. 28,  45a (28 USCA  45a)), and could have presented there all of their grounds of attack upon the orders in question. The orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission may apply throughout the country, and there may be cases where the convenience of the parties and the interests of justice may make appropriate separate suits by different parties affected by the same order. The question is thus one for the sound discretion of the District Court, in which such a suit is brought, to determine whether it should be permitted to continue or proceedings therein should be stayed, pending the final outcome of \n\n[282 U.S. 760, 764]\n\u00a0\n an earlier suit for the same purpose, to the end that there may not be a multiplicity of suits without substantial reason. As, however, the defendants here did not raise the question of the pendency of the earlier suit until the day of final hearing, several months after the suit was begun, we see no reason for disturbing the action of the District Court in this respect.\n Upon the merits, the appellants present the argument that a railway company, in the transportation or movement of an office car of another carrier, acts in the capacity of a private carrier, or bailee, and retains full freedom of contract in relation to such transportation. There is no doubt that common carriers, subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, may have activities which lie outside the performance of their duties as common carriers and are not subject to the provisions of the act. Santa Fe , Prescott & Phoenix Railway Company v. Grant Brothers Construction Company, 228U. S. 177, 188, 33 S. Ct. 474; Terminal Taxicab Company v. Kutz, \n241 \nU.S. 252\n, 36 S. Ct. 583, Ann. Cas. 1916D, 765. But a common carrier dealing with transportation that is subject to the act cannot escape its statutory obligations by calling itself a private carrier as to such transportation. This applies to its transactions with other carriers. See New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Company v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n200 \nU.S. 361, 391\n, 392 S., 26 S. Ct. 272; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, \n225 \nU.S. 326, 341\n, 342 S., 32 S. Ct. 742, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 504. Upon grounds which have been stated in the opinion of the Court in the Louisville & Nashville Case, supra, we have concluded that, in view of the facts found by the Commission, the transportation of the cars in question falls within the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, and that the order of the Commission in directing the carriers to cease and desist from transporting such cars free or at less than published transportation rates was within its authority.\n With respect to the contention that the Commission's order undertakes to regulate movements of office cars in \n\n[282 U.S. 760, 765]\n\u00a0\n intrastate commerce, it is enough to say that no such complaint was made in the petition in this suit. The Commission's order is construed as intended to apply to transportation within the purview of the Interstate Commerce Act, and no different application of it is disclosed by the record.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","83":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKEATING v.

UNITED STATES(1931)\nNo. 387\nArgued: February 27, 1931Decided: April 13, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 231, 232]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Benjamin B. Pettus and H. H. Shinnick, both of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Charles B. Rugg, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioners are the sole surviving heirs of Solomon Klein and distributees of his estate. He died intestate, leaving, among other property, two parcels of land in Cook county, Ill., which, some fifteen months prior to his death, he had conveyed to his wife, Etta M. Klein, by deed, the habendum clauses of which are as follows:\n'First. To have and to hold the said lands unto the said grantee for and during the term of her natural life, and if she shall die prior to the decease of said grantor then and in that event she shall by virtue hereof take no greater or other estate in said lands and the reversion in fee in and to the same shall in that event remain vested in said grantor, his heirs, and assigns, such reversion being \n\n[283 U.S. 231, 233]\n\u00a0\n hereby reserved to said grantor and excepted from this conveyance.\n\n'Second. Upon condition and in the event that said grantee shall survive the said grantor, then and in that case only the said grantee shall by virtue of this conveyance take, have, and hold the said lands in fee simple, unto the sole use of herself, her heirs, and assigns forever.'\n\n In auditing the estate tax return of the administratrix, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue included in the gross estate the value of these two parcels of land, after deducting therefrom the value of the life estate; and the tax thereto attributable was assessed against the estate. This was paid, and a claim for refund was rejected. Thereupon petitioners sued in the Court of Claims to recover the amount. That court rendered judgment against petitioners. 42 F.(2d) 596.\n The case turns upon the meaning and application of section 402 of the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1097, which provides that the value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, etc.-\n'(c) To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, or with respect to which he has at any time created a trust, ... intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death. ...'\n\n The two clauses o the deed are quite distinct-the first conveys a life estate; the second deals with the remainder. The life estate is granted with an express reservation of the fee, which is to 'remain vested in said grantor' in the event that the grantee 'shall die prior to the decease of said grantor.' By the second clause the grantee takes the fee in the event-'and in that case only'-that she shall survive the grantor. It follows that only a life estate immediately was vested. The remainder was retained by the grantor; and whether that ever would become vested in \n\n[283 U.S. 231, 234]\n\u00a0\n the grantee depended upon the condition precedent that the death of the grantor happen before that of the grantee. The grant of the remainder, therefore, was contingent. See 2 Washburn, Real Property (4th Ed.) pp. 547, 548, 559, par. 1. The decisions of the Supreme Court of Illinois, the state where the deed was made and the property lies, support this conclusion. Haward et al. v. Peavey, 128 Ill. 430, 439, 21 N. E. 503, 15 Am. St. Rep. 120; Baley v. Strahan, 314 Ill. 213, 217, 145 N. Ed. 359.\n It is said that we must consider the deed as a whole; that, since there is nothing in the granting clause to indicate the nature of the estate granted, we must go to the habendum to determine that question; that the habendum consists of two clauses, one conveying a life estate, and the other the fee; and that 'the greater estate or fee naturally swallows up the lesser or life estate when created by the same instrument.' The principle invoked, however, does not help the petitioners, for certainly here the estates were not merged during the life of the grantor; and the deed evinces the clear intention of the grantor that they should not be. Nothing is to be gained by multiplying words in respect of the various niceties of the art of conveyancing of the law of contingent and vested remainders. It is perfectly plain that the death of the grantor was the indispensable and intended event which brought the larger estate into being for the grantee and effected its transmission from the dead to the living, thus satisfying the terms of the taxing act and justifying the tax imposed. Compare Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497\n, 50 S. Ct. 356, 69 A. L. R. 758.\n The provision of the Revenue Act of 1918, so far as it seeks to tax the transfer in question, is assailed as unconstitutional, because, it is said, the transfer was complete and irrevocable before the act was passed. In support of this view Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531\n, 47 S. Ct. 710, 52 A. L. R. 1081, and similar decisions of this court are cited. But the deed under \n\n[283 U.S. 231, 235]\n\u00a0\n review, while made before the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1918, was made after the Act of 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, 777, which, with an addition not pertinent here, contained (section 202) exactly the same provision; and the contention, for that reason, other grounds aside, is without merit.

GREEN(1931)\nNo. 38\nArgued: Decided: February 24, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 531, 532]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert E. Bronson and H. B. Jones, both of Seattle, Wash., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Winter S. Martin and Samuel B. Bassett, both of Seattle, Wash ., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, as sole owner of the fishing vessel Aloha, on February 24, 1928, brought a proceeding in the federal District Court for the Western District of Washington, praying a limitation of liability under Rev. St.  4283, 4284, 4285 (U. S. C. title 46,  183, 184, 185 (46 USCA  183-185 )), which are copied in the margin. \n1\n It was stipulated by the \n\n[282 U.S. 531, 533]\n\u00a0\n parties that the vessel was of no greater value than the sum of $5,000. After setting forth that petitioner was the sole owner of the vessel, and that the vessel was seaworthy in all respects, the petition alleged, among other things, that the respondent on October 11, 1927, had commenced an action in a superior court of the state of Washington against petitioner to recover damages in the sum of $25,000 for personal injuries suffered while employed upon said vessel. The petition for a limitation of liability was filed four months later while that action was pending, and, it is said and not denied, within two days before the date set for the trial in the state court. Following the filing of the petition, the federal District Court issued an order restraining further proceedings in the state court, and a monition to all claimants to present their claims within a time fixed. The respondent, in response to the monition, filed his claim in the amount of $25,000 for damages resulting from the personal injuries referred to above. No other claim was filed.\n Thereupon respondent moved to dissolve the restraining order upon the ground that the state court had jurisdiction of the cause; that there was only one possible \n\n[282 U.S. 531, 534]\n\u00a0\n claimant and one owner; and that petitioner, therefore, might claim and obtain the advantage and benefit of the limitation of liability statute by proper pleading in the action pending in the state court. This motion the District Court denied, and the cause in respect of respondent's claim was tried. Upon the hearing, the District Court determined that it should first inquire whether there was any liability, and, if there was, then, whether it should be limited; and, at the conclusion of respondent's evidence without taking evidence on the part of petitioner, the court held that there was no liability, and entered a decree accordingly. 32 F.(2d) 284. Respondent appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals; and that court reversed the decree and remanded the case to the District Court, with directions to dismiss it for want of jurisdiction. 35 F.(2d) 447.\n In the Court of Appeals, the decree was assailed upon the grounds (1) that, there being but one possible claim and one owner, the shipowner should have sought his remedy for a limitation of liability by proper pleading in the state court; and (2) that the record disclosed the privity and knowledge of the owner in respect of the matters and things by which the injury to respondent resulted. The court rejected the first contention upon the authority of White v. Island Transportation Co., \n233 \nU.S. 346\n, 34 S. Ct. 589; but sustained the second, holding that the pleadings and evidence disclosed that the injury complained of was occasioned with the privity and knowledge of the shipowner, and consequently the District Court was without jurisdiction.\n We are of opinion that the second contention, upon which the decree below was predicated, did not present a jurisdictional question. The District Court had jurisdiction to pass upon the sufficiency of the pleadings and to decide the question upon the evidence; and a determination thereof either way, whether right or wrong, would \n\n[282 U.S. 531, 535]\n\u00a0\n have been a determination by that court upon the merits in the proper exercise of its jurisdiction. Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, \n263 \nU.S. 291\n, 44 S. Ct. 96, and cases cited; Moore v. N. Y. Cotton Exchange, \n270 \nU.S. 593, 608\n, 46 S. Ct. 367, 45 A. L. R. 1370. In the Binderup Case the rule was stated as follows (page 305 of 263 U. S., 44 S. Ct. 96, 98):\n'Jurisdiction is the power to decide a justiciable controversy, and includes questions of law as well as of fact. A complaint, setting forth a substantial claim under a federal statute presents a case within the jurisdiction of the court as a federal court, and this jurisdiction cannot be made to stand or fall upon the way the court may chance to decide an issue as to the legal sufficiency of the facts alleged any more than upon the way it may decide as to the legal sufficiency of the facts proven. Its decision either way upon either question is predicated upon the existence of jurisdiction, not upon the absence of it. Jurisdiction, as distinguished from merits, is wanting only where the claim set forth in the complaint is so unsubstantial as to the frivolous, or, in other words, is plainly without color of merit. (Citing cases.) In that event the claim of federal right under the statute, is a mere pretense and, in effect, is no claim at all.'\n\n But we deem it unnecessary to consider the second contention further, since the conclusion to which we have come rests upon the first contention, in respect of which, for reasons presently to be stated, we are of opinion both courts below were in error.\n The preliminary objection is urged by petitioner that, since the decision below upon this point was against respondent and he has not applied for certiorari, the point is not open here for consideration; but the objection is without merit, as a brief review of the decisions of this court will disclose.\n In Irvine v. The Hesper, \n122 \nU.S. 256, 266\n, 7 S. Ct. 1177, the rule was announced without qualification that an appeal in admiralty from the District Court to the Circuit Court \n\n[282 U.S. 531, 536]\n\u00a0\n vacated the decree of the former and opened the case for a trial de novo in the latter court. At page 267 of 122 U. S., 7 S. Ct. 1177, 1182, the court said:\n'We do not think that the fact that the claimants did not appeal from the decree of the district court alters the rule. When the libelants appealed, they did so in view of the rule, and took the risk of the result of a trial of the case de novo. The whole case was opened by their appeal, as much as it would have been if both parties had appealed, or if the appeal had been taken only by the claimants.'\n\n In Reid v. Fargo, \n241 \nU.S. 544, 548\n, 36 S. Ct. 712, in an opinion by Mr. Chief Justice White, this conclusion was reaffirmed; and attention was called to the fact that a full and convincing review of the authorities on the subject was contained in the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Munson S. S. Line v. Miramar S. S. Co ., 167 F. 960. In the more recent case of Standard Oil Co. v. So. Pacific Co., \n268 \nU.S. 146, 155\n, 45 S. Ct. 465, 466, the rule was again stated in these words:\n'On appeal in admiralty, there is a trial de novo. The whole case was opened in the Circuit Court of Appeals by the appeal of the Southern Pacific Company, as much as it would have been if the Director General had also appealed.'\n\n The question then arises: What is the scope of inquiry in this court when the case is brought up by certiorari from the Circuit Court of Appeals? It has been decided that upon writ of error from an intermediate appellate tribunal we are not limited to a consideration of the points raised by the plaintiff, but 'must enter the judgment which should have been rendered by the court below on the record then before it.' Baker v. Warner, \n231 \nU.S. 588, 593\n, 34 S. Ct. 175, 177. And in Delk v. St. Louis & San Francisco R. R., \n220 \nU.S. 580, 588\n, 31 S. Ct. 617, following Lutcher & Moore Lumber Co. v. Knight, \n217 \nU.S. 257, 267\n, 30 S. Ct. 505, it \n\n[282 U.S. 531, 537]\n\u00a0\n was held that on certiorari, likewise, the entire record is before this court with power to review the action of the Court of Appeals and direct such disposition of the case as that court might have done upon the writ of error sued out for therev iew of the Circuit (now District) Court. In Watts, Watts & Co. v. Unione Austriaca, etc., \n248 \nU.S. 9, 21\n, 39 S. Ct. 1, 2, 3 A. L. R. 323, it was said that: 'This court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, has power not only to correct error in the judgment entered below, but to make such disposition of the case as justice may at this time require'; and 'the rule is the more insistent, because in admiralty cases are tried de novo on appeal.' See, also, Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286, 289\n, 44 S. Ct. 323.\n The authorities relied upon by petitioner are not to the contrary. They contain no challenge to the rule laid down in the decisions cited immediately above, but proceed upon the theory that the court is not bound to consider objections to the decree urged by respondent, in the absence of cross-petition for certiorari. In Warner Co. v. Pier Co., \n278 \nU.S. 85, 91\n, 49 S. Ct. 45, 46, where the authorities are collected, it is said:\n'Objections to the decree below were offered by counsel for respondents in their briefs and arguments here. But no application for certiorari was made in their behalf and we confine our consideration to errors assigned by the petitioner.'\n\n In Hubbard v. Tod, \n171 \nU.S. 474, 494\n, 19 S. Ct. 14, 21, the court disposed of the matter by saying:\n'And, as respondents did not apply for certiorari, we shall confine our consideration of the case to the examination of errors assigned by petitioner.'\n\n In Federal Trade Comm. v. Pac. Paper Ass'n, \n273 \nU.S. 52\n, 47 S. Ct. 255, respondents, without presenting a cross-petition for certiorari, sought a reversal of a distinct portion of the decree. This court, in declining to consider the matter, said (page 66 of 273 U. S., 47 S. Ct. 255, 259):\n\n\n[282 U.S. 531, 538]\n\u00a0\n 'A party who has not sought review by appeal or writ of error will not be heard in an appellate court to question the correctness of the decree of the lower court. This is so well settled that citation is not necessary. The respondents are not entitled as of right to have that part of the decree reviewed. (Citing cases.) And, assuming power, we are not moved by any persuasive consideration to examine the parts of the Commission's order to which respondents object.'\n These decisions simply announce a rule of practice which generally has been followed; but none of them deny the power of the court to review objections urged by respondent, although he has not applied for certiorari, if the court deems there is good reason to do so. In the present case, however, it is not necessary to consider this rule of practice because the respondent offers no objection to the decree of the Court of Appeals. In that court he attacked the decree of the District Court upon the two grounds above stated, and the Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the attack but upon one of such grounds only. Respondent here defends that decree upon the ground upon which it was based, and, in addition, continues to urge the rejected ground, not to overthrow the decree, but to sustain it. His right to do so is beyond successful challenge, quite apart from the fact that this is a proceeding in admiralty, and is here from an intermediate appellate court. United States v. American Ry. Exp. Co., \n265 U.S. 425\n, at page 435, 44 S. Ct. 560, 564, where it is said:\n'It is true that a party who does not appeal from a final decree of the trial court cannot be heard in opposition thereto when the case is brought here by the appeal of the adverse party. In other words, the appellee may not attack the decree with a view either to enlarging his own rights thereunder or of lessening the rights of his adversary, whether what he seeks is to correct an error or to supplement the decree with respect to a matter not \n\n[282 U.S. 531, 539]\n\u00a0\n dealt with below. But it is likewise settled that the appellee may, without taking a cross-appeal, urge in support of a decree any matter appearing in the record, although his argument may involve an attack upon th re asoning of the lower court or an insistence upon matter overlooked or ignored by it. By the claims now in question, the American does not attack, in any respect, the decree entered below. It merely asserts additional grounds why the decree should be affirmed.'\n\n And, obviously, the right or duty of this court to consider these additional grounds will neither be affected by their rejection in the court below nor be made to depend upon the effect finally given to them here.\n We proceed, then, to inquire what disposition the Court of Appeals should have made of the case in respect of the point under consideration upon the record which was before that court. Section 24(3) of the Judicial Code (U. S. C. title 28,  41(3), 28 USCA  41(3), confers upon the District Courts of the United States admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, 'saving to suitors in all cases the right of a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it.' The provisions of the statute in respect of limitation of liability confer upon the owner of a vessel in a variety of cases, including the present case, when loss is occasioned without the privity or knowledge of the owner, the right to limit his liability to the value of his interest in the vessel and her freight then pending. That the action brought in the state court was authorized by the first of the statutes referred to is plain. That the petition of the owner in the present case was properly brought, and that the federal court had jurisdiction to entertain it, whether there was a plurality of claims or only one, is equally clear. White v. Island Transportation Co., supra, page 351 of 233 U. S., 34 S. Ct. 589. The situation, then, is that one statute gave respondent the right to a common-law remedy, which he properly sought in the state court; and another statute \n\n[282 U.S. 531, 540]\n\u00a0\n gave petitioner the right to seek a limitation of liability in the federal District Court. Needless to say that, if the case for a limitation of liability assumes such a form that only a federal court is competent to afford relief, the jurisdiction of that court is exclusive, and must be exerted to dispose of the entire cause; and the action in the state court may not be further prosecuted.\n Here the petition alleged that petitioner feared other claims, but no other claims were filed in response to the monition; the time therefor had expired and default had been noted; and nothing appears to suggest the possibility of any other claim. On the contrary, not only does a presumption fairly arise from the nature of the accident and all the surrounding circumstances that no other claims exist, but they are such as to reflect doubt upon the good faith of the allegation that petitioner was in fear of other claims; and the fact that petitioner delayed his proceeding for four months after the commencement of the state action and until two days before the date set for the trial is confirmatory of that view. In this situation, while there is some conflict among the decisions of the lower federal courts, this court has accepted the view that, 'in a state court, when there is only one possible claimant and one owner, the advantage of this section ( 4283 (46 USCA  183)) may be obtained by proper pleading. The Lotta (D. C.) 150 F. 219, 222; Delaware River Ferry Co. v. Amos (D. C.) 179 F. 756.' Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, \n259 \nU.S. 255, 260\n, 42 S. Ct. 475, 477. See, also, American Steamboat Co. v. Chace, 16 Wall. 522, 532, 533.\n Upon the present record, the necessary result of this holding is that the state court, in the action there pending and in the due course of the exercise of its commonlaw powers, was competent to entertain a claim of the shipowner for a limitation of liability and afford him appropriate relief under the statute dealing with that subject. Compare Loughin v. McCaulley, 186 Pa. 517, 40 A. 1020, 48 L. R. A. 33, 65 Am. St. Rep. 872. Notwith- \n\n[282 U.S. 531, 541]\n\u00a0\n standing this, however, the shipwner was free to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal District Cort (White v. Island Transportation Co., supra); and, that having been done, the question which arose was not one of jurisdiction, but as will later more fully appear, was whether as a matter of discretion that jurisdiction should be exercised to dispose of the cause. shipowner was free to invoke the jurisdiction of a hard and fast rule. The Styria, Scopinich, Claimant, v. Morgan, \n186 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 22 S. Ct. 731. When invoked as a guide to judicial action, it means a sound discretion, that is to say, a discretion exercised not arbitrarily or willfully, but with regard to what is right and equitable under the circumstances and the law, and directed by the reason and conscience of the judge to a just result.\n In the case now under review, the problem presented to the District Court by the motion of respondent was quite simple. Upon the face of the record, the state court, whose jurisdiction already had attached, was competent to afford relief to the petitioner. The difference in the effect of adopting one or the other of the two alternatives presented to the District Court was obvious. To retain the cause would be to preserve the right of the shipowner, but to destroy the right of the suitor in the state court to a commonlaw remedy; to remit the cause to the state court would be to preserve the rights of both parties. The mere statement of these diverse results is sufficient to demonstrate the justice of the latter course; and we do not doubt that, in the exercise of a sound discretion, the District Court, following that course, should have granted respondent's motion to dissolve the restraining order so as to permit the cause to proceed in the state court, retaining, as a matter of precaution, the petition for a limitation of liability to be dealt with in the possible but (since it must be assumed that respondent's motion was not an idle gesture but was made with full \n\n[282 U.S. 531, 542]\n\u00a0\n appreciation of the state court's entire lack of admiralty jurisdiction) the unlikely event that the right of petitioner to a limited liability might be brought into question in the state court, or the case otherwise assume such form in that court as to bring it within the exclusive power of a court of admiralty. The failure to do this, in our opinion, constituted an abuse of discretion subject to the correcting power of the appellate court below and of this court.\n In The Lotta (D. C.) 150 F. 219, cited as authority for the rule laid down in the Sandanger Case, Judge Brawley, a capable admiralty judge, dealt with the same question in the manner here suggested, and delivered an opinion which seems to us entirely sound. In that case an action had been brought in a state court against the owner of the Lotta by an administrator to recover damages for the death of his son. The right to maintain such an action was conferred by state statute. Pending the prosecution of that action, the owner of the Lotta filed a petition in the federal District Court for a limitation of liability, and by an ex parte proceeding had the Lotta appraised, paid the appraised value into the registry of the court, and obtained an injunction restraining the prosecution of the action in the state court. After referring to the provision of law saving to suitors the right of a common-law remedy, Judge Brawley said that the plaintiff had the right to pursue his remedy in the state court, unless the act providing for a limitation of liability clearly deprived him of it; that, where there was only a single claim, there was no need for the adoption of the peculiar and exclusive jurisdiction of the admiralty court; and that an answer setting up the limitation of liability would give the shipowner the relief to which he was entitled. It appearing there, as it appears here, that only one claim had been presented, and that the time fixed by the monition had expired, the court said (pages 222, 223, of 150 F.):\n\n\n[282 U.S. 531, 543]\n\u00a0\n 'The owner of the vessel, therefore, can by answer in the state court set up as a defense that he is not liable beyond the value of the vessel, an th at value may be determined as appropriately and as easily in that court as in this. In the ex parte proceedings here the vessel has been appraised by appraisers chosen by the petitioner, and, while there may be no reason to question the fairness and fullness of such appraisement, the plaintiff is entitled to be heard on that question, and in the usual course of the common-law proceeding that issue can be fairly tried. ...\n'All that the petitioner can fairly claim is that he should not be subject to a personal judgment for an indefinite amount and beyond the value of his interest in the Lotta and her freight. There is no reason to doubt that this proper defense may be availed of in the state court, and if there is an ulterior purpose, and petitioner's object in invoking the jurisdiction of this court is to escape a jury trial and take the case away from the common-law jurisdiction, that purpose should receive no countenance here; for the act which gives this court its admiralty and maritime jurisdiction saves to suitors in all cases the right of the common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it, and good faith requires that this proviso shall have its full and fair effect.'\n\n Thereupon an order was entered dissolving the injunction against the prosecution of the action in the state court, but retaining the petition for a limitation of liability, for the reason, as the court said, that, 'if it should hereafter appear in the course of the proceedings in the state court that a question is raised as to the right of petitioner to a limited liability, this court has exclusive cognizance of such a question ... and the decision upon the question of the injunction is predicated upon the assumption that that question is not involved in the suit in the state court, and that the only questions to be de- \n\n[282 U.S. 531, 544]\n\u00a0\n cided there are, first, whether the defendant is liable at all, and, if so, as to the value of the vessel and her freight, which is the limit of defendant's liability.' See, also, Delaware River Ferry Co. v. Amos (D. C.) 179 F. 756.\n Disposition of the matter, so as to allow the action to proceed in the state court, finds warrant in like principles which have been applied in other kinds of cases. Admiralty courts, for example, have complete jurisdiction over suits of a maritime nature between foreigners. Nevertheless, 'the question is one of discretion in every case, and the court will not take cognizance of the case if justice would be as well done by remitting the parties to their home forum.'

See, also, generally, Watts, Watts & Co. v. Unione Austriaca, etc., supra; and compare the opinion of the District Court upon the point in the same case, 224 F. 188, 191. So, while the courts of this country have and may entertain jurisdiction of actions between nonresident foreigners for torts committed in a foreign country, they will exercise such jurisdiction in their discretion and only in special cases.

C. C. 245. A jury being waived, the court made findings of fact, stated its conclusions of law, and dismissed the case on the ground that the Commission's findings and order were void for lack of jurisdiction. The District Court of Appeal affirmed, 106 Cal. App. 595, 289 P. 643, the state Supreme Court ecli ned to hear the case, and this court granted a writ of certiorari, \n282 \nU.S. 833\n, 51 S. Ct. 102, 75 L. Ed. -.\n Defendant is an interstate carrier by railroad. Its lines connect with a line of a Mexican common carrier by rail extending from Navojoa, Sonora, to the international boundary at Nogales, Ariz. In 1923, defendant, in conjunction with the Foreign line, transported three carloads of cow peas from Navojoa to San Francisco. The shipments moved at different times on through bills of lading issued by the foreign line. The rate charged was $1.33 per hundred pounds, stated in a tariff joined in by the carriers and filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Department of Communications and \n\n[283 U.S. 654, 657]\n\u00a0\n Public Works of Mexico. The carriers agreed to divide the rate, 63.175 cents to the foreign line and 69.825 cents to the defendant.\n The cow peas were transported by the foreign line 377 miles to the boundary, thence by defendant 1,036 miles to destination. The defendant collected from plaintiff $3,828.74 as freight charges, and that amount was divided in accordance with the divisions agreement. The average yield on these shipments was 90 cents per car mile and 18.8 mils per ton mile for the entire distance, 1,413 miles. The average yield to the foreign line was $1.60 per car mile and to defendant 64.6 cents.\n The trial court found that defendant, by tariff filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, maintained a rate of $1.14 1\/2 applicable to carload shipments of cow peas destined to San Francisco 'originating at Nogales,' 'originating at the point where the lines' of the foreign carrier and of defendant touch the boundary or 'loaded into cars at any point upon or adjacent to said international boundary line, within the limits of defendant's railroad yards at Nogales.' The court found that the cow peas were in sacks and readily could have been transported, by means other than a railroad, to Nogales there to be loaded into cars for transportation over defendant's lines to San Francisco at the rate of $1. 14 1\/2, that the Commission had made no finding in respect of such rate, and that it was 'reasonable and lawful for application upon carload shipments of cow peas from Nogales, Arizona, including such shipments as might be loaded at any and all places within the railroad yard limits at that point, destined to San Francisco, California.'\n It was not found, and it does not appear from the record, that the defendant established or made available to shippers any rate applicable to the transportation over its lines from the boundary to San Francisco of cow peas in car loads originating at Navojoa or elsewhere in Mexico \n\n[283 U.S. 654, 658]\n\u00a0\n and delivered to defendant at such boundary point by a connecting railroad for transportation to San Francisco. The record does not disclose what, if any, rate was available for the transportation of the cow peas as a local shipment from Navojoa to Nogales. And it may not reasonably be assumed that the charges of the foreign carrier for such transportation would be less than the amount it was entitled to have out of the joint through rate under its agreement with defendant. Indeed, under the principles ordinarily applied in making divisions agreements, in the absence of a special allowance or arbitrary differential, the Foreign carrier's share of the through rate would be less than its local rate.\n If defendant's local rate of $1.14 1\/2 be deemed to be applicable to the American part of the through transportation and the foreign carrier's proportion, 63.175 cents, of the joint rate be taken as the local rate from Navojoa to the boundary, the sum of the locals would amount to slightly more than $1.77 1\/2 as against the joint through rate of $1.33. There is nothing in the record to indicate that there was available for the transportation of such cow peas any rate or combination of rates less than the rate of $1.33.\n The Commission found that at the time the cow peas were being transported defendant concurred in a rate of 94 cents per hundred pounds on garbanzo (a kind of pea) from Navojoa to San Francisco; that the rate of $1.33 for the transportation of the cow peas was unreasonable to the extent that it exceeded the 94-cent rate; that the shipments moved as described; that plaintiff paid and bore the freight charges; that so far as defendant participated in such transportation and rates it was a tort- feasor, and that it should make reparation for the damage to complainant in the sum of $1,122.72, with interest. And by its order the Commission authorized and directed defendant to pay complainant that sum. \n\n[283 U.S. 654, 659]\n\u00a0\n Defendant having refused to make reparation, plaintiff brought this action, and in its complaint alleged the transportation, the unreasonableness of the rate as found by the Commission, showed the charges paid by it to defendant, made the Commission's report and order a part of the complaint, and prayed judgment for the amount of damages found by the Commission.\n Defendant's answer admitted the transportation, the rate exacted, and the charges collected. It alleged that defendant maintained a rate applicable on cow peas in carloads from the international boundary at Nogales to San Francisco, but it did not specify that rate or state that it was reasonable. It averred that the Commission had not found such rate unjust, unreasonable, or otherwise in violation of law, and that the Commission had no jurisdiction to order the defendant to pay any reparation or damages.\n The opinion of the District Court of Appeal differentiates this case from News Syndicate Co. v. N. Y. C. R. R., \n275 \nU.S. 179\n, 48 S. Ct. 39, on the ground that it there appeared that the carrier violated the act by failing to maintain a rate to cover the transportation from the international boundary to destination, thereby compelling the shipper to pay the excessive joint through rate, and that, for the determination of damages, it was necessary for the Commission to determine the reasonableness of such rate. But the court said that in this case defendant published and maintained a rate on shipments from the boundary to destination which was not found unreasonable by the Commission, and plaintiff was not compelled to pay the joint through rate by reason of any violation of the Act on the part of the defendant.\n We are of opinion that the record shows that the Commission had jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of the joint through international rate. \n\n[283 U.S. 654, 660]\n\u00a0\n The act does not empower the Commission to prescribe or regulate such rates. It applies to international commerce only in so far as the transportation takes place within the United States. \n1\n The act applied to the transportation of the cow peas from the boundary to destination, and required defendant to establish just and reasonable rates for that service. And defendant was liable to shippers for damages resulting from its failure so to do. Interstate Commerce Act  1(1)(c), (2) and (5),  6(1), ( 7), and  8, 49 USCA  1(1)(c) (2 and 5),  6(1, 7) and  8.\n The act prohibits every excessive charge, whether exacted directly or obtained by indirection, and its provisions are designed to prevent evasion of the rule that every charge for transportation shall be just and reasonable. The collection by a common carrier of exorbitant charges is a tort (Smith v. Chicago & Northwestern Railway Co., 49 Wis. 443, 448, 5 N. W. 240), and the general rule as to liability of joint tort-feasors applies where two or more connecting carriers combine to impose excessive charges for transportation over their connecting lines Loui sville & N. R. R. v. Sloss-Sheffield Co., \n269 \nU.S. 217, 232\n, 233 S., 46 S. Ct. 73). Defendant is liable for any violation of the act by it that caused or contributed to cause damage to plaintiff without regard to the proportion of the charges attributable to the foreign transportation or paid to the foreign carrier. News Syndicate Co. v. N. Y. C. R. R., supra, pages 187, 188 of 275 U. S., 48 S. Ct. 39.\n The act does not create a cause of action based on the Commission's findings and reparation order for the recov- \n\n[283 U.S. 654, 661]\n\u00a0\n ery of money collected as freight charges based on rates alleged to be unjust and unreasonable. It makes a determination by the Commission of the unreasonableness of the rate attacked and the extent that it is, if at all excessive, a condition precedent to suit.\n Section 16(2), 49 USCA  16(2), provides that, if the carrier shall not comply with an order for the payment of money within the time specified, the person for whose benefit is was made may file in the District Court of the United States, 'or in any State court of general jurisdiction,' a petition setting forth briefly 'the causes for which he claims damages, and the order of the commission,' and that the suit in the United States court shall proceed in all respects 'like other civil suits for damages,' except that the findings and order of the Commission shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated. The section contains nothing relating to evidence or procedure in state courts. It is clear that the action is not on the award as such. Meeker & Co. v. Lehigh Valley R. R., \n236 \nU.S. 412, 430\n, 35 S. Ct. 328, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 691. But no action for damages alleged to have been caused by the exaction of excessive rates for interstate transportation can be maintained in any court, state or federal, in the absence of a prior finding by the Commission that the rate charged was unreasonable. The reasons upon which this rule rests have been fully stated in our decisions. Texas & Pac. Ry. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426, 444\n, 27 S. Ct. 350, 9 Ann. Cas. 1075; Robinson v. B. & O. R. R., \n222 \nU.S. 506, 510\n, 32 S. Ct. 114; Cf. Baltimore & O. R. R. v. U. S. ex rel. Pitcairn Coal Co., \n215 \nU.S. 481, 498\n, 30 S. Ct. 164; Great Northern Ry. v. Merchants' Elev. Co., \n259 \nU.S. 285, 291\n, 292 S., 42 S. Ct. 477.\n There is no essential difference in this respect between a claim arising out of interstate transportation and the one under consideration. The act applies to the interstate rate, and an excessive charge for the transportation covered by it is a direct and immediate violation. While \n\n[283 U.S. 654, 662]\n\u00a0\n the act does not govern the joint through international rate, the demand for reparation is grounded upon the claim that the maintenance of that rate participated in by the American carrier and its violation of the act, in failing to maintain a just and reasonable rate for the transportation from the boundary to destination, operated to compel payment of the charges based on the excessive joint rate.\n The complaint before the Commission alleged that the joint through rate was unreasonable and was charged in violation of the act. It was undoubtedly sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the Commission. The only requirement (section 13 (49 USCA  13)) is that it 'shall briefly state the facts.' Reparation proceedings before the Commission properly may be and frequently are quite informal. Many claims on account of excessive charges are dealt with and finally disposed of, without formal pleading or proof, by means of correspondence carried on by the Commission with claimants and carriers respectively. Rule III(b). Defendant did not apply to the Commission for authority to make the reparation claimed. It moved to dismiss the complaint, alleging that the Commission lacked jurisdiction over rates from points in an adjacent foreign country to points in the United States. The motion was denied on the authority of International icke l Co. v. Director General, 66 I. C. C. 627. The record does not show the contents or substance of defendant's answer referred to in the order. It does not appear what, if any, issue was joined as to the facts. It is the duty of the Commission, if there appears 'any reasonable ground for investigating' the complaint, to investigate the matters complained of 'in such manner and by such means as it shall deem proper.' Section 13. The report shows that the case was presented under shortened procedure and, having regard to the ruls of practice, this implies that there was a formal complaint, but no oral hearing. Rule X-A. The evidence referred to in \n\n[283 U.S. 654, 663]\n\u00a0\n the report fully sustains the finding that the joint through rate of $1.33 was unreasonable to the extent that it exceeded the 94-cent rate contemporaneously applied to like transportation of garbanzos.\n The trial court's findings are not sufficient to show that at the time the shipments in question moved defendant maintained a just and reasonable rate applicable to the transportation of such shipment over its lines from the international boundary to destination.\n The tariff, as described in the findings, does not purport to apply to the American part of such international transportation. A carload shipment 'originating' at Nogales or at the point where the line of the foreign carrier and that of the defendant touch the boundary or in defendant's railroad yard adjacent to the boundary clearly must be distinguished from a through carload shipment brought to defendant at the boundary by a foreign carrier. The former covers local transportation only and involves two terminal services, one at Nogales, the point where received from the shipper, and the other at San Francisco, the place where delivered to the consignee. The latter involves the transportation of a through car from the point of connection and only the one terminal service at destination. It is manifest that a tariff limited, as is that described in the findings, to shipments so originating on defendant's line does not apply to the American part of the transportation of an international shipment on a through bill of lading. It is to be presumed that, if any tariff covering that part of the through service existed, defendant would have produced it; and, in view of the facts shown, the burden was upon the carrier to bring forward evidence that a rate therefor had been established as required by the act. It follows that the lower court erred in distinguishing this case from the News Syndicate Co. v. N. Y. C. R. R., supra. That case controls this one.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The act does not authorize or forbid the making of joint through international rates. The Commission, recognizing that they are of great convenience to carriers and shippers, does not object to their maintenance if shown, together with the agreed divisions, in tariffs filed in compliance with requirements prescribed by it.

Co. and others.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Interstate Commerce Commission, June 3, 1929 (155 I. C. C. 247), and September 30, 1929 (157 I. C. C. 498), prescribed rates for the transportation of sand, gravel, and other named commodities, hereafter referred to as road materials, in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and that part of Louisiana west of the Mississippi including certain points on the east bank of the river. The rates were based on straight mileage. Eight cents per ton was added for ferrying such of the traffic as crosses the Mississippi to and from the named points on the east bank. The rates were made to apply alike to interstate and intrastate transportation.\n The commissions of Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, respectively, adopted for application therein the intrastate rates so prescribed. The carriers applied to the Louisiana Public Service Commission for authority to give them effect in that state. October 12, 1929, the commission adopted them as to traffic between points on and north of the Vicksburg, Shreveport & Pacific Railroad, and between that territory and points in Western Louisi- \n\n[284 U.S. 125, 130]\n\u00a0\n ana south of the railroad. It refused to apply them on traffic wholly within the territory south of the railroad or on the traffic between that part of the state and the specified places on the east bank of the river.\n The first of these suits was brought by the carriers against the commission and its members to enjoin them from interfering with the application of these intrastate rates. The other was brought by the state and the commission to annul them. 28 U. S. C.  47(28 USCA  47). A court of three judges heard the cases, held the rates valid, granted a permanent injunction in the first suit, No. 36, and dismissed the other, No. 37, 41 F.(2d) 293. The cases are here on direct appeal. Section 345(4).\n Appellants seek reversal on the grounds that the inclusion of the allowance for ferrying the Mississippi gives preference to Galveston, Houston, and other ports of Texas over New Orleans and Baton Rouge in Louisiana in violation of the Constitution, article 1,  9, cl. 6; that the Interstate Commerce Commission made no findings and had no evidence as to the cost of the ferry service; and that there is no evidence to warrant a finding that the lower intrastate rates in effect under state authority operate as a real and substantial obstruction to, burden upon, or discrimination against, interstate commerce.\n The power of Congress to regulate interstate and foreign commerce is exclusive and has no limitations other than such as arise from the Constitution itself.

Section 15a (49 USCA  15a). Wisconsin R. R. Comm. v. C., B. & Q. R. R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563, 585\n, 588 S., 42 S. Ct. 232, 22 A. L. R. 1086; Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194, 210\n, 211 S., 51 S.

The specified limitations on the power of Congress were set to prevent preference as between states in respect of their ports or the entry and clearance of vessels. It does not forbid such discriminations as between ports. Congress, acting under the commerce clause, causes many things to be done that greatly benefit particular ports and which incidentally result to the disadvantage of other ports in the same or neighboring states. The establishing of ports of entry, erection and operation of lighthouses, improvement of rivers and harbors, and the providing of structures for the convenient and economical handling of traffic, are examples. State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 18 How. 421, 433-435. And see Armour Packing Co. v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 56, 80\n, 28 S. Ct. 428. The construction for which appellants contend would strip Congress of much of the power that it long has been accustomed to exert \n\n[284 U.S. 125, 132]\n\u00a0\n and which always has been held to have been granted to it by the commerce clause. It is clear that the Constitution does not forbid the allowance for ferrying the Mississippi at Louisiana ports.\n Neither the failure of the Commission separately to ascertain and state, nor the absence of evidence to show, the cost to carriers of the ferry service, requires annulment of the rates prescribed for transportation between the places on the east bank of the Mississippi and points west of the river.\n Those rates were made by adding eight cents per ton to the mileage scale which was applied generally throughout the above-mentioned states. No rate specifically applies to the carriage across the river. The orders do not relate to divisions under section 15(6) or to allowances under section 15(13), 49 USCA  15(6, 13). Every railroad shipment requires two terminal services and the line haul. Shipments moving in carloads require switching at places of loading and unloading and frequently at intermediate points. Some require the use of floating equipment and other special facilities. Some are moved on stretches of line where, by reason of physical conditions, the service is performed at costs per mile much in excess of the average on other parts of the haul. Straight mileage schedules appropriately may be applied where conditions affecting transportation are reasonably uniform, but substantial additions to rates so made are necessary to cover extraordinary costs of service. While in the making of reasonable rates all the material facts are to be regarded, it has never been deemed necessary or practicable-if indeed it is at all possible-to ascertain in advance the cost to carriers of each of the various elements embraced in the transportation service. The act does not require any such determination.\n There was evidence to show:\n The commodities in question are used chiefly for the construction, improvement, and maintenance of highways. \n\n[284 U.S. 125, 133]\n\u00a0\n Each of the states mentioned has an extensive system of highways, and contemplates much construction, improvement, and maintenance work. There are more than 300 sources of supply in the territory, and by far the larger part of the materials used in each state is produced therein. These commodities move in great volume, and constitute substantially more than 10 per cent. of the carriers' tonnage. In Louisiana there are many places where such materials are produced. About 98 per cent. of the improved highways in that state are constructed with gravel. There is a large part of Western Louisiana in which no gravel is produced. Some road materials are hauled intrastate more than 240 miles, large quantities move from 100 to more than 140 miles, and, as calculated by the Commission, the average is from 75 to 80 miles.\n In Texas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma there is a number of places, not far from Louisiana boundaries, where large quantities of such materials available for use in that state are produced. Notwithstanding the relatively low applicable Louisiana intrastate rates, substantial quantities are shipped from these outside sources for use on roads in various parts of the state, including the territory as to which the state authorities refused to adopt the scale of rates prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The Louisiana highway commission constructs about 500 miles of road annually, and the parishes construct considerable additional mileage. In each year great quantities of road materials are and in the future will be required for road work in that state south of the Vicksburg, Shreveport & Pacific Railroad and west of the Mississippi. At shipping points throughout the whole territory prices per ton range about as follows: Washed gravel, from $0.60 to $1.15; clay gravel, $0.40 to $0.60; sand, $0.45 to $0.70; crushed stone, $1.00 to $1. 50; shells, $1.20 to $1.40; chat, $0.25 to $0.35. \n\n[284 U.S. 125, 134]\n\u00a0\n The Commission found in Louisiana three scales of intrastate rates applicable to these commodities. One applied to commercial shipments, and is higher than that prescribed by the orders under consideration. One somewhat lower and on which comparatively little moves covers shipments to municipalities for the construction of public buildings. The one here under consideration is the lowest; it applies to materials used in the construction of state and parish highways and city streets when the shipments are consigned to and the freight charges are paid by federal, state, parish, or municipal governments. From 80 per cent. to 85 per cent. of all the traffic in such materials in Western Louisiana moves on that scale. There is printed in the margin a comparison of these rates with those ordered by the Commission. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[]\n 1 2 3 Per cent that Distance, Louisiana Commission's column 2 is (miles) good-roads scale less than scale column 3 []\n 10 40 50 20 20 40 56 29 30 50 62 19 40 50 68 26 50 50 74 32 60 50 80 38 70 50 85 41 80 60 90 33 90 60 95 37 100 60 100 40 110 60 105 43 120 60 110 45 130 60 115 43 140 80 120 33 150 80 125 36 160 80 130 38 170 90 135 33 180 90 140 36 190 90 145 38 200 90 150 40 Average .... .... 35.25 [] \n\n[284 U.S. 125, 135]\n\u00a0\n The latter are about 150 per cent. of the former. For 80 miles, about the average intrastate haul, the prescribed rates are higher by 30 cents per ton; for 100 miles 40 cents; 120 miles 50 cents; 140 miles 40 cents; and 200 miles 60 cents. Producers outside Louisiana are necessarily at disadvantage in respect of the sale and delivery within that state of such materials to the extent that the state rates are lower than the prescribed scale. In the course of the Commission's report it is said that the disparity between the two scales is bound to operate as a real discrimination against, and obstruction to, interstate commerce, and result in interstate shippers being unduly prejudiced and interstate commerce unjustly burdened. And in its ultimate findings the Commission states that the intrastate rates to the extent that they are lower, distance considered, than corresponding interstate rates would result in undue preference and advantage to shippers and receivers of freight in intrastate commerce within Western Louisiana and in undue prejudice to shippers and receivers of freight in interstate commerce between points in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas and points in Western Louisiana, and in unjust discrimination against interstate commerce.\n The facts above stated are adequately supported by the evidence, and are clearly sufficient to warrant the Interstate Commerce Commission in prescribing, under section 13(3)(4), supra, the schedule of intrastate rates under consideration.

C., for appellants.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Daniel W. Knowlton, of Washington, D. C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a decree of the District Court, constituted as required by statute, dismissing the petition of the appellants to set aside, in part, two orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, which were made on November 4, 1929, and July 30, 1929, respectively.\n The first-mentioned order was made in a proceeding instituted by the Commission in December, 1925, on its own motion, for an investigation concerning the use of private passenger train cars, including so-called office cars. A questionnaire was sent to all class I and class II carriers, and to switching and terminal carriers, calling for information 'as to private passenger-train cars owned, leased, or operated, the movement or use of such cars as were transported free or at less than tariff rates on home and foreign lines, and the occupants of such cars on respective trips.' Returns were made by 387 carriers covering the calendar years 1923, 1924, and 1925. In July, 1928, a proposed report was served upon appellants and \n\n[282 U.S. 740, 742]\n\u00a0\n all other carriers. Exceptions were filed by the association of Railway Executives on behalf of its members, including the appellants; argument was heard; and the matter submitted to the Commission. Its report was issued on June 21, 1929, setting forth the Commission's findings and conclusions. 155 I. C. C. 775. After waiver by the carriers of further hearing before the Commission, the order in question was entered requiring the carriers named, including these appellants, 'to cease and desist, on or before January 15, 1930, and thereafter to abstain, from the transportation or movement of private passenger train cars, including so- called office cars, of another carrier free or at other than published tariff rates.'\n The other order of the Commission under attack, that is, the order of July 30, 1929, amended the Commission's regulations governing the form and recording of passes, by the insertion of the following: 'A car pass may be issued only for cars owned by the issuing carrier or held by it under lease for use in its business as a common carrier. It may not be issued for other cars. This provision is not to be construed as prohibiting the issuance of passes for cars of lines operated as a part of the same system. See In the Matter of Private Passenger Train Cars, 155 I. C. C. 775.'\n The case was tried in the District Court on the facts detailed in the report of the Commission as to the practices of the carriers, ad a  to these facts were was no dispute. The Court concluded that the practice condemned by the Commission was a matter within its jurisdiction, and that, the order being supported by substantial evidence, the Court was without power to interfere.\n The evidence before the Commission consisted of the returns of the carriers to its questionnaire. These returns contained a vast amount of statistical data, differing in details but practically the same in substance, which were reviewed and tabulated in the Commission's report. The commission found, in substance, that carriers transported \n\n[282 U.S. 740, 743]\n\u00a0\n free of charge the private, or office, cars1 of other carriers when occupied by persons for whose transportation it was lawful to issue a pass; that carriers also provided accessorial transportation of such cars free of charge when they were moved 'deadhead' to stations where they were to be occupied, or to their home stations after occupancy, and also in switching and storing the cars. The wide extent of the practice and the abuses attending it were shown. \n2\n The Commission referred to the proposal of the \n\n[282 U.S. 740, 744]\n\u00a0\n carriers to undertake the correction of such abuses, and stated that the Commission was concerned primarily with the legality of the free transportation of the private cars of other carriers.\n With respect to the transportation of privately owned cars, that is, of cars owned by others than carriers, or of cars chartered for the exclusive use of special parties, the Commission found that such cars were transported in pas- \n\n[282 U.S. 740, 745]\n\u00a0\n senger trains under tariffs which provided for certain minimum revenues, 3 and that these charges were intended to cover the service of transporting the cars; that is, 'to \n\n[282 U.S. 740, 746]\n\u00a0\n compensate for the movement of the car rather than its contents.' \n4\n The Commission concluded that the transportation of the private cars of other carriers free, or at less than published rates, while making charges for the movement of privately owned or chartered cars, was injustly discriminatory.\n Treating the private, or office, cars of other carriers as property, to which the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act applied, and considering that the free transportation of property was lawful only in the exceptions provided in section 22 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  22), the Commission concluded that the transportation of such cars free, or at other than published tariff rates, was a violation of the act. The Commission pointed out that its finding 'does not extend to the point of saying that it is unlawful for private cars of one carrier to be transported over the lines of other carriers, but is confined to the assertion that under existing law the transportation of private cars on foreign lines should be paid for through the assessment of a just and reasonable charge.' 155 I. C. C. p. 793.\n The conclusions of the Commission were thus summarized in its order of November 4, 1929:\n'1. That the transportation or movement of private passenger cars, including so-called office cars, of one car- \n\n[282 U.S. 740, 747]\n\u00a0\n rier subject to the Interstate Commerce Act by another such carrier free or at other than published tariff rates is contrary to the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act;\n\n'2. That it is unjustly discriminatory and unduly preferential and prejudicial to haul such private cars of other carriers free, or at less than published tariff rates, while charging certain minimum fares and revenues for the movement of privately owned or chartered cars; and\n\n'3. That the transportation of persons in such private passenger cars, including berth and other accommondations, at the rate charged passengers provided only with ordinary coach accommodations is unjustly discriminatory and unduly preferential and prejudicial.'\n\n Appellants state that they are not attacking the third of these propositions; that is, there is no effort in this suit to set aside that part of the Commission's order which relates to the transporting of revenue passengers in business cars at the rate charged passengers holding tickets which are good only in the coach. The appellants say that it is the purpose of the carriers to remove this discrimination in some satisfactory way.\n The first two propositions are those in controversy. The appellants confine their complaint in this Court to the aspect of the Commission's order which holds unlawful the movement by a carrier subject to the act 'of the private or business car of another such carrier when such car is occupied by a person using, and lawfully entitled to use, free transportation.' A similar position is taken with respect to the other order of the Commission (of July 30, 1929), amending the Commission's regulations as to passes.\n With the premise that the Commission has no authority except that delegated to it by the Congress, the appellants contend (1) that the movement under consideration 'is not a shipmen of property subject to section 6 of the \n\n[282 U.S. 740, 748]\n\u00a0\n Interstate Commerce Act, which relates to property shipments'; and (2) that 'the transaction here involved does not violate the discrimination provisions' of the act.\n We may first consider the question of unjust discrimination. It is not open to dispute that there is discrimination in fact, The findings of the Commission are decisive upon that point. The tariffs of the carriers provide for certain minimum fares and revenues for the movement of the private cars of individuals and of corporations other than those of other carriers. These charges, as the Commission found, cover the service of transporting the car and not simply the passengers. 'Apparently,' said the Commission, 'the only matterial difference between the cars on which these minimum charges apply and the private cars of other carriers is the matter of who owns or is using them.' The Commission found that this discrimination is unjust, and, so far as this is a question of fact, it does not appear that the finding lacks adequate support. The appellants emphasize the convenience to railraod officials of the existing practice. It is said that much of a railroad officer's time is spent in traveling, not only over his own lines, but to points on the lines of other railroads, in connection, as questions of management and operation, as well as of financial and other executive policies of importance to all the railroads; that he must attend meetings and conferences, and hearings before Commissions; that during such journeys, which frequently cover long periods, he is handling mail and business documents, and is giving attention to the conduct of his railroad work; and that he must take with him voluminous papers and office assistants. It is also pointed out that inspection of the properties of other carriers is necessary to good management, and has high educational value. But, if it be assumed that the existing practice is a convenience to railroad officials, still it does not appear that the convenience is essentially one peculiar to \n\n[282 U.S. 740, 749]\n\u00a0\n their case. The finding of the Commission is that, while the use of private cars of railroad officials as 'offices on wheels for those whose duties require considerable travel over the line' is an important facility for carrying on the business of the road, 'it is seldom, however, that these duties necessitate a movement of the car over other lines.' And it is a matter of common knowledge that there are large enterprises, other than railroads, extending throughout the country, or large portions of it, and requiring executive supervision; that there are numerous meetings and conferences, held in different parts of the country, of national organizations representing undertakings which are nation-wide in scope; and that those charged with administrative responsibilities in important activities must give appropriate attention to them while on their travels in the discharge of their duties or in the promotion of the interests confided to their care. Discrimination by a carrier with respect to the movement of private cars over its line, in favor of the officials of other railroad companies, and against all others who may desire the transportation of such private cars for their convenience, would require evidence to justify it (unless it can be deemed to lie outside the purview of the statute), and that evidence is lacking. We perceive no ground for disturbing the finding of the Commission as to unjust discrimination, unless it can be said as matter of law that there was none; that is, that the difference in treatment was one which was sanctioned by the Interstate Commerce Act. It is the contention of the appellants that the practice has this sanction.\n The legislative history of the Interstate Commerce Act shows clearly that the evil of discrimination was the principal thing aimed at.

Tis Court has said that the language of the Act 'is certainly sweeping enough \n\n[282 U.S. 740, 750]\n\u00a0\n to embrace all the discriminations of the sort described which it was within the power of Congress to condemn.' \n5\n The Shreveport Case, 234, U. S. 342, 356, 34 S. Ct. 833, 838. Section 3(1), 49 USCA  3(1) provides that 'it shall be unlawful for any common carrier ... to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, company, firm, corporation, or locality, or any particular description of traffic, in any respect whatsoever.' The porhibition, of course, does not reach the exceptional cases for which provision is made by sections 1 and 22 of the act (49 USCA  1, 22) with respect to passes. \n6\n These provisions relate to the transportation, \n\n[282 U.S. 740, 751]\n\u00a0\n free or at reduced rates, of the persons and property there described. Neither section provides for the free transportation of private cars. If discrimination, which would \n\n[282 U.S. 740, 752]\n\u00a0\n otherwise be unjust and condemned by the Act, can be deemed to be saved by the exceptions stated, it must be either because the transportation of a private car is to be regarded as incidental to the free transportation of a passenger who may hold a pass, or because the transportation of a private car occupied by a passenger with a pass is not a service rendered under circumstances and conditions substantially similar to those of the transportation of a private car with passengers paying fares.\n Neither of these propositions is tenable. The pass which the statute allows is in lieu of the passenger's fare and is for the transportation of the passengers. The terms of the statutory permission go no further. Passes may be given under the statute to a variety of persons, including, not only the principal officers of railroad companies, but the agents and employees of common carriers, and their families, including, among others, for example, furloughed and superannuated employees, and those who have become disabled or infirm in the service of a carrier, and also 'the families of persons killed, and the widows during \n\n[282 U.S. 740, 753]\n\u00a0\n widowhood and minor children during minority of persons who died, while in the service of any such common carrier.' It would hardly be thought a reasonable contention that the transportation of a private car should be deemed incidental to the free transporttion of all the persons in the categories mentioned. But, so far as the pass per se is concerned, the hauling of a private car occupied by such a person is as much, and as little,inc idental to the pass in one case as in any other. Even in the case of a rai road official, it appears that, if he owns the private car, its transportation would be subject to the tariff charges on privately owned cars. 155 I. C. C. p. 788. The distinction, then, must be found, not in the fact that a pass may be issued for the transportation of the passenger, or that the passenger is a railroad official, but in the fact that the private car in which the holder of the pass is traveling belongs to another carrier. We find nothing in the terms of the statute recognizing such a differentiation. See New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Company v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n200 \nU.S. 361\n, 26 S. Ct. 272; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, \n225 \nU.S. 326, 341\n, 342 S., 32 S. Ct. 742, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 504.\n Nor can it be said that, so far as the transportation of the private car itself is concerned, the service is not rendered under substantially similar circumstances and conditions whether the occupants have passes or pay for their transportation as passengers. The circumstances and conditions relating to the transportation of the cars, as such, are alike. The cars are hauled between the same points, on the same line, in the same or like passenger trains, and in the same manner.\n The appellants' contention rests largely upon the long continuance of the practice of the carriers to transport the private, or office, cars of other carriers free of charge, and upon the fact that the Interstate Commerce Commission has not only not interfered with the practice here- \n\n[282 U.S. 740, 754]\n\u00a0\n tofore, but has apparently sanctioned it by its regulations in recognizing passes for such cars. The argument based on this asserted sanction is addressed both to the conclusion of the Commission that the movement of such cars free, or at other than published tariff rates, is contrary to the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, and to the conclusion of the Commission as to unjust discrimination. It is said that, in view of the nature of the subject of the transportation, and especially in the light of past administrative construction, the act should be construed as not forbidding the free transportation of the cars in question, and that, if it is lawful to move the carrier owned car free, no unlawful discriminatory conditions arise from the difference to treatment of privately owned cars. In this view, the right of free transportation of the cars in question is made the fundamental consideration, and we pass to the examination of that question.\n Supporting their contention in this respect, the appellants argue that the movement of the private, or office, car of another carrier is not a shipment of property; that such a car in the movement under consideration is to be regarded as a facility of the carrying line, ranking as its own for the purposes of the service. The Commission dealt with the question when railway equipment generally may be transported without charge. The Commission said that, of course, a carrier may transport its own property without the payment of tariff charges; that, likewise, property which is hired or rented for the performance of its common-carrier duties may be transported in the same way as property which it owns. The Commission reviewed the terms on which freight cars and passenger cars move over foreign lines. It found that 'so long as a car is being handled for revenue purposes, it is in service and not subject to charges; but when it is transported \n\n[282 U.S. 740, 755]\n\u00a0\n solely for the benefit of the owning line, the latter must pay for such transportation on another line.' The Commission further found that 'the criterion for determining when a passenger car is in service would seem to be the same as in the case of a freight car; that is, whether the car is being handled for revenue purposes in the interest of all the carriers in the through route or solely for the benefit of the owning line.' 155 I. C. C. pp. 786, 787. After referring to the tariff har ges for the movement of 'special, privately owned, or chartered cars for the exclusive use of special parties' when transported in passenger trains,7 the Commission reached the following conclusion: 'It will be seen from the foregoing that tariff charges are provided for the transportation in freight trains of both carrier and privately owned cars of all kinds, when they are handled solely for the benefit of the owner and not for revenue purposes. It would not be seriously urged that such transportation could be rendered free if an attendant or other person having a pass should ride in the car. The tariffs also provide minimum charges for the transportation in passenger trains of special, privately owned, or chartered cars for the exclusive use of special parties. Apparently these minimum charges would not be lessened or affected in any way if a person or persons having passes should ride in the car. All of these charges show that there is nothing in the nature of railway equipment which justifies its transportation without charge, except when it is being handled for revenue purposes in the interest of the carrier performing the service. Even then the revenue from a passenger car used exclusively by a special party must be sufficient to warrant its transportation. ... The transportation of a private car of another carrier is ordinarily for the benefit of the owning line or its officials and not for revenue purposes. While \n\n[282 U.S. 740, 756]\n\u00a0\n ticket passengers may sometimes occupy such a car, they do so by invitation, and the carrier performing the transportation is not at liberty to make use of the car by putting other passengers in it. The returns to our questionnaire indicate that it is seldom, if ever, that the number of ticket passengers is sufficient to make the hauling of the private car of another carrier profitable to the carrier performing the service. This is further indicated by the additional fact that such passengers apparently do not pay the surcharge, which is assessed on persons riding in Pullman and privately owned or chartered cars. Indeed, the few ticket passengers sometimes riding in the private car of another carrier could probably be accommodated in other equipment that must be hauled anyhow, and the transporting carrier would receive more revenue if they rode in an ordinary Pullman car. Under these circumstances a carrier hauling the private car of another line can not be said to have hired its use, as it would have no interest in doing so and pays no rental therefor. Even if car hire should be provided on private cars, it would obviously be a mere subterfuge which could not change the legality of the practice. Our conclusion is that the transportation of the private car of another carrier is not of such advantage to the carrier performing the service as to warrant its performance without charge, on the same principle as the free handling of revenue-producing equipment.' 155 I. C. C. pp. 788, 789. On the findings of the Commission, we perceive no ground for the conclusion that the cars in question are to be treated merely as a facility of the carrying line and not as property transported.\n The Commission referred to the argument that the carriers had always hauled the private cars of other lines without charge, and that this practice had been well known to the Commission and had been expressly approved by it. Endeavoring to meet the contention that the Commission in its conference rulings and pass regula- \n\n[282 U.S. 740, 757]\n\u00a0\n tions of 1917 had prescribed a form of pass for railway officials and employees, which included the word 'car,' and which, as the carriers asserted, applied to foreign-line cars, the Commission said that the form of pass should be given a construction in harmony with the law, and that the Commission 'never intended to approve the practice of issuing passes for the private cars of other lines.' There is, however, no question as to the long-continued practice of transporting the private cars of other lines without charge, and it would seem that the form of pass prescrbed by the Commission was available and was used in this practice. The Commission stated that this was the first time that the lawfulness of the practice of issuing passes for foreign-line private cars had been brought in issue before it, but the Commission recognized that the practice prevailed at the time of the passage of the Act to Regulate Commerce, and had been continued. It appears that, prior to this proceeding, the Commission had not attempted to disturb it.\n The act has been repeatedly amended, and has been re-enacted, without any change directed to the correction of this practice. It is strongly urged that in the light of these circumstances the administrative construction should be determinative. The principle is a familiar one that in the interpretation of a doubtful or ambiguous statute the long- continued and uniform practice of the authorities charged with its administration is entitled to great weight, and will not be disturbed, except for cogent reasons. Logan v. Davis, \n233 \nU.S. 613, 627\n, 34 S. Ct. 685; Kern River Company v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 147, 154\n, 42 S. Ct. 60, 66, L. Ed. 175; Swendig v. Washington Water Power Company, \n265 \nU.S. 322, 331\n, 44 S. Ct. 496; United States v. Minnesota, \n270 \nU.S. 181, 205\n, 46 S. Ct. 298; Wisconsin v. Illinois, \n278 \nU.S. 367, 413\n, 49 S. Ct. 163. But that principle does not go far enough to control the decision here. There is no ambiguity in the requirement of section 6(1) of the act (49 USCA  6(1) that its provisions as to published tariffs 'shall apply to all traffic, transpor- \n\n[282 U.S. 740, 758]\n\u00a0\n tation, and facilities defined in this Act.' Whether the private, or office, cars of other carriers are to be deemed property transported, or a facility of the carrying line, depends upon the circumstances of the carriage as matters of fact, and when the facts have been resolved by the Commission upon evidence, there is no escape from the application of the broad provision of the statute. Similarly, there is no ambiguity, os far as the terms of the provision of section 3(1) are concerned, in its prohibition of discriminations, when it has been found as a fact that these cars are transported for the benefit of the owning line and do not belong in the category of the facilities of the carrying line, and that transporting them free of charge constitutes an unjust discrimination, as compared with the tariff charges for the transportation of privately owned cars. Nor are the provisions of sections 1(7) and 22(1) to be deemed ambiguous by reason of the omission of private, or office, cars owned by carriers from the specification of persons or property that may be carried free. The omission simply takes the cars out of the provisions of the sections. Whatever doubt or uncertainty attached to the application of the provisions of the act to the transactions under review lay in the appreciation of the facts, and appropriate action thereon, and not in the interpretation of the terms of the law after the facts have been ascertained. Thus, in American Express Company v. United States, \n212 \nU.S. 522\n, 29 S. Ct. 315, it was argued by the appellants that the custom of express companies to issue such passes as were there in question was one of long standing and presumably known to Congress; that there was no record of any protest against it to or by the Interstate Commerce Commission, or to Congress, nor any suggestion in any speech or report that it was supposed to be detrimental to the public interest, or that it was intended to be prohibited; that there was no direct or express pro- \n\n[282 U.S. 740, 759]\n\u00a0\n hibition in the statute, but, on the contrary, the Interstate Commerce Act recognized, and always had recognized, that the granting of similar privileges to the officers and employees of railroad companies was consistent with sound public policy. Page 523 of 212 U. S., 29 S. Ct. 315. And this Court stated in its opinion that the facts were not seriously in dispute, and showed that it had been the custom of expresscom panies for many years to issue franks such as were embraced in the proceeding. Page 529 of 212 U. S., 29 S. Ct. 315. But this Court held that, in view of the all-embracing prohibition of the act, it could not be doubted that the transportation of property, such as was shown in that case, upon franks issued by the express companies, was within the terms of the act. If the practice could be deemed to be lawful, the Court said that the right must be founded upon some exception incorporated in the statute. The Court found no such exception, and gave effect to the act according to its terms.\n Long-continued practice and the approval of administrative authorities may be persuasive in the interpretation of doubtful provisions of a statute, but cannot alter provisions that are clear and explicit when related to the facts disclosed. A failure to enforce the law does not change it. The good faith of the carriers in the transactions of the past may be unquestioned, but that does not justify the continuance of the practice.\n We are of the opinion that the order of the Commission of November 4, 1929, was within its authority. For similar reasons, we conclude that the Commission had power to revise its regulation as to passes in the manner provided by the order of July 30, 1929\n\n\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND are of opinion that the decree of the court below should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Commission's report and order described the cars in question as private passenger train cars, or private passenger cars, including so- called office cars. The reference is to the private, or office, cars of carriers as distinguished from cars privately owned by persons and corporations other than railroad companies. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Commission's report states (in part): 'The returns show that a substantial portion of the total mileage of private passenger-train cars, including so-called office cars, herein referred to collectively as private cars, was on the lines of carriers other than those owning the cars. The private cars thus moved over foreign lines were transported without charge. In other words, a pass was issued covering transportation of the private cars similar to that issued for the transportation of certain classes of persons as provided for in sections 1 and 22 of the act . ...\n'It will be understood that a private car includes a kitchen, dining room, staterooms, and observation or sitting room, together with storage space and sleeping quarters for the cook and attendants. The facilities thus provided for those traveling in private cars excel the facilities of the ordinary coach or pullman car.\n\n'The returns ... show that the occupants of private cars are not restricted to officials and employees of the carriers but include in a large number of cases the families, relatives, and friends of railway officials traveling on passes or on tickets that would in most cases entitle them only to transportation in the ordinary coach.' (The report cites many instances of the movement of such cars when in charge of the wives of officials and the widows of deceased officials.) ...\n\n'There is also a substantial use of private cars, both on home and foreign lines, by directors of carriers. ...\n\n'The movement of private cars to resorts commonly patronized by those seeking recreation or amusement, and located on foreign lines, is very noticeable. ... There is also an extensive use of private cars by short lines, industrial roads, and lines owned, controlled, or used in the interest of some particular business. The mileage of private cars used by the latter lines is largely on foreign lines, and in numerous instances the home stations of the cars and the movements thereof are so far removed from the vicinity of the owning road that it is difficult to conceive the circumstances under which such movements could have been in the interest of or connected with the operation of the road owning the car. ... \n\n'The returns show that a substantial portion of the total mileage of private cars, especially on foreign lines, was what is commonly referred to as deadhead' mileage, that is, the cars were nt o ccupied, except in some instances by an attendant. The purpose of such movements is to return the cars to their home stations or to move them to stations where they are to be occupied. ... The returns show numerous instances where private cars were deadheaded to and from off-line shops without charge. Also worthy of consideration is the matter of free switching service and free storage for private cars. A large number of the private cars covered by the returns are held at off-line stations when not in use. Many are so held at New York and the returns indicate that the matter of storage and switching of these cars is of considerable importance from the standpoint of operating expenditures. In numerous cases cars were rented from the Pullman Company by officers of carriers, and such cars were moved without charge by the carriers. ...\n\n'The private cars of railroad officials are intended to be offices on wheels for those whose duties require considerable travel over the line and when used for that purpose are an important facility for carrying on the business of the road. It is seldom, however, that these duties necessitate a movement of the car over other lines. In some cases such a movement may be justified for business reasons; for example, where it avoids a very circuitous haul over the home line. But the returns to our questionaire indicate that private cars are often used for other than business purposes by railroad officers, their relatives, and friends. Moreover, they appear to be used in some instances for the benefit of an industry which controls the railroad. In other instances their use in entertaining shippers may be for the purpose of obtaining business for the railroad. These and other abuses are apparent from the returns, but we are here concerned primarily with the legality of the free transportation of the private cars of other carriers.' 155 I. C. C. pp. 776, 778, 779, 781, 782, 783. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Commission stated: 'Special, privately owned, or chartered cars for the exclusive use of special parties are transported in passenger trains under tariffs which provide for certain minimum revenues. In the case of sleeping and parlor cars, charges for a one-way movement are based on the authorized fare for each passenger, with a minimum of 25 adult fares, but not less than $42 for the car and party. The changes for a round-trip movement are similar, except the 25 fares are doubled or must be for the round trip, and the minimum revenue is $84. In either case, the surcharge must be paid for each passenger, with a minimum of 25 surcharges, but this is not used in computing the minimum revenue per car. When a car is moved empty or in charge of porter or other attendants, charges are assessed on the basis of 10 regular adult one-way fares, plus the authorized fare for each porter or attendant, except not more than three employees of common carriers may be carried free. In this case also the minimum revenue is $42, including fares of attendants, but the surcharge is not collected. In some of the tariffs the charges for empty movements apply to carrier-owned as well as privately owned equipment. The tariffs also provide for application of the minimum fares and revenue on carrier- owned cars equipped for certain special purposes, such as advertising, exhibition, instruction, and the lkie. Thes ar e the provisions generally in effect, although there may be variations on individual lines. The term privately owned cars is not defined in the tariffs, but its obvious meaning is cars owned by others than the carriers. Apparently a private car owned by an individual even though a railroad official would be subject to the tariff charges on privately owned cars. ...' 155 I. C. C. pp. 787, 788. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Commission said on this point: 'As heretofore pointed out, the tariffs provide certain minimum fares and revenues for the movement of special, privately owned, or chartered cars, which are evidently intended to cover the service of transporting the car. This is apparent from the fact that the charges are the same whether the car is occupied by 1 passenger or 25. Especially in the case of cars moving empty or in charge of porter, it is manifest that the minimum fares and revenue are intended to compensate for the movement of the car rather than its contends. Apparently the only material difference between the cars on which these minimum charges apply and the private cars of other carriers is the matter of who owns or is using them.' 155 I. C. C. p. 792. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] 'Sec. 2. That if any common carrier subject to the provisions of this Act shall, directly or indirectly, by any special rate, rebate, drawback, or other device, charge, demand, collect, or receive from any person or persons a greater or less compensation for any service rendered, or to be rendered, in the transportation of passengers or property or the transmission of interlligence, subject to the provisions of this Act, than it charges, demands, collects, or receives from any other person or persons for doing for him or them a like and contemporaneous service in the transportation or transmission of a like kind of traffic or message under substantially similar circumstances and conditions, such common carrier shall be deemed guilty of unjust discrimination, which is hereby prohibited and declared to be unlawful.'

Branch, of Providence, R. I., and Charles R. Pollard, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner seeks to recover interest on an overpayment made June 20, 1918, on account of income and excess profits taxes assessed for the year 1917, which was refunded during 1922. The Court of Claims denied relief and we are asked to reverse this action.\n The Revenue Act of 1917, 40 State. 300, 303, 304, 307, laid an income tax; also a tax upon excess profits equal to designated percentages of the net income, after making deductions therefrom as stated in section 203. The amount of such deductions depended upon invested capital, prewar operations, etc.\n The provisions of that Act there specially applicable follow-\n'Sec. 205. (a) That if the Secretary of the Treasury, upon complaint finds either (1) that during the prewar period a domestic corporation or partnership, or a citizen or resident of the United States, had no net income from the trade or business, or (2) that during the prewar period the percentage, which \n\n[283 U.S. 583, 585]\n\u00a0\n the net income was of the invested capital, was low as compared with the percentage, which the net income during such period of representative corporations, partnerships, and individuals, engaged in a like or similar trade or business, was of their invested capital, then the deduction shall be. ...'\n\n'Sec. 210. That if the Secretary of the Treasury is unable in any case satisfactorily to determine the invested capital, the amount of the deduction shall be the sum of (1) an amount equal to the same propertion of the net income of the trade or business received during the taxable year as the proportion which the average deduction ( determined in the same manner as provided in section two hundred and three, without including the $3,000 or $6,000 therein referred to) for the same calendar year of representative corporations, partnerships, and individuals, engaged in a like or similar trade or business, bears to the total net income of the trade or business received by such corporations, partnerships, and individuals, plus . ...'\n\n Article 52, Treasury Department Regulations 41, promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1917, states: 'Section 210 provides for exceptional cases in which the invested capital can not be satisfactorily determined.

From this it appeared that, reckoned \n\n[283 U.S. 583, 586]\n\u00a0\n according to the rule commonly applicable, the tax amounted to $1,508,400. 25. With the return petitioner sent a written communication, addressed to the Commissioner, copied in the margin. \n1\n This expressed the opinion 'that our tax is proportionately larger than that of other representative concerns in the same line of business' and 'that this disproportion arises from causes of the nature of those specified in Article 52, of Regulations No. 41.' And finally: 'Upon the above statement, which we are prepared to support and amplify if required, we request assessment in the manner provided for in Article 52, referring also to Articles 18 and 24, Regulations No. 41.' \n\n[283 U.S. 583, 587]\n\u00a0\n On June 20, 1918, payment was made of the full amount of the tax reckoned upon the March 28 return. This was accompanied by a letter stating 'we filed a request dated March 28th for assessment in the manner provided for in Article 52, referring also to Articles 18 and 24, Regulations 41. Understanding that these questions will be passed upon at a later date, we shall be pleased to be advised that a hearing will be granted to us.' At this time no provision of law permitted recovery of interest upon refunded overpayments. \n\n[283 U.S. 583, 588]\n\u00a0\n December 30, 1921, petitioner filed a formal claim for the refund of excess payment of income and excess-profits tax for 1917\n\n\n The petitioner now claims that the contents of its letter of March 28, 1918, reiterated in the later one, were sufficient to meet the requirements of section 1324(a), Act of 1921, that what was there written amounted to 'a specific protest setting forth in detail the basis of and reasons for such protest,' within the meaning of the statute. The Court of Claims (37 F.(2d) 196) held otherwise; and while its opinion cannot be wholly approved, the judgment is correct and must be affirmed.\n The general purpose of the petitioner's communications to the commissioner was to induce the latter to set on foot an investigation of the company's affairs to the end that, after ascertaining the circumstances and in the exercise of a proper discretion, he might make an assessment duly proportioned to those imposed upon others engaged in like business. There was no challenge of the commissioner's right then to demand payment according to the general rule-no claim that in view of the facts then before him this would amount to an unlawful imposition. Considering the circumstances disclosed, the commissioner did nothing unjust or contrary to law when he demanded payment; and if he had concluded to take no further proceedings, the petitioner could have recevered nothing. Williamsport Wire Rope Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 551\n, 48 S. Ct. 587.\n In Girard Trust Company v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 163, 170\n, 173 S., 46 S. Ct. 229, 232, this Court pointed out that the Act of 1921 is remedial and was passed with the general purpose to 'require the government to recoup the taxpayer unjustly dealt with by paying interest during the whole time the money was detained.' Also, we there said: 'A protest is for the purpose of inviting attention of the taxing \n\n[283 U.S. 583, 589]\n\u00a0\n officers to the illegality of the collection, so that they may take remedial measures at once.'\n We are unable to conclude that the petitioner's action amounted to a precise objection to an unauthorized exaction within the fair intendment of the statute. Meticulous compliance by the taxpayer with the prescribed conditions must appear before he can recover. Lucas v. Pilliod Lumber Company, \n281 \nU.S. 245, 249\n, 50 S. Ct. 297, 67 A. L. R. 1350.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Maas & Waldstein Co.\n March 28, 1918.\n Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, D. C.\n Dear Sir: We beg to submit herewith tax returns for the Maas & Waldstein Company covering the year 1917 as follows:\n Our net income for the taxable year was $2,656,395.01. We are therefore required to pay in the above taxes substantially 66% of our net income. Of the total amount of the Excess Profits Tax, substantially 83% is assessed at the 60% rate, in addition to which we are required to pay over $242,000 for the Munitions Manufacturers' Tax.\n It is our opinion that our tax is proportionately larger than that of other representative concerns in the same line of business. It is our further opinion that this disproportion arises from causes of the nature of those specified in Article 52, of Regulations No. 41, for the following reasons: \n[\nFootnote 1\n] Under paragraph 3, Article 52, it is our belief that through the simple form and manner of our organization we are placed at a disadvantage in comparison with representative concerns in a similar trade or business. In accordance with the regulations applying to Excess Profits Tax Returns, we have reduced the value of the tangible assets acquired at the time of our organization to $100,000. No proper evidence of the actual value of these assets when acquired by the corporation is now in existence, but it is our opinion that their actual value was far in excess of $100,000. By reason of our organization, it has been possible to make our return in strict accord with the law and the regulations. We believe that this fact places us at a disadvantage with concerns which, by reason of the manner of their organization, and by reason of reorganizations through which they may have passed, are not able to correct their capital account in the manner provided in the regulations.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Under paragraph 4, Article 52, our invested capital when computed in the manner specified in the regulations, is manifestly seriously disproportionate to the taxable income. This arises in part for the reasons specified in the preceding paragraph, and in part for the reason specified under (b) in paragraph 4. About 90% of our total net income was earned through the operation of our gun cotton plant. This plant was erected solely for war purposes to meet the needs of a foreign government and will not be wanted for the purpose of our trade or business after the termination of the war. Under the regulations it has not been possible to properly allow for the amortization and exceptional depreciation of this plant.\n Upon the above statement, which we are prepared to support and amplify if required, we request assessment in the manner provided for in Article 52, referring also to Articles 18 and 24, Regulations No. 41.\n Very truly yours,\n Maas & Waldstein Co.,\n'Henry V.

UNITED STATES(1931)\nNo. 65\nArgued: Decided: January 26, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 432, 433]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Theodore B. Benson and William Meyerhoff, both of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General, and Mr. Chas. B. Rugg, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner filed his income tax return for 1916 in February, 1917. In October, 1921. the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed an additional tax, and in November, 1921, the petitioner filed a claim in abatement. In 1924, the Commissioner allowed the claim in abatement for a portion of the amount claimed and rejected it as to the residue, which the petitioner then paid, upon the collector's demand. In December, 1927, the petitioner filed a claim for refund, which was rejected, whereupon this suit was brought in the Court of Claims in December, 1928, to recover the amount paid. The court dismissed the action, applying section 611 of the Revenue Act of192 8 (c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 875 (26 USCA  2611)), 37 F.(2d) 763. This Court granted a writ of certiorari, \n281 \nU.S. 713\n, 50 S. Ct. 407\n\n\n The questions presented with respect to the construction and validity of section 611 are the same as those considered in Graham v. Goodcell, decided this day. \n282 \nU.S. 409\n, 51 S. Ct. 186. The petitioner contends, however, that this section does not apply to his case, upon the ground that the tax was not assessed within the three-year period of limitation prescribed by \n\n[282 U.S. 432, 434]\n\u00a0\n section 9(a) of the Revenue Act of 1916 (c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, 763). The Court of Claims held that the assessment was valid under the provisions of section 250(d) of the Act of 1921 (Act of November 23, 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 265). We think the court was right in construing this statute as applicable to the assessment, although previously made, and hence that the tax was assessed 'within the period of limitation properly applicable thereto,' as required by section 611 of the Revenue Act of 1928 (26 USCA  2611).\n The petitioner also insists that his claim in abatement was illegal under section 250(d) of the Revenue Act of 1921. We do not find that there was any statutory prohibition of the filing of a claim in abatement in the circumstances here shown. The taxpayer benefited by the claim and is not in a position to contest its legality. Compare United States v. John Barth Co., \n279 \nU.S. 370, 376\n, 49 S. Ct. 366; Florsheim. Brothers Drygoods Co., Limited, v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 453, 464\n, 50 S. Ct. 215.

The Government resists recovery under section 611 of the Revenue Act of 1928 (c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 875 (26 USCA  2611)). In No. 400, Mascot Oil Co., Inc., v. United States, the Government was successful. 42 F.(2d) 309. In No. 416, United States v. Wyman, Partridge & Co,. (Ct. Cl.) 41 F.(2d) 886, and in No. 508, D. B. Heiner, Collector of Internal Revenue, etc., v. Erie Coal & Coke Co. ( C. C. A.) 42 F.(2d) 214, the decisions below were in favor of the plaintiffs. This Court granted writs of certiorari. \n282 \nU.S. 829, 828\n, 832 S., 51 S. Ct. 84, 80, 90, 75 L. Ed. -, -, -.\n In No. 400, Mascot Oil Co., Inc., v. United States, the taxpayer had made a deposit in escrow with a bank to cover the amount of the tax, but, when the collector demanded payment, it was made by the taxpayer under protest and not from the deposit. In No 508, D. B. Heiner, Collector of Internal Revenue, etc., v. Erie Coal & Coke Co., a bond had been given to secure payment of the tax. The making of the deposit in the former case, and the giving of the bond in the latter, were after the statute of limitations had run, but the taxpayer in each case insists that the statute had not thereby been waived.\n We may lay that question aside, for if thre was no waiver these two cases, together with No. 416, United States v. Wyman, Partridge & Co., involve the same circumstances as those decided this day in Graham v. Goodcell, \n282 \nU.S. 409\n, 51 S. Ct. 186, save that collections were made while section 1106(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 113) was in force. \n1\n That section was repealed, \n\n[282 U.S. 434, 437]\n\u00a0\n as of the date of its passage, by section 612 of the Revenue Act of 1928 ( 45 Stat. 875). It is not necessary to attempt to resolve the questions raised by the ambiguous language of this section, as we are of the opinion that, from any point of view, it does not protect the taxpayers from the operation of section 611 of the Revenue Act of 1928. At the time the taxes were collected, there was no liability on the part of the taxpayers, but this was also true in the case of the petitioners in Graham v. Goodcell, supra. The Congress had constitutional authority in the circumstances set forth in section 611 of the Revenue Act of 1928 to cure the defect in administration which had resulted in the collection of the tax after the statute of limitations had run and to deny recovery to the taxpayers for the amount paid. The fact that section 1106(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 was in effect at the time of the collection is a distinction which does not affect the result.\n No. 400, Mascot Oil Company, Inc. v. The United States, judgment affirmed.\n No. 416, The United States v. Wyman, Partridge & Company, judgment reversed.\n No. 508, D. B. Heiner, Collector of Internal Revenue, etc. v. Erie Coal & Coke Company, judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This section provided: 'Sec. 1106(a) The bar of the statute of limitations against the United States in respect of any internal-revenue tax shall not only operate to bar the remedy but shall extinguish the liability; but no credit or refund in respect of such tax shall be allowed unless the taxpayer has overpaid the tax. The bar of the statute of limitations against the taxpayer in respect of any internalrevenue tax shall not only operate to bar the remedy but shall extinguish the liability; but no collection in respect of such tax shall be made unless the taxpayer has underpaid the tax.' \n\n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMAYNARD v. ELLIOTT(1931)\nNo. 239\nArgued: Decided: April 13, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 273, 274]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Randolph Bias and Wells Goody. both of Williamson, W. Va., for petitioner.\n Mr. Stanley Reed, of Ashland, Ky., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The bankrupts in these cases were indorsers of promissory notes payable to petitioners, some of them within the year after adjudication, allowed by section 57, 57n of the Bankruptcy Act (July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544, 561, 11 USCA  93(n) for proof of claims, others at later dates. Petitioners filed proofs of claim upon the indorsements, which were allowed. Proceedings were brought by the trustee to expunge the claims as not provable.\n Upon review, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that as none of the notes was due at the time of the petition, and as neither presentment nor notice of dishonor had been waived, the liability with respect to each of the indorsements was not a provable claim because contingent, and gave judgment accordingly, 40 F.(2d) 17, following its earlier decision in First National Bank v. Elliott (C. C. A.) 19 F.(2d) 426. This Court granted certiorari, \n282 \nU.S. 822\n, 51 S. Ct. 31, 75 L. Ed . -, October 13, 1930, to resolve the conflict between the decision below and those of other circuit courts of appeals, in Moch v. Market Street National Bank, 107 F. 897 (C. C. A. 3d), and in In re Semmer Glass Co., 135 F. 77 (C. C. A. 2d), appeal dismissed, \n203 \nU.S. 141\n, 27 S. Ct. 50; see Colman Co. v. Withoft (C. C. A.) 195 F. 250, 253.\n Section 63 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA  103) provides:\n'(a) Debts of the bankrupt may be proved and allowed against his estate which are (1) a fixed liability, as evi- \n\n[283 U.S. 273, 275]\n\u00a0\n denced by a judgment or an instrument in writing, absolutely owing at the time of the filing of the petition against him, whether then payable or not, with any interest here on which would have been recoverable at that date or with a rebate of interest upon such as were not then payable and did not bear interest; ... (4) founded upon an open account, or upon a contract txpress or implied. ...\n\n'(b) Unliquidated claims against the bankrupt may, pursuant to application to the court, be liquidated in such manner as it shall direct, and may thereafter be proved and allowed against the estate.'\n\n Section 17 of the act (11 USCA  35) provides that, 'A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts ...' with exceptions not now material, and section 1(11) of the act, 11 USCA  1(11), that \"debt' shall include any debt, demand, or claim provable in bankruptcy.' Earlier acts provided for the proof of various types of contingent liability specifically enumerated, including that of the indorser of negotiable paper, section 5, Act of August 19, 1841, c. 9, 5 Stat. 440, 445; section 19, Act of March 2, 1867, c. 176, 14 Stat. 517, 525.\n Although the omission of any reference to contingent claims in section 63 of the present act has led to some confusion and uncertainty in the decisions, it is now settled that claims founded upon contract, which at the time of the bankruptcy are fixed in amount or susceptible of liquidation, may be proved under subdivision (a)(4) of that section, 11 USCA  103(a)(4), although not absolutely owing when the petition is filed. Williams v. U. S. Fidelity Co., \n236 \nU.S. 549\n, 35 S. Ct. 289; Central Trust Co. v. Chicago Auditorium, \n240 \nU.S. 581\n, 36 S. Ct. 412, L. R. A. 1917B, 580. The sole question now presented is whether the liability of an indorser is of that class.\n The obligation of an indorser is at least a 'claim,' and hence a debt so far as defined by section 1(11); and the language of section 63, which permits proof of a claim 'founded ... upon a contract express or implied,' is broad enough to \n\n[283 U.S. 273, 276]\n\u00a0\n embrace the liability of an endorser upon negotiable paper which has not matured at the time of the adjudication. Within three years after the enactment of the Bankruptcy Act, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Moch v. Market Street National Bank, supra, held that the liability of a bankrupt indorser of commercial paper, which did not mature until after the filing of the petition, was a provable claim under section 63(a)(4). This ruling was followed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in In re Semmer Glass Co., supra, and appears to have been accepted by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Colman Co. v. Withoft, supra, page 253 of 195 F., and by the District Courts generally. In re O'Donnell, 131 F. 150; In re Rothenberg, 140 F. 798; In re Smith, 146 F. 923: In re Dunlap Carpet Co., 163 F. 541; In re Caloris Mfg. Co., 179 F. 722; In re Buzzini, 183 F. 827; In re Lyons Beet Sugar Refining Co., 192 F. 445; In re Keith-Gara Co., 203 F. 585; Heyman v. Third National Bank, 216 F. 685; In re Amdur Shoe Co., 13 F.(2d) 147. See, also, Germania Savings Bank v. Loeb, 188 F. 285, 289, Courtney v. Trust Co., 219 F. 57, 66 (both C. C. A. 6th).\n The rule thus announced seems not to have been seriously challenged until the decision, twenty-six years later, of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in First National Bank v. Elliott, supra. In Dunbar v. Dunbar, \n190 \nU.S. 340\n, 23 S. Ct. 757, the Moch Case was cited and distinguished from the claim involved in that case, which was dependent upon a contingency so uncertain, as the court held, that its liquidation or valuation was impossible. In the meantime, leading text- writers have stated that the liability of an endorser, upon a note falling due after the petition, is provable under section 63(a)(4). 1 Loveland on Bankruptcy (4th Ed.) p. 609; 2 Collier on Bankruptcy (13th Ed.) pp. 1399- 1400; 2 Remington on Bankruptcy (3d Ed.)  777. \n\n[283 U.S. 273, 277]\n\u00a0\n Only compelling language in the statute itself would warrant the rejection of a construction so long and so generally accepted, especially whre o verturning the established practice would have such far reaching consequences as in the present instance. But such language is wanting in section 63. That section purports to be an enumeration of classes of provable claims-not an enumeration of characteristics which must inhere in every claim proved. Only by reading into subdivision (a)(4) the limitation of subdivision (a)(1), 11 USCA  63(a) (1), that the claim must be absolutely owing, would there be ground for rejecting a claim against a bankrupt indorser as not complying with the former.\n Respondent argues that (a)(4) must be so read, since, otherwise, the limitation in (a)(1) would be practically without effect. See In re Roth & Appel (C. C. A.) 181 F. 667, 31 L. R. A. (N. S.) 270; In re Hutchcraft (D. C.) 247 F. 187. But this contention was rejected by the decision in Williams v. U. S. Fidelity Co., supra; see Central Trust Co. v. Chicago Auditorium, supra, pages 592, 593, of 240 U. S., 36 S. Ct. 412, and is not supported, as respondent contends, by Zavelo v. Reeves, \n227 \nU.S. 625\n, 33 S. Ct. 365. That case held only that section 63, read in the light of the spirit and purpose of the Act, did not authorize proof of claim upon an obligation entered into by the bankrupt after the filing of the petition. See In re Burka (D. C.) 104 F. 326.\n Possible doubts as to the meaning of the section should be resolved in the light of the purpose of the Act 'to convert the assets of the bankrupt into cash for distribution among creditors, and then to relieve the honest debtor from the weight of oppressive indebtedness, and permit him to start afresh free from the obligations and responsibilities consequent upon business misfortunes.' Williams v. U. S. Fidelity Co., supra, page 554 of 236 U. S., 35 S. Ct. 289, 290; Central Trust Co. v. Chicago Auditorium, supra, page 591 of 240 U. S., 36 S. Ct. 412. If this purpose be given its appropriate weight, a meaning cannot be attributed to the plain words of subdivision (a)(4), which would so restrict them as to preclude proof of claim upon \n\n[283 U.S. 273, 278]\n\u00a0\n the liability of an indorser of commercial paper, and result in its survival of the bankrupt's discharge as an obligation enforceable against him.\n That some contingent claims are deemed not provable does not militate against this conclusion. The contingency of the bankrupt's obligation may be such as to render any claim upon it incapable of proof. It may be one beyond the control of the creditor, and dependent upon an event so fortuitous as to make it uncertain whether liability will ever attach. In re Merrill & Baker (C. C. A.) 186 F. 312. Such a claim could not be proved under the Act of 1841 although in terms permitting proof of contingent claims. Riggin v. Magwire, 15 Wall. 549. Or, the contingency may be such as to make any valuation of the claim impossible, even though liability has attached. Of this latter class was the claim upon the bankrupt's contract to pay his divorced wife a specified amount annually so long as she should remain unmarried, proof of which was for that reason rejected in Dunbar v. Dunbar, supra; see Atkins v. Wilcox (C. C. A.) 105 F. 595, 53 L. R. A. 118.\n But the liability of an indorser is of neither class. Its amount is certain; and the contingency of notice of dishonor to the indorser is within the control of the creditor, so as to place his claim, so far as its certainty of accrual and its susceptibility of liquidation are concerned, upon the same footing as the contract of indemnity which was held provable in Williams v. U. S. Fidelity Co., supra, although the claimant had done nothing at the time of the bankruptcy to satisfy the liability for which the indemnity was given. See also Central Trust Co. v. Chicago Auditorium, supra, pages 593, 594 of 240 U. S., 36 S. Ct. 412.\n The claim against the indorser of paper not matured at the time of the bankruptcy thus stands on the same plane as contracts of suretyship or guarantee of payment of a debt not due until after the bankruptcy. See In re Lyons Bee Sug ar Refining Co., supra; Collier on Bankruptcy, supra; Reming- \n\n[283 U.S. 273, 279]\n\u00a0\n ton on Bankruptcy, supra. Even though not due until after the year allowed for proof of claims, if proved in time, such a claim may be liquidated as are other unmatured claims. In re Buzzini, supra, page 830 of 183 F. As the claim is provable, and as notice of dishonor after the petition is filed is necessary only to charge the indorser, in the event he does not secure his discharge, the claimant need not give notice of dishonor in order to share in the estate. See Colman Co. v. Withoft, supra, page 253 of 195 F.\n The application of respondent to expunge the claims should be denied in each case. The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","94":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCBOYLE v. U.

I., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner was convicted of transporting from Ottawa, Illinois, to Guymon, Oklahoma, an airplane that he knew to have been stolen, and was sentenced to serve three years' imprisonment and to pay a fine of $2,000. The judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 43 F.(2d) 273. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court on the question whether the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act applies to aircraft. \n\n[283 U.S. 25, 26]\n\u00a0\n Act of October 29, 1919, c. 89, 41 Stat. 324, U. S. Code, title 18,  408 ( 18 USCA  408). That Act provides: 'Sec. 2. That when used in this Act: (a) The term 'motor vehicle' shall include an automobile, automobile truck, automobile wagon, motor cycle, or any other self-propelled vehicle not designed for running on rails. ... Sec. 3. That whoever shall transport or cause to be transported in interstate or foreign commerce a motor vehicle, knowing the same to have been stolen, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $5,000, or by imprisonment of not more than five years, or both.'\n Section 2 defines the motor vehicles of which the transportation in interstate commerce is punished in Section 3. The question is the meaning of the word 'vehicle' in the phrase 'any other self-propelled vehicle not designed for running on rails.' No doubt etymologically it is possible to use the word to signify a conveyance working on land, water or air, and sometimes legislation extends the use in that direction, e. g., land and air, water being separately provided for, in the Tariff Act, September 21, 1922, c. 356,  401(b), 42 Stat. 858, 948 (19 USCA  231(b). But in everyday speech 'vehicle' calls up the picture of a thing moving on land. Thus in Rev. St.  4 (1 USCA  4) intended, the Government suggests, rather to enlarge than to restrict the definition, vehicle includes every contrivance capable of being used 'as a means of transportation on land.' And this is repeated, expressly excluding aircraft, in the Tariff Act, June 17, 1930, c. 497,  401(b), 46 Stat. 590, 708 (19 USCA  1401). So here, the phrase under discussion calls up the popular picture. For after including automobile truck, automobile wagon and motor cycle, the words 'any other self-propelled vehicle not designed for running on rails' still indicate that a vehicle in the popular sense, that is a vehicle running on land is the theme. It is a vehicle that runs, not something, not commonly called a vehicle, that flies. Airplanes were well known in 1919 when this statute was passed, but it is admitted that they were not mentioned in the reports or in the debates in Congress. \n\n[283 U.S. 25, 27]\n\u00a0\n It is impossible to read words that so carefully enumerate the different forms of motor vehicles and have no reference of any kind to aircraft, as including airplanes under a term that usage more and more precisely confines to a different class. The counsel for the petitioner have shown that the phraseology of the statute as to motor vehicles follows that of earlier statutes of Connecticut, Delaware, Ohio, Michigan and Missouri, not to mention the late Regulations of Traffic for the District of Columbia, title 6, c. 9,  242, none of which can be supposed to leave the earth.\n Although it is not likely that a criminal will carefully consider the text of the law before he murders or steals, it is reasonable that a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line should be clear. When a rule of conduct is laid down in words that evoke in the common mind only the pleture of vehicles moving on land, the statute should not be extended to aircraft simply because it may seem to us that a similar policy applies, or upon the speculation that if the legislature had thought of it, very likely the picture of vehicles moving on land, the United States v.

HERSHEY CHOCOLATE CO.(1931)\nNo. 426\nArgued: Decided: May 18, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 488, 489]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Claude R. Branch, Sp. Asst. to Atty. Gen ., of Providence, R. I., for petitioners.\n Mr. Wm. Clarke Mason, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Section 900 of the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1057, 1122, imposed, at varying percentages, an excise tax upon \n\n[283 U.S. 488, 490]\n\u00a0\n the sales price of enumerated articles, most of which may be characterized as luxuries. The enumeration of the ninth subdivision was, 'Candy, 5 per centum.' Section 900(6) of the Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 292, re- enacted this provision but reduced the tax to 3 per cent. Respondents, manufacturers of 'sweet chocolate' and 'sweet milk chocolate,' brought suits in the District Court for Eastern Pennsylvania, to recover about $8, 000,000 of taxes assessed under these sections for the years 1918 to 1924, on the ground that the articles sold are not 'candy,' sale of which was taxed. On written stipulation of the parties, the cases were tried by the court without a jury. Judgments for petitioners were reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 42 F.(2d) 408. This Court granted certiorari, \n282 \nU.S. 827\n, 51 S. Ct. 81, 75 L. Ed. -, October 20, 1930, to resolve the conflict of the decision below with that of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Malley v. Walter Baker & Co., 281 F. 41.\n The trial court found that sweet chocolate is a solid or plastic mass, made by mixing sugar with chocolate, which is the powdered cacao nib or bean, with or without the addition of flavoring material, and that sweet milk chocolate also contains milk solids; that the type of sweet chocolate manufactured and sold by respondents is commonly sold in small bars, sometimes containing nuts, or in blocks, 'attractively dressed up' for sale under names which would appeal to candy consumers, and is usually consumed in the same manner as candy, that is, eaten in small quantities from the hand as a sweetmeat. One of the respondents described its product as a 'confection' upon some of its labels and display matter.\n Respondents rest their case mainly upon differences in compositin of sweet chocolate from that of confectionery, made principally of sugar or molasses, with or without the addition of coloring or flavoring matter, which, it is urged, is alone described by the word 'candy.' They \n\n[283 U.S. 488, 491]\n\u00a0\n assert that chocolate is food and candy is not, and hence chocolate cannot be properly described as candy. But it is common knowledge that sugar, also a food, is an ingredient both of candy as thus defined and of sweet chocolate, sometimes to the extent of 50 per cent. or more of the latter, as was conceded on the argument here. We likewise know, as was conceded, that chocolate in a great variety of forms is an important ingredient of what is commonly known as candy, and that pieces of sweet chocolate of the type described by the findings are often included in packages of confectionery commonly sold as candy. These considerations at least suggest that the form and use of sugar compounds, intended for taste gratifying consumption, are quite as important in determining whether they are candy, as their particular composition. See Malley v. Walter Baker & Co., supra, page 46 of 281 F.\n No doubt the word 'candy,' in view of its use to designate confections made principally of sugar before the widespread consumption of sweet chocolate preparations as confections or sweetmeats, and as the dictionary suggests, may be used in this narrower and more restricted sense. But it may be, and we think is used, as the dictionary also suggests, in a popular and more general sense, as synonymous with sugar compounds sold and used as confectionery or sweetmeats, and embraces them, as well as candy made chiefly of sugar.\n If it were necessary to our decision, in the absence of any controlling legislative history or any suggested plausible reason why a tax on candy, in a general revenue measure taxing luxuries, should be deemed to apply to one type of confectionery and not the other, we should hesitate to say that the word was used in its restricted sense, or to hold that a substance made of sugar and chocolate, a widely known and popular form of confectionery identified, in use and method of distribution, with other \n\n[283 U.S. 488, 492]\n\u00a0\n types of confectionery known as 'candy,' was not intended to be taxed. See DeGanay v. Lederer, \n250 \nU.S. 376, 381\n, 39 S. Ct. 524; Van Camp & Sons v. American Can Co., \n278 \nU.S. 245, 253\n, 49 S. Ct. 112, 60 A. L. R. 1060\n\n\n Possible doubts as to the proper construction of the language used should be resolved in the light of its administrative and legislative history. Shortly after the adoption of the 1918 Act, Art. 22 of Regulations 47, May 1, 1919, announced that 'Candy within the meaning of the act includes ... sweet chocolate and sweet milk chocolate, whether plain or mixed with fruit or nuts.' This continued to be the ruling of the Treasury Department until the repeal of the tax by section 1100(a) of the Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 352. It and later regulations excluded unsweetened chocolate from the tax and, as revised in December, 1920, the regulation, and also article 19 of Regulations 47, January 6, 1922, under the 1921 Act, excluded from the tax all sweet chocolate which obviously would not be consumed in the condition or form in which sold. This was but a recognition that use may be a determining factor in ascertaining what sugar compounds are embraced in the word candy.\n The administrative construction was upheld in 1922 by Malley v. Walter Baker & Co., supra, the only case, other than the present, which has considered it. The provision has been consistently enforced as construed, was re-enacted by Congress in the 1921 Act, and remained on the statute books without amendment until its repeal. Such a construction of a doubtful or ambiguous statute by officials charged with its administration will not be judicially disturbed except for reasons of weight, which this record does not present. See Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327, 336\n, 50 S. Ct. 115; Universal Battery Co. v. United Sttes, \n281 \nU.S. 580, 583\n, 50 S. Ct. 422; Fawcus Machine Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 375, 378\n, 51 S. Ct. 144. The reenactment of the statute by Congress, as well as the failure to amend it in the face of the consistent \n\n[283 U.S. 488, 493]\n\u00a0\n administrative construction, is at least persuasive of a legislative recognition and approval of the statute as construed. See National Lead Co. v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 140, 146\n, 40 S. Ct. 237. We see no reason for rejecting that construction.\n The court below found support for its decision in the fact that various tariff and revenue acts have separately classified candy and chocolate, and respondents make the point here. But it is to be noted that in none of the acts cited does the word candy appear alone, as in the present statute. In the earlier tariff acts the duty was laid on 'sugar candy.' See Act of August 10, 1970, 1 Stat. 180; Act of June 7, 1794, 1 Stat. 390. In those of August 5, 1909, 36 Stat. 11; October 3, 1913, 38 Stat. 144; and September 21, 1922, 42 Stat. 858 (19 USCA  121, schedule 5, 505, schedule 7, par. 775), which may be taken as typical, a duty was imposed on importations of 'sugar candy and all confectioners not specially provided for' at one rate and by a different paragraph, on chocolate, at a different rate. The differences in rate made classification necessary; and as the cacao bean is not produced in the United States and sugar is, that fact may be taken to account in a tariff act for the differences both in rate and classification. But a difference in composition, relatively minor so far as it has any hearing on the general character of the product or its use, is of little moment in determining whether the product falls within or without a single class of luxuries taxed, for revenue only, at a single rate. Similarly, rulings of the Department of Agriculture setting up standards under the Pure Food Laws for the composition of various types of confectionery, including sweet chocolate, throw no light on the present problem.\n Nor do we think of significance the fact relied upon here and by the court below that statements inconsistent with the conclusion which we reach were made to committees of Congress or in discussions on the floor of the Senate by senators who were not in charge of the bill. \n\n[283 U.S. 488, 494]\n\u00a0\n For reasons which need not be re stated, such individual expressions are with out weight in the interpretation of a statute See Duplex Co. v.

Hagan, of Tulsa, Okl., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Smith, a citizen and resident of Oklahoma, died as a result of injuries alleged to have been negligently inflicted by the respondents. His widow was appointed administratrix of his estate by an Oklahoma probate court, and, as such, instituted an action for damages in a district court of that state, against the respondents and certain individuals, under a statute1 creating a cause of action for death by wrongful act. Such a proceeding is required to be brought by the administrator, if there be one. The amount recovered does not constitute assets of the estate, but is to be divided between the widow and children.\n The cause was removed to the United States District Court. The administratrix filed a motion to remand, which was overruled. She then dismissed the action. Subsequently she brought a second suit as administratrix, against the respondents and certain of their employees, upon the same cause of action, in a district court of Oklahoma; and a little later brought a third against the same or some of the same defendants in another state district court. Both were removed into the appropriate United States District Courts. Motions to remand were \n\n[284 U.S. 183, 185]\n\u00a0\n overruled, and both were thereupon dismissed by the plaintiff.\n The widow resigned as administratrix, and upon her request the probate court appointed petitioner as administrator. He was and is a resident and citizen of Louisiana, of which state the respondent Fitzsimmons Drilling Company is also a citizen. He filed the present action in a state court, and the respondents again removed to the United States District Court. The petitioner having moved to remand, the respondents answered, charging fraud and collusion on the part of the widow, her attorney, and the petitioner, the alleged object of which was to prevent removal by having an administrator appointed whose citizenship was the same as that of one of the defendants. A hearing was had at which it was proved that the motive for the appointment was to obviate the diverse citizenship of the parties which had justified the removal of the earlier suits, and that petitioner had, as a favor to the widow and her attorney, agreed to act as administrator. The District Court refused to remand. To this refusal the petitioner saved proper exceptions.\n It should perhaps be remarked that in this last suit there was included a second cause of action for pain and suffering caused the deceased between the date of his injury, and that of his death; but no question here arises in respect of this cause of action, and for present purposes it may be disregarded.\n At the trial on the merits a demurrer to petitioner's evidence was sustained, and judgment for respondents resulted. On appeal, the Circuit Court affirmed, holding that the cause was properly removed. \n2\n This Court granted certiorari. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[284 U.S. 183, 186]\n\u00a0\n It is settled that the federal courts have jurisdiction of suits by and against executors and administrators if their citizenship be diverse from that of the opposing party, although their testators or intestates might not have been entitled to sue or been liable to suit in those courts for want of diversity of citizenship. Childress v. Emory, 8 Wheat, 643; Coal Co. v. Blatchford, 11 Wall. 172; Rice v. Houston, 13 Wall. 66; Amory v. Amory, \n95 U.S. 186\n; Blake v. McKim, \n103 U.S. 336\n; American Bible Society v.

It was, however, held by the court below that this principle is inapplicable to a case, like the present, where the administrator sues, not for the benefit of the estate, but of certain named beneficiaries amongst whom the amount recovered must be divided. That court likened such a case to one where suit by the beneficiary is required to be brought in the name of a state, county, or official body, although such nominal plaintiff has no interest in the result, and is not permitted to control the litigation (McNutt v. Bland, 2 How. 9; Maryland v. Baldwin, \n112 \nU.S. 490\n, 5 S. Ct. 278); or to actions instituted by a next friend, where it has been held that the infant is the real party in interest, whose citizenship determines the question of diversity (Voss v. Neineber (C. C.) 68 F. 947; Blumenthal v. Craig (C. C. A.) 81 F. 320).\n The petitioner insists that, where an administrator is required to bring the suit under a statute giving a right to recover for death by wrongful act, and is, as here, charged with the responsibility for the conduct or settlement of such suit and the distribution of its proceeds to the persons entitled under the statute, and is liable upon his official bond for failure to act with diligence and fidelity, he is the real party in interest, and his citizenship, rather than that of the beneficiaries, is determinative of federal jurisdiction. This we think is the correct view. The applicable statutes make the administrator the trustee of an \n\n[284 U.S. 183, 187]\n\u00a0\n express trust and require the suit to be brought and controlled by him. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Under these circumstances the rule laid down in Mexican Central Ry. Co. v. Eckman, \n187 \nU.S. 429\n, 23 S. Ct. 211, is applicable. That was an action in a federal court in Texas by a guardian, a citizen of that state, against a Massachusetts corporation, to recover for an injury to a minor which occurred in Mexico. A plea in abatement averred that the ward and his parents were citizens of Illinois, and that the court was therefore without jurisdiction. This Court examined the state law, and ascertained that it authorized a guardian to bring suit in his own name. It was held that his citizenship, not that of his ward, determined the right to resort to the federal court. At page 434 of 187 U. S., 23 S. Ct. 211, 213, it was said:\n'If in the state of the forum the general guardian has the right to bring suit in his own name as such guardian, and does so, he is to be treated as the party plaintiff so far as Federal jurisdiction is concerned, even though suit might have been instituted in the name of the ward by guardian ad litem or next friend. He is liable for costs in the event of failure to recover and for attorneys' fees to those he employs to bring the suit, and in the event of success, the amount recovered must be held for disposal according to law, and if he does not pay the same over to the parties entitled, he would be liable therefor on his official bond.'\n\n See, also, City of Detroit v. Blanchfield (C. C. A.) 13 F.(2d) 13, 47 A. L. R. 314.\n It has been held that the same rule applies in the case of suits by administrators to recover for death by wrongful act, whether the statute provides that the amount recovered be for certain relatives of the decedent or be \n\n[284 U.S. 183, 188]\n\u00a0\n general assets of the estate. Harper v. N. & W. R. Co. (C. C.) 36 F. 102; Popp v. C., H. & D. Ry. Co. (C. C.) 96 F. 465; C., H. & D. R. Co. v. Thiebaud (C. C. A.) 114 F. 918; Bishop v. B. & M. R. R. Co. (C. C.) 117 F. 771; Memphis St. Ry. Co. v. Bobo (C. C. A.) 232 F. 708.\n The court below relied on Stewart v. B. & O. R. R. Co., \n168 \nU.S. 445\n, 18 S. Ct. 105. That authority is not in point. It dealt with the question whether an administrator appointed in the District of Columbia could bring suit there for a death occurring in Maryland-the latter's statute providing that such suit should be brought in the name of the state. It was held that the suit might be maintained, as the administrator would be required to make distribution of the amount recovered in accordance with the laws of Maryland. No question of a fraudulent attempt to avoid jurisdiction by reason of lack of diversity of citizenship arose or was considered in the case.\n The respondents assert that the present case is taken out of the general rule by its peculiar facts, which it is alleged demonstrate that a fraud was perpetrated to avoid federal jurisdiction. They point out that, after the widow in her capacity as administratrix had repeatedly failed to prevent the removal of her successive actions, her attorney had her resign and nominate in her stead the petitioner, who did not know her, had not known the decedent, knew of no assets in Louisiana, and consented to be substituted for her as a favor to her attorney; that petitioner did not sign his own bond, did not come to the state of Oklahoma to be appointed, and upon his appointment at once named the widow as his state agent in Oklahoma. They concede, as they must, that as a nonresident he was qualified under the Oklahoma law if appointed by the probate court to act as administrator. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[284 U.S. 183, 189]\n\u00a0\n His appointment was regular and in accordance with the statutes and the decree of the probate court may not be collaterally attacked in the present proceeding. See McGehee v. McCarley (C. C. A.) 91 F. 462; American Car & Foundry Co. v. Anderson (C. C. A.) 211 F. 301. It is nevertheless insisted that, if the petitioner's appointment was accomplished for the purpose of avoiding diversity of citizenship and consequent removal into the United States court, the parties to that proceeding-the petitioner, the widow, and her attorney-were in a conspiracy to defeat federal jurisdiction.\n But it is clear that the motive or purpose that actuated any or all of these parties in procuring a lawful and valid appointment is immaterial upon the question of identity or diversity of citizenship. To go behind the decree of the probate court would be collaterally to attack it, not for lack of jurisdiction of the subject-matter or absence of jurisdictional facts, but to inquire into purposes and motives of the parties before that court when, confessedly, they practiced no fraud upon it. The case falls clearly within the authorities announcing the principle that in a removal proceeding the motive of a plaintiff in joining defendants is immaterial, provided there is in good faith a cause of action against those joined. While those cases involve a somewhat different situation-that where a plaintiff joins defendants in order to avoid federal jurisdiction-they are in principle applicable to the present case, where it is claimed a plaintiff was procured for the same purpose. It has been uniformly held that, where there is a prima facie joint liability, averment and proof that resident and nonresident tortfeasors are jointly sued for the purpose of preventing removal does not amount to an allegation that the joinder was fraudulent, and will not justify a removal from the state court. Illinois Central R. R. v. Sheegog, \n215 \nU.S. 308\n, 30 S. Ct. 101; C., B. & Q. R. R. Co. v. Willard, \n220 \nU.S. 413\n, 31 S. Ct. 460; C., R. I. & P. \n\n[284 U.S. 183, 190]\n\u00a0\n Ry. Co. v. Schwyhart, \n227 \nU.S. 184\n, 33 S. Ct. 250. The facts disclosed in this record fall far short of proof of actual fraud such as was held sufficient to justify removal in Morris v. Gilmer, \n129 \nU.S. 315\n, 9 S. Ct. 289; Lehigh Mining & Manufacturing Company v. Kelly, \n160 \nU.S. 327\n, 16 S. Ct. 307; Lake County Commissioners v. Dudley, \n173 \nU.S. 243\n, 19 S.

Ct. 35.\n The case comes to no more than this. There being, under Oklahoma law, a right to have a nonresident appointed administrator, the parties in interest lawfully applied to an Oklahoma court, and petitioner was appointed administrator, with the result that the cause of action for the wrongful death of the decedent vested in him. His citizenship being the same as that of one of the defendants there was no right of removal to the federal court; and it is immaterial that the motive for obtaining his appointment and qualification was that he might thus be clothed with a right to institute a action which could not be so removed on the ground of diversity of citizenship.\n We are of opinion that the petitioner's motion to remand the cause to the state court should have been granted. The judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded to the United States District Court, with directions to set aside the judgment and remand the case to the state court.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sections 822-825, Comp.

An appeal brings the case here.\n The road district was created, and commissioners therefor were appointed, by the board of supervisors of the county in February, 1926, under chapter 277 of the State Laws of 1920. With an approving vote of the district's electors, and at the request of the commissioners, the board of supervisors then issued and sold bonds of the district in the sum of $6, 500 to provide money for the construction and maintenance of public roads in the district-the particular roads to be determined later on as provided in section 5 of chapter 277.\n At this stage of the proceedings the state Legislature, desiring to put at rest any question respecting the validity of the creation of the district and the issue of the bonds, passed two acts confirming both. One of these acts took effect on March 11, 1926, and the other four days later. The first, being chapter 1080 of the local laws of that year, applied to this district alone. The second, being chapter 278 of the general laws of that year, applied broadly to all districts in the situation of this one, and to others.\n After the enactment of the confirmatory measures the commissioners, with the approval of the board of supervisors, designated two roads-one branching from the other-as the ones to be constructed and maintained out of the proceeds of the bonds; and in due course the work of construction was begun and carried to completion.\n In November, 1926, the board of supervisors, at the request of the commissioners, levied on all taxable property, real and personal, within the district an ad valorem tax to meet the first instalment of interest and principal \n\n[282 U.S. 241, 244]\n\u00a0\n upon the bonds, that instalment being payable in the following February. The tax was four-tenths of 1 per cent. of the assessed value of the property as fixed for state and county taxes. The amount so charged on the appellant's property was about $450, and this is the tax against which the suit is directed.\n The Supreme Court of the state in the decision under review holds that the creation of the road district, the issue of the bonds, and the levy of the tax were all valid under the state Constitution and the acts before cited; that the board of supervisors in creating the district acted in a legislative capacity, they being invested by the Constitution and statutes of the state with discretion to create the district, or refuse to create it, according to their judgment of the best interests of all concerned; and that the two confirmatory acts were valid under the state Constitution and operated to make the district a legislatively created district if it was not such before. These were all questions of state law, and their decision by that court is controlling here.\n Counsel for the appellant so understand the situation, for in their last brief they say 'that it (appellant) and this Court are bound by the decision of the State's highest court relating to the state constitution and state statutes and that it is no longer possible here for appellant to contend that the district was invalidly organized or that the special validating act approved as constitutional under the constitution of Mississippi did not serve to place the Oldham road district in the class of legislatively created districts.' And also that 'the Supreme Court of Mississippi in the decision below expressly held that the board of supervisors of a Mississippi county was vested with authority to deny the petition to create he district. District thus created, within the discretion of the board of supervisors, are, therefore, under this decision, equivalent to legislatively created districts, and hence a taxpayer \n\n[282 U.S. 241, 245]\n\u00a0\n whose property is included therein is not entitled to notice and hearing within the doctrine aforesaid of Browning v. Hooper, (\n269 \nU.S. 396\n, 46 S. Ct. 141).'\n The only question presented in the Supreme Court of the state which is open here is whether the act of 1920 and the confirmatory acts of 1926, as construed and applied in this case, are invalid as authorizing the imposition of a tax which is so palpably arbitrary and unreasonably discriminatory that it offends the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n On the part of the appellant the tax is said to be thus objectionable, because it is imposed to pay for local road improvements and is not apportioned according to benefits, but is laid upon all the property, real and personal, within the district on an ad valorem basis; because the property of the appellant, and particularly its personal property, receives no benefit from the improvements; and because, even if there be some benefit to the appellant's property, the tax laid thereon is disproportionate to the benefit and to the tax laid on other property.\n The construction and maintenance of serviceable roads in any community is a matter in which the whole community have an interest and is a typical purpose for which property may be taxed by the state. Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Western Crawford Road District, \n266 \nU.S. 187, 190\n, 45 S. Ct. 31. Whether the tax shall be state wide or confined to the county or local district wherein the improvement is made, and whether it shall be laid generally on all property or all real property within the taxing unit, or shall be laid only on real property specially benefited, are matters which rest in the discretion of the state, and are not controlled by either the due process or the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. County of Mobile v. Kimball, \n102 U.S. 691\n, 703; Spencer v. Merchant, \n125 U.S. 345\n, 355-356, 8 S. Ct. 921; Houck v. Little River District, \n239 \nU.S. 254, 262\n, 265 S., 36 S.

Western Crawford Road District, supra; Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Road Improvement District No. 3, \n266 \nU.S. 379, 386\n, 45 S. Ct. 136.\n But, however the tax may be laid, if it be palpably arbitrary, and therefore a plain abuse of power, it falls within the condemnation of the due process clause, Houck v. Little River District, supra; Valley Farms Co. v. Westchester, supra; and if it be manifestly and unreasonably discriminatory it falls within the condemnation of the equal protection clause. Gast Realty Co. v. Schneider Granite Co., \n240 \nU.S. 55\n, 36 S. Ct. 254; Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Road Improvement District No. 6, \n256 \nU.S. 658\n, 41 S. Ct. 604; Thomas v.

Ct. 563.\n Where the tax is laid generally on all property or all real property within the taxing unit, it does not become arbitrary or discriminatory merely because it is spread over such property on an ad valorem basis; nor where the tax is thus general and ad valorem does its validity depend upon the receipt of some special benefit as distinguished from the general benefit to the community. St. Louis & Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Nattin, \n277 \nU.S. 157\n, 48 S. Ct. 438; Valley Farms Co. v. Westchester, supra; Houck v. Little River District, supra; Miller & Lux v. Sacramento Drainage District, \n256 \nU.S. 129\n, 41 S. Ct. 404; Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Western Crawford Road District, supra.\n The Oldham oad district was created, not as a temporary expedient to accomplish a particular road improvement and defray the cost of that work, but as a permanent agency invested with continuing authority to provide and maintain suitable district roads under the supervision of the county board. The state laws provide for accomplishing road improvements and paying therefor in two distinct ways-one through special benefit assessment districts \n\n[282 U.S. 241, 247]\n\u00a0\n and the other through established local districts authorized to defray the cost by general taxes. In the decision under review the Supreme Court of the state holds that the Oldham district is 'not a special benefit assessment district,' but one wherein road improvement expenses and bonds issued therefor are to be paid by general taxes.\n The district is rural, comprises four full sections of land and fractions of two sections, 2,950 acres in all, and is about two miles wide and two and a half miles long. The railroad of the appellant extends through the southerly part of the district of about two miles and for about a half mile more lies just inside the southerly line. The appellant's property in the district consists of right of way, 2.88 miles of main track, 2.69 miles of side track, section house site, and a small fraction of its rolling stock. The value of this property as assessed for state and county taxes was $113,200, and the value of other property in the district as so assessed was $68,246, making a total of $181,446. These valuations are not questioned here.\n When the district was organized it was not far advanced or well developed. Along the appellant's railroad were two large and extensively worked gravel pits with an output of about 8,000 cars a year, which were being shipped over the appellant's railroad and were bringing it a gross yearly return of about $250,000. The gravel was of superior quality, of almost inexhaustible quantity, and in much demand. Relatively small quantities of pulpwood and lumber were also being shipped from the district over the appellant's railroad in car load lots. Grain and other products of the district destined to be shipped away usually were hauled by the producers to a nearby town which was on the appellant's railroad and without other railroad facilities. The Lee highway, a good road leading to that town, crossed the most southerly part of the district south of and near the appellant's railroad. Another good road leading to the same town lay north of the dis- \n\n[282 U.S. 241, 248]\n\u00a0\n trict. But, apart from the Lee Highway, the roads then in the district were not good at any time and in some seasons were almost impassable.\n When the bonds were voted, issued, and sold it was not known what road or roads would be constructed with the proceeds, for as yet no road had been selected. Under the state law that matter remained open until the selection was made by the commissioners and approved by the county supervisors. Board of Supervisors v. Callender, 128 Miss. 159, 90 So. 722.\n The roads ultimately selected and actually constructed are in the form of an inverted Y with the stem extending to the northerly line of the district and the arms extending to the two gravel pits and the adjacent side tracks of the appellant's railroad near the southerly line. From each arm there is a connection with the Lee highway near the southern border of the district, and at the other end of the stem there is a connection leading to the road on the north. The roads so constructed are not parallel to the appellant's railroad, but practically at right angles to it.\n The appellant sought by its evidence to prove that these roads could be of no benefit whatever to it. Part of this evidence tended merely to show that railroads receive no benefit from public roads running parallel to them, and so was not in point. And much of its came from witnesses whose knowledge of the relevant conditions within the district and surrounding it was so meagre that little weight could be accorded to their testimony. On the other hand, the appellees produced witnesses having sme familiarity with the district and its surroundings whose testimony, although open to some criticism, tended to show that the roads would be of real benefit to the appellant both by enabling it to retain old business and by bringing new business to it. Both state courts found that there would be appreciable benefit, and we think \n\n[282 U.S. 241, 249]\n\u00a0\n their finding has such support in the evidence that it should not be disturbed.\n Upon applying the settled rules before stated to the case presented, we are of opinion that the appellant has not shown that the tax imposed under the sanction of the state statutes is either palpably arbitrary or unreasonably discriminatory. It was imposed for what obviously is a public purpose. It was a general tax and admissibly was spread over all the taxable property in the district according to the value thereof as fixed by the assessment for state and county taxes. The appellant was afforded ample opportunity by the state law to be heard on that assessment and to have it corrected if erroneous or unfair, and is not challenging it now. The chief complaint made here is that the imposition of the tax on an ad valorem basis was 'inherently invalid' under the due process and equal protection clauses. That complaint is not tenable, as is shown in several cases before cited. And, as the tax was general and ad valorem, its validity, as was held in St. Louis & Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Nattin, supra, 'does not depend upon the receipt of any special benefit by the taxpayer.'\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","99":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMERCHANTS' WAREHOUSE CO. v. UNITED STATES(1931)\nNo. 635\nArgued: April 21, 1931Decided: May 18, 1931\n\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 501, 503]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Davis, of New York City, and M. Hampton Todd, of Philadelphia, Pa., for Merchants' Warehouse Co. and others.\n Mr. H. Edgar Barnes, of Philadelphia, Pa., for Pennsylvania Warehousing & Safe Deposit Co.\n Mr. John P. Connelly, of Philadelphia, Pa., for Philadelphia Warehousing & Cold Storage Co.\n Mr. J. Stanley Payne, of Washington, D. C., for the United States and Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. John J. Hickey, of Washington, D. C., for James Gallagher and others.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are appeals under section 238 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  345), from a decree of a District Court of three judges for Eastern Pennsylvania, dismissing the bills of complaint by which appellants, warehousing corporations doing business in Philadelphia, sought to set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission. 44 F.(2d) 379. The order required the Reading Company and the Pennsylvania and Baltimore & Ohio railroads, interstate rail carriers, to cancel such provisons in their tariffs as pur- \n\n[283 U.S. 501, 504]\n\u00a0\n ported to make the warehouses of appellants in Philadelphia a part of the station facilities of the carriers. and directed that they cease and desist from making allowances to appellants in connection with the loading and unloading of package freight at the latter's warehouses. There are also cross-appeals from an order of the District Court staying the order of the Commission pending disposition of the appeals in this court.\n The three railroads load and unload package freight at their stations in Philadelphia. The Pennsylvania and Baltimore & Ohio railroads have designated some of appellants' warehouses as parts of their station facilities there. All three have contracts of long standing with one or more appellants, under which the latter, at their warehouses, afford facilities and perform services, in connection with the loading and unloading of package freight, which they denominate terminal facilities and services, and for which the railroads pay them a stipulated compensation. In the case of the Pennsylvania, provision is made for this allowance in its published tariff.\n Six warehouse companies, appellees, which also maintain warehouses in Philadelphia with private railroad sidings connected with one or another of the three railroads, and are competitors of appellants, instituted proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission, in which they assailed the terminal service contracts referred to as unjustly discriminatory and unduly preferential, and the payments made under them as unlawful rebates. Numerous merchants' organizations of Philadelphia intervened in the proceedings, which were consolidated and heard as a single cause, and resulted in the order before us. 160 I. C. C. 563.\n The Interstate Commerce Commission and the court below found the facts as already stated and also the following: Carload freight, carried at carload rates, is customarily loaded and unloaded by the owner or consignee, as required by rule 27 of the Consolidated Freight Classi- \n\n[283 U.S. 501, 505]\n\u00a0\n fication, filed under section 6 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  6), with the binding force of a tariff schedule. By exceptions to the classification, the railroads undertake, as a part of the transportation service covered by their tariffs, to load and unload carload package freight at their Philadelphia freight stations, except when handled directly to or from cars on team tracks. At their warehouses appellants load and unload cars and perform other services presently to be referred to, for which the railroads compensate them by the challenged allowances. These services do not differ in substance from those which the competing warehouses render. Both handle the same classes of freight and procure its shipment to or from them by advertising in trade publications and in circulars to prospective customers. Shippers using public warehouse facilities generally select the company offering the lowest aggregate charge for the distribution of their goods, and, by reason of the allowances made, the contract warehouses are able to quote lower prices than their competitors, thus securing business which would otherwise go to the latter. The primary motive for the payment of the allowances to the contract warehouses is to gain traffic, and the allowances are compensation to appellants for their solicitation of freight movements over the lines of the carriers.\n The Commission and court also found as follows: Appellants' warehouses, while nominally open to the general public as railroad freight stations, are not in fact public stations, but are confined to the warehousing of merchandise for their patrons. The services which they perform in connection with loading and unloading of freight, including the sending of arrival notices to their patrons after receipt of notice of arrival from the railroad, the collection of freight charges, and other incidental matters, are in fact performed for the owners of the merchandise rather than for the railroads. While the contract warehouses are not owners of goods received or shipped, the dealings of the railroads are with them and \n\n[283 U.S. 501, 506]\n\u00a0\n not with the owners of the goods; and as to many of the inbound carload shipments, the contract warehouses are the only parties to whom delivery of the goods could be made as carload shipments, the real owners being concerns which ship carload merchandise to appellants for distribution by them in less than carload lots. The contract warehouses, being given dominion over the merchandise for transportation purposes, are to be deemed consignors of shipments from, and consignees of shipments to, their warehouses.\n Appellants do not seriously contend that the challenged allowances are not discriminatory in fact, but maintain that the discrimination is one which the law permits. While conceding that the contract warehouses and their patrons, by virtue of the contracts and allowances, gain important business advantages over their competitors, they insist that the advantages are those which flow exclusively from the fact that the contract warehousemen are agents of the carriers in the performance of transportation services, and that since the railroads may properly perform such services at their own stations and include charges for them in their filed tariffs, they may likewise select the warehouses of appellants as stations, perform the services there, and employ and compensate the warehousemen for doing them. As these contentions do not comport with the findings of the Commission and the court below that the contract warehouses are not in fact open public freight stations, and that the services rendered are not transportation services, those findings are sharply challenged as without support in the evidence.\n We may assume that the railroads, in order to carry on their business as interstate carriers, are not bound to maintain their own freight stations, but may contract with others to supply them and to perform there the transportation services which they are under a duty to perform. Arbuckle Case (United States v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R.) \n231 \nU.S. 274\n, 34 S. Ct. 75. If appellants' warehouses were held out to the public by the carriers, and used \n\n[283 U.S. 501, 507]\n\u00a0\n exclusively, as freight stations, and the services rendered there were exclusively transportatin services which the carriers were either bound or permitted to render, the case would lack those elements which appellees urge as challenging the right of the carriers to make the allowances of appellants. They say that the warehouses of appellants are devoted to their private business activities in the storage, distribution, and assembling of freight for their patrons before or after its rail transportation, and that the alleged transportation services are but a part of these activities, not differing from those performed by other warehouses for their patrons as a part of their warehousing business. Appellees contend that the designation of them as transportation services, only when performed at warehouses of appellants, enables the carriers to discriminate in favor of appellants, at the expense of their competitors, by compensating for them in that guise, or, what is the same thing, by extending to appellants at their warehouses the benefit of transportation services withheld from their competitors.\n We think, as the court below held, that the Commission's finding that appellants' warehouses are not in fact public freight stations, is supported by the evidence. As already indicated, they are owned or controlled by appellants and used by them as storage and distribution warehouses located on private premises, served by private side tracks. They are not leased to the railroads. There is no provision in the contracts between the carriers and the warehousemen which suggests that the warehouses were regarded or intended to be treated by either as freight stations. There was evidence that, apart from the designation of the warehouses as stations in the tariffs, they were neither held out nor treated as such by carriers or appellants, nor known as such generall to shippers or to representative trucking companies engaged in the business of handling freight in Philadelphia. Pamphlet instructions by the railroads to their employees list their \n\n[283 U.S. 501, 508]\n\u00a0\n public freight stations in Philadelphia, but list appellants' warehouses as private industries served by private side tracks. None of the appellants acted as freight agents for the carriers or issued bills of lading. While there was evidence of shipment from appellants' warehouses of freight delivered to them by truck or previously stored there, it did not appear that any shipments were made except for those who were patrons of the warehouses. There were instances where freight brought by truck to contract warehouses and tendered by nonpatrons for shipment over the road serving them were rejected on the sole ground that the warehouses were not freight stations, and the intending shippers were instructed by those in charge to tender the shipment at a 'freight station' of the carrier.\n This and other evidence, which it is unnecessary to review at length, support the conclusion of the Commission that appellants' warehouses are not in fact public freight stations; that the services performed there by appellants do not differ from those performed by their competitors; and that their designation as freight stations was nominal only, the real purpose being the compensation of appellants for soliciting freight shipments over the lines of the carriers. See O'Keefe v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 294, 303\n, 36 S. Ct. 313. This evidence distinguishes the present case from the Arbuckle Case, supra, on which appellants rely. Cf. Terminal Warehouse Co. v. United States (D. C.) 31 F.( 2d) 951. The credibility of witnesses and weight of evidence are for the Commission and not for the courts, and its findings will not be reviewed here if supported by evidence. See Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R. R., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 92\n, 100 S., 33 S. Ct. 185; United States v. Louisville & Nashville R. R., \n235 \nU.S. 314, 320\n, 35 S. Ct. 113; Assigned Car Cases, \n274 \nU.S. 564, 580\n, 581 S., 47 S. Ct. 727\n\n\n Even though appellants' warehouses are not public freight stations, the questions remain whether the services \n\n[283 U.S. 501, 509]\n\u00a0\n for which the allowances are made are transportation services for which the carriers may lawfully compensate, and, if they are, whether the carriers may discriminate by granting such compensation to appellants and not to others. Under the contracts those services begin with the receipt for shipment of outgoing freight (the contract with the Reading Company applies only to inbound freight) and with the unloading of the cars of inbound freight. They end with loading for shipment of outgoing freight and, in the case of inbound freight, with the expiration of the forty- eight hour period of free time during which the carrier allows freight to remain at its freight stations, without charge, before delivery to the consignee, or with the delivery, during the period, of the freight on the truck platform of the warehouse. From the expiration of that period, freight not delivered is held by appellants either under such warehousing agreements as they may make with owners or consignees, or, in the absence of such agreements, as undelivered freight stored with them by the carriers for the account of the owners.\n During this period, they perform three important items of service, not to mention minorones ones which, for present purposes, may be disregarded, but for all of which together the allowances are made. They load and unload cars; they may store the freight or some of it; and, what is of vital importance, so far as the present issues of discrimination and rebating are concerned, they may assemble package freight of less than carload lots and ship it in carloads at carload rates, and distribute or reship, in less than carload lots, a large amount of package freight, carried in carloads at carload rates.\n Addressing ourselves first to the nature of this third item of servce , we note that the rates of the three railroads for transportation of freight in carloads are substantially lower than for package freight in less than car- \n\n[283 U.S. 501, 510]\n\u00a0\n load lots. By Rule 23 of the Consolidated Freight Classification, the carriers may not distribute carload of freight in less than carload load lots, nor assemble smaller lots into carloads. By Rule 14, the carriers confine their service with respect to carload shipments to one consignor and one consignee. The service rendered by appellants' warehouses in distributing and assembling package carload freight is thus one which a carrier is not authorized or permitted to render, even at its own public freight stations, and, if performed by it, would nullify its published rates for carload transportation service. See New York, New Haven & H. R. R. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n200 \nU.S. 361\n, 26 S. Ct. 272.\n But it is a service which inures to the benefit of shippers by securing delivery to them or their customers in less than carload lots of package freight which is transported at carload rates. When rendered, as it largely is, within the forty-eight hours' free time, that benefit is without expense to appellants or their patrons, since it is included in the service for which the carriers pay. A substantial part of the inbound freight, varying from 35 per cent. to 80 per cent. at the different contract warehouses, is delivered or shipped from them within the forty- eight hours' free time. The amount of the allowances paid during the four years preceding the hearing aggregated more than $809,000; and the conclusion is inescapable that a very large part of the total is for the service of breaking up and distributing carloads in less than carload lots, which the carriers could not lawfully perform at their own public freight stations. Examination of the evidence can leave no doubt that it is the performance of this service, free of charge, to shippers, featured in appellants' advertising and solicitation of patronage, which induces the consignment of freight by shippers to them over the lines of the carriers and withdraws the business from competing warehouses. Such allowances are forbidden, even though \n\n[283 U.S. 501, 511]\n\u00a0\n paid to appellants and their competitors alike, since, as to both, they would be departures from carload rates of the published tariffs of the carriers and amount to rebates forbidden by sections 2 and 3 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  2, 3). See Lehigh Valley R. R. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 444, 446\n, 37 S. Ct. 434; United States v. Union Stock Yard, \n226 \nU.S. 286, 307\n, 33 S. Ct. 83.\n Apart from this consideration, the practical effect of the arrangement with appellants is that the carriers extend, in the form of money allowances to the favored warehousemen, forty-eight hours' free time, during which carload freight is unloaded at their places of business, stored, and distributed in less than carload lots, all at the expense of the carriers-a privilege which they withhold from other competing warehousemen and from shippers who maintain their own private warehouses on industrial tracks or private sidings. Granted that the carriers might lawfully undertake to perform or pay for some of these services at warehouses served by private side tracks, they may not extend the privilege to some and withold it from others. Section 2 forbids the carrier to discriminate by way of allowances for transportation services given to one, in connection with the delivery of freight at his place of business, which it denies to another in like situation. Union Pacific R. R. Co. c. Updike Grain Co., \n222 \nU.S. 215, 220\n, 32 S. Ct. 39. Appellants rely on Interstate Commerce Commission v. Diffenbaugh, \n222 \nU.S. 42\n, 32 S. Ct. 22, but it is distinguishable from both the present and the Updike Case in that it did not involve discrimination among shippers or consignees, which was condemned in the latter.\n Where a forbidden discrimination is made, the mere fact that it has ben l ong continued, and that the machinery for making it is in tariff form, cannot clothe it with immunity. See Louisville & Nashville R R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n282 \nU.S. 740\n, 51 S. Ct. 297, decided February 24, 1931. In that case we held that a carrier may not haul private cars of some of \n\n[283 U.S. 501, 512]\n\u00a0\n its passengers free of charge and deny the privilege to others on the theory that it is using the cars which it carries free, as instrumentalities of transportation. The very selection of the cars of some passengers and not others for the favored treatment was held to be a forbidden discrimination. The order of the Commission upheld there would be futile if discrimination could still be effected by filing an exception to the carrier's tariffs for hauling private cars, designating some private cars as transportation facilities, and then granting allowances to the owners for their use. That, in substance and practical operation, is the effect of the tariff exceptions and the allowances which the present order forbids.\n Only a word need be said of the objection that appellants and their competitors are not shippers, and that the relationship between them and the carriers is not one subject to control by the Commission. The warehouse companies are 'persons' authorized to lodge a complaint with the Commission by section 13(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  13(1 ), and they are 'persons' within the meaning of that word as used in sections 2 and 3 of the act. The relationship between persons and rail carriers, with which the Commission is authorized to deal, is not formal, and is not to be determined exclusively by reference to bills of lading. In point of substance the warehousemen were consignors and consignees of merchandise, and they alone could act as such in the case of carload shipments which they assembled or distributed. In this respect they do not differ from freight forwarders who render a like service, so far as concerns their relations with the carriers. Lehigh Valley R. R. v. United States, supra; see Interstate Commerce Commission v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. R., \n220 \nU.S. 235\n, 31 S. Ct. 392; Great Northern Ry. Co. v. O'Connor, \n232 \nU.S. 508\n, 34 S. Ct. 380. The evil of discrimination was the principal thing aimed at by the act, see Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. United States, 238 U. S. page 8, 35 S. Ct. 696, and its language is certainly broad \n\n[283 U.S. 501, 513]\n\u00a0\n enough to embrace all discriminations of the sort described which it was within the power of Congress to condemn. Shreveport Case, \n234 \nU.S. 342, 356\n, 34 S. Ct. 833. Section 3 makes it unlawful for any rail carrier 'to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, company, firm, corporation, or locality, or any particular description of traffic, in any respect whatsoever. ...'\n For reasons already indicated the case is not one in which, as appellants argue, the carriers should be left free to remove the discrimination by extending the benefit of the allowances to the competing warehouses. Since the allowances are for services which include the assembling and distribution of carloads from or into less than carload lots, the objections to them would not be removed by extending them to some additional shippers of carloads at carload rates, but not to all, nor even to all under existing tariffs and classifications for the handling of carloads. As the Commission found that appellants' warehouses are not public freight stations in fact, but are such in name only, it rightly secured the discontinuance of the discrimination by ordering the carriers to cease employing the means by which it had been accomplished. New York, New Haven & H. R. R. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, supra, page 404 of 200 U. S., 26 S. Ct. 272. But nothing said here is to be taken as indicating that a carrier may not designate a warehouse as a public freight station and select an agent for its management where a forbdden discrimination is not effected.\n The court below was within the limits of its discretionary power in staying the Commission's order pending the appeal. The practice complained of was of long standing, entered into, so far as appears, in good faith, at a time when the discrimination, if it existed, was much less serious than at present, and before the present prohibitions against such discriminations. Its legality now \n\n[283 U.S. 501, 514]\n\u00a0\n is not free from doubt, as it indicated by the fact that the judges of the court below were not unanimous. The immediate enforcement of the order, if the judgment below were not affirmed here, would have resulted in a serious and unnecessary disturbance of a course of business affecting, not alone the parties to this litigation, but the patrons of the various warehouses, which the court below found would be irreparable. These considerations, taken together, were sufficient to call for the exercise of its discretion. Cf. Virginian Ry. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 672\n, 47 S.

Ed. -, October 13, 1930, to review a judgment of the Court of Claims denying to petitioners recovery of a tax alleged to have been illegally exacted under the decedents' estates provisions of the Revenue Act of 1918. 38 F.(2d) 381; Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1096, 1097, 1149, 1150\n\n\n In December, 1916, while the Revenue Act of that year was in force ( Act of Sept. 8, 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, 777), petitioners' decedent gave to his children certain shares of corporate stock. The donor died March 5, 1920, \n\n[283 U.S. 15, 19]\n\u00a0\n after the effective date of the 1918 act. The Commissioner included the shares of stock in the decedent's estate as a gift made in contemplation of death, section 402(c) of the 1918 act, and assessed and collected the tax now in suit, which was computed on the basis of the value of the stock at the time of decedent's death, and at the rats i n the 1918 act, which were higher than those fixed by the corresponding provisions of the act of 1916.\n Section 401 of the 1918 act imposed taxes at specified rates upon transfers of estates by decedents. Under section 403, the taxable estate was the 'gross estate' less enumerated deductions. Section 402 provided for the inclusion in the gross estate of the value of property '(c) To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, or with respect to which he has at any time created a trust, in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death (whether such transfer or trust is made or created before or after the passage of this act). ...' The Revenue Act of 1916 ,  201, 202(b), which had contained similar provisions for the taxing of decedents' estates, including gifts in contemplation of death, but at lower rates, was repealed, with provisos not now material, by section 1400 of the 1918 act.\n The finding of the Commissioner that the present gift was in contemplation of death is not questioned by petitioners, and is controlling here, since it is not challenged by any facts appearing of record. Niles Bement Pond Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 357, 361\n, 50 S. Ct. 251; Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co., \n282 \nU.S. 359\n, 51 S. Ct. 150, decided January 5, 1931. Although antedating the enactment of section 402, the gift is embraced within its provisions, which are in terms applicable to gifts in contemplation of death made before the passage of the act.\n Petitioners' argument that section 402 does not apply is not supported by their citations of Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339\n, 49 S. Ct. 123, 66 A. L. R. 397, and May v. Heiner, \n281 \nU.S. 238\n, 50 S. Ct. 286, 62 A. L. R. 1244. In \n\n[283 U.S. 15, 20]\n\u00a0\n those cases the gifts inter vivos were not 'in contemplation of death,' and the only relevant question was one of construction, whether some of them were of the class intended by Congress to be taxable under section 402(c) as transfers 'intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death.' It was held that they were not. But those gifts were not of the class now involved, gifts in contemplation of death, made before the passage of the act, which are expressly named by section 402(c) as subject to its provisions.\n This court has not passed directly on the constitutionality of the federal taxation of gifts made in contemplation of death. But taxation of transfers at death has been upheld, Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41\n, 20 S. Ct. 747, as has, more recently, the taxation of gifts inter vivos, Bromley v. McCaughn, \n280 \nU.S. 124\n, 50 S. Ct. 46; and we hold, as this court has several times intimated, that the inclusion of this type of gifts in a single class with decedents' estate to secure equality of taxation, and prevent evasion of estate taxes, is a permissible classification of an appropriate subject of taxation. See Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531, 542\n, 47 S. Ct. 710, 52 A. L. R. 1081; Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497, 505\n, 50 S. Ct. 356, 69 A. L. R. 758; Corliss v.

R. 1224.\n The objection to the tax, chiefly urged in brief and argument, is that the taxing statute, as applied, is a denial of due process of law because retroactive. It is said that the statute is invalid not alone because it reaches a gift made before its enactment, but because it measures the tax by rates not in force when the gift was made, applied to the value of the property not when given, but at the uncertain later time of the death of the donor.\n This court has held the taxation of gifts made, and completely vested beyond recall, before the passage of any statute taxing them,to be so palpably arbitrary and un- \n\n[283 U.S. 15, 21]\n\u00a0\n reasonable as to infringe the due process clause. Nichols v. Coolidge, supra; Untermyer v. Anderson, \n276 \nU.S. 440\n, 48 S. Ct. 353; Coolidge v. Long, \n282 \nU.S. 582\n, 51 S. Ct. 306, decided Feb. 24, 1931.1 In Nichols v. Coolidge, it was held that section 402 of the 1918 act could not constitutionally be applied to a gift inter vivos, not in contemplation of death, and made long before the adoption of any congressional legislation imposing an estate tax or taxing gifts to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death. In Untermyer v. Anderson, supra, it was held that the retroactive provision of the novel gift tax of the Revenue Act of 1924 was invalid as applied to gifts antedating the act. In both the point was stressed, as the basis of decision, that the nature and amount of the tax burden imposed could not have been understood and foreseen by the taxpayer at the time of the particular voluntary act which was made the occasion of the tax. See Nichols v. Coolidge, supra, page 542 of 274 U. S., 47 S. Ct. 710; Untermyer v. Anderson, supra, page 445 of 276 U. S., 48 S. Ct. 353. Upon similar grounds, in Coolidge v. Long, supra, a state tax on successions was held invalid as applied to the gift to the donor's children involved in Nichols v. Coolidge, supra, because deemed to be a tax on a succession to a gift completely vested before the enactment of the taxing act or of any other law taxing successions by lineal descendants of the donor.\n But a tax is not necessarily and certainly arbitrary and therefore invalid because retroactively applied, and taxing acts having retroactive features have been upheld in view of the particular circumstances disclosed and considered by the court. See Stockdale v. Atlantic Insurance Co., 20 Wall. 323, 331; Railroad Co. v. Rose, \n95 U.S. 78\n, 80; Western Union Railroad Co. v. United States, \n101 U.S. 543\n, 549; Flint v.

Ct. 186, decided January 26, 1931.\n Hence, in challenging the present tax it does not suffice to say that the gift antedated the statute. It is necessary to consider the nature of the tax and of the decedent's gift. When the gift was made, it was subject to the provisions of the 1916 Revenue Act. By it, Congress had adopted the well-understood system of taxation of transfers of property at death, already in force in forty-two states. Report No. 793, Senate Committee on Finance; Report No. 922, House Committee on Ways and Means; both on H. R. No. 16763, Sixty-Fourth Congress. A characteristic feature of the system was that incorporated in sections 202(b) of the 1916 act and 402(c) of the 1918 act, both of which imposed a tax on gifts made in contemplation of death, computed at the same value and rate as though the property given had been a part of the donor's estate passing at death. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n While we need not attempt at this time to define with precision gifts in contemplation of death, their characteristic features have been sufficiently indicated by the various treasury regulations dealing with the subject. Regu- \n\n[283 U.S. 15, 23]\n\u00a0\n lation 37 under the 1918 act (revised August 8, 1919) is typical. It provides (article 23): 'The words 'in contemplation of death' do not refer to the general expectation of death which all persons entertain. A transfer, however, is made in contemplation of death wherever the person making it is influenced to do so by such an expectation of death, arising from bodily or mental conditions, as prompts persons to dispose of their property to those whom they deem proper objects of their bounty.'\n It is sufficient for present purposes that such gifts are motivated by the same considerations as lead to testamentary dispositions of property, and made as substitutes for such dispositions without awaiting death, when transfers by will or inheritance become effective. Underlying the present statute is the policy of taxing such gifts equally with testamentary dispositions, for which they may be substituted, and the prevention of the evasion of estate taxes by gifts made before, but in contemplation of, death. It is thus an enactment in aid of, and an integral part of, the legislative scheme of taxation of transfers at death. Decedent's gift as a substitute for a testamentary disposition was thus brought within the operation of the 1916 act taxing such gifts on the same basis, with respect to rate and valuation as transfers of property at death. Not only was the decedent left in no uncertainty that the gift he was then making was subject to the provisions of the existing statute, but, in view of its well-understood purpose, he should be regarded as taking his chances of any increase in the tax burden which might result from carrying out the established policy of taxation under which substitutes for testamentary gifts were classed and taxed with them.\n The reasonableness of the present application of the increased rate of tax of the 1918 act must be determined in the light of the legislative policy which the 1916 act had established before the gift was made. Obviously that \n\n[283 U.S. 15, 24]\n\u00a0\n policy would be set at naught if gifts made in contemplation of death, after the 1916 act, were to be taxed more favorably than transfers from the donor occurring at and by reason of his death. As was apparent when the 1916 act was adopted, that policy could be made effective only if gifts made in contemplation of death, while that act was in force, were to be subject at the donor's death to such rate as might at the time of that event be applicable to the transfer of the donor's estate. The decedent, when he made his gift, was as well warned that it might be taxed on that basis as he was that it would be so taxed if on that day he had made the same disposition of it by will. A change in the rate applicable to transfers at death necessitates a corresponding change in the rate applicable to gifts made in contemplation of death, else the purpose in taxing the latter would not be attained. That purpose, as already indicated, was to put such gifts on the same plane as testamentary disposals.\n Only a word need be said of the suggestion that the application of section 402(c) to gifts made while the 1916 act was in force destroys the character of the tax as one on privileges, and so renders it invalid as an unapportioned direct tax forbidden by sections 2 and 9 of article 1 of the Constitution. See Levy v. Wardell, \n258 \nU.S. 542, 545\n, 42 S. Ct. 395, 66 L. E. 7 58. The present gift was subject to the excise when made; and, for reasons already indicated, we think a mere increase in the tax, pursuant to a policy of which the donor was forewarned at the time he elected to exercise the privilege, did not change its character. See Hecht v. Malley, supra, page 164 of 265 U. S., 44 S. Ct. 462. Further, as an appropriate and indeed necessary measure to secure the effective administration of a system of death taxes, we think the present tax is to be supported as an incident and in aid of the exercise of the constitutional power to levy a tax on the transfer of the decedent's estate at death.

They were Arizona, Arkansas, Calfornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and Hawaii. Most of these provided for appraisal of the value of the property as of the date of decedent's death; but a few (Indiana, Kansas, and Wisconsin) provided for valuation as of the date of transfer.

The trial resulted in a verdict for the respondent, which petitioner moved to set aside on the ground that misconduct of respondent's counsel in making appeals to passion and prejudice had prevented an impartial trial. The motion was denied, and petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court of Minnesota. That court referred to the state practice which requires counsel to interrupt and have the language used by offending counsel placed upon the record, to ask the court to instruct the jury to \n\n[283 U.S. 520, 521]\n\u00a0\n disregard it, and to take an exception, if thought advisable. It, however, criticised the conduct of respondent's counsel, and said: 'In the absence of objection from counsel, it may become the duty of the court to act on its own motion. ... From the entire record before us we are of the opinion that the verdict is excessive because of passion and prejudice.'\n A new trial was ordered, unless the respondent should file in the trial court a writing remitting a portion of the verdict. 181 Minn. 56, 231 N. W. 829, 832. Such a remittitur was filed, and thereupon the trial court entered judgment for the remainder. The petitioner again appealed, and the Supreme Court affirmed, 181 Minn. 626, 231 N. W. 920, merely referring to its previous opinion. We granted a writ of certiorari \n282 \nU.S. 833\n, 51 S. Ct. 105, 75 L. Ed. -, limited to the question arising from the failure of the state court to grant a new trial in a case under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59) where the verdictwas obtained by appeals to passion and prejudice.\n It is unnecessary to cite from the record what occurred at the trial, or to discuss the propriety of the views of the court below as to the basis of the verdict. The finding is quoted above, and our sole concern is as to the action it requires. Nor need we inquire into the rules applicable in trials under state law. Whether under the state's jurisprudence the present record would entitle petitioner to a new trial or to such a conditional order as was awarded is immaterial.\n In actions under the federal statute no verdict can be permitted to stand which is found to be in any degree the result of appeals to passion and prejudice. Obviously such means may be quite as effective to beget a wholly wrong verdict as to produce an excessive one. A litigant gaining a verdict thereby will not be permitted the benefit of calculation, which can be little better than speculation, \n\n[283 U.S. 520, 522]\n\u00a0\n as to the extent of the wrong inflicted upon his opponent.\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","102":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI PAC.

On the complaint and supporting affidavits the plaintiff applied for a temporary injunction. Defendants moved to dismiss. The court, consisting of a circuit judge and two district judges, held the complaint insufficient to show any ground for relief and dismissed the case. 42 F.( 2d) 765.\n The statutes so assailed are Laws 1907, Act No. 116, p. 295 and Laws 1913, Act No. 67, p. 211 (sections 8577-8579 and 8583, 8585, 8586, Crawford & Moses' Digest, 1921) which so far as here material \n\n[283 U.S. 249, 251]\n\u00a0\n are printed in the margin. \n1\n The earlier act requires railroad carriers whose lines are not less than 50 miles in length to have not less than three brakemen in every crew of freight trains of 25 cars or more. The later act requires not less than three helpers in switch crews in yards in cities of the first and second class operated by companies having lines of 100 miles or more.\n The complaint asserts that each of these acts violates the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 3), and the \n\n[283 U.S. 249, 252]\n\u00a0\n due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and is repugnant to the Interstate Commerce Act as amended in 19202 and to the Railway Labor Act. 3 But they have been held valid by this court as against the claim of repugnancy to these clauses of the Constitution. See Chicago, R. I. & Pac. Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n219 \nU.S. 453, 459\n, 465 S., 31 S. Ct. 275, affirming 86 Ark. 412, 111 S. W. 456, as to the Act of 1907, and St. Louis & Iron Mtn. Ry. v. Arkansas, \n240 \nU.S. 518\n, 36 S. Ct. 443, affirming 114 Ark. 486, 170 S. W. 580, as to the Act of 1913\n\n\n The first of these cases was decided in 1911. The court held that the act of 1907 is not a regulation of interstate commerce and that upon its face it must be taken as having been enacted in aid of, and for the protection of those engaged in, such commerce. It said that Congress might have taken entire charge of the subject, but that it had not done so and had not enacted regulations in respect of the number of employees to whom might be committed the management of interstate trains and that until it does the statutes of the state, not in their nature arbitrary, must control. The court found that, while under the evidence there was admittedly room for controversy as to whether the statute was necessary, it could not be said that it was so unreasonable as to justify the court in adjudging it an arbitrary exercise of power. And it held that, being applicable alike to all belonging to the same class, there was no basis for the contention that it denied the company equal protection of the laws. The principles governing that decision were followed in the later case, decided in 1916, which upheld the act of 1913. Both acts were sustained as valid exertions of police power for the promotion of safety of employees and others.\n The plaintiff says that, since these decisions, Congress has occupied the field and has delegated to the Commis- \n\n[283 U.S. 249, 253]\n\u00a0\n sion and Labor Board full authority over the subject and that the state laws under consideration are repugnant to the comprehensive scheme of federal regulation prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Act as amended and conflict with sections 1(10) and (21), 13, 15 and 15a thereof, 49 USCA  1(10) and (21);  13, 15, 15a, and with the spirit of the Railway Labor Act of 1926.\n It maintains that the allegations of the complaint together with the facts set forth in the affidavits show that, when applied to operating conditions on its lines in Arkansas, these state laws are arbitrary and violative of the Federal Constitution and laws. But the affidavits filed in support of the application for a temporary injunction may not be considered in determining whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute ground for relief.

R. 1635.\n The substance of the pertinent allegations of the complaint follows:\n Present railroad operating conditios on plaintiff's railroad in Arkansas and elsewhere, and on railroads generally in this country, differ from those that existed in 1907 and 1913 when these laws were passed. Roads and equipment have been so improved that longer and heavier trains may be operated more safely now than must smaller trains could then be operated. It is standard practice of railroads 'wherever the density of traffic is sufficient, except in the State of Arkansas, to operate freight and passenger trains and switch engines with crews consisting of less than the extra switchman (meaning one less than required by the 1913 Act) and extra brakemen (meaning one less than required by the 1907 Act) provided by the Arkansas laws.'\n Freight trains and switch engines are safely operated on lines similar to those of plaintiff 'wherever the traffic \n\n[283 U.S. 249, 254]\n\u00a0\n and circumstances make such operation advisable, without such extra switchmen and extra brakemen.' By increasing lengths of their freight trains, the plaintiff and other railroads in States 'where such extra brakemen and extra switchmen are not (by law) required' have been able to effect great economies. But by the Arkansas laws plaintiff is compelled there to employ more than the standard crew and to pay for services and time not needed or used for the operation of its freight trains.\n The standard agreement between plaintiff and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen provides for a switch crew consisting of a foreman and two helpers and 'also provides for a ... freight train crew, in through and irregular freight service, of a conductor and two brakemen.' Other railroads have similar agreements with the Brotherhood 'with the exception of the service in States with laws similar to the above laws of the State of Arkansas.'\n And it is alleged that, if plaintiff were permitted to operate its freight trains without the extra brakemen required by the Act of 1907, its expenses would be reduced by $350,000 per year; and, if permitted to operate its switch engines without the extra helper required by the Act of 1913, its expenses would be reduced $250,000 per year.\n The complaint contains much by way of argument, assertions as to questions of law together with inferences and conclusions of the pleader as to matters of fact. These are not deemed to be admitted by motion to dismiss. Equitable Life Assurance Society v. Brown, \n213 \nU.S. 25, 43\n, 29 S. Ct. 404; Southern Ry. Co. v. King, \n217 \nU.S. 524, 536\n, 30 S.

Moreover, in the cases here decided they were held not repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution or the due process or equal protection clause \n\n[283 U.S. 249, 255]\n\u00a0\n of the Fourteenth Amendment. The burden is on the plaintiff by candid and direct allegations to set forth in its complaint facts sufficient plainly to show the asserted invalidity. Aetna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, \n275 \nU.S. 440, 447\n, 48 S. Ct. 174, and cases there cited; N. O. Public Service v. New Orleans, \n281 \nU.S. 682, 686\n, 50 S. Ct. 449; Beaumont, S. L. & W. Ry. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 74, 88\n, 51 S. Ct. 1.\n There is no showing that the dangers against which these laws were intended to safeguard employees and the public no longer exist or have been lessened by the improvements in road and equipment or by the changes in operating conditions there described. And, for aught that appears from the facts that are alleged, the same or greater need may now exist for the specified number of brakemen and helpers in freight train and switching crews. It is not made to appear that the expense of complying with the state laws is now relatively more burdensome than formerly. Greater train loading tends to lessen operating expenses for brakemen. There is no statement as to present efficiency of switching crews compared with that when the 1913 Act was passed, but it reasonably may be inferred that larger cars and heavier loading of today make for a ower switching expense per car or ton. While cost of complying with state laws enacted to promote safety is an element properly to be taken into account in determining whether such laws are arbitrary and repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (Lehigh Valley R. R. v. Commissioners, \n278 \nU.S. 24, 34\n, 49 S. Ct. 69, 62 A. L. R. 805; Oregon R. R. & N. Co. v. Fairchild, \n224 \nU.S. 510, 529\n, 32 S. Ct. 535), there is nothing alleged in that respect which is sufficient to distinguish this case from those in which we have upheld the laws in question. And the claim that 'standard' crews are generally employed by the railroads of the United States is substantially impaired by the qualified form of the allegations and also by the fact, \n\n[283 U.S. 249, 256]\n\u00a0\n which we judicially notice, that other states have laws somewhat similar to the Arkansas Act in question. \n4\n It is clear that, so far as constitutionality is concerned, the facts alleged are not sufficient to distinguish this case from those in which this court has sustained these laws.\n Has Congress prescribed, or authorized the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate, the number of brakemen to be employed for the operation of freight trains or the number of helpers to be included in switching crews?\n In the absence of a clearly expressed purpose so to do Congress will not be held to have intended to prevent the exertion of the police power of the states for the regulation of the number of men to be employed in such crews. Reid v. Colorado, \n187 \nU.S. 137, 148\n, 23 S. Ct. 92; Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 533\n, 32 S. Ct. 715; Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line, \n272 \nU.S. 605, 611\n, 47 S. Ct. 207. Plaintiff, while not claiming the Interstate Commerce Act in terms purports to cover that sub- \n\n[283 U.S. 249, 257]\n\u00a0\n ject, insists that the act does give the Commission jurisdiction over freight train and switching crews and so excludes the states from that field. It call attention to a number of provisions of the act. \n5\n And maintains that under them the Commission is empowered to regulate the 'practice' to carriers in respect of the 'supply of trains' to be provided by any carrier. But, assuming that the Act does so authorize regulation in respect of such practice and supply, it is clear that the delegation of power would not include the regulation of the number of brakemen or helpers. The act uses the word 'practice' in connection with the fixing of rates to be charged and prescribing of service to be rendered by the carriers, but these matters differ widely in kind from the subject covered by the Arkansas laws. That word is deemed to apply only to acts or things belonging to the same class as those meant by the words of the law that are associated with it. B. & O. R. R. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 291, 300\n, 48 S. Ct. 520. The act does not use that word in respect of any subject that reasonably may be thought similar to or classifid wi th the regulation of the number of men to be employed in such crews. And it is also clear that there is nothing in the phrase 'supply of trains' or in the purpose of the act to suggest that by it Congress intended to supersede state laws like those under consideration. The plaintiff further supports its contention by the claim that the Commission is authorized to regulate the expenditures of carriers. That claim is based on the provisions of the act empowering the Commission to regulate rates to be charged and divisions of joint rates and to ascertain rate levels that will yield the fair return provided for. But manifestly there is no similarity between determining what items of expense properly are to be taken into account in calculations made for such purposes and in the \n\n[283 U.S. 249, 258]\n\u00a0\n prescribing of the number of employees or the compensation to be paid them. We think it very clear that Congress has not prescribed or empowered the Commission to fix the number of men to be employed in train or switching crews.\n No analysis or discussion of the provisions of the Railway Labor Act of 1926 is necessary to show that it does not conflict with the Arkansas statutes under consideration.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Judgment modified, see \n283 \nU.S. 809\n, 51 S.

The District Court, composed of three judges (U. S.

No opinion was rendered by the District Court, and the only question presented by the record upon this appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion in granting an injunction until the case could be heard upon the merits.

The Circuit Courts of Appeal seem generally to agree, as the language of the Bankruptcy Act appears to us to imply very plainly, that what thus is recovered for the benefit of the estate is to be distributed in 'dividends of an equal per centum ... on all allowed claims, except such as have priority or are secured.'

Rogers, of Tulsa, Okl., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the United States, on behalf of Jackson Barnett, a full-blood Creek Indian, to recover certain United States bonds, charged to have been wrongly diverted from a trust fund held for him, or their proceeds or value if they have been converted.\n A second amended bill of complaint was tendered for filing, to which the defendant objected on the ground that it did not state a cause of action. The court, treating the objection as if it were a motion to dismiss the tendered complaint after filing, held that no cause of action was stated and dismissed the suit. \n1\n On appeal the Circui Cou rt of Appeals held that a cause of action was adequately stated and reversed the decree, with directions to permit the complaint to be filed. \n2\n Certiorari was then granted by this court. \n281 \nU.S. 714\n, 50 S. Ct. 410\n\n\n The suit arises out of the same transactions that were the basis of the litigation described in United States v. Equitable Trust Company, \n283 \nU.S. 738\n, 51 S. Ct. 639, just decided.\n The case stated in the tendered complaint is as follows: Barnett received an allotment from the lands of \n\n[283 U.S. 747, 749]\n\u00a0\n the Creek Tribe. His title was in fee simple, but by reason of his being a full-blood Creek was subject to restrictions against alienation and leasing, except with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. \n3\n Besides being under that disability, he was and still is, by reason of mental infirmity incapable of managing his own affairs, comprehending the nature or extent of his property, or understanding any kind of business transaction. Because of his mental infirmity he was adjudged an incompetent and subjected to guardianship by the probate court of the county of his residence in Oklahoma.\n Apart from the approval of the lease about to be mentioned, the restrictions incident to his status as a full-blood Creek have never been removed or qualified.\n In 1912, Barnett, with his guardian joining therein, executed a lease of his land for oil and gas purposes, the lease being approved by both the probate court and the Secretary of the Interior. The lease and the Secretary's regulations, which were made part of the lease, required that the royalties be paid to a local representative of the Secretary in trust for Barnett and disbursed only with the Secretary's sanction. In time the royalties yielded a large fund, which the Secretary invested for Barnett's benefit in United States bonds.\n In February, 1923, the Secretary, at Barnett's request, distributed the larger part of the bonds in gifts. One gift was to Barnett's purported wife and included $550,000 of the bonds. His request that the gifts be made was in the form of a written instrument on which he placed a thumb mark signature-he being then incapable, by reason of his mental infirmity, of comprehending or understanding the nature, import, or effect of the instru- \n\n[283 U.S. 747, 750]\n\u00a0\n ment. The Secretary approved the request by an indorsement on the instrument, and then transferred the bonds to the designated donees.\n The wife immediately delivered $150,000 of the bonds to one McGugin, and he thereupon passed $15,000 of them to the defendant, Marshall L. Mott. Both McGugin and Mott at the time had full knowledge that the wife received the bonds as a gift out of Barnett's trust fund, that that fund represented royalties from the oil and gas lease of his restricted land, and that by reason of mental infirmity he was without capacity to initiate or make a gift or disposal of the bonds.\n Mott has refused and still refuses to return the bonds so received by him to the United States or to account for their proceeds or value.\n The prayer of the complaint is that Mott be required to surrender into court the bonds, or their proceeds or value if they have been converted, to the end that they may be restored to the fund from which they were diverted and there held for Barnett's use and benefit.\n We are of opinion that the facts thus shown are such as to entitle the United States to the equitable relief which it seeks. Its right to sue in behalf of an Indian ward for the purpose of asserting and enforcing his interest in property diverted from a trust fund while being administered by the government's officers is obvious. Barnett is such a ward, for he is a full-blood Creek Indian who has not been relieved from the restrictions we have described. The approval by the Secretary of the Interior of the oil andgas lease did not terminate them. It made the lease effective, but otherwise left the restrictions in full force. Besides, it subjected the royalties to restrictions similar to those applying to the leased land from which the royalties would come. This was accomplished by a provision in the lease whereby, agreeably to the \n\n[283 U.S. 747, 751]\n\u00a0\n Secretary's regulations, the royalties were to be paid to a representative of the Secretary in trust for Barnett and disbursed only with the Secretary's sanction. The authority of the Secretary to withhold his approval includes the lesser authority to give his approval upon condition that the royalties be thus conserved and protected. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n But while the Secretary is authorized to prevent improvident alienation or leasing by resricted Creek allottees, he is not authorized to alien or lease in their stead and right. This is plainly the effect of the statutory provisions which we quote in the margin. \n5\n If an allottee chooses to alien or lease, the Secretary, if not satisfied that the transaction will be of benefit to the Indian, can prevent it by not approving it. But, if the allottee chooses not to alien or lease, the Secretary cannot do so for him, even though it appears that the Indian would be benefited. And of course the Secretary cannot merely \n\n[283 U.S. 747, 752]\n\u00a0\n of his own volition make gifts or donations of the Indian's restricted land.\n Like principles apply to restricted funds such as that arising from Barnett's royalties. That fund was his individual property and as such was within the protective guaranties of the Constitution. \n6\n No statute purported to give any authority for taking it from him. Nor was there anything in the Secretary's regulations indicative of an assumption of such authority. On the contrary, they contemplated that such funds would be held, conserved, and protected for the benefit of their Indian owners.\n We need not inquire, as the Circuit Court of Appeals appears to have done, whether, had Barnett been mentally competent, the gifts named in his purported request could have been made from his trust fund. That is not this case. Barnett, according to the complaint, was mentally incompetent to a degree which made him wholly incapable of understanding, intending, or making such a request. Therefore the instrument, although bearing his thumb mark, was not his act, and could not bind him. With it eliminated, the gift in question stood as if made by the Secretary merely on his ow vol ition. This was beyond his authority.\n The suggestion that his approval supplied the necessary intent on the part of Barnett is but another way of saying that the Secretary could make the gift merely of his own volition. The further suggestion that he must be presumed to have found Barnett free from disability, and that this determination cannot be questioned in the courts, is without merit. If good as to a mental incompetent, it would be good as to an Indian under age or \n\n[283 U.S. 747, 753]\n\u00a0\n even an infant. The suggestion has been disapproved by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 33 F.(2d) 340. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 37 F.(2d) 860. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Acts March 1, 1901, c. 676, 31 Stat. 861; June 30, 1902, c. 1323, 32 Stat. 500; May 27, 1908, c. 199, 35 Stat. 312.

An unlimited choice might overburden a circuit court of appeals, whose docket was \n\n[283 U.S. 483, 487]\n\u00a0\n already overcrowded, with petitions for review with respect to which it could have had no venue under the other subdivisions of section 1002\n\n\n The Senate Committee on Finance, in proposing the addition of (d) to section 1002, stated that the purpose was to permit parties '... to stipulate the court to which the review will be taken, in order that any doubt as to the proper court may be removed ...' Senate Reports, 69th Congress, 1st Session, Vol. 1, Report No. 52, p. 36. See also, to the same effect, the conference report in House Reports, supra, Report No. 356, p. 54. Whatever solution (d) may afford for the difficulties in those cases when doubts arise as to the proper circuit for review under (a), (b), or ( c), here petitioner had its principal office in California and filed its return there, so that under (b) the venue could properly be laid only in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Hence the parties' right of choice by stipulation under (d) was restricted to that court or the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia.\n Section 1003(a) confers jurisdiction to review decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals on circuit courts of appeals and the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. Section 002 is entitled 'Venue.' Even if the effect of this distinction is to define venue but not to restrict the jurisdiction of the court below, it was not bound to exercise jurisdiction in the face of (d), which authorized the parties to control the venue only by stipulation conforming to its terms. See Kansas City Ry. Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 760\n, 51 S. Ct. 304, decided February 25, 1931. The restriction on the power of the parties to stipulate as to venue would be meaningless if they could waive it without the consent of the court.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Revenue Act of 1926 reads in part:\n'Sec. 1001.

Latimer, of Minneapolis, Minn., for appellant.\n Messrs. James E. Markham, of St. Paul, Minn., and Arthur L. Markve, of Minneapolis, Minn., for appellee.\n\n\n[283 U.S. 697, 701]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Chapter 285 of the Session Laws of Minnesota for the year 19251 provides for the abatement, as a public nuisance, of a 'malicious, scandalous and defamatory news- \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 702]\n\u00a0\n paper, magazine or other periodical.' Section 1 of the act is as follows:\n'Section 1. Any person who, as an individual, or as a member or employee of a firm, or association or organization, or as an officer, director, member or employee of a corporation, shall be engaged in the business of regularly or customarily producing, publishing or circulating, having in possession, selling or giving away.\n\n'(a) an obscene, lewd and lascivious newspaper, magazine, or other periodical, or\n\n'(b) a malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspaper, magazine or other periodical,\n\n -is guilty of a nuisance, and all persons guilty of such nuisance may be enjoined, as hereinafter provided.\n'Participation in such business shall constitute a commission of such nuisance and render the participant liable and subject to the proceedings, orders and judgments provided for in this Act. Ownership, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, of any such periodical, or of any stock of interest in any corporation or organization which owns the same in whole or in part, or which publishes the same, shall constitute such participation.\n\n'In actions brought under (b) above, there shall be availabl the defense that the truth was published with good motives and for justifiable ends and in such actions the plaintiff shall not have the right to report (sic) to issues or editions or periodicals taking place more than three months before the commencement of the action.'\n\n Section 2 provides that, whenever any such nuisance is committed or exists, the county attorney of any county where any such periodical is published or circulated, or, in case of his failure or refusal to proceed upon written request in good faith of a reputable citizen, the Attorney General, or, upon like failure or refusal of the latter, any citizen of the county, may maintain an action in the district court of the county in the name of the state to enjoin \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 703]\n\u00a0\n perpetually the persons committing or maintaining any such nuisance from further committing or maintaining it. Upon such evidence as the court shall deem sufficient, a temporary injunction may be granted. The defendants have the right to plead by demurrer or answer, and the plaintiff may demur or reply as in other cases.\n The action, by section 3, is to be 'governed by the practice and procedure applicable to civil actions for injunctions,' and after trial the court may enter judgment permanently enjoining the defendants found guilty of violating the act from continuing the violation, and, 'in and by such judgment, such nuisance may be wholly abated.' The court is empowered, as in other cases of contempt, to punish disobedience to a temporary or permanent injunction by fine of not more than $1,000 or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than twelve months.\n Under this statute (section 1, clause (b), the county attorney of Hennepin county brought this action to enjoin the publication of what was described as a 'malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspaper, magazine or other periodical,' known as The Saturday Press. published by the defendants in the city of Minneapolis. The complaint alleged that the defendants, on September 24, 1927, and on eight subsequent dates in October and November, 1927, published and circulated editions of that periodical which were 'largely devoted to malicious, scandalous and defamatory articles' concerning Charles G. Davis, Frank W. Brunskill, the Minneapolis Tribune, the Minneapolis Journal, Melvin C. Passolt, George E. Leach, the Jewish Race, the members of the grand jury of Hennepin county impaneled in November, 1927, and then holding office, and other persons, as more fully appeared in exhibits annexed to the complaint, consisting of copies of the articles described and constituting 327 pages of the record. While the complaint did not so allege, it \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 704]\n\u00a0\n appears from the briefs of both parties that Charles G. Davis was a special law enforcement officer employed by a civic organization, that George E. Leach was mayor of Minneapolis, that Frank W. Brunskill was its chief of police, and that Floyd B. Olson, the relator in this action, was county attorney.\n Without attempting to summarize the contents of the voluminous exhibits attached to the complaint, we deem it sufficient to say that the articles charged, in substance, that a Jewish gangster was in control of gambling, bootlegging, and racketeering in Minneapolis, and that law enforcing officers and agencies were not energetically performing their duties. Most of the charges were directed against the chief of police; he was charged with gross neglect of duty, illicit relations with gangsters, and with participation in graft. The county attorney was charged with knowing the existing conditions and with failure to take adequate measures to remedy them. The mayor was accused of inefficiency and dereliction. On member of the grand jury was stated to be in sympathy with the gangsters. A special grand jury and a special prosecutor were demanded to deal with the situation in general, and, in particular, to investigate an attempt to assassinate one Guilford, one of the original defendants, who, it appears from the articles, was shot by gangsters after the first issue of th per iodical had been published. There is no question but that the articles made serious accusations against the public officers named and others in connection with the prevalence of crimes and the failure to expose and punish them.\n At the beginning of the action on November 22, 1927, and upon the verified complaint, an order was made directing the defendants to show cause why a temporary injunction should not issue and meanwhile forbidding the defendants to publish, circulate, or have in their possession any editions of the periodical from September \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 705]\n\u00a0\n 24, 1927, to November 19, 1927, inclusive, and from publishing, circulating or having in their possession, 'any future editions of said The Saturday Press' and 'any publication, known by any other name whatsoever containing malicious, scanadalous and defamatory matter of the kind alleged in plaintiff's complaint herein or otherwise.'\n The defendants demurred to the complaint upon the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and on this demurrer challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The district court overruled the demurrer and certified the question of constitutionality to the Supreme Court of the state. The Supreme Court sustained the statute (174 Minn. 457, 219 N. W. 770, 58 A. L. R. 607), and it is conceded by the appellee that the act was thus held to be valid over the objection that it violated not only the State Constitution, but also the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n Thereupon the defendant Near, the present appellant, answered the complaint. He averred that he was the sole owner and proprietor of the publication in question. He admitted the publication of the articles in the issues described in the complaint, but denied that they were malicious, scandalous, or defamatory as alleged. He expressly invoked the protection of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case then came on for trial. The plaintiff offered in evidence the verified complaint, together with the issues of the publication in question, which were attached to the complaint as exhibits. The defendant objected to the introduction of the evidence, invoking the constitutional provisions to which his answer referred. The objection was overruled, no further evidence was presented, and the plaintiff rested. The defendant then rested, without offering evidence. The plaintiff moved that the court direct the issue of a permanent injunction, and this was done. \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 706]\n\u00a0\n The district court made findings of fact, which followed the allegations of the complaint and found in general terms that the editions in question were 'chiefly devoted to malicious, scandalous and defamatory articles' concerning the individuals named. The court further found that the defendants through these publications 'did engage in the business of regularly and customarily producing, publishing and circulating a malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspaper,' and that 'the said publication' 'under said name of The Saturday Press, or any other name, constitutes a public nuisance under the laws of the State.' Judgment was thereupon entered adjudging that 'the newspaper, magazine and periodical known as The Saturday Press,' as a public nuisance, 'be and is hereby abated.' The judgment perpetually enjoined the defendants 'from producing, editing, publishing, circulating, having in their possession, selling or giving away any publication whatsoever which is a malicious, scandalous or defamatory newspaper, as defined by law,' and also 'from further conducting said nuisance under the name and title of said The Saturday Press or any other name or title.'\n The defendant Near appealed from this judgment to the Supreme Court of the State, again asserting his right under the Federal Constitution, and the judgment was affirmed upon the authority of the former decision. 179 Minn. 40, 228 N. W. 326. With respect to the contention that the judgment went too far, and prevented the defendants from publishing any kind of a newspaper, th cou rt observed that the assignments of error did not go to the form of the judgment, and that the lower court had not been asked to modify it. The court added that it saw no reason 'for defendants to construe the judgment as restraining them from operating a newspaper in harmony with the public welfare, to which all must yield,' that the allegations of the complaint had been \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 707]\n\u00a0\n found to be true, and though this was an equitable action defendants had not indicated a desire 'to conduct their business in the usual and legitimate manner.'\n From the judgment as thus affirmed, the defendant Near appeals to this Court.\n This statute, for the suppression as a public nuisance of a newspaper or periodical, is unusual, if not unique, and raises questions of grave importance transcending the local interests involved in the particular action. It is no longer open to doubt that the liberty of the press and of speech is within the liberty safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by state action. It was found impossible to conclude that this essential personal liberty of the citizen was left unprotected by the general guaranty of fundamental rights of person and property. Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652, 666\n, 45 S. CT. 625; Whitney v. California, \n274 \nU.S. 357, 362\n, 373 S., 47 S. Ct. 641; Fiske v. Kansas, \n274 \nU.S. 380, 382\n, 47 S. Ct. 655; Stromberg v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 359\n, 51 S. Ct. 532, decided May 18, 1931. In maintaining this guaranty, the authority of the state to enact laws to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of its people is necessarily administered. The limits of this sovereign power must always be determined with appropriate regard to the particular subject of its exercise. Thus, while recognizing the broad discretion of the Legislature in fixing rates to be charged by those undertaking a public service, this Court has decided that the owner cannot constitutionally be deprived of his right to a fair return, because that is deemed to be of the essence of ownership. Railroad Commission Cases, \n116 \nU.S. 307, 331\n, 6 S. Ct. 334, 388, 1191; Northern Pacific Railway Company v. North Dakota, \n236 \nU.S. 585, 596\n, 35 S. Ct. 429, L. R. A. 1917F, 1148 Ann. Cas. 1916A, 1. So, while liberty of contract is not an absolute right, and the wide field of activity in the making of contracts is subject to legislative supervision (Frisbie v. United States, \n157 \nU.S. 161, 165\n, 15 S. Ct. 586), this Court has held that the power of the state stops short of interference with what are deemed \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 708]\n\u00a0\n to be certain indispensable requirements of the liberty assured, notably with respect to the fixing of prices and wages (Tyson v. Banton, \n273 \nU.S. 418\n, 47 S. Ct. 426, 58 A. L. R. 1236; Ribnik v. McBride, \n277 \nU.S. 350\n, 48 S. Ct. 545, 56 A. L. R. 1327; Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525, 560\n, 561 S., 43 S. Ct. 394, 24 A. L. R. 1238). Liberty of speech and of the press is also not an absolute right, and the state may punish its abuse. Whitney v. California, supra; Stromberg v. California, supra. Liberty, in each of its phases, has its history and connotation, and, in the present instance, the inquiry is as to the historic conception of the liberty of the press and whether the statute under review violates the essential attributes of that liberty.\n The appellee insists that the equstions of the application of the statute to appellant's periodical, and of the construction of the judgment of the trial court, are not presented for review; that appellant's sold attack was upon the constitutionality of the statute, however it might be applied. The appellee contends that no question either of motive in the publication, or whether the decree goes beyond the direction of the statute, is before us. The appellant replies that, in his view, the plain terms of the statute were not departed from in this case, and that eve n if they were, the statute is nevertheless unconstitutional under any reasonable construction of its terms. The appellant states that he has not argued that the temporary and permanent injunctions were broader than were warranted by the statute; he insists that what was done was properly done if the statute is valid, and that the action taken under the statute is a fair indication of its scope.\n With respect to these contentions it is enough to say that in passing upon constitutional questions the court has regard to substance and not to mere matters of form, and that, in accordance with familiar principles, the state must be tested by its operation and effect. Henderson v. Mayor, \n92 U.S. 259\n, 268; Bailey v. Alabama, 219 \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 709]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 219, 244, 31 S. Ct. 145; United States v. Reynolds, \n235 \nU.S. 133, 148\n, 149 S., 35 S. Ct. 86; St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 362\n, 35 S. Ct. 99; Mountain Timber Company v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219, 237\n, 37 S. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642. That operation and effect we think is clearly shown by the record in this case. We are not concerned with mere errors of the trial court, if these be such, in going beyond the direction of the statute as construed by the Supreme Court of the state. It is thus important to note precisely the purpose and effect of the statute as the state court has construed it.\n First. The statute is not aimed at the redress of individual or private wrongs. Remedies for libel remain available and unaffected. The Statute, said the state court (174 Minn. 457, 219 N. W. 770, 772, 58 A. L. R. 607), 'is not directed at threatened libel but at an existing business which, generally speaking, involves more than libel.' It is aimed at the distribution of scandalous matter as 'detrimental to public morals and to the general welfare,' tending 'to disturb the peace of the community' and 'the provoke assaults and the commission of crime.' In order to obtain an injunction to suppress the future publication of the newspaper or periodical, it is not necessary to prove the falsity of the charges that have been made in the publication condemned. In the present action there was no allegation that the matter published was not true. It is alleged, and the statute requires the allegation that the publication was 'malicious.' But, as in prosecutions for libel, there is no requirement of proof by the state of malice in fact as distinguished from malice inferred from the mere publication of the defamatory matter. \n2\n The judgment in this case proceeded upon the mere proof of publication. The statute permits the defense, not of the truth alone, but only that the truth was published with good motives and \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 710]\n\u00a0\n for justificable ends. It is apparent that under the statute the publication is to be regarded as defamatory if it injures reputation, and that it is scandalous if it circulates charges of reprehensible conduct, whether criminal or otherwise, and the publication is thus deemed to invite public reprodation and to constitute a public scandal. The court sharply defined the purpose of the statute, bringing out the precise point, in these words: 'There is no constitutional right to publish a fact merely because it is true. It is a matter of common knowledge that prosecutions under the criminal libel statutes do not result in efficient repression or suppression of the evils of scandal. Men who are the victims of such assaults seldom resort to the courts. This is especially true if their sins are exposed and the only question relates to whether it was done with good motive and for justifiable ends. This law is not for the protection of the person attacked nor to punish the wrongdoer. It is for the protection of the public welfare.'\n Second. The statute is directed not simply at the circulation of scandalou and defamatory statements with regard to private citizens, but at the continued publication by newspapers and periodical of charges against public officers of corruption, malfeasance in office, or serious neglect of duty. Such charges by their very nature create a public scandal. They are scandalous and defamatory within the meaning of the statute, which has its normal operation in relation to publications dealing prominently and chiefly with the alleged derelictions of public officers. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[283 U.S. 697, 711]\n\u00a0\n Third. The object of the statute is not punishment, in the ordinary sense, but suppression of the offending newspaper or periodical. The reason for the enactment, as the state court has said, is that prosecutions to enforce penal statutes for libel do not result in 'efficient repression or suppression of the evils of scandal.' Describing the business of publication as a public nuisance does not obscure the substance of the proceeding which the statute authorizes. It is the continued publication of scandalous and defamatory matter that constitutes the business and the declared muisance. In the case of public officers, it is the reiteration of charges of official misconduct, and the fact that the newspaper or periodical is principally devoted to that purpose, that exposes it to suppression. In the present instance, the proof was that nine editions of the newspaper or periodical in question were published on successive dates, and that they were chiefly devoted to charges against public officers and in relation to the prevalence and protection of crime. In such a case, these officers are not left to their ordinary remedy in a suit for libel, or the authorities to a prosecution for criminal libel. Under this statute, a publisher of a newspaper or periodical, undertaking to conduct a campaign to expose and to censure official derelictions, and devoting his publication principally to that purpose, must face not simply the possibility of a verdict against him in a suit or prosecution for libel, but a determination that his newspaper or periodical is a public nuisance to be abated, and that this abatement and suppression will follow unless he is prepared with legal evidence to prove the truth of the charges and also to satisfy the court that, in \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 712]\n\u00a0\n addition to being true, the matter was published with good motives and for justifiable ends.\n This suppression is accomplished by enjoining publication, and that restraint is the object and effect of the statute.\n Fourth. The statute not only operates to suppress the offending newspaper or periodical, but to put the publisher under an effective censorship. When a newspaper or periodical is found to be 'malicious, scandalous and defamatory,' and is suppressed as such, resumption of publication is punishable as a contempt of court by fine or imprisonment. Thus, where a newspaper or periodical has been suppressed because of the circulation of charges against public officers of official misconduct, it would seem to be clear that the renewal of the publication of such charges would constitute a contempt, and that the judgment would lay a permanent restraint upon the publisher, to escape which he must satisfy the court as to the character of a new publication. Whether he would be permitted again to publish matter deemed to be derogatory to the same or other public officers would depend upon the court's ruling. In the present instance the judgment restrained the defendants from 'publishing, circulating, having in their possession, selling or giving away any publication whatsoever which is a malicious, scandalous or defamatory newspaper, as defined by law.' The law gives no definition except that covered by the words 'scandalous and defamatory,' and publications charging official misconduct are of the class. While the court, answering the objection that the judgment was too broad, saw no reason for construing it as restraining the defendants 'from operating a newspaper in harmony with the public welfare to which all must yield,' and said that the defendants had not indicated 'any desire to conduct their business in the usual and legitimate manner,' the manifest inference is that, at least with respect to a \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 713]\n\u00a0\n new publication directed against official misconduct, the defendant would be held, under penalty of punishment for contempt as provided in the statute, to a manner of publication which the court considered to be 'usual and legitimate' and consistent with the public welfare.\n If we cut through mere details of procedure, the operation and effect of the statute in substance is that public authorities may bring the owner or publisher of a newspaper or periodical before a judge upon a charge of conducting a business of publishing scandalous and defamatory matter-in particular that the matter consists of charges against public officers of official dereliction-and, unless the owner or publisher is able and disposed to bring competent evidence to satisfy the judge that the charges are true and are published with good motives and for justifiable ends, his newspaper or periodical is suppressed and further publication is made punishable as a contempt. This is of the essence of consorship.\n The question is whether a statute authorizing such proceedings in restraint of publication is consistent with the conception of the liberty of the press as historically conceived and guaranteed. In determining the extent of the constitutional protection, it has been generally, if not universally, considered that it is the chief purpose of the guaranty to prevent previous restraints upon publication. The struggle in England, directed against the legislative power of the licenser, resulted in renuciation of the censorship of the press. \n4\n The liberty deemed to be established was thus described by Blackstone: 'The liberty of the press is indeed essential to the nature of a free state; but this consists in laying no previous restraints upon publications, and not in freedom from censure for criminal matter when published. Every freeman has an \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 714]\n\u00a0\n undoubted right to lay what sentiments he pleases before the public; to forbid this, is to destroy the freedom of the press; but if he publishes what is improper, mischievous or illegal, he must take the consequence of his own temerity.' 4 Bl. Com. 151, 152. See Story on the Constitution,  1884, 1889. The distinction was early pointed out between the extent of the freedom with respect to censorship under our constitutional system and that enjoyed in England. Here, as Madison said, 'the great and essential rights of the people are secured against legislative as well as against executive ambition. They are secured, not by laws paramount to prerogative, but by constitutions paramont to laws. This security of the freedom of the press requires that it should be exempt not only from previous restraint by the Executive, as in Great Britain, but from legislative restraint also.' Report on the Virginia Resolutions, Madison's Works, vol. IV, p. 543. This Court said, in Patterson v. Colorado, \n205 \nU.S. 454, 462\n, 27 S. Ct. 556, 558, 10 Ann. Cas. 689: 'In the first place, the main purpose of such constitutional provisions is 'to prevent all such previous restraints upon publications as had been practiced by other governments,' and they do not prevent the subsequent punishment of such as may be deemed contrary to the public welfare. Commonwealth v. Blanding, 3 Pick. (Mass.) 304, 313, 314 (15 Am. Dec. 214); Respublica v. Oswald, 1 Dall. 319, 325, 158. The preliminary fredom extends as well to the false as to the true; the subsequent punishment may extend as well to the true as to the false. This was the law of criminal libel apart from statute in most cases, if not in all. Commonwealth v. Blanding, ubi supra; 4 Bl. Com. 150.'\n The criticism upon Blackstone's statement has not been because immunity from previous restraint upon publication has not been regarded as deserving of special emphasis, but chiefly because that immunity cannot be deemed to exhaust the conception of the liberty guaranteed by \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 715]\n\u00a0\n State and Federal Constitutions. The point of criticism has been 'that the mere exemption from restraints cannot be all that is secured by the constitutional provisions,' and that 'the liberty of the press might be rendered a mockery and a delusion, and the phrase itself a by-word, if, while every man was at liberty to publish what he pleased, the public authorities might nevertheless punish him for harmless publications.' 2 Cooley, Const. Lim. (8th Ed.) pp. 885. But it is recognized that punishment for the abuse of the liberty accorded to the press is essential to the protection of the public, and that the common-law rules that subject the libeler to responsibility for the public offense, as well as for the private injury, are not abolished by the protection extended in our Constitutions Id. pp. 883, 884. The law of criminal libel rests upon that secure foundation. There is also the conceded authority of courts to punish for contempt when publications directly tend to prevent the proper discharge of judicial functions. Patterson v. Colorado, supra; Toledo Newspaper Company v. United States, \n247 \nU.S. 402, 419\n, 38 S. Ct. 560.5 In the present case, we have no occasion to inquire as to the permissible scope of subsequent punishment. For whatever wrong the appellant has committed or may commit, by his publications, the state appropriately affords both public and private redress by its libel laws. As has been noted, the statute in question does not deal with punishments; it provides for no punishment, except in case of contempt for violation of the court's order, but for suppression and injunction-that is, for restraint upon publication.\n The objection has also been made that the principle as to immunity from previous restraint is stated too \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 716]\n\u00a0\n broadly, if every such restraint is deemed to be prohibited. That is undoubtedly true; the protection even as to previous restraint is not absolutely unlimited. But the limitation has been recognized only in exceptional cases. 'When a nation is at war many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its errort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fignt and that no Court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right.' Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47, 52\n, 39 S. Ct. 247, 249. No one would question but that a government might prevent actual obstruction to its recruiting service or the publication of the sailing dates of transports or the number and location of troops. \n6\n On similar grounds, the primary requirements of decency may be enforced against obscene publications. The security of the community life may be protected against incitements to acts of violence and the overthrow by force of orderly government. The constitutional guaranty of free speech does not 'protect a man from an injunction against uttering words that may have all the effect of frce. Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., \n221 \nU.S. 418, 139\n, 31 S. Ct. 492, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 874.' Schenck v. United States, supra. These limitations are not applicable here. Nor are we now concerned with questions as to the extent of authority to prevent publications in order to protect private rights according to the principles governing the exercise of the jurisdiction of courts of equity. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The exceptional nature of its limitations places in a strong light the general conception that liberty of the press, historically considered and taken up by the Federal Constitution, has meant, principally although not exclusively, immunity from previous restraints or censorship. The conception of the liberty of the press in this country had broadened with the exigencies of the colonial \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 717]\n\u00a0\n period and with the efforts to secure freedom from oppressive administration. 8 That liberty was especially charished for the immunity it afforded from previous restraint of the publication of censure of public officers and charges of official misconduct. As was said by Chief Justice Parker, in Commonwealth v. Blanding, 3 Pick. (Mass.) 304, 313, 15 Am. Dec. 214, with respect to the Constitution of Massachusetts: 'Besides, it is well understood and received as a commentary on this provision for the liberty of the press, that it was intended to prevent all such previous restraints upon publications as had been practiced by other governments, and in early times here, to stifle the efforts of patriots towards enlightening their fellow subjects upon their rights and the duties of rulers. The liberty of the press was to be unrestrained, but he who used it was to be responsible in case of its abuse.' In the letter sent by the Continental Congress (October 26, 1774) to the Inhabitants of Quebec, referring to the 'five grate rights' it was said:9 'The last right we shall mention, regards the freedom of the press. The importance of this consists, besiders the advancement of truth, science, morality, and arts in general, in its diffusion of liberal sentiments on the administration of Government, its ready communication of thoughts between subjects, and its consequential promotion of union among them, whereby oppressive officers are shamed or intimidated, into more honourable and just modes of conducting affairs.' Madison, who was the leading spirit in the preparation of the First Amendment of the Federal Constitution, thus described the practice and sentiment which led to the guaranties of liberty of the press in State Constitutions:10 \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 718]\n\u00a0\n 'In every State, probable, in the Union, the press has exerted a freedom in canvassing the merits and measures of public men of every description which has not been confined to the strict limits of the common law. On this footing the freedom of the press has stood; on this footing it yet stands. ... Some degree of abuse is inseparable from the proper use of everything, and in no instance is this more true than in that of the press. It has accordingly been decided by the practice of the States, that it is better to leave a few of its noxious branches to their luxuriant growth, than, by pruning them away, to injure the vigour of those yielding the proper fruits. And can the wisdom of this policy be doubted by any who reflect that to the press alone, chequered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression; who reflect that to the same beneficent source the United States owe much of the lights which conducted them to the ranks of a free and independent nation, and which have improved their political system ito a shape so auspicious to their happiness? Had 'Sedition Acts,' forbidding every publication that might bring the constituted agents into contempt or disrepute, or that might excite the hatred of the people against the authors of unjust or pernicious measures, been uniformly enforced against the press, might not the United States have been languishing at this day under the infirmities of a sickly Confederation? Might they not, possibly, be miserable colonies, graning under a foreign yoke?'\n The fact that for approximately one hundred and fifty years there has been almost an entire absence of attempts to impose previous restraints upon publications relating to the malfeasance of public officers is significant of the deep-seated conviction that such restraints would violate constitutional right. Public officers, whose character and \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 719]\n\u00a0\n conduct remain open to debate and free discussion in the press, find their remedies for false accusations in actions under libel laws providing for redress and punishment, and not in proceedings to restrain the publication of newspapers and periodicals. The general principle that the constitutional guaranty of the liberty of the press gives immunity from previous restraints has been approved in many decisions under the provisions of state constitutions. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n The importance of this immunity has not lessened. While reckless assaults upon public men, and efforts to bring obloquy upon those whon are endeavoring faithfully to discharge official duties, exert a baleful influence and deserve the severest condemnation in public opinion, it cannot be said that this abuse is greater, and it is believed to be less, than that which characterized the period in which our institutions took shape. Meanwhile, the administration of government has become more complex, the opportunities for malfeasance and corruption have multiplied, crime has grown to most serious proportions, and the danger of its protection by unfaithful officials and of the impairment of the fundamental security of life and \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 720]\n\u00a0\n property by criminal alliances and official neglect, emphasizes the primary need of a vigilant and courageous press, expecially in great cities. The fact that the liberty of the press may be abused by miscreant purveyors of scandal does not make any the less necessary the immunity of the press from previous restraint in dealing with offical misconduct. Subsequent punishment for such abuses as may exist is the appropriate remedy, consistent with constitutional privilege.\n In attempted justification of the statute, it is said that it deals not with publcati on per se, but with the 'business' of publishing defamation. If, however, the publisher has a constitutional right to publish, without previous restraint, an edition of his newspaper charging official derelictions, it cannot be denied that he may publish subsequent editions for the same purpose. He does not lose his right by exercising it. If his right exists, it may be exercised in publishing nine editions, as in this case, as well as in one edition. If previous restraint is permissible, it may be imposed at once; indeed, the wrong may be as serious in one publication as in several. Characterizing the publication as a business, and the business as a nuisance, does not permit an invasion of the constitutional immunity against restraint. Similarly, it does not matter that the newspaper or periodical is found to be 'largely' or 'chiefly' devoted to the publication of such derelictions. If the publisher has a right, without previous restraint, to publish them, his right cannot be deemed to be dependent upon his publishing something else, more or less, with the matter to which objection is made.\n Nor can it be said that the constitutional freedom from previous restraint is lost because charges are made of derelictions which constitute crimes. With the multiplying provisions of penal codes, and of municipal charters and ordinances carrying penal sanctions, the conduct of \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 721]\n\u00a0\n public officers is very largely within the purview of criminal statutes. The freedom of the press from previous restraint has never been regarded as limited to such animadversions as lay outside the range of renal enactments. Historically, there is no such limitation; it is inconsistent with the reason which underlies the privilege, as the privilege so limited would be of slight value for the purposes for which it came to be established.\n The statute in question cannot be justified by reason of the fact that the publisher is permitted to show, before injunction issues, that the matter published is true and is published with good motives and for justifiable ends. If such a statute, authorizing suppression and injunction on such a basis, is constitutionally valid, it would be equally permissible for the Legislature to provide that at any time the publisher of any newspaper could be brought before a court, or even an administrative officer (as the constitutional protection may not be regarded as resting on mere procedural details), and required to produce proof of the truth of his publication, or of what he intended to publish and of his motives, or stand enjoined. If this can be done, the Legislature may provide machinery for determining in the complete exercise of its discretion what are justifiable ends and restrain publication accordingly. And it would be but a step to a complete system of censorship. The recognition of authority to impose previous restraint upon publication in order to protect the community against the circulation of charges of misconduct, and especially of official misconduct, necessarily would carry with it the admission of the authority of the censor against which the constitutional barrier was erected. The preliminary freedom, by virtue of the very reason for its existence, does not depend, as this court has said, on proof of truth. Patterson v. Colorado, supra.\n Equally unavailing is the insistence that the statute is designed to prevent the circulation of scandal which tends \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 722]\n\u00a0\n to disturb the public peace and to provoke assaults and the commission of crime. Charges of reprehensible conduct, and in particular of official malfeasance, unquestionably create a public scandal, but the theory of the constitutional guaranty is that even a more serious public evil would be caused by authority to prevent publication. 'To prohibit the intent to excite those unfavorable sentiments against those who administer the Government, is equivalent to a prohibition of the actual excitement of them; and to prohibit the actual excitement of them is equivalent to a prohibition of discussions having that tendeny an d effect; which, again, is equivalent to a protection of those who administer the Government, if they should at any time deserve the contempt or hatrad of the people, against being exposed to it by free animadversions on their characters and conduct.' \n12\n There is nothing new in the fact that charges of reprehensible conduct may create resentment and the disposition to resort to violent means of redress, but this well-understood tendency did not alter the determination to protect the press against censorship and restrain upon publication. As was said in New Yorker Staats-Zeitung v. Nolan, 89 N. J. Eq. 387, 388, 105 A. 72: 'If the township may prevent the circulation of a newspaper for no reason other than that some of its inhabitants may violently disagree with it, and resent it circulation by resorting to physical violence, there is no limit to what may be prohibited.' The danger of violent reactions becomes greater with effective organization of defiant groups resenting exposure, and, if this consideration warranted legislative interference with the initial freedom of publication, the constitutional protection would be reduced to a mere form of words.\n For these reasons we hold the statute, so far as it authorized the proceedings in this action under clause (b) \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 723]\n\u00a0\n of section 1, to be an infringement of the liberty of the press guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. We should add that this decision rests upon the operation and effect of the statute, without regard to the question of the truth of the charges contained in the particular periodical. The fact that the public officers named in this case, and those associated with the charges of official dereliction, may be deemed to be impeccable, cannot affect the conclusion that the statute imposes an unconstitutional restraint upon publication.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER (dissenting).\n The decision of the Court in this case declares Minnesota and every other state powerless to restrain by injunction the business of publishing and circulating among the people malicious, scandalous, and defamatory periodicals that in due course of judicial procedure has been adjudged to the a public nuisance. It gives to freedom of the press a meaning and a scope not heretofore recognized, and construes 'liberty' in the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to put upon the states a federal restriction that is without precedent.\n Confessedly, the Federal Constitution, prior to 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, did not protect the right of free speech of press against state action. Barron v. Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, 250; Fox v. Ohio, 5 How. 410, 434; Smith v. Maryland, 18 How. 71, 76; Withers v. Buckley, 20 How. 84, 89-91. Up to that time the right was safeguarded solely by the Constitutions and laws of the states, and, it may be added, they operated adequately to protect it. This court was not called on until 1925 to decide whether the 'liberty' protected by the Fourteenth Amendment includes the right of free speech and press. That question has been finally an- \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 724]\n\u00a0\n swered in the affirmative. Cf. Patterson v. Colorado, \n205 \nU.S. 454, 462\n, 27 S. Ct. 556, 10 Ann. Cas. 689; Prudential Ins. Co. v. Cheek, \n259 \nU.S. 530, 538\n, 543 S., 42 S. Ct. 516, 27 A. L. R. 27. See Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652\n, 45 S. Ct. 625; Fiske v. Kansas, \n274 \nU.S. 380\n, 47 S. Ct. 655; Stromberg v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 359\n, 51 S. Ct. 532\n\n\n The record shows, and it is conceded, that defendants' regular business was the publication of malicious, scandalous, and defamatory articles concerning the principal public officers, leading newspapers of the city, many private persons, and the Jewish race. It also shows that it was their purpose at all hazards to continue to carry on the business. In every edition slanderous and defamatory matter predominates to the practical exclusion of all else. Many of the statements are so highly improbable as to compel a finding that they are false. The articles themselves show malice. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[283 U.S. 697, 725]\n\u00a0\n The defendant here has no standing to assert that the statute is invalid because it might be construed so as to violate the Constitution. His right is limited solely to \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 726]\n\u00a0\n the inquiry whether, having regard to the points properly raised in his case, the effect of applying the statute is to deprive him of his liberty without die process of law. \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 727]\n\u00a0\n This court should not reverse the judgment below upon the ground that in some other case the statute may be applied in a way that is repugnant to the freedom of the press protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 \nU.S. 674, 680\n, 18 S. Ct. 229; Williams v. Mississippi, \n170 \nU.S. 213, 225\n, 18 S. Ct. 583; Yazoo & Miss. R. R. v. Jackson Vinegar Co., \n226 U.S. 217\n, 219-220, 33 S. Ct. 40. Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 U.S. 531\n, 544-546, 34 S. Ct. 359.\n This record requires the Court to consider the statute as applied to the business of publishing articles that are in fact malicious, scandalous, and defamatory.\n The statute provides that any person who 'shall be engaged in the business of regularly or customarily producing, publishing or circulating' a newspaper, magazine or other periodical that is (a) 'obscene, lewd and lascivious' or (b) 'malicious, scandalous and defama- \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 728]\n\u00a0\n tory' is guilty of a nuisance and may be enjoined as provided in the act. It will be observed that the qualifying words are used conjunctively. In actions brought under (b) 'there shall be available the defense that the truth was published with good motives and for justificable ends.'\n The complaint charges that defendants were engaged in the business of regularly and customarily publishing 'malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspapers' known as the Saturday Press, and nine editions dated, respectively, on each Saturday commencing September 25 and ending November 19, 1927, were made a part of the complaint. These are all that were published.\n On appeal from the order of the district court overruling defendants' demurrer to the complaint, the state Supreme Court said (174 Minn. 457, 461, 219 N. W. 770, 772, 58 A. L. R. 607):\n'The constituent elements of the declared nuisance are the customary and regular dissemination by means of a newspaper, which finds its way into families, reaching the young as well as the mature, of a selection of scandalous and defamatory articles treated in such a way as to excite attention and interest so as to command circulation . ... The statute is not directed at threatened libel but at an existing business which, generally speaking, involves more than libel. The distribution of scandalous matter is detrimental to public morals and to the general welfare. It tends to disturb the peace of the community. Being defamatory and malicious, it tends to provoke assaults and the commission of crime. It has no concern with the publication of the truth, with good motives and for justifiable ends . ... In Minnesota no agency can hush the sincere and honest voice of the press, but our Constitution was never intended to protect malice, scandal, and defamation when untrue or published with bad motive or without justifiable ends. ... It was never the intention of the Constitution to afford protec- \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 729]\n\u00a0\n tion to a publication devoted to scandal and defamation. ... Defendants stand before us upon the record as being regularly and customarily engaged in a business of conducting a newspaper sending to the public malicious, scandalous, and defamatory printed matter.'\n\n The case was remanded to the district court.\n Near's answer made no allegations to excuse or justify the business or the articles complained of. It formally denied that the publications were malicious, scandalous, or defamatory, admitted that they were made as alleged, and attacked the statute as unconstitutional. At the trial the plaintiff introduced evidence unquestionably sufficient to support the complaint. The defendant offered none. The court found the facts as alleged in the complaint and specifically that each edition 'was chiefly devoted to malicious, scandalous and defamatory articles' and that the last edition was chiefly devoted to malicious, scandalous, and defamatory articles concerning Leach (mayor of Minneapolis), Davis (representative of the law enforcement league of citizens), Brunskill (chief of police), Olson (county attorney), the Jewish race, and members of the grand jury then serving in that court; that defendants in and through the several publications 'did thereby engage in the business of regularly and customarily producing, publishing and circulating a malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspaper.'\n Defendant Near again appealed to the Supreme Court. In its opinion ( 179 Minn. 40, 228 N. W. 326) the court said: 'No claim is advanced that the method and character of the operation of the newspaper in question was not a nuisance if the statute is constitutional. It was regularly and customarily devoted largely to malicious, scandalous, and defamatory matter. ... The record presents the same questions upon which we have already passed.' \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 730]\n\u00a0\n Defendant concedes that the editions of the newspaper complained of are 'defamatory per se.' And he says: 'It has been asserted that the constitution was never intended to be a shield for malice, scandal, and defamation when unrue, or published with bad motives, or for unjustificable ends. ... The contrary is true; every person does have a constitutional right to publish malicious, scandalous, and defamatory matter though untrue, and with bad motives, and for unjustifiable ends, in the first instance, though he is subject to responsibility therefor afterwards.' The record, when the substance of the articles is regarded, requires that concession here. And this Court is required to pass on the validity of the state law on that basis.\n No question was raised below, and there is none here, concerning the relevancy or weight of evidence, burden of proof, justification or other matters of defense, the scope of the judgment or proceedings to enforce it, or the character of the publications that may be made notwithstanding the injunction.\n There is no basis for the suggestion that defendants may not interpose any defense or introduce any evidence that would be open to them in a libel case or that malice may not be negatived by showing that the publication was made in good faith in belief of its truth or that at the time and under the circumstances it was justified as a fair comment on public affairs or upon the conduct of public officers in respect of their duties as such. See Mason's Minnesota States 1927,  10112, 10113.\n The scope of the judgment is not reviewable here. The opinion of the state Supreme Court shows that it was not reviewable there because defendants' assignments of error in that court did not go to the form of the judgment and because the lower court had not been asked to modify the judgment. \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 731]\n\u00a0\n The act was passed in the exertion of the state's power of police, and this court is by well-established rule required to assume, until the contrary is clearly made to appear, that there exists in Minnesota a state of affairs that justifies this measure for the preservation of the peace and good order of the state. Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61, 79\n, 31 S. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160; Gitlow v. New York, supra, \n268 U.S. 668\n-669, 45 S. Ct. 625; Corporation Commission v. Lowe, \n281 \nU.S. 431, 438\n, 50 S. Ct. 397; O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Ins. Co., \n282 U.S. 251\n, 257-258, 51 S. Ct. 130.\n The publications themselves disclose the need and propriety of the legislation. They show:\n In 1913 one Guilford, originally a defendant in this suit, commenced the publication of a scandal sheet called the Twin City Reporter. In 1916 Near joined him in the enterprise, later bought him out, and engaged the services of the Bevans. In 1919 Bevans acquired Near's interest, and has since, alone or with others, continued the publication. Defendants admit that they published some reprehensible articles in the Twin City Reporter, deny that they personally used it for blackmailing purposes, admit that, by reason of their connection with the paper, their reputation did become tainted, and state that Bevans, while so associated with Near, did use the paper for blackmailing purposes. And Near says it was for that reason he sold his interest to Bevans.\n In a number of the editions, defendants charge that, ever since Near sold his interest to Bevans in 1919, the Twin City Reporter has been used for blackmail, to dominate public gambling and other criminal activities, and as well to exert a kind of control over public officers and the government of the city.\n The articles in question also state that, when defendants announced their intention to publish the Saturday Press, they were threatened, and that soon after the first pub- \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 732]\n\u00a0\n lication Guilford was waylaid and shot down before he could use the firearm which he had at hand for the purpose of defending himself against anticipated assaults. It also appears that Near apprehended violence and was not unprepared to repel it. There is much more of like significance.\n The long criminal career of the Twin City Reporter-if it is in fact as described by defendants-and the arming and shooting ariing out of the publication of the Saturday Press, serve to illustrate the kind of conditions in respect of the business of publishing malicious, scandalous, and defamatory periodicals by which the state Legislature presumably was moved to enact the law in question. It must be deemed appropriate to deal with conditions existing in Minnesota.\n It is of the greatest importance that the states shall be untrammeled and free to employ all just and appropriate measures to prevent abuses of the liberty of the press.\n In his work on the Constitution (5th Ed.) Justice Story, expounding the First Amendment which declares: 'Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press' said (section 1880):\n'That this amendment was intended to secure to every citizen an absolute right to speak, or write, or print whatever he might please, without any responsibility, public or private, therefor, is a supposition too wild to be indulged by any rational man. This would be to allow to every citizen a right to destroy at his pleasure the reputation, the peace, the property, and even the personal safety of every other citizen. A man might, out of mere malice and revenge, accuse another of the most infamous crimes; might excite against him the indignation of all his fellow-citizens by the most atrocious calumnies; might disturb, nay, overturn, all his domestic peace, and embitter his parental affections; might inflict the most distressing punishments upon the weak, the timid, and the inno- \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 733]\n\u00a0\n cent; might prejudice all a man's civil, and political, and private rights; and might stir up sedition, rebellion, and treason even against the government itself, in the wantonness of his passions or the corruption of his heart. Civil society could not go on under such circumstances. Men would then be obliged to resort to private vengenance to make up for the deficiencies of the law; and assassination and savage cruelties would be perpetrated with all the frequency belonging to barbarous and brutal communities. It is plain, then, that the language of this amendment imports no more than that every man shall have a right to speak, write, and print his opinions upon any subject whatsoever, without any prior restraint, so always that he does not injure any other person in his rights, person, property, or reputation; and so always that he does not thereby disturb the public peace, or attempt to subvert the government. It is neither more nor less than an expansion of the great doctrine recently brought into operation in the law of libel, that every man shall be at liberty to publish what is true, with good motives and for justifiable ends. And with this reasonable limitation it is not only right in itself, but it is an inestimable privilege in a free government. Without such a limitation, it might become the scourge of the republic, first denouncing the principles of liberty, and then, by rendering the most virtuous patriots odious through the terrors of the press, introducing despotism in its worst form.' (Italicizing added.)\n\n The Court quotes Blackstone in support of its condemnation of the statute as imposing a previous restraint upon publication. But the previous restraints referred to by him subjected the press to the arbitrary will of an administrative officer. He describes the practice ( book IV, p. 152): 'To subject the press to the restrictive power of a licenser, as was formerly done, both before and since the revolution, (of 1688) is to subject all free- \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 734]\n\u00a0\n dom of sentiment to the prejudices of one man, and make him the arbitrary and infallible judge of all controverted points in learning, religion, and government.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Story gives the history alluded to by Blackstone (section 1882):\n'The art of printing soon after its introduction, unless previously approved by proper well in England as in other countries, as merely a matter of state, and subject to the coercion of the crown. It was, therefore, regulated in England by the king's proclamations, prohibitions, charters of privilege, and licenses, and finally by the decrees of the Court of Star-Chamber, which limited the number of printers and of presses which each should employ, and prohibited new publications, unless priviously approved by proper licensers. On the demolition of this odious jurisdiction, in 1641, the Long Parliament of Charles the First, after their rupture with that prince, assumed the same powers which the Star-Chamber exercised with respect to licensing books; and during the Commonwealth (such is human frailty and the love of power even in republics!) they issued their ordinances for that purpose, founded principally upon a Star-Chamber decree of 1937. After the restoration of Charles the Second, a statute on the same subject was passed, copied, with some few alterations, from the parliamentary ordinances. The act expired in 1679, and was revived and continued for a few years after the revolution of 1688. Many attempts were made by the government to keep it in force; but it was \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 735]\n\u00a0\n so strongly resisted by Parliament that it expired in 1694, and has never since been revived.'\n\n It is plain that Blackstone taught that under the common law liberty of the press means simply the absence of restraint upon publication in advance as distinguished from liability, civil or criminal, for libelous or improper matter so published. And, as above shown, Story defined freedom of the press guaranteed by the First Amendment to mean that 'every man shall be at liberty to publish what is true, with good motives and for justifiable ends.' His statement concerned the definite declaration of the First Amendment. It is not suggested that the freedom of press included in the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, which was adopted after Story's definition, is greater than that protected against congressional action. And see 2 Cooley's Constitutional Limitations (8th Ed.) p. 886; 2 Kent's Commentaries (14th Ed.) Lect. XXIV, p. 17.\n The Minnesota statute does not operate as a previous restraint on publication within the proper meaning of that phrase. It does not authorize administrative control in advance such as was formerly exercised by the licensers and censors, but prescribes a remedy to be enforced by a suit in equity. In this case there was previous publication made in the course of the business of regularly producing malicious, scandalous, and defamatory periodicals. The business and publications unquestionably constitute an abuse of the right of free press. The statute denounces the things done as a nuisance on the ground, as stated by the state Supreme Court, that they threaten morals, peace, and good order. There is no question of the power of the state to denounce such transgressions. The restraint authorized is only in respect of continuing to do what has been duly adjudged to constitute a nuisance. The controlling words are: 'All persons guilty of such nuisance may be enjoined, as here- \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 736]\n\u00a0\n inafter provided. ... Whenever any such nuisance is committed ... an action in the name of the State' may be brought 'to perpetually enjoin the person or persons committing, conducting or maintaining any such nuisance, from further committing, conducting, or maintaining any such nuisance . ... The court may make its order and judgment permanently enjoining ... defendants found guilty ... from further committing or continuing the acts prohibited hereby, and in and by such judgment, such nuisance may be wholly abated. ...' There is nothing in the statute3 purporting to prohibit publications that have not been adjudged to constitute a nuisance. It is fancful to suggest similarity between the granting or enforcement of the decree authorized by this statute to prevent further publication of malicious, scandalous, and defamatory articles and the previous restraint upon the press by licensers as referred to by Blackstone and described in the history of the times to which he alludes. \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 737]\n\u00a0\n The opinion seems to concede that under clause (a) of the Minnesota law the business of regularly publishing and circulating an obscene periodical may be enjoined as a nuisance. It is difficult to perceive any distinction, having any relation to constitutionality, between clause (a) and clause (b) under which this action was brought. Both nuisances are offensive to morals, order, and good government. As that resulting from lewd publications constitutionally may be enjoined, it is hard to understand why the one resulting from a regular business of malicious defamation may not.\n It is well known, as found by the state Supreme Court, that existing libel laws are inadequate effectively to suppress evils resulting from the kind of business and publications that are shown in this case. The doctrine that measures such as the one before us are invalid because they operate as revious restraints to infringe freedom of press exposes the peace and good order of every community and the business and private affairs of every individual to the constant and protracted false and malicious \n\n[283 U.S. 697, 738]\n\u00a0\n assaults of any insolvent publisher who may have purpose and sufficient capacity to contrive and put into effect a scheme or program for oppression, blackmail or extortion.\n The judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, and Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Mason's Minnesota Statutes, 1927,  10123-1 to 10123-3. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Mason's Minn.

There have been too many men in this city and especially those in official life, who HAVE been taking orders and suggestions from JEW GANGSTERS, therefore we HAVE Jew Gangters, practically ruling Minneapolis.\n\n'It was buzzards of the Barnett stripe who shot down my buddy. It was Barnett gunmen who staged the assault on Samuel Shapiro. It is Jew thugs who have 'pulled' practically every robbery in this city. It was a member of the Barnett gang who shot down George Rubenstein (Ruby) while he stood in the shelter of Mose Barnett's ham-cavern on Hennepin avenue. It was Mose Barnett himself who shot down Roy Rogers on Hennepin avenue. It was at Mose Barnett's place of 'business' that the '13 dollar Jew' found a refuge while the police of New York were combing the country for him. It was a gang of Jew gunmen who boasted that for five hundred dollars they would kill any man in the city. It was Mose Barnett, a \n\n Jew, who boasted that he held the chief of police of Minnoapolis in his hand-had bought and paid for him.\n'It is Jewish men and women-pliant tools of the Jew gangster, Mose Barnett, who stand charged with having falsified the election records and returns in the Third ward. And it is Mose Barnett himself, who, indicted for his part in the Shapiro assault, is a fugitive from justice today.\n\n'Practically every vendor of vile hooch, every owner of a moonshine still, every snake-faced gangster and exbryonic yegg in the Twin Cities is a JEW.\n\n'Having these examples before me, I feel that I am justified in my refusal to take orders from a Jew who boasts that he is a 'bosom friend' of Mr. Olson.\n\n'I find in the mail at least twice per week, letters from gentlemen of Jewish faith who advise me against 'launching an attack on the Jewish people.' These gentlemen have the cart before the house. I am launching, nor is Mr. Guilford, no attack against any race, BUT:\n\n'When I find men of a certain race banding themselves together for the purpose of preying upon Gentile or Jew; gunmen, KILLERS, roaming our streets shooting down men against whom they have no personal grudge (or happen to have); defying OUR laws; corrupting OUR officials; assaulting business men; beating up unarmed citizens; spreading a reign of terror through every walk of life, then I say to you in all sincerity, that I refuse to back up a single step from that 'issue'-if they choose to make it so.\n\n'If the people of Jewish faith in Minneapolis wish to avoid criticism of these vermin whom I rightfully calls 'Jews' they can easily do so BY THEMSELVES CLEANING HOUSE.\n\n'I'm not out to cleanse Israel of the filth that clings to Israel's skirts. I'm out to 'hew to the line, let the chips fly where they may.'\n\n'I simply state a fact when I say that ninety per cent of the crimes committed against society in this city are committed by Jew gangsters.\n\n'It was a Jew who employed JEWS to shoot down Mr. Guilford. It was a Jew who employed a Jew to intimidate Mr. Shapiro \n\n and a Jew who employed JEWS to assault that gentleman when he refused to yield to their threats. It was a JEW who wheedled or employed Jews to manipulate the election records and returns in the Third ward in flagrant violation of law. It was a Jew who left two hundred dollars with another Jew to pay to our chief of police just before the last municipal election, and:\n'It is Jew, Jew, as long as one cares to comb over the records.\n\n'I am launching no attack against the Jewish people AS A RACE. I am merely calling attention to a FACT. And if the people of that race and faith with to rid themselvs of the odium and stigma THE RODENTS OF THEIR OWN RACE HAVE BROUGHT UPON THEM, they need only to step to the front and help the decent citizens of Minneapolis rid the city of these criminal Jews.\n\n'Either Mr. Guilford or myself stand ready to do battle for a MAN, regardless of his race, color or creed, but neither of us will step one inch out of our chosen path to avoid a fight IF the Jews want to battle.\n\n'Both of use have some mighty loyal friends among the Jewish people but not one of them comes whining to ask that we 'lay off' criticism of Jewish gangsters and none of them who comes carping to us of their 'bosom friendship' for any public official now under our journalistic guns.'\n\n'GIL'S (Guilford's) CHATTERBOX.\n\n'I headed into the city on September 26th, ran across three Jews in a Chrevolet; stopped a lot of lead and won a bed for myself in St. Barnabas Hospital for six weeks. ...\n\n'Whereupon I have withdrawn all allegiance to anything with a hook nose that east herring. I have adopted the sparrow as my national bird unit Davis' law enforcement league or the K. K. K. hammers the eagle's beak out straight. So if I seem to act crazy as I ankle down the street, bear in mind that I am merely saluting MY national emblem.\n\n'All of which has nothing to do with the present whereabouts of Big Mose Barnett. Methinks he headed the local delegation to the new Palestine- for-Jews-only. He went ahead of the boys so \n\n he could do a little fixing with the Yiddish chief of police and get his twenty-five per cent of the gambling take-off. Boys will be boys and 'ganefs' will be ganefs.'\n GRAND JURIES AND DITTO.\n'There are grand juries, and there are grand juries. The last one was a real grand jury. It acted. The present one is like the scion who is labelled 'Junior.' That means not so good. There are a few mighty good folks on it-there are some who smell bad. One petty peanut polician whose graft was almost pitiful in its size when he was a public official, has already shot his mouth off in several places. He is establishing his alibi in advance for what he intends to keep from taking place.\n\n'But George, we won't bother you. (Meaning a grand juror.) We are aware that the gambling syndicate was waiting for your body to convene before the big crap game opened again. The Yids has your dimensions, apparently, and we always go by the judgment of a dog in appraising people.\n\n'We will call for a special grand jury and a special prosecutor within a short time, as soon as half of the staff can navigate to advantage, and then we'll show you what a real grand jury can do. Up to the present we have been merely tapping on the window. Very soon we shall start smashing glass.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] May, Constitutional History of England, c. 1X.

CO. v. BOWERS(1931)\nNo. 160\nArgued: Decided: April 13, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 242, 243]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James H. McIntosh, of New York City, for New York Life ins. co.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Claude R. Branch, of Providence, R. I., for Bowers.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The company sued the collector in the District Court, Southern District of New York, to recover capital stock taxes exacted under section 1000(c) of the Revenue Act of 19181 for four years ending June 30, 1922. A jury was waived, and the case was submitted on an agreed statement of facts. The court held the taxes for the first three years were rightly collected, and as to the causes of action alleged on account of them dismissed the complaint. It held that, \n\n[283 U.S. 242, 244]\n\u00a0\n by reason of the Revene Ac t of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 261, the capital stock tax did not apply to the last year, and gave plaintiff judgment for the amount paid for that period. 34 F.(2d) 60. On the company's appeal (No. 93 here) and the collector's cross-appeal (No. 160) the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. 39 F.(2d) 556.\n The company is a New York corporation without capital stock engaged in mutual life insurance on the level premium plan. It made a return for each of the years showing no tax. After auditing the returns, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed the taxes in question.\n By means of an accepted mortality table and an assumed rate of interest, the company calculates the amount that would be required to be paid by the insured each year in advance to cover policy claims if deaths occur as indicated by the table and if that rate of interest is realized on the investments. The amount so ascertained is called the net or mathematical premium. There is added loading to cover expenses and unforeseen contingencies such as excess mortality, diminished taxes. The premium so built up is named in takes. The premium so built up is named in the policy and constitutes the maximum that the company may require the insured to pay.\n The amount by which the premium exceeds the company's actual cost must be returned to the policyholder. Penn Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Lederer, \n252 \nU.S. 523, 525\n, 40 S. Ct. 397. Some of the company's policies are on the annual dividend plan, which requires it to account for divisible surplus and to make yearly distribution to the policyholders. The other policies are on the deferred dividend plan and provide for holding the overpayments to the credit of the deferred dividend policyholders as a class, accumulating them at interest and paying to each holder of a policy in force at the time designated therein his share of the accumulated sum. \n\n[283 U.S. 242, 245]\n\u00a0\n As soon as practicable after the expiration of each calendar year, the company takes an account of its business, ascertains the surplus earned that year, and determines the amount which safely may be distributed out of the surplus for that and prior years. By the laws of New York and of other states, where the company does business, it is required annually to file a statement showing, among other things, income and disbursements in, and its assets and liabilities at the end of, the preceding year. Item 35 on the form used shows dividends apportioned and payable to annual dividend policyholders to and including December 31 following. Item 36 covers dividends apportioned and payable to deferred dividend policies in the same period. Item 37 shows the amounts set apart, apportioned, provisionally ascertained, calculated, declared, or held awaiting apportionment upon deferred dividend policies not included in item 36.\n Section 1000(c) imposes a tax on each mutual insurance company's 'surplus or contingent reserves maintained for the general use of the business.' The Commissioner based the capital stock taxes for each year on the total of items 35, 36, and 37 as disclosed by the company's annual statements filed for the years ending respectively December 31, 1917, 1918, 1919, and 1920\n\n\n 1. These items represent surplus within the meaning of subdivision (c).\n The sums to be paid as dividends are not a part of the insurance specified in the policies. They are derived from amounts which, from abundant caution, are included in the advance premiums over and above hat is found by actual experience to be necessary to pay the cost of the insurance and the expenses of carrying on the business. They indicate a 'surplus,' i. e., assets in excess of what is deemed necessary to provide for the payment when due of the amounts specifically covered by the policies. \n\n[283 U.S. 242, 246]\n\u00a0\n No money or property is set aside on account of such dividends. The items in question do not constitute liabilities. They are merely accounting entries to show the amounts presently available for dividends currently payable and as well the fund accumulated in respect of deferred dividends. Such entries are analogous to those in ballance sheets of business corporations which show capital stock as a liability. And until actually paid out as dividends the money or securities used for that purpose properly may be deemed to be maintained for 'the general use of the business.'\n Under the company's construction of subdivision (c) it was not liable for the tax for any year while the 1918 act was in force. According to its returns it had no 'surplus or contingent reserves.' The company does not suggest, and there is no reason to suppose, that, in respect of assets properly so to be classed, it is not typical of mutual insurance companies generally. When regard is had to the well-known and necessary practice of mutual insurance companies to collect in advance premiums in excess of total costs and to pay dividends out of the resulting surplus, it is clear that the company's construction is unreasonable. It would operate to defeat the plainly expressed purpose of Congress to impose a capital stock tax on mutual insurance companies.\n\n 2. \nThe company contends that in any event subdivision (b) of section 1000 requires that item 37 be excluded from the amount used to measure the excise.\n That provision is: 'In computing the tax in the case of insurance companies such deposits and reserve funds as they are required by law or contract to maintain or hold for the protection of or payment to or apportionment among policyholders shall not be included.' The legislative history of section 1000 goes far to make its meaning clear. Section 407 of the 1916 act imposed upon corporations a special excise measured by the value of their capital stock. \n\n[283 U.S. 242, 247]\n\u00a0\n 39 Stat. 789. Its scope was not clear. At first the Treasury Department ruled that, as mutual insurance companies have no capital stock, the section did not apply to them. Regulations 38, art. 2(b). That construction was later reversed. Regulations 38 (Revised) art. 3. And see Lumber Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Malley (D. C.) 44 F.(2d) 553.\n In the bill for the Revenue Act of 1918 as it passed the House, section 1000 was substantially the same as section 407 of the 1916 act. The Senate substituted provisions to tax the incomes of insurance companies. In conference, the original section 1000 was restored, and there was added to it the provision in paragraph (c) which specifically declares that the taxes imposed by that section shall apply to mutual insurance companies. The provision added was complete in itself. It specified the rate and indicated the basis on which the tax was to be calculated; it was adequate to govern the ascertainmet of the amount, and there is nothing to indicate an intention that the language there used should be modified by anything in subdivision (b). It is clear that (c) was intended exclusively to govern mutual insurance companies, and that (b) applies only to stock insurance companies.\n\n 3. \nThe company insists that section 1000 of the 1918 act did not impose a tax for the year ending June 30, 1921.\n The Treasury Department ruled that the taxes imposed by section 407 of the 1916 act were payable in advance for the year commencing July 1, and that construction was followed while the section remained in force. Undoubtedly Congress intended that the same rule should be followed under the substitute provision, section 1000 of the 1918 act. And the Treasury Department so construed it. The 1918 act was not approved until February 24, 1919. The yer co mmencing July 1, 1918, was the first for which it imposed the capital stock tax. See Hecht v. Malley, \n265 \nU.S. 144, 163\n, 44 S. Ct. 462. And this company's annual statement for 1917 was the basis on which the Commissioner made his \n\n[283 U.S. 242, 248]\n\u00a0\n calculations. The legislative history and the administrative construction make it clear that such taxes were payable in advance. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The taxes for the third year under the 1918 act were calculated on the insurance company's annual statement for the calendar year 1919 and were payable in advance for the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1920. There is nothing in the 1921 act, which was not approved until November 23, to suggest that Congress intended that capital stock taxes so payable in 1920 were to be returned if already paid or canceled if delinquent. The company was rightly held for that year's tax.\n\n 4. \nThe collector maintains that, despite the 1921 act, the company is liable under section 1000 of the 1918 act for the capital stock tax for the year ending June 30, 1922.\n Section 243 of the 1921 act (42 Stat. 261) imposes a tax upon the net income of every insurance company for the calendar year 1921 and each taxable year thereafter. It declares that tax to be in lieu of other taxes imposed by that act, namely, income taxes on corporations generally, section 230, capital stock taxes, section 1000, and profits taxes, title 3. Section 1400(a) repealed, to take effect January 1, 1922, title 10 of the 1918 act, which includes section 1000. Section 1400(b) provides: 'In the case of any tax imposed by any part of the Revenue Act of 1918 repealed by this Act, if there is a tax imposed by this Act in lieu thereof, the provision (of the 1918 Act) imposing such tax shall remain in force until the corresponding tax under this Act takes effect.' The income tax imposed by section 243 is declared to be in lieu of capital stock tax in section 1000 of the same act. \n\n[283 U.S. 242, 249]\n\u00a0\n And, as the latter tax was in lieu of the capital stock tax imposed by section 1000 of the 1918 act, it reasonably may be said that the income tax imposed by section 243 was intended to be in lieu of the capital stock tax of section 1000 of the 1918 act.\n This income tax was one 'corresponding' to the capital stock tax under section 1000 of the 1918 act within the meaning of section 1400(b). And under that provision the last-mentioned tax remained in force until the former took effect. The income tax imposed by section 243 was 'for the calendar year 1921.' Section 1400 (b) makes it plain that there was no intention to subject insurance companies to both taxes for the same period.

HARTLEY(1931)\nNo. 66\nArgued: January 23, 1931Decided: May 25, 1931\n\n\n\n Messrs. O. C. Moore, of Spokane, Wash., and W. Lon Johnson, of Colville, Wash., for appellant.\n Mr. John H. Dunbar, of Olympia, Wash., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity to enjoin the appellees from bringing or causing to be brought a suit for enforcing against the appellant section 33, article 2 of the Constitution of the State of Washington and an Act of 1921 (Laws Wash. 1921, p. 156) in pursuance of the same, it being alleged that the section and Act are repugnant to the commerce and contract \n\n[283 U.S. 568, 569]\n\u00a0\n clauses of the Constitution of the United States (article 1,  8, cl. 3, and section 10, cl. 1) and also to the Fourteenth Amendment and to the Treaty between the United States and Great Britain (8 Stat. 228). The bill was dismissed by a District Court of three Judges. 35 F.(2d) 199.\n The bill alleges that the plaintiff, the appellant, is a corporation of the State of Washington and that it owns rights of way, etc., over which it transmits electrical energy from Canada to points within the State. But the majority of its stock is owned by an alien corporation and, with immaterial exceptions, section 33, art. 2 of the Constitution of the State prohibits the ownership of land by aliens and provides that every corporation of which the majority of the stock is owned by aliens shall be considered an alien for the purposes of the prohibition. This was in force before the appellant acquired its alleged rights. The statute was passed after the acquisitio. State v. Natsuhara, 136 Wash. 437, 444, 240 P. 557. It is alleged that the defendants have threatened and will attempt to forfeit and escheat to the State the plaintiff's rights by prosecuting a suit at law in the Courts of the State as a result of which the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable loss.\n Some, at least, of the constitutional objections to the laws of the State are disposed of by Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197\n, 44 S. Ct. 15, but before they are reached there arises the objection that no ground for equitable interference by the Courts of the United States is shown by the bill. The only injury alleged is the result of the suit in the State Courts. So far as appears that result will ensue only upon a decision against the appellant. It is an odd ground for an injunction against a suit that the suit may turn out against the party sued. If the action is based upon an unconstitutional law and if the trial court upholds it, still the appellant can protect its rights as fully in the State Courts as elsewhere. As it is put by Mr. \n\n[283 U.S. 568, 570]\n\u00a0\n Justice Moody speaking for a unanimous Court, 'It is safe to say that no case can be found where this court has deliberately approved the issuance of an injunction against the enforcement of an ordinance resting on state authority, merely because it was illegal or unconstitutional, unless further circumstances were shown which brought the case within some clear ground of equity jurisdiction.'

These cases relied on by the Court below are sufficient to sustain its conclusion. The exceptions are explained in the cases in which they occur, e. g., Terrace v.

Lum, of Newark, N. J., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases, which are here on appeals from the highest court of New Jersey, were argued together. They present the question whether the following statutory provision, \n\n[282 U.S. 251, 255]\n\u00a0\n effective March 29, 1928, is consistent with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment:\n'In order that rates for insurance against the hazards of fire shall be reasonable it shall be unlawful for any such insurer licensed in this State to ... allow ... any commission ... in excess of a reasonable amount, to any person for acting as its agent in respect to any class of such insurance, nor ... to allow, any commission ... to any person for acting as its local agent in respect to any class of such insurance, in excess of that ... allowed to any one of its local agents on such risks in this State.' (New Jersey Laws 1928, c. 128, p. 258.)\n\n In each case, O'Gorman & Young, Inc., a domestic corporation licensed as an insurance broker, sues a licensed foreign fire insurance company to recover a balance alleged to be due for services performed as local agent at Newark after the effective date of the statute. In the Phoenix Assurance Company case, the complaint is on a contract terminable at will, made prior to the enactment of the statute. by which the company agreed to pay to the agent twenty-five per cent of the premiums. In the Hartford Fire Insurance Company case, the complaint is on a contract, made after the enactment of the statute, by which the defendant agreed to pay as compensation 'what such services were reasonably worth'; and the complaint alleges that the services were reasonably worth twenty-five per cent. of the premiums. Each complaint alleges that the defendant has paid the plaintiff only twenty per cent. of the premiums. Each answer admits the facts alleged in the complaint. As a defense, it sets up the statute and the fact that the defendant had at the date of its enactment, and ever since has had, several persons acting as its local agents within the State to whom the compensation allowed in respect to the same class of business has been only twenty per cent. of the premiums. \n\n[282 U.S. 251, 256]\n\u00a0\n Each case was heard upon a motion to strike out the answer and for judgment on the ground that the statute is void under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In each case the trial court denied the motion and entered judgment against the plaintiff, the facts alleged in the answer being admitted. In an opinion discussing the question presented, that court said:\n'Our statute provides that the rates for fire insurance 'shall be reasonable.' Since the commissions paid to local agents naturally enter into the cost of such insurance to the public, and therefore influence the rates which must be charged to the public for such insurance, it is within the police power of the State to require that the commissions must be reasonable, otherwise such large commissions might be allowed as to impair the financial stability of the insurance companies, and thus imperil their ability to meet their financial obligations to their policyholders.\n\n'Since twenty per cent. is the amount of commissions paid to some of its local agents, the effect of this legislation is to determine that a commission in excess of that is unreasonable. The presumption is in favor of the reasonableness of the law until the contrary is made to appear.\n\n'In the facts or argument th ere is nothing to overcome that presumption. ...' 105 N. J. Law 645, 146 A. 370, 371.1 \n\n[282 U.S. 251, 257]\n\u00a0\n On that opinion the Court of Errors and Appeals affirmed the judgments of the trial court. 105 N. J. Law, 642, 146 A. 370.

St. Rep. 708, 18 Ann. Cas. 1048. The agent's compensation, being a percentage of the premium, bears a direct relation to the rate charged the insured. The percentage commonly allowed is so large that it is a vital element in the rate structure and may seriously affect the adequacy of the rate. Excessive commissions may result in an unreasonably high rate level or in impairment of the financial stability of the insurer. It was stated at the bar that the commission on some classes of insurance is as high as thirtyfive per cent. Moreover, lack of a uniform scale of commissions allowed local agents for the same service may encourage unfair discrimination among policyholders by facilitating the forbidden practice of rebating. In the field of life insurance, such evils led long ago to legislative limitation of agents' commissions. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The statute here questioned deals with a subject clearly within the scope of the police power. We are asked to declare it void on the ground that the specific method of regulation prescribed is unreasonable and hence deprives the plaintiff of due process of law. As underlying questions of fact may condition the constitutionality of legislation of this character, the presumption of constitutional- \n\n[282 U.S. 251, 258]\n\u00a0\n ity must prevail in the absence of some factual foundation of record for overthrowing the statute. \n3\n It does not appear upon the face of the statute, or from any facts of which the court must take judicial notice, that in New Jersey evils did not exist in the business of fire insurance for which this statutory provision was an appropriate remedy. The action of the legislature and of the highest court of the State indicates that such evils did exist. \n4\n The record is barren of any allegation of fact tending to show unreasonableness.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER.\n We are of opinion that the judgments below should be reversed.\n The appellees (defendants below) are separate fire insurance companies. The facts are not in dispute; both \n\n[282 U.S. 251, 259]\n\u00a0\n records present like circumstances and questions of law. It will suffice here to point out the essentials disclosed in No. 12.\n O'Gorman & Young, a New Jersey corporation, under proper license transacts business as an insurance broker. For many years it has been the agent of appellee, a Connecticut corporation authorized to issue fire policies in New Jersey. Prior to March 29, 1928, the agreement of employment provided that for negotiating and selling such policies the agent should receive 25 per cent. of prescribed premiums. On that day the original contract was changed and now it provides that the agent shall be paid 'what such services were reasonably worth.'\n Acting under this modified arrangement, O'Gorman & Young negotiated and sold policies upon which the premiums amounted to $2,454.61. As reasonable compensation, demand was made for $613.68-25 per cent. of the premiums. The insurance company paid $490.92, 20 per cent., and denied further liability.\n Thereupon (October, 1928), asserting that its services were reasonably worth 25 per cent. of the premiums, O'Gorman & Young brought an action against the insurance company in the circuit court, Essex county, N. J., to recover $122.76. The complaint sets out the foregoing facts and asks for judgment; it says nothing concerning any New Jersey statute.\n The answer admits the allegations of the complaint except 'defendant denies that it owes the plaintiff the sum of $122.76 as in said complaint alleged for the reasons hereinafter in this answer set forth.' They are set out in the three paragraphs immediately below.\n Chapter 128,5 Act of the New Jersey Legislature approved March 29, 1928, provides (section 1): 'In order \n\n[282 U.S. 251, 260]\n\u00a0\n that rates for insurance against the hazards of fire shall be reasonable it shall be unlawful for any such insurer licensed in this State to directly or indirectly pay or allow, or offer or agree to allow, any commission or other com- \n\n[282 U.S. 251, 261]\n\u00a0\n pensation or anything of value, in excess of a reasonable amount, to any person foract ing as its agent in respect to any class of such insurance, nor to directly or indirectly pay or allow, or offer or agree to allow, any commission or \n\n[282 U.S. 251, 262]\n\u00a0\n other compensation or anything of value, to any person for acting as its local agent in respect to any class of such insurance, in excess of that offered, paid or allowed to any one of its local agents on such risks in this State.'\n Also (section 2): 'Any insurer, agent, expert, person or corporation violating any of the provisions of this act shall be subject to a penalty of five hundred dollars for each and every violation to be sued for and recovered by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, or by any citizen of this State and paid to the State Treasurer. In case any insurer is convicted of a violation of this act, every local agent of the insurer in this State shall be \n\n[282 U.S. 251, 263]\n\u00a0\n entitled to the same commission or compensation, or other thing of value, for business done for the insurer during the calendar year in which the discrimination took place, on risks in this State, and any local agent may recover from the insurer in any court of competent jurisdiction, the amount of such excess commission or compensation, or other thing of value, if any, to which he may become entitled under the provisions of this Act.'\n'On and subsequently to March 29, 1928, this defendant had and now has several persons acting as its local agents duly authorized to represent it in writing fire insurance in the State of New Jersey; that the commissions allowed by this defendant to its said several agents so acting as aforesaid in respect to the classof insurance mentioned in the said complaint was, on said last mentioned day and from thence hitherto and now is, twenty per centum on each premium charged; that pursuant to the terms of the said statute it became and was unlawful on and after March 29, 1928, to pay to the plaintiff herein the commission of twenty- five per centum of the premium charged, theretofore paid by this defendant to the said plaintiff.'\n\n Admitting that since March 29, 1928, a commission of 20 per cent. had been regularly allowed by the insurance company to certain agents in New Jersey and asserting the invalidity of the Act of that date because of conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, complainant moved to strike out the answer as insufficient. This motion was denied and final judgment went for the defendant upon the pleadings and admission.\n The Circuit Court (Judge Dungan) said:\n'The other question is whether of not the act deprives the plaintiff of its property without due process of law, and therefore is a violation of the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution.\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 251, 264]\n\u00a0\n 'Federal and State laws are in favor of the regulation of the business affairs of persons and corporations which affect the public interest and there are federal and state decisions in almost every state in this country upholding the constitutionality of such laws, provided they are reasonable. Of course, the mere statement in the law itself as to the reasonableness of its provisions, does not make them so, but that is a question to be decided sometimes by the Court and sometimes by a jury. Whether or not the business of a fire insurance company is affected with a public interest is not an open question in this state. In McCarter, Attorney General v. Firemen's Ins. Co., 74 Eq. page 372 at page 383 (73 A. 80, 414, 29 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1194, 135 Am. St. Rep. 708, 18 Ann. Cas. 1048), our Court of Errors and Appeals said, 'The business of the defendants (insurance companies) is in point of fact one that directly affects the interests of the public, and such public interest has been recognized as a subsisting one by the Legislature of this State, and that in point of law, the business of the defendants is affected with a public interest.'\n'If the regulations prescribed are reasonable, they are valid. Our statute provides that the rates for fire insurance 'shall be reasonable.' Since the commissions paid to local agents naturally enter into the cost of such insurance to the public, and therefore influence the rates which must be charged to the public for such insurance, it is within the police power of the State to require that the commissions must be reasonable, otherwise such large commissions might be allowed as to impair the financial stability of the insurance companies, and thus imperil their ability to meet their financial obligations to their policy holders.\n\n'Since twenty per cent. is the amount of commissions paid to some of its local agents, the effect of this legislation is to determine that a commission in excess of that is \n\n[282 U.S. 251, 265]\n\u00a0\n unreasonable. The presumption is in favor of the reasonableness of the law until the contrary is made to appear.\n\n'In the facts or arguments, there is nothing to overcome that presumption, and therefore the answers should not be stricken out as an unlawful deprivation of the plaintiff of his property without due process of law.'\n\n The Court of Errors and Appeals affirmed the questioned judgment (105 N. J. Law, 642, 146 A. 370, 372) 'for the reasons expressed in the opinion by Judge Dungan in the circuit court.'\n The matter for our consideration comes to this: A foreign insurance company, licensed to operate in New Jersey, employed an agent and agreed to pay reasonable compensation. The agent demanded 25 per cent. of the premiums collected. The company paid 20 per cent. of these and successfully resisted the claim for more upon the sole ground that 'since twenty per cent. is the amount of commissions paid to some of its local agents, the effect of this legislation (Act March 29, 1928) is to determine that a comis sion in excess of that is unreasonable.' Abstractly stated, the principal paid 'A' commissions at the rate of 20 per cent.; therefore, it has been held, solely because of the Act nothing above 20 per cent. can be recovered by 'B,' who claims under a contract fair on its face and not expressly inhibited, which definitely provides for reasonable compensation.\n It cannot rightly be said that the burden of establishing any underlying disputable fact rests upon the appellant before it can successfully challenge the validity of the questioned enactment. This is not a proceeding to enjoin enforcement of a statute because of alleged discrimination or other circumstance, the existence of which requires consideration of facts not known to the court. Opinions in cases of that character are not in point. The court below \n\n[282 U.S. 251, 266]\n\u00a0\n ruled, in effect, that without regard to any evidence which might be presented the complainant, although relying upon a contract fair upon its face, could recover nothing above the rate allowed to another agent-that the statute restricted the right to contract for services for reasonable compensation. And we must determine whether thus construed, and in the absence of any emergency, the statute necessarily conflicts with the Fourteenth Amendment. Is such legislation permissible in the ordinary circumstances of which the court must take judicial notice?\n Under German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Superintendent of Ins. of State of Kansas, \n233 \nU.S. 389\n, 34 S. Ct. 612, 617, L. R. A. 1915C, 1189, the appellant does not deny that because of the public interest involved reasonable rates for issuing fire insurance policies may be fixed by statute. But that decision 'marks the extreme limit to which this court thus far has gone in sustaining price fixing legislation.' Tyson & Bro. v. Banton, \n273 \nU.S. 418, 434\n, 47 S. Ct. 426, 429, 58 A. L. R. 1236\n\n\n The German Alliance Company questioned the validity of an order by the Superintendent of Insurance of Kansas which undertook to reduce its duly announced basic schedule of rates. The definite point for decision was thus stated: 'Whether a contract of fire insurance is private, and as such has constitutional immunity from regulation. Or, to state it differently and to express an antithetical proposition, is the business of insurance so far affected with a public interest as to justify legislative regulation of its rates? And we mean a broad and definite public interest.' An affirmative answer followed.\n The decision is authoritative as to the point so ruled, but not otherwise. Nothing there determined would permit regulation of all the undertakings of an insurance company. Here we are not dealing directly with a contract to insure. And certainly it does not follow that because the State has power to regulate the rate for insur- \n\n[282 U.S. 251, 267]\n\u00a0\n ance she may control every agreement having any possible relation thereto.\n The public has no direct, immediate interest in the agency contract here set up. Its concern is with rates. Like any other expense item brokers' commissions may ultimately affect the rate charged for policies; but this is true of the wages of office boys, printers, bookkeepers, actuaries, officers; the price paid for pens, ink, or other supplies- indeed, whatever expense may be incurred. Broadly speaking the funds of an insurance company come from premiums collected; and necessarily all disbursements are made therefrom and therefore in some sense may be said to affect the necessary rate of charge.\n The State may not permit a foreign insurance company to do business within her limits upon condition that it shall submit to deprivation of rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S. Ct. 190; Hanover Ins. Co. v. Harding, \n272 \nU.S. 494, 508\n, 47 S. Ct. 179, 49 A. L. R. 713.\n This Court has steadfastly upheld the general right to enter into private contract and has definitely disapproved attempts to fix prices by legislative fiat. 'Freedomof contract is, nevertheless, the general rule and restraint the exception, and the exercise of legislative authority to abridge it can be justified only by the existence of exceptional circumstances.' 'That the right to contract about one's affairs is a part of the liberty of the individual protected by this clause (of the Fourteenth Amendment), is settled by the decisions of this court and is no longer open to question.'

Banton, supra; Ribnik v. McBride, \n277 \nU.S. 350\n, 48 S. Ct. 545, 56 A. L. R. 1327; Liggett Co. v. Baldridge, \n278 \nU.S. 105, 111\n, 49 S. Ct. 57.\n Also it must be accepted as settled that the right to regulate a business does not necessarily imply power to fix the scale for services therein, or to trespass on the duties of private management. Adams v. Tanner, supra; Truax v. Corrigan, supra; Tyson & Bro. v. Banton, supra; Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 276, 289\n, 43 S. Ct. 544, 31 A. L. R. 807; Wolff Co. v. Industrial Court, supra.\n Even if it be admitted that the power of the legislature to establish reasonable rates for insurance necessarily presupposes existence of the right to command or inhibit what is essential to the accomplishment of that end, certainly this implied right extends to nothing which does not clearly appear to be necessary for such purpose.\n The statute under review does not prescribe a schedule of rates or point out the basis for determination of reasonable rates; it leaves with each company the primary right and duty of deciding upon rates to be demanded. But it inhibits payment to any agent, irrespective of the worth of his services and without regard to any contract with him, of anything in excess of what may be actually paid to another agent. As construed, it declares that the smallest compensation voluntarily paid to any agent shall thereby become reasonable for every other agent. And it permits an agent who has been paid according to his agreement to recover more if he can show that some other agent has received greater compensation.\n The objections to the statute, no extraordinary conditions having been disclosed by the defendant, should be obvious. It goes far beyond the mere regulation of the business of insurance and interferes directly with the right of insurers to control the conduct of their internal affairs; it restricts the right of both company and agent to make reasonable private agreements in respect of com- \n\n[282 U.S. 251, 269]\n\u00a0\n pensation for ordinary services; and the restrictions have no immediate or necessary relation to the maintenance of insurance rates fair to the public.\n The difference between regulation and management is pointed out in the cases cited above. Congress has power, for example, to regulate interstate commerce; but generally, at least, it may not say what shall be paid to employees or interfere with the freedom of the parties to contract in respect of wages. This was distinctly pointed out in Wilson v. New, \n243 \nU.S. 332, 347\n, 37 S. Ct. 298, 301, L. R. A. 1917E, 938, Ann. Cas. 1918A 1024: 'It is also equally true that as the right of fix by agreement between the carrier and its employees a standard of wages to control their relations is primarily private, the establishment and giving effect to such agreed-on standard is not subject to be controlled or prevented by public authority.'\n In order to justify the denial of the right to make private contracts, some special circumstances sufficient to indicate the necessity therefor must be shown by the party relying upon the denial. Here the right freely to agree upon reasonable compensation has been abridged; and no special circumstances demanding such action have been disclosed. Under the construction placed upon the statute no agent can make an enforcible agreement with an insurance company definitely fixing his compensation. Always the company can defeat his claim for the agreed amount, reasonable in fact, by paying less to another agent.\n The inability of the company to make enforcible agreements with necessary agents has no appreciable relation to fair rates. One agent's efforts often produce much more valuable results than those of another. Such interference with the freedom of the parties hinders the proper conduct of the business and may ultimately cause increased rates. The statute prescribes no definite rate of compensation; under it no two companies are required to pay \n\n[282 U.S. 251, 270]\n\u00a0\n at the same rate for like services in the same locality; and competition for business is necessarily abridged. And in order to operate at all at some points the insurer may find it necessary to pay agents much more than prudent management would require, and beyond the real value of their services at such places.\n Although agents are usually paid a specified percentage of premiums collected, the statute is not limited to that situation. Certainly we cannot say that exercise by the companies of the ordinary right freely to contract touching compensation for services will tend materially to interfere with reasonable rates for insurance. Rates constitute the matter of public concern, not the compensation of employees or representatives which is after all only an item of expense. And so far as we can see this legislation will afford no protection to those who wish to insure.\n The statute before us goes far beyond the usual provisions of state laws concerning the insurance business. We are advised that a similar one was enacted by the State of Mississippi in 1924 and by the State of Louisiana in 1926. Diligent counsel have disclosed no others. The restrictions are novel and lack the sanction of general assent and practical experience.\n In our view the statute is arbitrary, unreasonable and beyond the power of the legislature. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It is the settled practice in New Jersey that where the subject regulated is properly within the scope of the police power of the State, a charge of discrimination or lack of reasonable relation between the object of the act and the means employed, must be supported by facts in the record sufficient to overcome the general presumption of constitutionality.

THE NIDARHOLM(1931)\nNo. 58\nArgued: January 20, 1931Decided: February 24, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 681, 682]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Lowrance, of Boston, Mass., and Nathan W. Thompson, of Portland, Me., for petitioner.\n Mr. Robert E. Goodwin, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, charterer of the steamship Nidarholm, brought this admiralty suit in rem in the District Court for Southern Maine, to recover damages for the loss of part of a cargo of pulpwood from the deck of the vessel, where it had been stowed by the charterer. The time charter party, which was in the usual 'government form,' see Golcar S. S. Co. v. Tweedie Trading Co. (D. C.) 146 F. 563, placed at the charterer's disposal 'the whole reach of the vessel's holds, decks and usual places of loading,' and provided that 'charterers ... load, stow, and trim the cargo at their expense under the supervision of the captain.' The question was whether, under these clauses of the charter party, the ship was liable for the loss, although one of its causes was the failure of the charterer to make the deck load secure. Judgment for the libelant, petitioner here, in the District Court, 26 F.(2d) 92, was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which divided the loss, 34 F.(2d) 442, rehearing denied (C. C. A.) 36 F.(2d) 227. This Court granted certiorari, \n281 \nU.S. 712\n, 50 S. Ct. 350, on a petition which relied in part on an alleged conflict of the decision below with that of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Olsen v. United States Shipping Co., 213 F. 18.\n The District Court found the facts as follows: The Nidarholm was chartered by petitioner for the purpose of carrying pulpwood from its plant at Murray, Nova Scotia, to Portland, Me. In loading for the voyage in ques- \n\n[282 U.S. 681, 683]\n\u00a0\n tion, petitioner, after the hold was filled, piled the logs of pulpwood, cut in 2-foot lengths, on the deck to a height of 17 feet. The deck load was secured by a crib, which petitioner constructed by erecting, at intervals along the rail, stanchions about 20 feet long and from 8 to 10 inches in diameter at the butt. The stanchions were held in position by wire rope lashings. When the ship backed from the dock, she had a list to starboard of about 5 degrees; but as she proceeded on her voyage, the list shifted to the port side, and increased to between 10 and 14 degrees. Within a half hour of her departure, and while she was still in smooth water, the stanchions broke, first on the port side, then on the starboard; and the deck load above the rails spiled into the sea. The court concluded that faulty stowage of the deck load had rendered the ship topheavy and unseaworthy, and held that, since this was a breach of the duty to supervise loading which the charter party had placed on the captain, the ship was responsible for the loss.\n The Court of Appeals accepted the District Court's finding that the ship was topheavy and unseaworthy because of improper loading, and its conclusion that this was a fault for which the master was responsible, but stated that the question was whether the charterer was also at fault. It pointed out that the cribbing was no part of the equipment which the vessel was under an obligation to furnish; that the charterer had erected it and chosen the material of which it was constructed; and that all the stanchions gave way at a time when the stress caused by the list of the ship was less than that which would be occasioned by the normal roll of the vessel at sea. These findings are supported by evidence.\n Whether the court considered the topheaviness of the ship, caused by the faulty stowage, and the defective cribbing to be joint contributing causes of the loss, or thought the latter the proximate cause, is not clear. But \n\n[282 U.S. 681, 684]\n\u00a0\n it reached the conclusion, without referring to any supporting facts, that the construction of the cribbing was a joint undertaking carried out by the charterer and the vessel, for the failure of which both were at fault, and decreed that the loss be divided.\n As respondent did not ask certiorari, the only question we shall consider  w hether the court below was wrong in denying the asserted liability of the ship for the entire loss. Warner Co. v. Pier Co., \n278 \nU.S. 85, 91\n, 49 S. Ct. 45.\n By the terms of the charter party there was an affirmative warranty of seaworthiness on the part of the vessel which would otherwise have been implied. The Caledonia, \n157 \nU.S. 124, 130\n, 131 S., 15 S. Ct. 537. This warranty extends to unseaworthiness of the ship due to faulty stowage of cargo, Corsar v. Spreckels (C. C. A.) 141 F. 260, even though the charterer himself, subject to supervision of the captain, loads the vessel, The Seguranca (C. C. A.) 250 F. 19. The charterer is entitled to rely on the master, in the exercise of his expert knowledge and judgment, to control the disposal of cargo so as to avoid dangers to it from any consequent unseaworthiness of the vessel. Olsen v. United States Shipping Co., supra; The Oakley C. Curtis (C. C. A.) 4 F.(2d) 979, certiorari denied \n267 \nU.S. 599\n, 45 S. Ct. 354; The Dana (D. C.) 190 F. 650; cf. Corsar v. Spreckels, supra; The Thames (C. C. A.) 61 F. 1014\n\n\n Respondent argues that the responsibility of the ship, when loaded by the charterer, is limited to faulty stowage of cargo which endangers the ship, and that when the cargo alone is imperiled, as is contended was the case here, ensuing loss must be borne by the charterer. See Elder & Dempster Co. v. Paterson, Zochonis & Co., (1924) A. C. 522, 560-562; Reed & Co. v. Page, Son & East, (1927) 1 K. B. 743, 754-756; cf. The Oakley C. Curtis, supra, page 981 of 4 F.(2d).\n We are not aware of any case in which the rule thus broadly stated has been applied so as to relieve the ship \n\n[282 U.S. 681, 685]\n\u00a0\n from liability for damage to cargo exposed, by bad stowage, to sea perils peculiarly within the specialized knowledge and experience of the master. But it is unnecessary to pass on the question here, for, independently of it, we think the ship cannot be held responsible for the loss imposed on petitioner by the decree below.\n Whether or not the topheaviness of the Nidarholm be taken to have contributed to the loss, the collapse of the stanchions was also a contributing cause; and for the latter petitioner is responsible, at least to the extent of the one-half of the damage imposed on it below, unless there was a duty on the ship to guard against the defective construction of the cribbing.\n The owner's duty to provide a seaworthy and cargo-worthy ship at the beginning of the voyage did not extend to the defective cribbing. That warranty applies only to the ship and such equipment as is called for by the charter party. Cf. The Santona (D. C.) 152 F. 516, 518. The cribbing was an enlargement of the ship's structural capacity for cargo beyond what she would otherwise naturally and reasonably take, which the vessel was not required to provide, and which was constructed by the charterer for its own convenience, to facilitate its stowage of cargo. The ship owed no duty to furnish the cribbing such as would relieve the charterer from the consequences of the failure to make it safe.\n Even though the master's duty of supervision of cargo stowage might, for some purposes and under other circumstances, be deemed to extend to the erection of this structure as a means of stowing the deck load, still we think there was no duty of ship or master to prevent the charterer from loading the pulpwood in such manner as to expose it to dangers ordinarily incident to the transportation of a cargo on deck, and not peculiarly within the prevision of the master. See Lawrence v. Minturn, 17 How. 100, 115. The charterer knew, as well as the \n\n[282 U.S. 681, 686]\n\u00a0\n master, that the ship would heel or roll at sea, and that the cribbing must be made sufficiently strong to hold the cargo on deck. We see no more reason for imposing responsibility on the ship for such an omission by the charterer than for the master's failure to prevent the charterer from stowing cargo in such manner that it is damaged by heat, The Thomas P. Beal (C. C. A.) 11 F.2d) 49; or in defective containers, The Oakley C. Curtis, supra, page 982 of 4 F.(2d); or in such contact with other cargo that it suffers injury, cf. Elder & Dempster Co. v. Paterson, Zochonis & Co., supra. See, also, Lawrence v. Minturn, supra.\n In the cases particularly relied upon by petitioner, the sole cause of the loss appears to have been the unseaworthiness of the ship. See The Seguranca, and The Dana, both supra. This was also the case with the part of the deck load of logs in Olsen v. United States Shipping Co., supra, jettisoned by the master to avoid danger to the ship, which, due to the excessive deck load, had listed 24 degrees, although no heavy weather had been encountered. Another part of the cargo of logs had been loaded by the charterer on the forward deck. As the loading was not completed until dark, the crew did not lash these logs, as they had those on the after deck. This part of the cargo spilled overboard when the master moved the ship without lashing the deck load. The court held the vessel liable, saying that she '... was unseaworthy as to her forward deck load, a thing which it was the duty of the master to prevent.' But it did not appear that the charterer had assumed any duty of lashing the deck loads; and it is evident that the moving of the vessel before the logs were lashed, ready for the voyage, exposed them, by act of the master, to a peril within his knowledge and control. The case is thus distinguishable from the present, where the erection of the defective stanchions was the charterer's act, and where it does not appear that the defect was known to the master.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","114":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPAGEL v.

Putnam and Orin M. Oulman, both of Minneapolis, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case certiorari was granted, \n282 \nU.S. 819\n, 51 S. Ct. 25, 75 L. Ed. -, October 13, 1930, to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota, 179 Minn. 402, 229 N. W. 344, awarding to respondent's \n\n[283 U.S. 266, 267]\n\u00a0\n interstate the proceeds of war risk insurance issued to petitioner's interstate. The insured designated, as beneficiary, his father, who survived him, but who has since died. The insured was also survived by him mother, respondent's intestate, and by brother and sisters.\n The installments of insurance, as they fell due, were paid to the father until his death, when the value of the remaining installments was paid to petitioner, in accordance with section 303 of the World War Veterans' Act of June 7, 1924, 43 Stat. 625, as amended by the Act of March 4, 1925, 43 Stat. 1310 (38 USCA  514) which provides:\n'If no person within the permitted class be designated as beneficiary ... by the insured either in his lifetime or by his last will and testament or if the designated beneficiary does not survive the insured or survives the insured and dies prior to receiving all ... installments ... there shall be paid to the estate of the insured the present value of the ... installments thereafter payable. ...'\n\n Section 300 (38 USCA  511) declares that it is the policy ofthe act to afford to commissioned officers and enlisted men 'protection for themselves and their dependents,' and provides that 'the insurance shall be payable only to a spouse, child, grandchild, parent, brother (or) sister. ...' Section 22 (38 USCA  454) states that the 'insurance ... payable ... shall not be subject to the claims of creditors of any person to whom an award is made. ...' The insurance certificate, in accordance with section 402 of the Act of October 6, 1917, 40 Stat. 409, under which it was issued, stipulated that, in the contingency which has arisen, the insurance should be paid to such members of the permitted class as would be entitled to the personal property of insured under the intestacy laws of the state of his residence, and that it should not be 'subject to the claims of the creditors of the insured or of the beneficiaries.'\n The question presented on this record and decided by the state court was whether, under the provisions of the \n\n[283 U.S. 266, 268]\n\u00a0\n act and of the certificate of insurance, the administrator of the insured received the insurance as an asset of the estate subject to payment of debts and administration expenses, or as trustee for the benefit of such of the surviving members of 'the permitted class' of beneficiaries as would be entitled to decedent's personal property under the laws of Minnesota, where he resided. The court held that, despite the difference in language between section 303 and its earlier forms, section 402, Act of October 6, 1917, supra; section 15, Act of December 24, 1919, 41 Stat. 376, the members of the permitted class were to be preferred over creditors of the insured, and directed judgment for payment of the insurance to the mother, as the only person in the permitted class entitled to take the personal property of insured under the intestacy laws of the state.\n Pending the application for certiorari, the mother died, and the suit was revived, after certiorari was granted, by substitution of her administrator as respondent. By reason of her decease, the question whether the mother alone of the permitted class is entitled to receive the proceeds of the insurance, in preference to the creditors of the insured, presented by the record and decided by the state court, has now become subsidiary to other questions, the determination of which is necessary to the disposition of the present suit and may render unnecessary and adjudication of the rights of the mother. Assuming, as the state court held, that the mother was entitled to the insurance in her lifetime, it does not follow that respondent, by virtue of his office as administrator, or claiming in the mother's right, is entitled to payment of the insurance under the judgment in her favor. That depends on the interpretation of section 300, directing that the insurance 'shall be payable only' to members of the permitted class, and on the question whether, under the provisions of the act and of the certificate, the insurance should now go to the estate of the mother, to the creditors of the insured, or \n\n[283 U.S. 266, 269]\n\u00a0\n to the surviving brothers and sisters, if any, none of whom is a party to this suit. That question was not decided by the state court, for the review of whose judgment certiorari was granted, and is not one which can be disposed of on this record.\n While, in such a situation, the writ may be dismissed, see Kimball v. Kimball, 174 U. S., 158, 19 S. Ct. 639, the present is not a proper case for such disposition, which might leave the judgment to be enforced by the respondent administrator without determination of his rights. In order that the state court may be free to deal adequately with the questions which must be determined in order to make appropriate distribution of the fund involved, the judgment will be vacated and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

Bakewell, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Charles L. Byron and George L. Wilkinson, both of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the court.\n The Permutit Company is the owner of Gans patent No. 1,195,923, for an apparatus for softening water, applied for August 5, 1911, and granted August 22, 1916. It brought, on February 23, 1928, this suit in the federal court for northern Illinois, against Graver Corporation to enjoin infringement of claims 1 and 5. The defendant denied both the validity of the patent and the infringement. The District Court held both claims invalid, 37 F.(2d) 385. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed that decision; and also held that the \n\n[284 U.S. 52, 54]\n\u00a0\n defendant's 'presently used structures' do not infringe calim 5, 43 F.(2d) 898. Certiorari was granted (\n283 \nU.S. 812\n, 51 S. Ct. 345), because of conflict with earlier decisions in other circuits. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n Water is hard because it contains the salts of calcium and magnesium. It may be softented by distillation or by adding to the water certain other chemicals through which the hardening constituents in solution are changed to an insoluble form and precipitated. Such softening may also be effected by the use of zeolite, a hydrated alumino-silicate found in nature. When hard water is passed through zeolites, they give up their sodium to the water, and take from it the calcium and magnesium as a new base. Zeolites have the peculiar quality that, after becoming exhausted in such use, they may be regenerated by passing a solution of common salt through them, whereupon they give up their new base of calcium and magnesium and take back their sodium base. They retain indefinitely these valuable properties.\n The chemical attributes of zeolites, and their effect upon hard water, had been known long before the application for the patent in suit. But zeolites were not employed commercially as a water softener because, as then found in nature, they were ill adapted for use in filters, and the expense of mining them was large. Gans invented a process for producing artificial zeolites, and a process of softening water by means of them. The United States patents issued for those inventions had expired before \n\n[284 U.S. 52, 55]\n\u00a0\n the commencement of this suit, which is upon a patent for an apparatus 'in which the zeolites or alumino-silicates can be used in a filter and be regenerated therein so as to be capable of continuous use for the softening of water.' The essential elements of the water softening process in which this apparatus is employed are the passage of water through zeolites, their regeneration by recharging them with the sodium chloride solution, and the rinsing of them thereafter, so that no noticeable tinge of salt will be found in the filtered water. A drawing was attached to the specification as an example of a filter provided according to the invention claimed.\n As described in the specification, the apparatus consists of a cylindrical container within which are 'a number of horizontally disposed perforated plates.' Near the bottom is one upon which rests a layer of sand (or quartz). This supports a bed of zeolites. At some distance above the zeolites is another perforated bed of sand 'through which the water to be softened may be first filtered.' There are piping connections so that the hard water may be run into the casing through the zeolite bed and out to the soft water service line. The chamber is also provided with means for cutting off the hard water and introducing a flow of salt water to regenerate the zeolites; and with means for washing out of the container the contaminated brine and any accumulated dirt. As so constructed, the filter may operate by letting the hard water flow either downward through the upper sand bed to the zeolites or upward to them through the lower sand bed. On March 2, 1920, The Permutit Company disclaimed from the scope of claim 1 any apparatus 'in which the water to be softened is so introduced into the casing that it passes upwardly through said layer of zeolites.' It is conceded that Graver Corporation's 1927 type of water softener does not infringe claim 1, as in it the water passes up- \n\n[284 U.S. 52, 56]\n\u00a0\n ward. The specification also describes, and the drawing indicates, a modified form of apparatus provided with means for stirring the zeolites in washing. No stirrer is employed in the defendants' apparatus.\n First. The apparatus described in the specification closely resmebles sand filters long used. The elements enumerated above, alone and in combination, are confessedly old. The only invention seriously urged under claim 1 is the substitution of a 'free' for a 'locked' zeolite bed; a matter which is not referred to either in the specification or in the claim. In earlier filters, the zeolites had been held in place by locking the bed; that is, by placing a metal screen either immediately over the layer of zeolites or over a layer of burlap or excelsior resting upon them. The occasion for a screen is that zeolite grains are lighter than the sand and gravel on which they rest. In flowing the water or the regenerating solution upward through the zeolite bed in an upflow softener, or in backwashing the zeolites in a downflow softener for the purpose of cleansing them of accumulated slime and dirt, the lighter grains may be washed out through the flow pipe, unless impeded in some way. Gans is alleged to have discovered that a locked zeolite bed is erratic in action and will soon cease to give soft water; that through such a bed the hard water will flow unevenly; that preferred channels of flow will form; that the zeolites contiguous to them will be speedily exhausted and the hard water will pass through unaffected, although the great mass of zeolite material remains unexhausted; and that it is necessary to have an open space above the top of the zeolites in order to furnish opportunity for the zeolites to rise or boil, and to spread out and reform in the bed. The invention relied upon consists in removing the close fitting cover from the zeolite bed and in providing ade- \n\n[284 U.S. 52, 57]\n\u00a0\n quate rising space by placing the screen at some distance above the top of the layer of zeolites.\n We have no occasion to consider whether this alleged Gans invention of a 'free' zeolite bed rises to the dignity of invention or whether, as Graver Corporation contends,2 it lacked novelty, and was anticipated by earlier apparatus and publications; defenses to which the evidence, the briefs, and the oral arguments were mainly directed. For even if a patent for a 'free' bed might have been valid, that sued on is invalid for lack of the disclosure prescribed by Rev. St.  4888 (35 USCA  33).3 There is no mention in the specification of either a 'free' or a 'locked' zeolite bed; or of the alleged discovery that a rising space above the zeolite bed is necessary for the successful operation of the softener; or of the need of a device to prevent the lighter grains of zeolite from passing out in backwashing. Nor does claim 1 or claim 5 make mention of a 'free' zeolite bed. Claim 1 is for 'a filter bed consisting of a layer of sand or quartz and a layer of zeolites or hydrated alumino-silicates disposed on the layer of sand or quartz.' \n4\n Claim \n\n[284 U.S. 52, 58]\n\u00a0\n 5 for 'a filter bed consisting of a layer of zeolites or alumino-silicates, supporting means for said layer.' \n5\n As the patentee has thus failed to give in the specification 'a written description' and has likewise failed particularly to point out and distinctly claim the free zeolite bed, as 'the part, improvement, or combination which he claims as his invention or discovery,' the patent is void.\n The question of compliance with the requirement of disclosure laid down by section 4888 was not adverted to in either opinion of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals sustaining the validity of the patent, 279 F. 713, 22 F.(2d) 916; 6 nor was it called to the attention of this court, which denied certiorari in the first case in \n259 \nU.S. 588\n, 42 S. Ct. 590. In those cases, both of the district courts seem to have thought that the free surface of the zeolites was indicated by the attached drawing, and to have deemed such indication sufficient, although the matter was nowhere mentioned in the description or claims 274 F. 937, 942; 292 F. 239, 240. The opinion in the second case added that this feafure was necessarily 'presupposed' in the stirring device mentioned in the description as 'advantageous' and included in other claims not now in suit, and that it was 'involved' in the absence from claims 1 and 5 of any upper sand filter. These con- \n\n[284 U.S. 52, 59]\n\u00a0\n clusions were adopted by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,7 which invoked the doctrine that 'if the specifications and drawings of a patent show a structure cleraly involving a certain theory of operation, it is not necessary that the patentee should expressly describe this theory, nor indeed that he should at that time clearly understand it.'\n We think that these views rest upon misconception. The absence in the claims of a sand bed placed above the zeolites does not imply that the zeolite bed is to be unconfined. The only normal inference from such silence is either that it was deemed immaterial whether the zeolite bed be locked or free, or that, if a free bed is preferable, it was not claimed because it lacked novelty. The drawing annexed to the specification, it is true, shows a layer of sand or quartz at a point above the zeolites and an unoccupied space between it and the top of the zeolite bed. But there is no suggestion on the drawing or elsewhere that the upper plate bearing the layer of sand or quartz has any purpose except to serve as a mechanical filter through which 'the water to be softened may be first filtered,' or that the unoccupied space has any other purpose than that of similar spaces in sand filters long \n\n[284 U.S. 52, 60]\n\u00a0\n familiar. \n8\n Moreover, while drawings may be referred to for illustration and may be used as an aid in interpreting the specification or claim, they are of no avail where there is an entire absence of description of the alleged invention, or a failure to claim it. 9 The statute requires the patentee not only to explain the principle of his apparatus and to describe it in such terms that any person skilled in the art to which it appertains may construct and use it after the expiration of the patent, but also to inform the public during the life of the patent of the limits of the monopoly asserted, so that it may be known which features may be safely used or manufactured without a license and which may not. \n10\n The free bed was neither described in the specification nor claimed in either claim 1 or claim 5.11\n Second. The further contention is that claim 5 can be sustained on the ground that in providing for 'means connected to the lowest point of the casing for removing the salt solution,' it introduced a novel element constituting invention. The only novelty suggested is that of placing the means at the lowest point of the casing. It does not require the exercise of the inventive faculty to place at the bottom of a receptacle the outlet through which it is to be drained, Smith, Adm'x, v.

Water softening apparatus comprising a casing, a filter bed consisting of a layer of zeolites or alumino-silicates, supporting means for said layer, means for permitting the passage of water through the casing, means for cutting off the supply of water on the exhaustion of the zeolites, means for supplying and passing into the casing a solution of a salt capable of regenerating zeolites and means connected to the lowest point of the casing for removing the salt solution so introduced.' \n[\nFootnote 6\n] In 22 F.(2d) 916, 918, the court, in rejecting a defense of anticipation by a German Gebrauchmuster, stated that the earlier patentee did not have in mind backwashing to which Gans referred in his specification. This was not said, however, in reference to the question of the adequacy of Gans' disclosure. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The court said: 'The specification and drawing provide for the occasional descent into the zeolite bed from above of a revolving stirrer, and this makes it clear that the top of the zeolite must be free and unconfined, under the contemplation of these claims, like 1 and 5, which do not imply the nonuse of the stirrer.' 13 F.(2d) 454, 458. On the contrary, the drawing shows that a vertical movement of the stirrer was not contemplated, and that the arrangement of shaft and gear would prevent it. Moreover, the stirrer was not an element in the combination claimed. It was not even an element in the filter shown in the drawing and referred to in the specification 'by way of example.' The specification states: 'Fig. 2 is a similar, but fragmental view of a modification carrying a stirring device; Fig. 3 is a horizontal section of the same.' Nor would the presence of the stirrer in any event be inconsistent with a confined bed.

He is a native of Greece; shipped from that country as a seaman and arrived at New York on September 10, 1925, when he deserted, and has remained in this country ever since, that is, for more than three years before the arrest. He sued out a writ of habeas corpus, setting up the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, c. 29,  34, 39 Stat. 874, 896 (8 USCA  166), as a statute of limitation entitling him to remain. The writ was ordered to be dismissed by the District Court and the order was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 37 F.(2d) 1015, citing United States ex rel. Piccolella v. Commissioner of Immigration (C. C. A.) 36 F.( 2d) 1022, which in turn cites United States ex rel. Rios v. Day (C. C. A.) 24 F.(2d) 654. A contrary decision was reached by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Carr, Director of Immigration v. Zaja, 37 F.(2d) 1016, and writs of certiorari were granted by this Court. \n282 \nU.S. 816\n, 51 S. Ct. 22, 75 L. Ed. -.\n Section 34 of the act of 1917 provides that 'any alien seaman who shall land in a port of the United States contrary to the provisions of this Act shall be deemed to be unlawfully in the United States, and shall, at any time \n\n[283 U.S. 48, 50]\n\u00a0\n within three years thereafter, ... be taken into custody' and upon the conditions there stated shall be deported. It may be assumed that under this statute the time within which a seaman can be arrested for deportation is limited to three years from the date of entry. But by the Immigration Act of May 26, 1924, c. 190,  14, 43 Stat. 153, 162 (8 USCA  214). 'Any alien who at any time after entering the United States is found to have been at the time of entry not entitled under this Act to enter the United States, or to have remained therein for a longer time than permitted under this Act, or regulations made thereunder,' is to be deported in the same manner as provided for in sections 19, 20, of the Immigration Act of 1917 (8 USCA  155, 156). It is argued elaborately for the petitioner and is conceded by the Government that section 34 of the earlier act is not repealed by the later one. See section 25 of the latter ( 8 USCA  223). For the purposes of this case we may assume this to be true, and that in accordance with this section 25, the earlier act section 34 is in force if not inapplicable. But we cannot accept the conclusion that deserting alien seamen are thereby made a favored class to be retained in this country when other aliens would be compelled to leave. 'Any alien' in section 14 of the act of 1924 includes alien seamen on its face and by the definition in section 28, Id. (8 USCA  224). It is obvious that thepet itioner, whether he entered rightfully or wrongfully, remained in the United States longer than he was permitted to by the law. He deserted after the act of 1924 was in effect. The regulations under sections 15 and 19 of the act of 1924 (8 USCA  166, 215) allowed only sixty days to alien seamen permitted to enter. If he entered without permission he was not entitled to more. It seems to us too clear to need argument that the limitation of three years in section 34 of the act of 1917 does not override or qualify the clear and definite terms of section 14 of the act of 1924. Those terms must prevail. Zurbrick v. Traicoff (C. C. A.) 38 F.( 2d) 811; United States ex rel. Cateches v. Day (C. C.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1931)\nNo. 455\nArgued: April 23, 1931Decided: May 25, 1931\n\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 589, 591]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Elkan Turk, of New York City, for petitioners.\n The Attorney General and Mr. G. A. Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1919, the Coombe Garment Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, distributed all of its assets among its stockholders, and then dissolved. Thereafter, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue made deficiency assessments against it for income and profits taxes for the years 1918 and 1919. A small part of these assessments was collected, leaving an unpaid balance of $9,306.36. I. L. Phillips, of New York City, had owned one- fourth of the company's stock and had received $17,139.61 as his distributive dividend. Pursuant to section 280(a) (1) of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 61, 26 USCA  1069(a)(1), the Commissioner sent due notice that he proposed to assess against, and collect from, Phillips the entre r emaining amount of the deficiencies. No notice of such deficiencies was sent \n\n[283 U.S. 589, 592]\n\u00a0\n to any of the other transferees, and no suit or proceedings for collection was instituted against them. Upon petition by Phillips' executors for a redetermination, the Board of Tax Appeals held that the estate was liable for the full amount. 15 B. T. A. 1218. Its order was affirmed by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 42 F.(2d) 177. Because of conflict in the decisions of the lower courts1 a writ of certiorari was granted. \n282 \nU.S. 828\n, 51 S. Ct. 82, 75 L. Ed. -.\n Stockholders who have received the assets of a dissolved corporation may confessedly be compelled, in an appropriate proceeding, to discharge unpaid corporate taxes. Compare Pierce v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 398\n, 41 S. Ct. 365. Before the enactment of section 280(a)(1), such payment by the stockholders could be enforced only by bill in equity or action at law. 2 Section 280(a)(1) provides that the liability of the transferee for such taxes may be enforced in the same manner as that of any delinquent taxpayer. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n The procedure prescribed for collection of the tax from a stockholder is thus the same as that now followed when payment is sought directly from the corporate taxpayer. This procedure is now generally known, and some parts of it will later be considered in detail. As applied directly to the taxpayer, its constitutionality is not now assailed. Compare Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, \n279 \nU.S. 716\n, 49 S. Ct. 499. But it is contended that to apply it to stockholder transferees violates several constitutional guaranties; that \n\n[283 U.S. 589, 593]\n\u00a0\n additional obstacles are encountered if it is applied to transfers made before the enactment of section 280(a)(1); that the specific liability here sought to be enforced is governed by the law of Pennsylvania and barred by its statute of limitations; and that, in no event, can the stockholder be held liable for more than his pro rata share of the unpaid corporate tax.\n First. The contention mainly urged is that the summary procedure permitted by the section violates the Constitution because it does not provide for a judicial determination of the transferee's liability at the outset. The argu- \n\n[283 U.S. 589, 594]\n\u00a0\n ment is that such liability (except where a lien had attached before the transfer) is dependent upon questions of law and fact which have heretofore been adjudicated by courts; that to confer upon the Commissioner power to determine these questions in the first instance offends against the principle of the separation of the powers; and that the inherent denial of due process is not saved by the provisions for deferred review in a suit to recover taxes paid, or, in the alternative, for an immediate appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals with the right to review its determination in the courts, because there are limitations and conditions in either method of judicial review.\n Section 280(a)(1) provides the United States with a new remedy for enforcing the existing 'liability, at law or in equity.' The quoted words are employed in the statute to describe the kind of liability to which the new remedy is to be applied and to define the extent of such liability. The obligation to be enforced is the liability for the tax. Russell v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 181, 186\n, 49 S. Ct. 121; United States v. Updike, \n281 \nU.S. 489, 493\n, 494 S., 50 S. Ct. 367. The proceeding is one to collect the revenue. That Congress deemed the section necessary in order to make the tax-collecting system more effective is established, not only by the fact of enactment, but also by the reports of the committees. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[283 U.S. 589, 595]\n\u00a0\n The right of the United States to collect its internal revenue by summary administrative proceedings has long been settled. \n5\n Where, as here, adequate opportunity is afforded for a later judicial determination of the legal rights, summary proceedings to secure prompt performance of ecun iary obligations to the government have been consistently sustained. Compare Cheatham v. United States, \n92 U.S. 85\n, 88-89; Springer v. United States, \n102 U.S. 586\n, 594; Hagar v. Reclamation District No. 108, \n111 U.S. 701\n, 708-709, 4 S. Ct. 663. Property rights must yield provisionally to governmental need.

This prohibition of injunctive relief is applicable in the case of summary proceedings against a transferee. Act of May 29, 1928, c. 852,  604, 45 Stat. 791, 873 (26 USCA  2604). Proceedings more summary in character than that provided in section 280, and involving less directly the obligation of the taxpayer, were sustained in Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272. It is urged that the decision in the Murray Case was based upon the peculiar relationship of a collector of revenue to his government. The underlying principle in that case was not such relation, but the need of the government promptly to secure its revenues.\n Where only property rights are involved, mere postponement of the judicial enquiry is not a denial of due \n\n[283 U.S. 589, 597]\n\u00a0\n process, if the opportunity given for the ultimate judicial determination of the liability is adequate. Springer v. United States, \n102 U.S. 586\n, 593; Scottish Union & National Insurance Co. v. Bowland, \n196 \nU.S. 611, 631\n, 25 S. Ct. 345. Delay in the judicial determination of property rights is not uncommon where it is essential that governmental needs be immediately satisfied. For the protection of public health, a state may order the summary destruction of property by administrative authorities without antecedent notice of hearing.

Ct. 488.7\n The procedure provided in section 280(a)(1) satisfies the requirements of due process because two alternative methods of eventual judicial review are available to the transferee. He may contest his liability by bringing an action, either against the United States or the collector, to recover the amount paid. This remedy is available where the transferee does not appeal from the determination of \n\n[283 U.S. 589, 598]\n\u00a0\n the Commissioner, and the latter makes an assessment and enforces payment by distraint; or where the transferee voluntarily pays the tax and is thereafter denied administrative relief.

United States, \n277 \nU.S. 551, 560\n, 48 S. Ct. 587. Or the transferee may avail himself of the provisions for immediate redetermination of the liability by the Board of Tax Appeals, since all provisions governing this mode of review are made applicable by section 280. Compare Routzahn v. Tyroler (C. C. A.) 36 F.(2d) 208, 209. Thus within sixty days after the Commissioner determines that the transferee is liable for an unpaid deficiency, and gives due notice thereof, the latter may file a petition with the Board o Tax Appeals. Act of February 26, 1926, c. 27,  274(a), 44 Stat. 9, 55 (26 USCA  1048); Act of May 29, 1928, c. 852,  272(a), 45 Stat. 791, 852 (26 USCA  2272(a). Formal notice of the tax liability is thus given; the Commissioner is required to answer; and there is a complete hearing de novo according to the rules of evidence applicable in courts of equity of the District of Columbia. Act of May 29, 1928, c. 852,  601, 45 Stat. 791, 872 (26 USCA  1217-1219). Compare International Banding Machine Co. v. Commissioner (C. C. A.) 37 F.( 2d) 660. This remedy may be had before payment, without giving bond ( unless the Commissioner in his discretion deems a jeopardy assessment necessary). The transferee has the right to a preliminary examination of books, papers, and other evidence of the taxpayer; and the burden of proof is on the Commissioner to show that the appellant is liable as a transferee of property, though not to show that the taxpayer was liable for the tax. Act of May 29, 1928, c. 852,  602, 45 Stat. 791, 873 (26 USCA  1229, 1230).8 A review by the Circuit Court of Appeals of an adverse determination may be had; and assess- \n\n[283 U.S. 589, 599]\n\u00a0\n ment and collection meanwhile may be stayed by giving a bond to secure payment. Act of February 26, 1926, c. 27,  1001, 44 Stat. 9, 109 (26 USCA  1224 and note); Act of May 29, 1928, c. 852,  603, 45 Stat. 791, 873 ( 26 USCA  1224). There may be a further review by this court on certiorari. These provisions amply protect the transferee against improper administrative action. Compare Hurwitz v. North, \n271 \nU.S. 40\n, 46 S. Ct. 384.\n It is argued that such review by the Board of Tax Appeals and Circuit Court of Appeals is constitutionally inadequate because of the conditions and limitations imposed. Specific objection is made to the provision that collection will not be stayed while the case is pending before the Circuit Court of Appeals, unless a bond is filed; and also to the rule under which the Board's findings of fact are treated by that court as final if there is any evidence to support them. \n9\n As to the first of these objections, it has already been shown that the right of the United States to exact immediate payment and to relegate the taxpayer to a suit for recovery is paramount. The privilege of delaying payment pending immediate judicial review, by filing a bond, was granted by the sovereign as a matter of grace solely for the convenience of the tax- \n\n[283 U.S. 589, 600]\n\u00a0\n payer. \n10\n Nor is the second objection of weight. It has long been settled that determinations of fact for ordinary administrative purposes are not subject to review. Johnson v. Drew, \n171 \nU.S. 93, 99\n, 18 S. Ct. 800; Public Clearing House v. Coyne, \n194 \nU.S. 497, 508\n, 24 S. Ct. 789; United States v. Ju Toy, \n198 \nU.S. 253, 263\n, 25 S. Ct. 644; Red 'C' Oil Co. v. North Carolina, \n222 \nU.S. 380, 394\n, 32 S.

Save as there may be an exception for issues presenting claims of constitutional right, such administrative findings on issues of fact are accepted by the court as conclusive if the evidence was legally sufficient to sustain them and there was no irregularity in the proceedings. Reetz v. Michigan, \n188 \nU.S. 505, 507\n, 23 S. Ct. 390; Lieberman v. Van De Carr, \n199 \nU.S. 552, 562\n, 26 S. Ct. 144; Douglas v. Noble, \n261 \nU.S. 165, 167\n, 43 S. Ct. 303; Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 420, 443\n, 50 S. Ct. 220,74 L . Ed. 524.11 The adequacy of the scope of review offered by the Revenue Act of 1926 in the case of a deficiency determined directly against the taxpayer was assumed in Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, \n279 \nU.S. 716\n, 49 S. Ct. 499; and this procedure is now thoroughly established. 12 Questions of fact involved in proceedings against transferees are no different or more complex than those often encountered in determining the direct liability of a tax- \n\n[283 U.S. 589, 601]\n\u00a0\n payer. \n13\n The alternative judicial review provided is adequate in both cases.\n Second. It is urged by amici curize that the method of assessment and collection permitted by section 280(a)(1) cannot be applied where, as in the case at bar, the transfer of assets, upon which the transferee's liability is based, occurred prior to the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1926; and, moreover, that if applied retroactively to such transfer, the section would be unconstitutional. The power of Congress to provide an additional remedy for the enforcement of existing liabilities is clear. Compare Graham & Foster v. Goodcell, \n282 \nU.S. 409, 427\n, 51 S. Ct. 186. It is clear also that Congress intended that the section should be available for enforcing the liability of a transferee in respect to taxes 'imposed ... by any prior income, excess-profits, or War- Profits Tax Act,' irrespective of the time at which the transfer was made. The need for a more effective and expedient remedy was not limited to liabilities of transferees thereafter arising. To have so limited the operation of the section would, at least as to earlier acts, have seriously impaired the value of the new remedy. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n[283 U.S. 589, 602]\n\u00a0\n Third. It is contended that section 280(a)(1) is invalid because the liability at law or in equity of a transferee is dependent upon the law of the state of incorporation, and that thus the section improperly delegates the federal taxing power to the state Legislatures; and, further, that the tax liability of the transferee, as thus assessed and collected, violates the constitutional requirement of uniformity because differences in state laws may affect such liability. The extent and incidence of federal taxes not infrequently are affected by differences in state laws; but such variations do not infringe the constitutional prohibitions against delegation of the taxing power or the requirement of geographical uniformity. Florida v. Mellon, \n273 \nU.S. 12, 17\n, 47 S. Ct. 265; Crooks v. Harrelson, \n282 \nU.S. 55\n, 51 S. Ct. 49; Poe v. Seaborn, \n282 \nU.S. 101, 117\n, 51 S. Ct. 58. Compare Head Money Cases, \n112 \nU.S. 580, 594\n, 5 S. Ct. 247; Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland Railway Co., \n242 \nU.S. 311, 327\n, 37 S. Ct. 180, L. R. A. 1917B, 1218, Ann. Cas. 1917B 845. We have, therefore, no occasion to decide whether the right of the United States to follow transferred assets is limited by any state laws.\n Fourth. It is contended that summary proceeding by the United States to enforce the liability for the tax is barred by the six months' statute of limitations on suits against stockholders provided by the Pennsylvania statute. Laws 1874, c. 32, p. 80,  15 (Penn. Stat. 1920,  5728 (15 PS  352)). The United States is not bound by state statutes of limi- \n\n[283 U.S. 589, 603]\n\u00a0\n tation unless Congress provides that it shall be. United States v. Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. Co., \n118 \nU.S. 120\n, 6 S. Ct. 1006; Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Co., \n250 \nU.S. 123, 125\n, 39 S. Ct. 407; E. I. Dupont de Nemours & Co. v. Davis, \n264 \nU.S. 456, 462\n, 44 S. Ct. 364. The detailed limitation periods specified in section 280 evidence the intention that they alone shall be applicable to the proceedings therein authorized.\n Fifth. It is contended that, even if petitioners are liable, the amount determined is excessive; and that the findings of the Board of Tax Appeals in the present case are insufficient to support an assessment of the entire balance of the deficiencies. It is first urged that the estate of Phillips can be assessed only for its pro rata share of the deficiency, according to the ratio which the stock held by him bore to the total outstanding stock of the corporate taxpayer at the time of dissolution. The argument is that the federal Equity Rules require that all stockholders be brought in as necessary parties and be proportionately subjected to liability. While it is permissible for a respondent to bring in other stockholders or transferees by a cross-bill, 15 this procedure is founded upon the desire not to urde n the courts with a multiplicity of suits. Compare Hatch v. Dana, \n101 U.S. 205\n, 211. Such rule of convenience is not applicable in summary administrative proceedings like that provided by section 280(a)(1). One who receives corporate assets upon dissolution is severally liable, to the extent of assets received, for the payment of taxes of the corporation; and other stockholders or transferees need not be joined. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n[283 U.S. 589, 604]\n\u00a0\n Nonjoinder cannot affect or diminish the several liability of the stockholder or transferee sued. Compare Benton v. American National Bank ( C. C. A.) 276 F. 368.17 The individual several liability of Phillips may be fully enforced by the United States in the present proceeding. Whatever the petitioners' rights to contribution may be against other stockholders who have also received shares of the distributed assets, the government is not required, in collecting its revenue, to marshal the assets of a dissolved corporation so as to adjust the rights of the various stockholders. There is nothing in section 280 to indicate that Congress intended to limit the procedure in this way. And any such requirement would seriously impair the efficiency of the summary method provided.\n Petitioners assert also that the finding of the Board that the total assets of the corporation, amounting to $68,588.35, were paid 'to its stockholders between July 25, 1919 and September 27, 1919,' is insufficient to support the assessment against the estate of the entire remaining deficiency of $9,306.36. The argument is that there may have been several distributions within this period; that since there was no finding as to the existence of other creditors, it must be assumed that, until the assets had been depleted below the amount due for taxes, the corporation was solvent; and that thus the stockholder-transferees did not become liable until the final $9,306.36 of assets was distributed. Hence it is claimed \n\n[283 U.S. 589, 605]\n\u00a0\n that Phillips' liability for the tax is limited to a pro rata share of the assets finally distributed, that is, to one-quarter of the unpaid deficiency. But the plain import of the findings is that there was a single distribution which took several months to complete; and there is no question that the entire assets were thereby distributed. Moreover, such argument, urged for the first time here, comes too late. For while the burden was on the Commissioner to prove before the Board that Phillips was liable as a transferee, the facts in the case at bar were stipulated; and it was agreed that the date of complete liquidation was September 27, 1919, by which time petitioners' decedent had received his full share of the distributed assets. Since it was stipulated that the final transfers of assets were without consideration, that they completely exhausted the corporate assets, that the balance of the deficiencies, assessed against the corporation, remains unpaid, and that the distributive dividend received by Phillips was in excess of the remaining tax liability, the burden resting upon the Commssio ner was sustained.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare Owensboro Ditcher & Grader Co. v.

Moreover, in all cases, an additional period of one year after the expiration of the period for assessing the taxpayer was given. Compare H. R. Rep. No. 356, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., February 22, 1926, p. 44. Subdivision (c) provides that, in the case of corporations which had been dissolved, the period for assessment of the transferee was to be the same as if such 'termination of existence had not occurred.' These provisions clearly contemplated a dissolution and transfer of assets prior to the passage of the act. Compare United States v. Updike, \n281 \nU.S. 489, 494\n, 50 S. Ct. 367. In the case at bar, two assessments against the corporate taxpayer had been made prior to 1926. \n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Compare Equity Rules 25, 39, 42 (28 USCA  723); Watson v.

A jury having been waived, the court found the facts as stipulated and gave judgment against the collector. 30 F.(2d) 395. Upon appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, without deciding the case, certified here the questions involved, and, on joint motion of the parties, this Court ordered up the entire record. Judicial Code  239 (28 USCA  346).\n The only controversy presented relates to taxes levied and collected with respect to thirteen items of property, real and personal, concededly held by decedent and his wife as tenants by the entirety at his death in 1925. The applicable taxing statute is section 302 of the Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 304 (26 USCA  1094 note), which provides that the gross value of the decedent's estate subject to tax shall include all property: '(e) To the extent of the interest therein held as joint tenants by the decedent and any other person, or as tenants by the entirety by the decedent and spouse, or deposited, with any person carrying on the banking business, in their joint names and payable to either or the survivor, except such part thereof as may be shown to have originally belonged to such other person and never to have been received or acquired by the latter from the decedent for less than a fair consideration in money or money's worth. ...' This provision, without any variation of present significance, was in force under the 1916 and successive revenue acts. Section 202, Revenue Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 756, 777, 778; Revenue Act March 3, 1917, 39 Stat. 1000; section 402, Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1057, 1097; section 402, Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 278. \n\n[284 U.S. 160, 165]\n\u00a0\n The thirteen items of property with respect to which the tax was imposed may be classified in three groups: (1) Property held upon tenancies by the entirety created after the effective date of the Revenue Act of 1924; (2) property held upon tenancies by the entirety created after the Revenue Act of 1916 and before the effective date of the Revenue Act of 1924; and (3) bank accounts opened in 1910 in the joint names of decedent and his wife, in which there were deposit balances at the date of his death.\n The District Court accepted the contention of the taxpayer that the nature of the estate by the entirety, and particularly the interest in it of a surviving tenant, are such as to preclude the imposition of death or transfer taxes measured by the value of the interest which ceases at the death of either tenant, and that the tax, if deemed to be upon property, is a direct tax not apportioned, forbidden by article 1,  2, cl. 3, and section 9, cl. 4, of the Constitution. After the decision of the District Court, this contention was considered and rejected by this Court in Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497\n, 50 S. Ct. 356, 69 A. L. R. 758, holding that a like tax imposed under  202(c), Revenue Act of 1916, was a valid indirect tax, measured by the value of the property, rights in which devolved upon the surviving tenant upon the happening of an event, the death of the other tenant by the entirety.\n The controlling force of that decision is acknowledged as to the items of property in group 1, acquired after the passage of the taxing act, and as to them it is conceded that the tax was rightly levied.\n But it is urged that the tax imposed with respect to groups 2 and 3 is invalid. As the creation fo the tenancies by the entirety antedated the taxing act, and the earlier corresponding sections had been repealed, it is insisted that the statute is given a retroactive operation, such as that condemned by this Court in Nichols v. Cool \n\n[284 U.S. 160, 166]\n\u00a0\n idge, \n274 \nU.S. 531\n, 47 S. Ct. 710, 52 A. L. R. 1081; Untermyer v. Anderson, \n276 \nU.S. 440\n, 48 S. Ct. 353; Coolidge v. Long, \n282 \nU.S. 582\n, 51 S. Ct. 306. As section 302(h) of the Act of 1924 (26 USCA  1094 note) specifically makes the quoted provision of subdivision (e) applicable to estates created or existing before the passage of the statute, the question presented is not one of its construction or applicability, but of the power of Congress to impose the tax. The government argues that the tax was laid on the devolution of rights upon the wife at the death of her husband after the passage of the act, and that therefore the statute was not applied retroactively, even though the estate was created before its enactment. Without foreclosing consideration of this contention at another time, we find it unnecessary now, in view of the facts of the present case, to pass upon it.\n Group 2. The tenancies in all of the items of the second group were created after the passage of the 1916 Revenue Act. Congress had by that act adopted a system of death taxes, embracing, as it lawfully might, estates by the entirety. As was pointed out in Tyler v. United States, supra, pages 503, 505 of 281 U. S., 50 S. Ct. 356, 359, such estates are appropriate subjects of death taxes and the taxation of them is a suitable measure to prevent evasion of a system of taxation levied on estates passing at death by will or inheritance. In both respects they resemble gifts made in contemplation or death, likewise taxed by the estate tax provisions of the 1916 and later revenue acts. The considerations which led us, in Milliken v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 15\n, 51 S. Ct. 324, to uphold taxation of gifts in contemplation of death, made after the 1916 Act and before that of 1918, at the higher rate of the latter act, are equally applicable here. The knowledge available before the creation of the estate that it was embraced within an established taxing system and that its taxation, on the same basis and in the same manner as decedents' estates, was an essential part of the \n\n[284 U.S. 160, 167]\n\u00a0\n system to prevent evasions, relieves the present tax of the objection that it is arbitrarily retroactive.\n Group 3. Although the bank accounts were opened before the passage of the Revenue Act of 1916, the record does not disclose whether the deposits, which were the sources of the credit balances at the time of the decedent's death, were made before or after 1916. If after, the tax was rightly laid, for reasons already stated, which support the tax with respect to the items in group 2. As the suit is brought to recover taxes already paid, the presumption is that they were lawfully assessed and the burden rests on the taxpayer to prove the facts which establish their illegality. Niles Bement Pond Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 357, 361\n, 50 S. Ct. 251; Reinecke v. Spalding, \n280 \nU.S. 227, 232\n, 50 S. Ct. 96. As the taxpayer has failed to sustain the burden in this respect or to show that the wife had originally owned or paid for any of the items or to present any facts to support a recovery other than those stated, the judgment is\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","119":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPOTTSTOWN IRON CO. v.

C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Chas. B. Rugg, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n United States v. Swift & Company (No. 56) \n282 \nU.S. 468\n, 51 S. Ct. 202, decided this day, controls the decision of this case.\n Here the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, upon audit of petitioner's income and excess profits tax return for 1918, found an overpayment, and at the same time found an underpayment of similar taxes for the years 1916 and 1917. On January 22, 1926, he made additional assessments of the underpayments for 1916 and 1917, \n\n[282 U.S. 479, 480]\n\u00a0\n and on January 29 he approved a schedule of overassessments which embraced the overpayment for the year 1918. The schedule was transmitted to the collector of the appropriate district with the usual instructions and authority to check the overassessment against the taxpayer's account and determine whether the amounts in which the tax liability had been reduced should be abated in whole or in part, and, if any part of the overassessment was found to be an overpayment, to apply the same against taxes due, if any, making the appropriate entry in his accounts.\n After this had occurred, petitioner inquired in writing of the collector as to the status of its account. He replied by letter dated February 23, 1926, stating that he had applied the overassessment to close out the accounts of 1916 and 1917, thus extinguishing the taxpayer's liability as shown by his books. On February 27, 1926, he returned the schedule of overassessments to the Commissioner together with the usual subsidiary schedule of credits and refunds showing how he had credited the overassessment and that there remained a balance of 1918 taxes refundable to the taxpayer amounting to $21,152.12. On April 15, 1926, the Commissioner approved the schedule, thus authorizing the issuance of checks covering the amount to be refunded.\n The question  w hether interest should be allowed the petitioner under section 1019 of the Revenue Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 346 (26 USCA  153 note)) or under section 1116 of the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 119 (26 USCA  153 note)). The latter act took effect February 26, 1926. The Court of Claims held that the act of the Commissioner in approving the schedule of refunds and credits and authorizing the issuance of checks on April 15, 1926, constituted the allowance of the claim for credit, and that interest on credits for 1916 and 1917 taxes should be calculated under the act of 1926, which had then become effective. The petitioner argues that credit was allowed \n\n[282 U.S. 479, 481]\n\u00a0\n or taken when the collector, prior to February 26, 1926, made the entries upon his books, and that consequently interest on the credits should be calculated under the provisions of the act of 1924. We hold, in conformity with our decision in No. 56, that the allowance occurred April 15, 1926, when the Commissioner finally acted on the schedule of refunds and credits.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","120":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPRUSSIAN v.

Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Prussion, the petitioner, was convicted in the District Court for Eastern New York of forging an indorsement purporting to be that of a payee of a government draft. At the trial, by motions to dismiss and in arrest of judgment, the sufficiency of the indictment was challenged on the ground that the offense charged was the forging of an obligation of the United States in violation of section 148 of the Criminal Code, U. S. C. tit. 18,  262 (18 USCA  262) and that the indorsement alleged to have been forged was not such an obligation. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the judgment, holding that the indictment sufficiently charged a violation of that section. 42 F.(2d) 854.\n Certiorari was asked on the ground, among others, that the decision below conflicted with decisions of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Gesell v. United States, 1 F.(2d) 283; Lewis v. United States 8 F.( 2d) 849. See, also, White v. Levine (C. C. A.) 40 F.(2d) 502. In accord with the decision below are Hamil v. United States (C. C. A.) 298 F. 369, and Alvarado v. United States (C. C. A.) 9 F.(2d) 385. Cf. United States v. Jolly (D. C.) 37 F. 108; De Lemos v. United States (C. C. A.) 91 F. 497. Because of the conflict, the petition was not opposed by the government, although it suggested that the indictment might also be upheld as charging a forgery of a 'writing, for the purpose of obtaining ... from the \n\n[282 U.S. 675, 677]\n\u00a0\n United States ... any sum of money' under section 29 of the Criminal Code, U. S. C. tit. 18,  73 (18 USCA  73). This court granted the petition, \n282 \nU.S. 824\n, 51 S. Ct. 82, 75 L. Ed. -, October 20, 1930, limiting review to the question whether the indictment stated an offense under the Criminal Code.\n The indictment charged the forging by petitioner of 'a certain obligation of the United States,' described as the indorsement on a draft, drawn by a disbursing clerk of the United States Treasury upon the Treasurer of the United States and issued to the payee, 'by falsely making and forging the name of the payee ... on the back of said draft.' It set out a copy of the draft and the indorsement, and alleged that together they constituted a forged obligation of the United States. The indictment also set up that the indorsement was 'for the purpose of obtaining and receiving from the Treasurer of the United States a sum of money,' and was stated to be in violation of both sections 29 and 148 of the Criminal Code ( 18 USCA)  73, 262).\n Under section 148, 'whoever, with intent to defraud, shall falsely make, forge, counterfeit, or alter any obligation or other security of the United States,' is guilty of a criminal offense. Section 147 (18 USCA  261) provides: 'The words 'obligation or other security of the United States' shall be held to mean all ... checks, or drafts for money, drawn by or upon authorized officers of the United States.' It is apparent that the draft drawn on the Treasurer by an authorized officer is an 'obligation ... of the United States' both in common parlance and by the express definition of section 147. But to extend the meaning of that phrase so as to embrace the indorsement on the government draft is to enlarge the statutory definition, and would be possible only by a strained construction of the language of sections 147 and 148, inadmissible in the interpretation of criminal statutes, which must be strictly construed. See Fasulo v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 620\n, 47 S. Ct. 200; United States v. Salen, \n235 \nU.S. 237\n, 35 S. Ct. 51. \n\n[282 U.S. 675, 678]\n\u00a0\n The writing described in the indictment, when issued by the drawer, was a check or a draft. The added indorsement was in itself neither a check nor a draft. We need not stop to consider the argument advanced that the obligation upon the draft does not become complete until it is indorsed (see Hamil v. United States, supra, 298F. 371), for it overlooks the circumstance that the meaning of 'obligation' in section 148 is narrowed by the definition in section 147 to specifically enumerated written instruments, including checks or drafts for money, which are complete, as such, within the statutory definition and in common understanding, at least when issued to the payee by an authorized officer of the government. The indorsement was at most the purported obligation of the indorser, not of the United States, and a purported transfer of the title of the draft to the indorsee. In neither aspect was the indorsement itself an obligation of the United States as defined by section 147, or such a part of the draft as to constitute the forging of the indorsement a forgery of the draft.\n If the point were doubtful, the doubt would be resolved by a consideration of the purpose and history of the act of which section 148 is a part, and a comparison of it with related provisions of the Criminal Code. Its purpose has been declared by this court to be the protection of the bonds or currency of the United States, and not the punishment of any fraud or wrong on individuals. Dunbar v. United States, \n156 \nU.S. 185, 193\n, 15 S. Ct. 325. Cf. United States v. Turner, 7 Pet. 132, 136; United States v. Stewart, 4 Wash. C. C. 226, Fed. Cas. No. 16,402. Section 148 is a re-enactment of section 18 of the Act of April 10, 1816, 3 Stat. 266, 275, which made punishable the forgery of bills, notes, orders, or checks of the Bank of the United States. The legislation took substantially its present form in the Act of June 30, 1864 (chapter 172, 13 Stat. 218, 221, 222), section 10 of which (later Rev. St.  5414) extended its penal provisions to the forgery of 'any obli- \n\n[282 U.S. 675, 679]\n\u00a0\n gation or security of the United States,' and section 13 of which (later Rev. St.  5413) defined obligations of the United States substantially as in the present section 147. Before the enactment of the 1864 prototype of section 148, the purpose of the 1816 act had been declared, in United States v. Turner, supra, to be 'to guard the public from false and counterfeit paper, purporting on its face to be issued by the bank'; and it had been held to be inapplicable to a forged indorsement upon a genuine post note of the bank. United States v. Stewart, supra. In the light of this history, the omission of any reference to indorsements in section 148 is not without significance; and it is worthy of note that Congress later enacted laws specifically punishing forgery of indorsements on pension checks and money orders. Title 38, U. S. C.  128; title 18, U. S. C.  347 (38 USCA  128; 18 USCA  347).\n But we think the indictment is to be sustained as charging an offense under section 29 of the Criminal Code (18 USCA  73), which punishes the forgery of 'any deed, power of attorney, order, certificate, receipt, contract, or other writing, for the purpose of obtaining or receiving ... from the United States, or any of their officers or agents, any sum of money.' The indictment alleges specifically and with certainty the forgery of the indorsement on the draft, for the purpose of obtaining a sum of money from the Treasurer of the United States, and charges a violation of section 29. We think the indorsement was a 'writing' within that section. Its language is 'comprehensive' and 'all-embracing.' Cf. United States v. Davis, \n231 \nU.S. 183, 188\n, 34 S. Ct. 112. The writings enumerated have no common characteristic from which a purpose may be inferred to restrict the statute to any particular class of writings. The addition of 'other writing' to the enumeration was therefore not for the purpose of including writings of a limited class, but rather of extending the penal provisions of the statute to all writings of every class if forged for the purpose of \n\n[282 U.S. 675, 680]\n\u00a0\n obtaining money from an officer of the United States. See Howgate v. United States, 7 App. D. C. 217, 232, 233. Cf. United States v. Lawrence, 13 Blatch. 211, Fed. Cas. No. 15,572. It has been generally assumed by the lower federal courts that section 29 covers the forging of an indorsement. United States v. Winters (D. C.) 5 F.(2d) 321; Gesell v. United States, supra, 1 F.(2d) 287, 288; White v. Levine, supra; Bailey v. United States ( C. C. A.) 13 F.(2d) 325; Lewis v. United States, supra. Cr. United States v. Albert (C. C.) 45 F. 552; De Lemos v. United States, supra. But see, contra, Hamil v. United States, supra, 298 F. 372. Cf. United States v. Wilson, Fed. Cas. No. 16,732.\n Petitioner asserts that the indictment is defective in that it does not charge that the forgery was with intent to defraud the United States. See White v. Levine, supra, 40 F.(2d) 503. No such averment is required by the language of section 29 relating to forged indorsements. Other provisions of section 29 punish the uttering of a forged writing, or presenting any such writing to an officer of the United States in support of any claim, 'with intent to defraud the United States.' But the present indictment is not under either of those provisions. The charge is forgery of the indorsement, which is punishable by the different provision, now in question, if committed merely 'for the purpose of obtaining or receiving' from an officer or agent of the United States any sum of money. This imports an intent to defraud the United States, which the indictment sufficiently charges in the language of the statute.\n Nor is the present indictment defective, as is urged, because its material allegations are uncertain or repugnant. The accused was left in no uncertainty that he was charged with only a single act, that of forging the indorsement for the specified purpose. The judgment here would constitute an unmistakable bar to any future prosecution for the same offense. The validity of the indictment is therefore not affected by the fact that the pleader, \n\n[282 U.S. 675, 681]\n\u00a0\n through excess of caution, has mistakenly stated the act to be a violation of both section 148 and section 29.

The sole ground of the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals was that the Public Service Commission had no jurisdiction under the law of the state to make the order. \n\n[284 U.S. 6, 7]\n\u00a0\n The statute governing appeals to this Court from the Circuit Courts of Appeals is section 240 of the Judicial Code as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925 (c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 938 (28 USCA  347)), which provides in paragraphs (b) and (c) as follows:\n'(b) Any case in a circuit court of appeals where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of any State, on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is against its validity, may, at the election of the party relying on such State statute, be taken to the Supreme Court for review on writ of error or appeal; but in that event a review on certiorari shall not be allowed at the instance of such party, and the review on such writ of error or appeal shall be restricted to an examination and decision of the Federal questions presented in the case.\n\n'(c) No judgment or decree of a circuit court of appeals or of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court otherwise than as provided in this section.'\n\n The plain intent of this statute is to limit appeals to this Court from a Circuit Court of Appeals to cases where its decision is against the validity of a statute of a state upon the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States. In other cases, review by this Court, if it be had, must be pursuant to a writ of certiorari duly applied for and granted.\n As in this case the Circuit Court of Appeals did not decide against the validity of the order of the Public Service Commission upon the asserted federal grounds, but dealt with its validity solely under the state law, the appeal must be dismissed. \n\n\n\n","122":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAILWAY EXPRESS AGENCY v.

It has bought the business and assumed the liabilities of the American Railway Express Company, and is an agency of railroads throughout the United States.

The appellant says that so construed the prohibition is a direct burden upon the interstate commerce which is its principal business, and therefore is void. It also invokes the Fourteenth Amendment for some help. \n\n[282 U.S. 440, 444]\n\u00a0\n There is not here, as there was in Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S. Ct. 190, and Pullman Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 56\n, 30 S. Ct. 232, a deliberate attempt to use the State's powers as the means for attaining the unconstitutional result of taxing property outside the State. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Foster, \n247 \nU.S. 105, 114\n, 38 S. Ct. 438, 1 A. L. R. 1278. Virginia is not attempting to go beyond its power by indirection or to take anything from anybody. It simply is refusing to grant a foreign corporation a permit to transact local business without taking out a charter from the jurisdiction within which that business must be done. There is no substantial evidence that the refusal would impose a burden on interstate commerce and it is presumed to be constitutional. O'Gorman & Young, Inc., v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co. (January 5, 1931) \n282 \nU.S. 251\n, 51 S. Ct. 130. We may add that as suggested by the State Court the difficulties created by the Constitution of Virginia probably will not prove hard to overcome when it is found that they must be met.\n The objection based on the Fourteenth Amendment is that the requirement of the Virginia Constitution deprives the appellant of its right to sue in the federal courts and to remove suits to them on the ground of diversity of citizenship. This plainly is inaccurate. The appellant is not deprived of any rights. It can do all that it ever could. If it sees fit to acquire a new personality under the laws of Virginia it cannot complain that the new person has not the same rights as itself. Of course there can be no suggestion here that the clause in the State Constitution was adopted for a sinister end. And, unless it was, the inability of the new State corporation to do all that the appellant could have done is only the legitimate incident of a legitimate act.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","123":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRUSSIAN VOLUNTEER FLEET v. UNITED STATES(1931)\nNo. 39\nArgued: Decided: February 24, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 481, 482]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William L. Rawls, of Baltimore, Md., Charles Recht, of New York City, and Horace S. Whitman, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 481, 485]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Claude R. Branch, of Providence, R. I., for the United States.\n\n\n[282 U.S. 481, 486]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner brought this suit against the United States in the Court of Claims to recover just compensation for the requisitioning by the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, under authority \n\n[282 U.S. 481, 487]\n\u00a0\n delegated to it by the President, of contracts for the construction of two vessels. The Court of Claims dismissed the petition for the want of jurisdiction. 68 Ct. Cl. 32. This Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n281 \nU.S. 711\n, 50 S. Ct. 346\n\n\n The petition, filed in October, 1924, alleged that the petitioner 'is a corporation duly organized under, and by virtue of, the Laws of Russia'; that in January, 1917, the petitioner became the assignee for value of certain contracts for the construction of two vessels by the Standard Shipbuilding Corporation of New York; that in August, 1917, the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, acting under the authority conferred by the Act of June 15, 1917 (c. 29, 40 Stat. 183) and by the Executive Order of the President of the United States made on July 11, 1917, requisitioned these contracts, and the vessels being constructed thereunder, for the use of the United States; that the United States thereby became liable to the petitioner for the payment of just compensation; that in August, 1919, the petitioner submitted its affidavit of claim, and vouchers in support; that in March, 1920, the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation fixed the just compensation of the petitioner at a total amount of $1,412,532.35; that the value of the contracts taken from the petitioner was $4,000,000, to which the petitioner was entitled after allowing all proper credits and offsets; and that 'citizens of the United States are and at the time of and since the commencement of this suit have been accorded the right to prosecute claims against the Russian Government in the Court of that Government.'\n In May, 1927, the petitioner filed motions to issue commissions to take testimony in Germany and France; the defendant objected, and the motions were overruled. The petitioner then gave notice of the taking of testimony in Washington, D. C., whereupon the defendant moved to quash the notice upon the ground that the \n\n[282 U.S. 481, 488]\n\u00a0\n court was without jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the proceeding. On the submission of that motion, the petition was dismissed. The Court of Claims held that, as the United States government had not recognized the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in Russia, the petitioner was not entitled to maintain its suit in view of section 155 of the Judicial Code ( U. S. C., tit. 28,  261 (28 USCA  261)). That section is as follows: 'Sec. 155. Aliens who are citizens or subjects of any Government which accords to citizens of the United States the right to prosecute claims against such Government in its courts, shall have the privilege of prosecuting claims against the United States in the Court of Claims, whereof such court, by reason of their subject matter and character, might take jurisdiction.' The court said that the reference to citizens or subjects of 'any government' meant such governments as were recognized by the proper authorities of the United States.\n The government in its argument here, while submitting the case on theopi nion of the Court of Claims and not confessing error, presents the view that section 155 of the Judicial Code does not apply to this suit which was brought under the provisions of the Act of June 15, 1917. With respect to the matter of recognition, the government appends to its brief a letter of the Secretary of State of the United States, under date of December 5, 1930, stating that 'the Provisional Government of Russia, the successor of the Imperial Government of Russia, was recognized by the Government of the United States on March 22, 1917'; that, 'according to the Department's information, the Provisional Government of Russia was overthrown by an armed uprising which took place in the early part of November, 1917', and that 'the Government of the United States has not extended recognition to any re gime established in Russia subsequent to the overthrow of the Provisional Government.' \n\n[282 U.S. 481, 489]\n\u00a0\n As the facts alleged in the petition were admitted by the motion to dismiss, the allegation that the petitioner is a corporation duly organized under the laws of Russia stands unchallenged on the record. There was no legislation which prevented it from acquiring and holding the property in question. The petitioner was an alien friend, and as such was entitled to the protection of the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. Wong Wing v. United States, \n163 \nU.S. 228, 238\n, 16 S.

United States, supra; Brooks- Scanlon Corporation v. United States, \n265 \nU.S. 106, 123\n, 44 S. Ct. 471.\n The Congress recognized this duty in authorizing the expropriation. The Act of June 15, 1917, under which the requisition was made, provided for the payment of just compensation. The Congress did not attempt to give to any officer or administrative tribunal the final authority to determine the amount of such compensation1, and recovery by suit against the United States was \n\n[282 U.S. 481, 490]\n\u00a0\n made an integral part of the legislative plan of fulfilling the constitutional requirement. The act provided as follows: 'Whenever the United States shall ... requisition any contract, ... requisition, acquire or take over ... any ship, ... in accordance with the provisions hereof, it shall make just compensation therefor, to be determined by the President; and if the amount thereof, so determined by the President, is unsatisfactory to the person entitled to receive the same, such person shall be paid seventy-five per centum of the amount so determined by the President and shall be entitled to sue the United States to recover such further sum as, added to said seventy-five per centum, will make up such amount as will be just compensation therefor, in the manner provided for by section twenty-four, paragraph twenty, and section one hundred and forty-five of the Judicial Code.' Section 24, paragraph 20, of the Judicial Code (U. . C ., tit. 28,  41, subd. (20), 28 USCA  41(20 ), gives jurisdiction to the District Courts of the United States, concurrent with the Court of Claims, of claims against the United States not exceeding $10,000, founded upon the Constitution, or any law of Congress, or upon any contract, express or implied, with the government of the United States, when the claimant would be entitled to redress against the United States in a court of law, equity, or admiralty, if the United States were suable. The case of an alien friend is not excepted. Section 145 of the Judicial Code (U. S. C., tit. 28,  250 (28 USCA  250)) gives to the Court of Claims jurisdiction of suits on similar claims against the United States without limit of amount. The authority con- \n\n[282 U.S. 481, 491]\n\u00a0\n ferred upon the President by the Act of June 15, 1917, was exercised by him through the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, and as the compensation fixed by that corporation was not satisfactory to the petitioner, it became entitled under the express terms of the act to bring suit against the United States to recover the amount justly payable by reason of the requisition.\n The Act of June 15, 1917, makes no reference to section 155 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  261) with respect to alien suitors, and the question is whether that provision should be implied as establishing a condition precedent and the recovery thus be defeated. It is at once apparent that such an implication would lead to anomalous results. It would mean that, although the United States had actually taken possession of the property and was enjoying the advantages of its use, and the alien owner was unquestionably entitled to compensation at the time of the taking, it was the intention of the Congress that recovery should be denied, or at least be indefinitely postponed until the Congress made some other provision for the determination of the amount payable, if it appeared that citizens of the United States were not entitled to prosecute claims against the government of the alien's country in its courts, or that the United States did not recognize the re gime which was functioning in that country.\n We find no warrant for imputing to the Congress such an intention. 'Acts of Congress are to be construed and applied in harmony with and not to thwart the purpose of the Constitution.' Phelps v. United States, supra. The Fifth Amendment gives to each owner of property his individual right. The constitutional right of owner A to compensation when his property is taken is irrespective of what may be done somewhere else with the property of owner B. As alien friends are embraced within \n\n[282 U.S. 481, 492]\n\u00a0\n the terms of the Fifth Amendment, it cannot be said that their property is subject to confiscation here because the property of our citizens may be confiscated in the alien's country. The provision that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation establishes a standard for our government which the Constitution does not make dependent upon the standards of other governments. The act of Congress should be interpreted in the light of its manifest purpose to give effect to the constitutional guaant y.\n Nor do we regard it as an admissible construction of the Act of June 15, 1917, to hold that the Congress intended that the right of an alien friend to recover just compensation should be defeated or postponed because of the lack of recognition by the government of the United States of the re gime in his country. A fortiori, as the right to compensation for which the act provided sprang into existence at the time of the taking, there is no ground for saying that the statute was not to apply, if at a later date, and before compensation was actually made, there should be a revolution in the country of the owner and the ensuing re gime should not be recognized. The question as presented here is not one of a claim advanced by or on behalf of a foreign government or re gime, but is simply one of compensating an owner of property taken by the United States.\n The Act of June 15, 1917, if read according to its terms, presents no difficulty. A condition should not be implied which, to say the least, would raise a grave question as to the constitutional validity of the act. Federal Trade Commission v.

Walter, of New York City, for appellant. \n\n[284 U.S. 30, 33]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert P. Beyer, of New York City, for appellee.\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 30, 34]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Antonio Comincio, a native of Italy, died intestate in New York City some time prior to March 10, 1925, when letters of administration were issued to the respondent as public administrator by the Surrogates' Court of New York County. Upon the judicial settlement of the administrator's account, the appellant, the Consul General of Italy at New York, presented the claim that the decedent at the time of his death was a subject of the King of Italy and had left no heirs or next of kin, and that, under article XVII of the Consular Convention of 1878 between the United States and Italy, the petitioner was entitled to receive the net assets of the estate for distribution to the Kingdom of Italy. The Attorney General of New York contested the claim. The Surrogates' Court, finding that the domicile of the decedent was in New York City, decreed that the balance of the estate, amounting to $914.64, after payment of debts and the sums allowed as commissions and as expenses of administration, be paid into the treasury of New York City for the use and benefit of the unknown kin of the decedent. In re Comincio's Estate, 135 Misc. Rep. 733, 240 N. Y. S. 691, 692. The decree was affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the state, First Department (229 App. Div. 862, 243 N. Y. S. 814), and both the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeals of the state denied leave to appeal to the latter court. The case may \n\n[284 U.S. 30, 35]\n\u00a0\n be regarded as properly here on certiorari. Jud. Code,  237(c), U. S. C., tit. 28,  344(c), 28 USCA  344(c).\n There is no controversy as to the facts. The decedent was never naturalized, and at the time of his death was an Italian subject. He had lived in New York for many years, and the finding that the decedent was domiciled there is not open to question. Nor were any heirs or next of kin discovered. The testimony introduced on behalf of the Italian Consul General, which was undisputed, stated that the decedent had no relatives, and the decree of the Surrogates' Court recited that next of kin were unknown. The decree was made pursuant to chapter 230 of the Laws of New York of 1898 (as amended). The Surrogate said in his opinion: 'Pursuant to our statutes, this amount would be directed in the decree to be paid into the city treasury of the city of New York to await ascertainment of the next of kin. Uitimately the amount would find its way into the treasury of the state of New York.'\n The provision of the Consular Convention between the United States and Italy, under which the claim of the Italian Consul General was made, provides (20 Stat. 725, 732): 'Article XVII. The respective Consuls General, Consuls, Vice-Consuls and Consular Agents, as likewise the Consular Chancellors, Secretaries, Clerks or Attache s, shall enjoy in both countries, all the rights, prerogatives, immunities and privileges which are or may hereafter be granted to the officers of the same grade, of the most favoured nation.'\n Pursuant to this agreement, the Italian Consul General sought the application of article VI of the Treaty between the United States and Persia of 1856 as follows (11 Stat. 709, 710): 'Article VI. In case of a citizen or subject of either of the contracting parties dying within the territories of the other, his effects shall be delivered up integrally to \n\n[284 U.S. 30, 36]\n\u00a0\n the family or partners in business of the deceased; and in case he has no relations or partners, his effects in either country shall be delivered up to the consul or agent of the nation of which the deceased was a subject or citizen, so that he may dispose of them in accordance with the laws of his country.'\n This Treaty with Persia was terminated on May 10, 1928, but, as this was subsequent to the death of the Italian national whose estate is in question, the termination does not affect the present case.\n It may be assumed that article XVII of the Consular Convention with Italy contemplates reciprocity with respect to the rights and privileges sought, and there is no suggestion that Italy has not recognized the right of consuls of the United States to take the effects of the citizens of the United States dying in Italy in circumstances similar to those in which present claim of the Italian Consul General is pressed. As, is this view, there appears to be no ground for denying the right of the Italian Consul General to demand the application of the last clause of article VI of the Treaty with Persia, the only question is as to the interpretation of that provision.\n We are not here concerned with questions of mere administration, nor is it necessary to determine that the loose phrasing of the provisions of article VI precludes an appropriate local administration to protect the rights of creditors. Nor have we to deal with a case of testamentary disposition. In this instance there is no will, administration has been had, creditors have been paid, proper steps have been taken, without success, to discover kin of the decedent, and, assuming the absence of relatives, the question is one of escheat, that is, whether the net assets shall go to Italy or to the state of New York. The provision of article VI of the Treaty with Persia does not contain the qualifying words 'conformably with the laws of the country' (where the death occurred) as in \n\n[284 U.S. 30, 37]\n\u00a0\n the case of the Treaty between the United States and the Argentine Confederation of 1853 (article IX, 10 Stat. 1001, 1009; Rocca v. Thompson, \n223 \nU.S. 317, 326\n, 330 S., 332, 32 S. Ct. 207); or the phrase 'so far as the laws of each country will permit,' as in the Consular Convention between the United States and Sweden of 1910 (article XIV, 37 Stat. 1479, 1487, 1488; Rocca v. Thompson, supra; Matter of D'Adamo, 212 N. Y. 214, 222, 223, 106 N. E. 81, L. R. A. 1915D, 373). The omission from article VI of the Treaty with Persia of a clause of this sort, so frequently found in treaties of this class, must be regarded as deliberate. In the circumstances shown, it is plain that effect must be given to the requirement that the property of the decedent 'shall be delivered up to the consul or agent of the nation of which the deceased was a subject or citizen, so that he may dispose of them in accordance with the laws of his country,' unless a different rule is to apply simply because the decedent was domiciled in the United States.\n The language of the provision suggests no such distinction and, if it is to be maintained, it must be the result of construction based upon the supposed intention of the parties to establish a exception of which their words give no hint. In order to determine whether such a construction is admissible, regard should be had to the purpose of the Treaty and to the context of the provision in question. The Treaty belongs to a class of commercial treaties the chief purpose of which is to promote intercourse, which is facilitated by residence. Those citizens or subjects of one party who are permitted under the Treaty to reside in the territory of the other party are to enjoy, while they are such residents, certain stipulated rights and privileges. Whether there is domiciliary intent, or domicile is acquired in fact, is not made the test of the enjoyment of these rights and privileges. The words 'citizens' and 'subjects' are used in several articles of the Treaty with Persia and in no instance are \n\n[284 U.S. 30, 38]\n\u00a0\n they qualified by a distinction between residence and domicile. Thus, in article III we find the following provision (11 Stat. 709): 'Article III. The citizens and subjects of the two high contracting parties, travellers, merchants, manufacturers, and others, who may reside in the territory of either country, shall be respected and efficiently protected by the authorities of the country and their agents, and treated in all respects as the subjects and citizens of the most favored nation are treated.'\n It would be wholly inadmissible to conclude that it was the intention that citizens of the United States, making their residence in Persia under this Treaty, would be denied the benefit of article III in case they acquired a domicile in Persia. The provision contemplated residence, nothing is said to indicate that domicile is excluded, and the clear import of the provision is that, so long as they retained their status as citizens of the United States, they would be entitled to the guaranty of article III. The same would be true of Persians permitted to reside here under the Treaty.\n Again, the provisions of article V of the Treaty were of special importance, as they provided for extraterritorial jurisdiction of the United States in relation to the adjudication of disputes. \n1\n It would thwart the major \n\n[284 U.S. 30, 39]\n\u00a0\n purpose of the Treaty to exclude from the important protection of these provisions citizens of the United States Who might be domiciled in Persia. The test of the application of every paragraph of article V, with respect both to citizens of the United States and to Persian subjects, clearly appears to be that of nationality, irrespective of the acquisition of a domicile as distinguished from residence.\n We find no warrant for a more restricted interpretation of the words 'a citizen or subject of either of the contracting parties' in article VI than that which must be given to the similar description of persons throughout the other articles of the Treaty. The same intention which made nationality, without limitation with respect to domicile, the criterion in the other provisions, dominates this provision. The provision of article VI is reciprocal. The property of a Persian subject dying within the United States, leaving no kin, is to be dealt with in the same manner as the property of a citizen of the United States dying in Persia in similar circumstances. \n\n[284 U.S. 30, 40]\n\u00a0\n It is not necessary to invoke the familiar rule with respect to the liberal construction of treaties,2 as the instant case merely calls for a reading of the provision as to 'citizens' and 'subjects' according to its terms. There is no applicable principle which permits us to narrow them. As treaties are contracts between independent nations, their words are to be taken in their ordinary meaning 'as understood in the public law of nations.' Geofroy v. Riggs, \n133 \nU.S. 258, 271\n, 10 S. Ct. 295, 298, 33 L. Ld. 642.\n There can be no question as to the power of the government of the United States to make the treaty with Persia or the Consular Convention with Italy. The treatymaking power is broad enough to cover all subjects that properly pertain to our foreign relations, and agreement with respect to the rights and privileges of citizens of the United States in foreign countries, and of the nationals of such countries within the United States, and the disposition of the property of aliens dying within the territory of the respective parties, is within the scope of the power, and any conflicting law of the state must yield.

In the present suit, brought by respondents, in the District Court for Western Michigan to enjoin infringement of this and other patents, the District Court held the patent 'invalid if infringed,' and entered a decree for petitioner, 24 F.( 2d) 872, which the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, holding claim 25 valid and infringed. 37 F.(2d) 830. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had held the patent invalid, Wirebounds Patents Co. v. Gibbons Box Co., 25 F.(2d) 363, affirming a decree without opinion of the District Court for Northern Illinois.\n The present suit was based on three patents, all issued to the same patentees: The machine patent, already referred to; No. 1,128,144, issued February 9, 1915, application filed October 14, 1904, for a 'work holder,' used in connection with the box blank machine; and No. 1,128,252, issued February 9, 1915, application filed April 21, 1914, for a method of making wirebound boxes. The first two were based upon co-pending applications filed in October, 1904, and the third upon a divisional application cut out of the work holder application. Typical claims are printed in the margin. \n1\n A fourth product patent, now \n\n[282 U.S. 704, 706]\n\u00a0\n expired and only indirectly involved, was No. 799,854, issued to the same patentees September 19, 1905, application filed October 17, 1904 (reissued in 1907, No. 12,725), covering a specific form of box blank, which could be produced by the use of the machine and method patents, but also might be made without resort to either.\n The court below, after pointing out that the three patents directly involved were all issued on the same day and will expire at the same time, and that there could be no commercially important infringement of any of the patents which did not infringe the machine patent, limited its decision to determining the validity and infringement of claim 25 of that patent. It gave the usual decree for injunction and accounting with respect to this claim, and dismissed the bill as to the work holder and method patents, but with leave to counsel to apply for further consideration of any other claim of the patents in suit if deemed necessary to settle the controversy. No \n\n[282 U.S. 704, 707]\n\u00a0\n such application was made, and it was conceded at the bar that the disposition here of the issues raised with respect to claim 25 will be, for all practical purposes, determinative of the case.\n By the teachings of the Inwood and Lavenberg patents, to which reference has been made, wirebound box blanks may be produced, consisting usually of four panels which may be conveniently folded and attached to box ends so as to form strong, light weight, commercially useful boxes. The blanks, before folding, comprise the panels of side material in straight edged sheets of thin wood or veneer, stapled, at each end, to cleats placed at right angles to the side material, the staples srad dling reinforcing wire. The cleats, which have previously been step-mitered or beveled, and which in practice are usually eight in number, one at each end of the four panels of side material, are fastened to the side material in such position with respect to it and to each other that, when the blank is folded, the reinforcing wires serve as hinges; the ends \n\n[282 U.S. 704, 708]\n\u00a0\n of adjoining cleats engage; and the panels form the four sides of a box, with or without overlapping edges, as may be preferred.\n Before Inwood and Lavenberg, the method of manufacturing box blanks, under the so-called Rosback patents, had been to form a blank of a single sheet of side material stapled, at each of its two sides, to a single cleat. The rigid blank formed by this first step was then prepared for folding by a second and distinct mechanical procedure, in the course of which each of the cleats was cut into four separate cleats, step-mitered at their ends, and the single sheet of side material scored. The blank was then capable of being folded by bending the side material along the scored lines so that the adjacent ends of the cleats would meet. Before any of their applications, Inwood and Lavenberg appear to have devised a machine or work holder for holding in position, and fastening, pre-formed cleats to a single piece of side material; but that did not wholly eliminate the second part of the earlier procedure, by which the side material was scored before folding. The final step which brought them to their improved method was taken only when both cleats and side panels, assembled in position, were fastened into a foldable box blank by a single operation. The difference between the two methods was that the old taught the production of foldable relationships by cutting the rigid box blanks. Inwood and Lavenberg taught the new by assembling and fastening together the separate elements. Their method constituted an important advance over the old, which had not been commercially successful. The new, by the substitution of a single for a two-step procedure, saved the expense and inconvenience of double handling, and made it practicable to use cleats which could be pre-formed in quantities cheaply, and permitted the use for that purpose of short and otherwise waste pieces of lumber. It eliminated certain mechanical difficulties of the \n\n[282 U.S. 704, 709]\n\u00a0\n old method of mitering and scoring the rigid blanks, and resulted in a product with fewer defects and which folded more easily than the forms produced by the earlier.\n Numerous details of the new procedure had been taught by the prior art. The idea of folding wire- or metal-bound sides into a box was old. Averill (1900, No. 661,481) and Rosback (1898, No. 608,796) specifically taught the binding of the sides together with wire Howenstine (1891, No. 453,479), Hamilton (1887, No. 373,828), and others had developed the idea of using pre-formed cleats attached or to be attached to a plurality of side sheets. Rosback had developed elaborate machines for step-mitering ( 1898, No. 609,630; 1899, No. 623,258); and for stapling box blanks (1898, No. 614,348; 1899, No. 630,303); and devices for feeding box blank material into the stapling machine (1899, No. 625,958, No. 636,068).\n The conception of Inwood and Lavenberg which was new, was that the pre-formed cleats and side materials could be assembled and so positioned with reference to each other, that they could be stapled together to manufacture, in a single stapling operation, the finished product, the box blank ready for folding. This constituted an important advance over the use of the rigid box blanks in the two-step method of the prior art, which had been developed by Rosback. The new method had a large and immediate commercial success, and we assume, as the court below held, that it involved invention. See The Barbed Wire Patent, \n143 \nU.S. 275, 283\n, 12 S. Ct. 443; Krementz v. S. Cottle Co., \n148 \nU.S. 556, 560\n, 13 S. Ct. 719; Minerals Separation, Ltd., v. Hyde, \n242 \nU.S. 261\n, 37 S. Ct. 82.\n This conceptio is that of the reissue (product) patent, held valid as a basic patent in Wirebounds Patents Co. v. Chicago Mill & Lumber Co. ( D. C.) 238 F. 929, and by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Wirebounds Patents Co. v. Gibbons Box Co., supra. As it has now expired, the public is free to use the new procedure of making \n\n[282 U.S. 704, 710]\n\u00a0\n wirebound folding box blanks, so far as taught by that patent. The patent is for a product, an improved wirebound box blank, foldable into a box with overlapping sides. It describes the earlier two-step procedure by which the rigid box forms were first assembled and then, by a second separate step, prepared for folding by step-mitering the cleats and scoring the side material. The specification of the patent is: 'Our invention relates to certain improvements in wirebound boxes, especially of that class in which the blanks constituting the four sides of the box are assembled and secured in relative position to each other prior to folding by reinforcing wires, and has for its object the assembling and fastening together such parts constituting the completed blank so that the same when folded will produce overlapping edges of the side sheets.' The drawings of the patent, which show a completed blank ready for folding, read with the specifications, indicate unmistakably that the advance, achieved by the improvement over the existing method of manufacturing box blanks, was in the process, by which the product of the patent could be made by assembling and positioning pre-formed cleats and sides, so spaced that, when stapled, they will fold to form the four sides of a box.\n Thus this patent completely discloses the invention of Inwood and Lavenberg and the advance which it made over the prior art. It taught all that was disclosed by their method patent, for the method claimed is but the process of the now expired reissue patent resulting in the product of the patent. As only the validity and infringement of the machine patent are now before us, it is unnecessary to consider whether, for the reason just stated, the later method patent is invalid, although granted on a copending application, as was held in Mosler Safe & Lock Co. v. Mosler, \n127 \nU.S. 354, 361\n, 8 S. Ct. 1148, or whether it is invalid \n\n[282 U.S. 704, 711]\n\u00a0\n because of the delay in filing the divisional application, as was held by the District Court below.\n All else embodied in the machine and work holder patents, we think, involved not invention, but the application of mechanical skill to the solution of the problem of devising suitable mechanical means for the manufacture of foldable box blanks by the process or method disclosed by the reissue patent.\n The prior art had taught how to construct a machine which would fasten with staples the elements of the box blank of the reissue patent. That of Rosback, No. 614,348 and No. 625,958, used for stapling the rigid box forms of the earlier art, consisted of a stapler, stationary guides for directing the sheets and cleats, and an endless chain with attached purshers for feeding the materials along the guides to the stapler. Once it became apparent that an improved method could be employed in manufacturing the completed box blank by assembling all its pre-formed elements and holding them in their appropriate relative positions while they were being fed through a stapling machine, it was equally apparent that the new method could be used only by resort to some appropriate mechanical means for holding the elements of the blank in position until fastened. But the solution of that problem was, we think, obvious, involving only the adaptation of familiar mechanical means for holding cleats and sides in place, and requiring no more than the mechanical skill of the calling. That, we conclude, was all Inwood and Lavenberg achieved by their work holder and machine patents; and it is all that petitioner has done in the adaptation of the Rosback machine which it employs in the use of the method which it is now free to make.\n The work holder patent describes and claims a portable wok h older, embracing two parallel channels in which are placed the preformed cleats, their ends engaging space \n\n[282 U.S. 704, 712]\n\u00a0\n blocks of such size, shape, and location as to hold the cleats in appropriate position. The box sides, resting upon the cleats so engaged, are positioned by the space blocks and held in place by clamps. The work holder, with the assembled elements of the box blank thus held in position, is then passed through the stapling machine, which staples together wire, sides, and cleats. Claim 25 of the machine patent, it will be observed, relates only to cleat treatment. The mechanism which it claims could be operated to make box blanks having multiple preformed cleats and a single piece of side material. It obviously would not, without some modification, hold both cleats and separate side panels in appropriate relative positions for stapling, and so could not be used for making boxes by the improved method. As other claims of the machine patent may be taken to supply this deficiency, we assume, for present purposes, that claim 25, with others of the machine patent, is broad enough to embrace the essential elements of the work holder, and that the work holder is an exemplification of them. The machine patent, aside from the work controlling means, consists generally of a stapling head surmounting a table with feed roller mechanism for pushing the work holder under the stapler.\n We think that the machine and work holder patents, read separately or together, apart from such disclosure as they make of the process or method of the reissue patent, disclose only the results of the application of mechanical skill to the development of a convenient mechanism for using the method. Petitioner, by the adaptation of the Rosback machine which it uses to produce the box blank of the reissue patent, has done no more. It has increased the number of pushers to that required for the desired number of assembled separate elements-cleats and side material. The pushers are spaced at appropriate distances and used in conjunction with a detent or 'hold back,' so that, by the co-operation of the pushers \n\n[282 U.S. 704, 713]\n\u00a0\n and hold back, cleats and side material are held in appropriate positional relationship as they pass under the stapler. By this multiplication of pushers, the Rosback machine did for each panel only what it had previously done for the single rigid box blank. In making the latter, as well as the former, the pushers performed a positioning function, a fact which, alone, challenges the patentability of respondents' machine claim. With the old blank, as well as the new, the purshers could not be placed at random, and cleats and side materials both had to be brought into appropriate relative positions. Moreover, the spacing of the panels with reference to each other in box- or crate-making machines of the Rosback type, by the use of a plurality of space pushers on the same endless feed chain, was old. Such an arrangement, where the pushers performed this positioning function, is shown in Greenstreet (1895, No. 547,486; 1897, No. 579,574); and Lipps & Springer (1905, No. 801,998).\n The pushers and hold back, like the channels and space blocks of the work holder, are familiar mechanical means for holding materials in position while work is being done upon them. Given the method of the reissue patent, failure to adapt these obvious means to the solution of the problem in hand would, we think, have evidenced a want of ordinary mechanical skill and familiarity with them. Their adaptation to the new use was not the creative work of the inventive faculty. It was 'but the display of the expencted skill of the calling, and involves only the exercise of the ordinary faculties of reasoning upon the materials supplied by a special knowledge, and the facility of manipulation which results from its habitual and intelligent practice.' Hollister v. Benedict Mfg. Co., \n113 \nU.S. 59, 72\n, 73 S., 5 S. Ct. 717, 724; Concrete Appliances Co. v. Gomery, \n269 \nU.S. 177\n, 46 S. Ct. 42; Aron v. Manhattan Railway o., \n132 \nU.S. 84, 90\n, 10 S. Ct. 24.\n The court below upheld the validity of the machine patent because it had contributed to the market success of the product, which could not have been attained with \n\n[282 U.S. 704, 714]\n\u00a0\n out an automatic machine for its manufacture, and because it thought that the 'dominating new result' was to be found in the combination of machine elements. In considering the objection that the machine patent did not involve invention, it said, page 836, of 37 F.(2d):\n'It has been suggested that the disclosure made by the method patent left no room for invention in the machine patent. This suggestion cannot be of force, since the patents were copending and one is not prior art as against the other, even if they had not both been issued on the same day. ... If by the suggestion it is meant that the primary thought was in the method and that little or no invention was needed to make a machine, once the method had been conceived, that may be true; but that cannot militate against the validity of the machine patent when the two are practically simultaneous, for in such case the concept involved in the method is an important and perhaps a vital part of the machine invention. The concept which underlies and precedes the machine may or may not involve an independently patentable method; in either event alike the machine is patentable.'\n\n But this, we think, does not meet the objection, which, more precisely stated, is that the machine and work holder patents, fairly read, do not embrace a patent for the dominating new result, the process of the reissue patent, but are patents for a particular combination of mechanical means, useful, as is that of petitioner, in availing of the process, but which, as we have said, does not involve invention. That the new result is not so embraced is apparent from respondents' insistence, to establish the seniority of the machine invention over that shown by the reissue patent, upon the early use, to which we have referred, of the Inwood and Lavenberg machine for stapling a plurality of pre-mitered cleats to a single piece of side material. But such use of the machine invention did not \n\n[282 U.S. 704, 715]\n\u00a0\n disclose or involve the conception of the reissue patent of producing foldable relationships in one step, which, as we have said, is the new result.\n The machine and work holder patents describe and claim only a combination of mechanical elements enumerated and arranged as stated in claim 25, as we have construed it. This combination which had been found suitable for manufacturing blanks with a plurality of pre-formed cleats and a single piece of side material, was suitable for using the process of the reissue patent, as is the combination used by petitioner. Such possibilities of use might be spelled out of the machine and work holder patents by one skilled in the art and familiar with the process described in the reissue patent. But nowhere do they describe or claim, as the invention of the patent the new method or procedure of Inwood and Lavenberg, which was their improvement on the prior art. That is told in full in the reissue patent, and it is there that the dominating new result appears. Obviously, from what we have said, if the method concept which underlay and preceded the machine had not been independently patentable, the machine could not have been. For the same reasons, the machine cannot be patentable merely because it is capable of use in applying a conception independently patentable.\n The question therefore is not one of reliance upon the prior art of the reissue patent as against a co-pending patent, or of double patenting, or of the overlapping of specific and generic patents. It is the attempted extension of the monopoly of the expired reissue patent in Inwood and Lavenberg's invention by resort to the machine patent, and to the work holder from which the described invention had been subtracted by division, and which cover, not the invention of the reissue patent, but a mechanical device which does not involve invention.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Machine Patent No. 1,128,145 Claim 25.

At the preliminary hearing, the appellant challenged the validity of the statute, as applied to him, upon the ground that it was repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The appellant was held for trial. Upon return to a writ of habeas corpus, the circuit court \n\n[283 U.S. 553, 557]\n\u00a0\n of the county decided that the statute as applied to the appellant was unconstitutional, and the appellant was discharged from custody. This judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of the state, which upheld the statute. 99 Fla. 1174, 128 So. 632. The case comes here on appeal.\n The statute provides for the regulation, through the State Railroad Commission, of 'auto transportation companies.' These companies are thus defined in section 1(h):\n'The term 'auto transportation company' when used in this Act means every corporation or person, their lessees, trustees or receivers, owning, controlling, operating or managing any motor propelled vehicle not usually operated on or over rails, used in the business of transporting persons or property for compensation or as a common carrier over any public highway in this State between fixed termini or over a regular route; Provided, That the term 'auto transportation company' as used in this Act, shall not include corporations or persons engaged exclusively in the transportation of children to or from school, or any transportation company engaged exclusively in the transporting agricutura l, horticultural, dairy or other farm products and fresh and Salt Fish and Oysters and Shrimp from the point of production to the assembling or shipping point enroute to primary market, or to motor vehicles used exclusively in transporting or delivering dairy products or any transportation company engaged in operating taxicabs, or hotel busses from a depot to a hotel in the same town or city.'\n\n Every auto transportation company as thus defined is prohibited ( section 2) from operating 'any motor vehicle for the transportation of persons or property for compensation on any public highway in this State without first having obtained from the Railroad Commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity requires or will require such operation.' There is an \n\n[283 U.S. 553, 558]\n\u00a0\n exception in case of operation exclusively within the limits of an incorporated city or town.\n Application for such 'Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity' (section 3) must set forth certain information with respect to the applicant and proposed service. Upon hearing, the commission may issue the certificate as prayed for, 'or refuse to issue the same, or may issue the same with modification, or upon such terms and conditions as in its judgment the public convenience and necessity may require.' The commission may take into consideration various matters bearing upon the applicant's previous operation and reliability, as well as the effect that the granting of the certificate may have upon 'other transportation' facilities and upon 'transportation as a whole' within the territory sought to be served, and 'any other matters tending to qualify or disqualify' the applicant 'as a common carrier.' It is further provided that, upon hearing, the certificate shall be granted 'as a matter of right' to such auto transportation companies as were operating in good faith on the 19th day of April, 1929, over the route for which the certificate is sought, 'who shall comply in full with the provisions of this Act.' When application is made for a certificate 'to operate in a territory or on a line already served by a certificate holder,' the commission shall grant the certificate 'only when the existing certificate holder or holders serving such territory fail to provide service and facilities to the satisfaction of said Commission.'\n The following provision as to the giving of a bond in connection with the application for certificate is found in section 4:\n'The Commission shall, at the time of granting a certificate to operate any transportation company for transporting persons or property, fix and determine the amount of the bond to be given by the applicant for the protection, in case of passenger vehicle, of the passengers \n\n[283 U.S. 553, 559]\n\u00a0\n and baggage carried in said vehicle and of the public against injury caused by negligence of the person or corporation operating the said vehicle, and in the case of the vehicle transporting freight, for the protection of the said freight so carried and of the public against injuries received through negligence of the person or corporation operating said freight carrying vehicle. ... The said bonds shall be conditioned to indemnify passengers and the public receiving personal injuries by any act of negligence, and for damages to property of any person other than the assured; and such bonds shall contain such conditions, provisions, and limitations as the Commission may prescribe, and said bonds shall be payable to the State of Florida, and shall be for the benefit of and subject to action thereon by any person or persons who shall have sustained an actionable injury protected thereby, notwithstanding any provisions in said bond to the contrary, and every bond or insurance policy given shall be conclusively presumed to have been given according to and to contain all of the provisions of this Act. And no certificate shall be valid until such bond has been filed and approved. ...'\n\n With the approval of the commission, the applicant may file an insurance policy in lieu of bon.\n The commission is empowered (section 5) 'to fix or approve the rates, fares, charges, classifications, rules and regulations for each auto transportation company,' to regulate its 'service and safety of operations,' to prescribe 'a uniform system and classification of accounts to be used, which among other things, shall set up adequate depreciation charges,' to require 'the filing of annual and other reports and all other data,' and to supervise and regulate it 'in all other matters' affecting its relationship with the traveling and shipping public.\n Under section 6, every auto transportation company, as defined by the act, must forthwith file, with its application \n\n[283 U.S. 553, 560]\n\u00a0\n for a certificate, 'a schedule of its rates and fares, and a time schedule of all motor vehicles operated' which are to be subject to public inspection. Rates and time schedules are to be changed only with the sanction of the commission, and it is made unlawful for any such company to receive a greater or less charge for any service rendered than that shown by the filed schedules.\n Violation of any provision of the act is made a misdemeanor (section 13) punishable by fine or imprisonment, or by both.\n Section 14 provides for the collection of a tax from every auto transportation company to which has been granted a certificate of public convenience and necessity. This is a mileage tax graded according to the capacity of the vehicle. The tax is to be paid quarterly in advance, beginning with the issue of the certificate. Five per cent. of the moneys collected are to be used to defray the expense of the administration of the act, and the remainder is to be distributed among the counties in proportion to the use of their highways (section 15).\n Other provisions prohibit discrimination and 'free fares' except as stated.\n Upon the appeal in this case, the Supreme Court of the state thus construed the statute (99 Fla. 1174, 128 So. 632, 634):\n'The statute applies to corporations and persons who use motor- propelled vehicles in the business of transporting persons or property for compensation over public highways in this state between fixed termini or over a regular route, whether such transportation for compensation is as common carriers or as carriers for particular persons under special contract; but the statute does not require private carriers to become common carriers, and the provisions of the statute that are legally applicable only to common carriers are not intended to be applied to, and are not applicable to, corporations or persons who are not common carriers, though engaged in the transpor- \n\n[283 U.S. 553, 561]\n\u00a0\n tation to which the statute refers; and the provisions of the statute that are legally applicable to private carriers for compensation are capable of being effectuated, leaving the provisions that are legally applicable only to common carriers to be applied to such common carriers as are covered by the statute. ... The requirements as to procuring certificates of convenience and necessity for doing the business on the highways and as to the tax imposed on the business may be reasonably applied to private carriers for compensation for the privilege of transporting for hire as a business on the public roads of the state, in the exercise of the police and taxing power of the state to conserve the proper use of the public highways and to serve proper sovereign purposes.'\n\n The state court gave no indication as to the particular provisions of the statute which were deemed to be 'legally applicable' only to common carriers, or as to those which were considered to be legally applicable to private carriers, except that it was decided that the latter were bound to procure certificates and to pay the tax.\n There is no controversy with respect to the status of the appellant. The Supreme Court said that he 'owned and operated two motorpropelled vehicles in the business of transporting property for compensation upon the public highways between fixed termini and over regular routes, all within the state, not (as) a common carier but as a private carrier under special contract.' From the undisputed evidence upon the preliminary hearing, it appears that the appellant was employed under an exclusive contract with the Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company in hauling its merchandise from Jacksonville to various places in Florida. He has never held himself out as a common carrier.\n From statements made at the bar, it would appear that the appellant was engaged in the business above mentioned when the act was passed, and hence that he would \n\n[283 U.S. 553, 562]\n\u00a0\n be entitled to a certificate, provided he complied fully with the provisions of the act. By the terms of the act, such compliance would be necessary. The appellant did not apply for a certificate, and the principle is well established that, when a statute, valid upon its face, requires the issue of a license or certificate as a condition precedent to carrying on a business or following a vocation, one who is within the terms of the statute, but has failed to make the required application, is not at liberty to complain because of his anticipation of improper or invalid action in administration. Gundling v. Chicago, \n177 \nU.S. 183, 186\n, 20 S. Ct. 633; Lehon v. Atlanta, \n242 \nU.S. 53, 55\n, 56 S., 37 S. Ct. 70; Hall v. Geiger-Jones Co., \n242 \nU.S. 539, 553\n, 554 S., 37 S. Ct. 217, L. R. A. 1917F, 514, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 643. This principle, however, is not applicable where a statute is invalid upon its face and an attempt is made to enforce its penalties in violation of constitutional right. In the present instance, the appellant has been arrested and held for trial. He is in jeopardy, and the state court, entertaining his application for discharge, has denied the constitutional right asserted. The question of the validity of the statute, upon which the prosecution is based, is necessarily presented.\n The statute on its face makes no distinction between common carriers and a private carrier such as the appellant. It applies, without any stated exception, to every auto transportation company within the statutory definition, and this admittedly included the appellant. It not only required an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity but that this should be accompanied by a schedule of tariffs, and no such certificate was to be valid without the giving of a bond by the applicant for the protection both of the public against injuries and of the persons or property carried. The state commission was explicitly vested with authority to supervise 'every' auto transportation company that was embraced within the definition, to fix or approve its rates and charges, to regulate its service, to prescribe its method \n\n[283 U.S. 553, 563]\n\u00a0\n of keeping accounts which should set up adequate depreciation charges, and generally to make rules governing its operations. Schedules of rates of 'every such auto transportation company' were to be open to the public and all alterations in tariffs were to be subject to the commission's control. On the face of the statute, the scheme was obviously one for the supervision and control of those carriers which, by reason of the nature of their undertaking or business, were subject to regulation by public authority in relation to rates and service. No separate scheme of regulation can be discerned in the terms of the act with respect to those considerations of safety and proper operation affecting the use of highways which may appropriately relate to private carriers as well as to common carriers. All carriers within the act, whether public or private, are put by the terms of the statute upon precisely the same footing. All must obtain certificates of public convenience and necessity upon like application and conditions. It is true that the statute does not in express terms demand that a private carrier shall constitute itself a common carrier, but the statute purports to subject all the carriers which are within the terms of its definition to the same obligations. Such a scheme of regulation of the business of a private carrier, such as the ppel lant, is manifestly beyond the power of the state. See Michigan Public Utilities Commission v. Duke, \n266 U.S. 570\n, 576-578, 45 S. Ct. 191, 36 A. L. R. 1105; Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n271 \nU.S. 583, 592\n, 46 S. Ct. 605, 47 A. L. R. 457.\n If it be said that the statute contemplated the severability of its requirements in providing (section 18) that, if any of its provisions were held to be unconstitutional, the validity of the remaining portions should remain unaffected, the answer is that no line of severance is indicated in the terms of the act. The effect of this saving clause is merely that, if one provision is struck down as invalid, others may stand. But, until such separation has been \n\n[283 U.S. 553, 564]\n\u00a0\n accomplished by judicial decision, the statute remains with its inclusive purport, and those concerned in its application have no means of knowing definitely what eventually will be eliminated and what will be left. This was the situation which confronted the appellant when obedience to the statute was demanded and punishment for violation was sought to be inflicted.\n If, ignoring the explicit comprehensiveness of their requirements, it could be said that the provisions of the statute should be severed, so as to afford one scheme for common carriers and another for private carriers such as the appellant, the result would be to make the statute, until such severance was determined by competent authority, void for uncertainty. Either the statute imposed upon the appellant obligations to which the state had no constitutional authority to subject him, or it failed to define such obligations as the state had the right to impose with the fair degree of certainty which is required of criminal statutes. Considered as severable, the statute prescribed for private carriers 'no standard of conduct that it is possible to know.' International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 216, 221\n, 34 S. Ct. 853, 855; Collins v. Kentucky, \n234 \nU.S. 634, 638\n, 34 S. Ct. 924; United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., \n255 \nU.S. 81\n, 41 S. Ct. 298, 14 A. L. R. 1045; Weeds, Inc., v. United States, \n255 \nU.S. 109\n, 41 S. Ct. 306; Connally v. General Construction Co., \n269 \nU.S. 385, 391\n, 46 S. Ct. 126. It is idle to say that one could take a statute of this sort, establishing requirements binding upon private and common carriers alike, and divide its terms so as to make a valid scheme applicable to private carriers. The Legislature could not thus impose upon laymen, at the peril of criminal prosecution, the duty of severing the statutory provisions and of thus resolving important constitutional questions with respect to the scope of a field of regulation as to which even courts are not yet in accord.\n The construction placed upon the statute by the Supreme Court of the state does not avoid the difficulty. \n\n[283 U.S. 553, 565]\n\u00a0\n It should be observed that this is not an action in equity where the enforcement of a statute awaits the final determination of the court as to validity and scope. There is no controversy as to the facts, and the appellant has been held liable to the penalties of the act for his disobedience to it as it stood when it was enacted. He was entitled at that time to assert his constitutional right by virtue of the invalidity of the statute upon its face. Apart from this consideration, the construction of the statute by the state court does not determine what terms of the statute are binding upon private carriers such as the appellant. The court states that 'the provisions of the statute that are legally applicable only to common carriers are not intended to be applied to, and are not applicable to, corporations or persons who are not common carriers,' and that 'the provisions of the statute that are legally applicable to private carriers for compensation are capable of being effectuated, leaving the provisions that are legally applicable only to common carriers to be applied to such common carrirs a  are covered by the statute.' But the court does not point out what provisions are 'legally applicable' to private carriers. The decision thus aims to remove the constitutional objection of invalid application only by creating another constitutional objection of lack of appropriate certainty. Had the Legislature written into the statute itself that it was binding upon private carriers 'only so far as the provisions are legally applicable,' it would have transcended the permissible limits of statutory indefiniteness.\n Among the provisions of the statute binding upon those who apply for and obtain certificates of public convenience and necessity is one that a bond, or insurance policy, approved by the state commission, shall be furnished in order to afford security for the public against injuries as well as for the protection of persons and property transported. If we leave on one side the requirement that a \n\n[283 U.S. 553, 566]\n\u00a0\n certificate holder, who is a private carrier, shall give a bond or policy for the goods carried by him, irrespective of his contract with his employer whose goods he carries, and if we consider only the provision for the protection of the public with respect to the use of the highways, another constitutional difficulty is encountered, that is, of an unconstitutional discrimination. If the provisions of the act were treated as severable, and requirements relating to the safety of the public are separately considered, we are brought to the terms of the act with respect to those who are required to obtain certificates of public convenience and necessity and thus to supply the stipulated security. The act provides that the term 'auto transportation company,' upon which the obligations of the act are imposed, shall not include 'any transportation company engaged exclusively in the transporting agricultural, horticultural, dairy or other farm products and fresh and Salt Fish and Oysters and Shrimp from the point of production to the assembling or shipping point enroute to primary market, or to motor vehicles used exclusively in transporting or delivering dairy products.' The point with respect to this discrimination is not that a distinction is made between common carriers and private carriers, but between private carriers themselves, although they are alike engaged in transporting property for compensation over public highways between fixed termini or over a regular route.\n The principle that the state has a broad discretion in classification in the exercise of its power of regulation is constantly recognized by the decisions of this Court. Central Lumber Co. v. South Dakota, \n226 \nU.S. 157, 161\n, 33 S. Ct. 66; Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373, 382\n, 384 S., 35 S. Ct. 342, L. R. A. 1915F, 829; Bekins Van Lines v. Riley, \n280 \nU.S. 80, 82\n, 50 S. Ct. 64; Silver v. Silver, \n280 \nU.S. 117, 123\n, 50 S. Ct. 57; Carley & Hamilton v. Snook, \n281 \nU.S. 66, 73\n, 50 S. Ct. 204, 68 A. L. R. 194. But the constitutional guaranty of equal protection of the laws is interposed against discriminations that are entirely \n\n[283 U.S. 553, 567]\n\u00a0\n arbitrary. In determining what is within the range of discretion and what is arbitrary, regard must be had to the particular subject of the state's action. In the present instance, the regulation as to the giving of a bond or insurance policy to protect the public generally, in order to be sustained, must be deemed to relate to the public safety. This is a matter of grave concern as the highways become increasingly crowded with motor vehicles, and we entertain no doubt of the power of the state to insist upon suitable protection for the public against injuries through the operations on its highways of carriers for hire, whether they are common carriers or private carriers. But, in establishing such a regulation, there does not appear to be the slightest justification for making a distinction between those who carry for hire farm products, or milk or butter, or fish or oysters, and those who carry for hire bread or suar, or tea or coffee, or groceries in general, or other useful commodities. So far as the statute was designed to safeguard the public with respect to the use of the highways, we think that the discrimination it makes between the private carriers which are relieved of the necessity of obtaining certificates and giving security, and a carrier such as the appellant, was wholly arbitrary, and constituted a violation of the appellant's constitutional right. 'Such a classification is not based on anything having relation to the purpose for which it is made.' Air-Way Electric Appliance Corporation v. Day, \n266 \nU.S. 71, 85\n, 45 S. Ct. 12, 15; Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., \n184 \nU.S. 540, 563\n, 564 S., 22 S. Ct. 431; Southern Railway Co. v. Greene, \n216 \nU.S. 400, 417\n, 30 S. Ct. 287, 17 Ann. Cas. 1247; Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 332\n, 333 S., 42 S. Ct. 124, 27 A. L. R. 375; Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, \n277 \nU.S. 32, 37\n, 48 S. Ct. 423.\n For these reasons, we hold that the statute was invalid as applied to the appellant, and it is unnecessary to consider the questions that have been raised with respect to the validity of the provision for the mileage tax, separately considered. The judgment is reversed and the \n\n[283 U.S. 553, 568]\n\u00a0\n cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","127":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSMITH v.

Howard McCaleb, of New Orleans, La., for petitioner.\n Mr. Arthur C. Brown, of Tulsa, Okl., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opiion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Oklahoma to enjoin the infringement of letters patent No. 1,379,224, May 24, 1921, and No. 1,507,440, September 2, 1924 ( and also three other patents not here involved), issued to Owen P. Smith, the petitioner's intestate, for improvements in devices for dog races. A special master was appointed to hear and determine the issues. The master reported that each of the patents was valid and infringed. The District Court approved the report, and entered a decree for injunction, and for recovery, upon a bond given under the order of the Court, of damages. This decree was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 38 F.(2d) 170. This decision was in conflict with that the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in American Electric Rabbit Racing Association v. Smith, 26 F.(2d) 1016, affirming, without discussion, the decree of the district Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana (21 F.( 2d) 366) which held patents No. 1,379,224 and No. 1,507,440 to be valid and infringed. In view of this conflict, this Court granted a writ of certiorari in the instant case. 281 U.  714, 50 S. Ct. 410\n\n\n These patents were also before the District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, in Smith v. Springdale Amusement Park, where the bill of complaint was dismissed for want of infringement (39 F.(2d) 92) and the decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, 40 F.(2d), 173; certiorari granted October 13, 1930, \n282 \nU.S. 823\n, 51 S. Ct. 37, 75 L. Ed. -.\n Patent No. 1,379,224. The claims in suit are numbers 1 and 2, as follows:\n\n\n[282 U.S. 784, 786]\n\u00a0\n\n'1. In a dog racing amusement, a race course suited for dogs, a casing extending aroung the outer side of the race course and provided with a longitudinal opening, a mechanical conveyer including a track extending around the race course and located within the casing, and a conveyer car mechanically operated upon said track and provided with an arm extending through the longitudinal opening of the casing in a projecting position over the track and adapted to carry a lure, and a wheel rotatably mounted on and supporting the arm at the projecting end thereof.\n\n'2. In an amusement, the combination of a race course suited for dogs, a covered rail track adjacent said course on one side, a conveyor car mechanically operated upon said track, a horizontally extending arm hinged to said car extending midway of said course, a wheel rotatably mounted near the end of said arm, and resting upon the ground, a platform supported by said arm and a lure or quarry mounted upon said platform for attracting the dogs.'\n\n The prior art shows various contrivances for carrying an artificial lure around a track in front of racing dogs. Hind, 1884 (British, No. 4274 ), described an inanimate lure moved by means of a rope traveling along a sunken trough. Pinard, 1887 (No. 362,396), proposed a lure-carrier dragged upon the ground by a cable winding upon a drum at the end of the track. Moss, 1896 (British, No. 9058), showed a device, on the order of an electric trolley system, with a rail laid on the race course. Walsh, 1898 ( No. 611,876), placed his conveyor car adjacent to the track and separated from it by a fence, and provided an arm reaching over the fence and connected with another arm, pliant or stiff, which extended downward to the lure-carrying mat dragging on the ground. Smith 1912 (No. 1,038,504), provided an underground track, within and beneath the race course, and a conveying mechanism hidden from view and carrying the lure which \n\n[282 U.S. 784, 787]\n\u00a0\n was visible above the ground Everett, 1913 (No. 1,052,807), followed Smith, using an underground cable.\n Smith, in the combination for which the patent in suit (No. 1,379,224) was issued, placed his covered rail track adjacent to the race course, and the connected the cooperating elements of conveyor car and lure by an arm horizontally extending over the course. The distinctive feature of his invention is set forth in claim 1 as 'an arm extending through the longitudinal opening of the case in a projecting position over the track and adapted to carry a lure, and a wheel rotatably mounted on and supporting the arm at the projecting end thereof'; and, in claim 2, as 'a horizontally extending arm hinged to said car extending midway of said course, a wheel rotatably mounted near the end of said arm, and resting upon the ground, a platform supported by said arm and a lure or quarry mounted upon said platform for attracting the dogs.'\n The petitioner asserts that by his apparatus, Smith surmounted the difficulties encountered in the impracticable devices of the prior art and led to commercial success. The Circuit Court of Appeals in the instant case. while finding that there was no infringement, had no doubt that Smith's device was an improvement over the prior art and assumed that it was patentable. 38 F.(2d) at page 171. We make the same assumption. Smith's improvement, however, was in a limited field. There was manifestly no invention in a combination consisting of a rail track, with a casing adjacent to the course, a conveyor car, and an arm projecting over the course and connected with a mechanical lure carried in advance of racing dogs. Patentability could be predicated of Smith's improvement, only by reason of the distinctive feature of the arm which he employed.\n The differences in the respondents' apparatus. Which are urged as avoiding infringement, are that the respond- \n\n[282 U.S. 784, 788]\n\u00a0\n ents use a rigid horizontal arm, that it is not hinged to the car, that there is no wheel, and that the arm has no ground support at its free end; and, further, that the respondents has located their conveyor housing on the inner side of the race course, while claim 1 of the patent puts the casing on the outer side. We may at once dispose of the latter point, as we find no basis for the conclusion that the invention of the patent is limited to a location of the casing on the outer side of the course. There is no such limitation in claim 2. The important question is whether the patent covers a rigid horizontal lure-carrying arm without ground support.\n It appears from the file wrapper that in the application, which resulted in patent No. 1,379,224. Smith made, among others, the following claim:\n'3. In an amusement, the combination of a race track suited for dogs, a covered rail track adjacent said course, a conveyor car mechanically operated upon said track, an arm attached to said car extending midway of said course, a wheel rotatably mounted on said arm and a lure mounted on said arm.'\n\n This claim was rejected on the prior patent to Walsh (No. 611,876). Another claim (then numbered 4) was allowed as originally presented, and is claim 2 of the patent. Smith did not contest the rejection of original claim 3, above mentioned, but proposed an amendment which related to the casing. This amendment was rejected 'on either Walsh or Moss,' the examiner stating 'that Moss is provided with a housing and it would not be invention to provide Walsh with one.' Without further contest, Smith the canceled the rejected claim 3 and substituted what is now claim 1 of the patent. On comparing the claim as thus allowed and the rejected claim, it appears that the important difference was that instead of claiming 'an arm attached to said car extending midway of said course, a wheel rotatably \n\n[282 U.S. 784, 789]\n\u00a0\n mounted on said arm, and a lure mounted on said arm,' the claim was made to read 'an arm extending through the longitudinal opening of the casing in a projecting position over the track and adapted to carry a lure, and a wheel rotatably mounted on and supporting the arm at the projecting end thereof.'\n The petitioner insists that the gist of Smith's invention was 'the straight out lurecarrying arm laterally extending and operating exclusively in a substantially horizontal plane.' But it will be observed that the rejected and abandoned claim was the broad one of 'an arm attached to said car extending midway of said course,' nd that the new claim, as proposed and allowed, did not specify a horizontal arm alone. The essential difference in the allowed claim lay in the specification of the wheel 'as supporting the arm at the projecting and thereof.' Claim 2 ( original claim 4), which was allowed without question, specified a horizontal arm hinged to the car and resting on a wheel. A rigid, horizontal arm, without hinge or wheel, was not the subject of either claim.\n The case, in our opinion, thus calls for the application of the principle that where an applicant for a patent to cover a new combination is compelled by the rejection of his application by the Patent Office to narrow his claim by the introduction of a new element, he cannot after the issue of the patent broaden his claim by dropping the element which he was compelled to include in order to secure his patent. Shepard v. Carrigan, \n116 \nU.S. 593, 597\n, 6 S. Ct. 493. As this Court said in I. T. S. Rubber Company v. Essex Rubber Company, \n272 \nU.S. 429, 443\n, 47 S. Ct. 136, 141: 'If dissatisfied with the rejection he should pursue his remedy by appeal; and where, in order to get his patent, he accepts one with a narrower claim, he is bound by it. Shepard v. Carrigan, supra (116 U. S.) 597 (6 S. Ct. 493); Hubbell v. United States, \n179 \nU.S. 77, 83\n, 21 S. Ct. 24. Whether the examiner was right or wrong in rejecting the original claim, the court is not to inquire. Hubbell v. \n\n[282 U.S. 784, 790]\n\u00a0\n United States, supra (179 U. S.) 83 (21 S. Ct. 24). The applicant having limited his claim by amendment and accepted a patent, brings himself within the rules that if the claim to a combination be restricted to specified elements, all must be regarded as material, and that limitations imposed by the inventor, especially such as were introduced into an application after it had been persistently rejected, must be strictly construed against the inventor and looked upon as disclaimers. Sargent v. Hall Safe & Lock Company, \n114 \nU.S. 63, 86\n, 5 S. Ct. 1021; Shepard v. Carrigan, \n116 \nU.S. 598\n, 6 S. Ct. 493 ( 29 L. Ed. 723) supra; Hubbell v. United States, \n179 \nU.S. 85\n, 21 S. Ct. 24 ( 45 L. Ed. 95) supra. The patentee is thereafter estopped to claim the benefit of his rejected claim or such a construction of his amended claim as would be equivalent thereto. Morgan Envelope Company v. Albany Paper Company, \n152 \nU.S. 425, 429\n, 14 S. Ct. 627.'\n The petitioner resorts to the doctrine of equivalents, insisting that the rigid horizontal arm of the respondents is to be treated as the equivalent of the arm of the patent, and that the limiting specifications of the claims may be ignored. What has already been said disposes of this contention, for where a patentee has narrowed his claim, in order to escape rejection, he may not 'by resort to the doctrine of equivalents, give to the claim the larger scope which it might have had without the amendments, which amount to disclaimer.' Weber Electric Company v. Freeman Electric Company, \n256 \nU.S. 668, 677\n, 678 S., 41 S. Ct. 600, 603; I. T. S. Rubber Company v. Essex Rubber Company, supra. It should also be observed that the difference here was both in structure and in mode of operation and result. Petitioner's witness testified that Smith 'built cars with rigid arms and had the arms snap off,' and 'that is why he went to the wheel and hinge. It reduces the friction there, i guess you would call it, crystallizing the arm from the vibration. If the arm was at the end and no wheel to support it, it would naturally drag on the track.' Respondents' witness testified that the difference in the arm they used, which does not in \n\n[282 U.S. 784, 791]\n\u00a0\n clude the wheel for supporting the arm, is that when the arm 'has a wheel under the end as it runs over the track, it doesn't have any vibration'; that vibration makes the lure 'jump up and down' giving it a more lifelike appearance.\n We agree with the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals that infringement o le tters patent No. 1,379,224, was not established.\n Patent No. 1,507,440. This patent is for 'Housing for Conveyor Cars and Tracks.' It relates to the casing element called for by patent No. 1, 379,224. The claims as originally presented were rejected 'as indefinite and as aggregations.' Other claims were substituted, which included claim 1 of the patent, as allowed, as follows:\n'1. In a housing for covering tracks and cars having laterally extending arm operated upon said track, the combination of posts set in the ground at the sides of said track, timbers attached to said posts to form a frame, and boards attached to said timbers and posts to form a continuous enclosure above said track, and having a continuous opening in one side of said housing adapted to permit extension of the laterally extending arm therethrough, and truss rods attached to the closed side of the housing adapted to support the side of said housing above the said continuous opening.'\n\n All the elements in this claim were old. So far as the continuous opening 'adapted to permit extension of the laterally extended arm' is concerned, there was anticipation by Bertram, 1903, No. 729,120, whose housing for a third or electric rail disclosed a similar method of contact with an outside track, in providing for a casing (enclosing the electric rail) 'in which is formed a longitudinal slot or opening.' A comparison of claim 1 of the patent with the other claims which were rejected and canceled, shows that the distinctive features of the claim allowed were that the opening was placed 'in one side of said \n\n[282 U.S. 784, 792]\n\u00a0\n housing' and that there was a specification of a particular sort of support, that is, 'truss rods attached to the closed side of the housing.' In other claims allowed, the reference is to 'adjustable stay rods.'\n The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in the instant case, questioned the patentability of the device and said that if patentability existed at all, it must depend upon the truss rod support or the adjustable stay rods, neither of which the respondents use. We agree with this statements, and we are also of the opinion, as was the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (Smith v.

American Electric Rabbit Association v. Smith (C. C. A.) 26 F. (2d) 1016\n\n\n Patent No. 1,379,224 was before this Court in Smith v. Magic City Kennel Club, decided February 25, 1931. \n282 \nU.S. 784\n, 51 S. Ct. 291, 292. Referring to the prior art, the Court found that the patentee's improvement was in a limited field. There was no invention in a combination consisting of a covered rail track, conveyor car and an arm projecting over the course and connected with a mechanical lure carried before racing dogs. The pten t could be sustained only by virtue of the distinctive feature of the arm employed. This was described in claim 1 as 'an arm extending through the longitudinal opening of the casing in a projecting position over the track and adapted to carry a lure, and a wheel rotatably mounted on and supporting the arm at the projecting end thereof,' and, in claim 2, as 'a horizontally extending arm hinged to said car extending midway of said course, a wheel rotatably mounted near the end of said arm, and resting upon the ground, a platform supported by said arm and a lure or quarry mounted upon said platform for attacting the dogs.' The Court reached the conclusion that a rigid, horizontal arm, without hinge or wheel, was not the subject of either claim. In this view, the device of the defendant does not infringe.\n Patent No. 1,507,440, relating to 'Housing for Conveyor Cars and Tracks,' we have held to be invalid for want of invention. Smith v. Magic City Kennel Club, supra. \n\n[283 U.S. 121, 123]\n\u00a0\n Patent No. 1,507,439 is for an improvement in starting cages for racing dogs. The single claim is as follows:\n'In a starting cage for racing dogs, a frame comprising a boxlike structure divided into a plurality of compartments and comprising walls formed of wire mesh partially covered with fabric, individual rear doors for each of the compartments and a single front door hinged at its upper end to the top walls of the frame, divergent inclined members secured to the top of the said frame and extending upwardly and outwardly beyond the face of the front door and having their outer ends in the plane of the side walls of the box-like structure, springs secured to the outer ends of said inclined members and to the door and lying in the plane of the hinges, and a latch at the bottom of the cage for coaction with the lower edge of the front door to hold the front door normally closed against the tension of said springs, said springs adapted to raise the front door upon release of the latch.'\n\n In the light of the proceedings in the Patent Office upon the rejection of earlier claims, the claim can have but a narrow application. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the particular sort of spring support and the wire mesh partitions partially covered with fabric, as well as the other elements, are but forms of construction within the range of ordinary mechanical skill. There was an utter absence of invention justifying the issue of this patent.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","129":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSMOOT SAND & GRAVEL CORPORATION v.

It was brought originally in the Circuit Court of Arlington County, Virginia, and on the petition of the defendant the Smoot Sand and Gravel Company was removed to the District \n\n[283 U.S. 348, 350]\n\u00a0\n Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Virginia. That Court dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction, but the decree was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 44 F.(2d) 342. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court, \n283 \nU.S. 812\n, 51 S. Ct. 346, 75 L. Ed. -.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals states that the sole question presented is whether the boundary line between Virginia and the District of Columbia is at high or at low water mark on the Virginia side of the Potomac, and that is the only question argued here. In view of the previous decisions and intimations of this Court is, does not need extended discussion now.\n It must be assumed, notwithstanding some suggestion of ancient controversies, that the title of Maryland was that conveyed to Lord Baltimore by the charter of Charles I. and ran to and along the farther bank of the Potomac River. Marine Railway & Coal Co. v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 47, 63\n, 42 S. Ct. 32. This means that the boundary was the usual high water mark, Oklahoma v. Texas, \n260 U.S. 606\n, 626, et seq., 43 S. Ct. 221; so that the only question is whether anything has happened since to change the original line. At the present stage of this old discussion the most important inquiry is raised by the supposed contradiction between the language of this Court in settling the decree in Maryland v. West Virginia, \n217 \nU.S. 577\n, 30 S. Ct. 630, and that in the later case of Marine Railway & Coal Co. v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 47\n, 42 S. Ct. 32. With regard to that it is to be noticed that Mr. Justice Day who wrote the earlier decision took part also in the later and seems to have agreed with it. There was no adequate reason why he should not have agreed. Maryland v. West Virginia was a suit to settle a portion of the boundary line between those States. The decision could not affect the District of Columbia. It relied primarily upon an arbitration upon the issue in 1877, in which it was admitted that the original boundary was \n\n[283 U.S. 348, 351]\n\u00a0\n high water mark on the Virginia side, but held that the low water mark was established by prescription. The arbitration also relied upon a Compact of 1785, 1 Dorsey, Maryland Laws, 1692-1839, p. 187; 12 Hening, Virginia Statutes, p. 50, giving it a construction to which we cannot agree. Prescription was a sufficient reason for the decision, and could not be invoked against the District. The Compact is seen in a different light in Marine Railway & Coal Co. v. United States. As stated in \n257 \nU.S. 64\n, 42 S. Ct. 32, Article 7 gave the citizens of each State full property in the shores of the River adjoining their lands and the privilege of carrying out wharves etc., but left the question of boundary open to long continued disputes. The rights of private citizens established by Article 7 were further cared for by Article 12 giving citizens of each State having lands in the other liberty to transport to their own State the produce of such lands or to remove their effects, free of any charge or tax. But private ownership does not affect State boundaries. Some argument is based on the word 'shores.' But that is merely a topographical indication and imports nothing as to the sovereignty over them. We adhere to the opinion that the Compact has no bearing on the present case.\n Decree reversed.\n\n Separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n Twenty years ago (1910), in Maryland v. West Virginia, \n217 \nU.S. 577\n, 30 S. Ct. 630, it was definitely ruled by this Court (and rightly so) that under the compact of 1785 btwee n Virginia and Maryland the uniform southern boundary of the latter state was low-water mark on the right bank of the Potomac. Proper solution of the present controversy depends upon the precise question there decided. Fair consistency and proper regard for titles along the \n\n[283 U.S. 348, 352]\n\u00a0\n ten-mile river front in the District of Columbia, I think, demand that we follow what was thus solemnly declared.\n Marine Ry. Co. v. United States (1921) \n257 \nU.S. 47\n, 42 S. Ct. 32, 34, was a proceeding begun by them to recover land on the Potomac river front at Alexandria originally below low-water mark. Notwithstanding, the essential point there was distinct from the one upon which Maryland v. West Virginia turned, the opinion carefully affirmed that 'the former decisions of the Court must be followed so far as they go'-a truism, I submit, still worthy of acceptation. And the further observation that 'the compact between Virginia and Maryland in 1785 also seems to us to have no bearing upon the case' is plainly correct, whether relevant or not.\n As Marine Ry. Co. v. United States related only to land below low- water mark, the compact of 1785, of course, was inapplicable to the controversy. That compact did not undertake to settle titles to lands so located. No more did it apply to lands in Baltimore city.\n In such circumstances the suggestion that the writer of the opinion in Maryland v. West Virginia by assenting to Marine Ry. Co. v. United States gave his approval to a doctrine directly opposed to the one he had definitely expressed for the Court seems to me without substance. The Court, through him, had ruled that the Maryland boundary extended to low- water mark on the south side. Why should he object to an opinion which, after expressly accepting former decisions, held that land lying in the river north of that line had been part of Maryland?\n The challenged decree should be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","130":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN RY. CO. v. HUSSEY(1931)\nNo. 342\nArgued: Decided: April 13, 1931\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles A. Houts, of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. Wm. H. Allen, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondent. \n\n[283 U.S. 136, 137]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover for personal injuries suffered by the plaintiff, the respondent here, a passenger upon a train of the petitioner and on the petitioner's road, in consequence of a collision with a train of the Evansville, Indianapolis and Terre Haute Railway Company, a corporation of Indiana. The petitioner to meet the plaintiff's prima facie case, relied upon the following facts. The collision happened in Indiana on September 2, 1927. A statute of that State authorized Indiana railroads to cross and unite with any other railroad before constructed and required the intersected road to unite with the new one in forming such intersections and connections and to grant specified facilities. 3 Burns, Annotated Statutes, 1926,  12931. Other sections authorized and ratified contracts for running trains of one road over the tracks of another, and made the railroad so running its trains over the tracks of another liable to the same extent as if it owned the tracks.\n In January, 1922, the petitioner made a contract with the Evansville road providing for a connection with the petitioner's line to enable the Evansville Company to carry coal from mines near Francisco, where the lines connected, to Oakland City, a distance of about seven miles. The Evansville Company was to reimburse the petitioner for the 150-foot connection and was to maintain it at its own cost in all respects in accordance with the requirements of the petitioner. The petitioner was to have control of operations on this section of their main track, to provide for the movement of the Evansville trains over the section, and to furnish the necessary operators, signal men. etc. The Evansville crews and employees while in the section were to be governed by the petitioner's rules and amenable to orders of the petitioner's superintendent. We think it unnecessary to quote further in order \n\n[283 U.S. 136, 138]\n\u00a0\n to show the relation in which the petitioner stood to this portion of its own road. This contract was offered in evidence by the defendant but was excluded subject to its exception. It is before us in the record, but as it does not change the petitioner's liability in this case it does not matter whether it is let in or kept out. See Fairmont Creamery Co. v. Minnesota, \n274 \nU.S. 1, 5\n, 47 S. Ct. 506, 52 A. L. R. 163.\n The two roads are connected of course by a switch. The lever by which the switch was opened and shut was connected with a signal device so arranged that when the switch was closed and it was safe to go ahead on the main line a green light was shown. If the switch was open a red right meant stop. Just before the collision an Evansville train was waiting on the sidetrack to go to Oakland City. The switch had been opened in expectation of going on, but the conductor, learning that there was not time before the probable arrival of a Southern train, ordered it to be closed. A man started to do it but seeing the green light displayed supposed that it had been closed already and did nothing. In fact, owing to a defect in the switch, the green light had failed to give way to the red as it should have done, and when the Southern train arrived its engineer was led to think that the way ove th e main track was clear. The train went ahead but was turned on to the sidetrack and ran into the waiting Evansville train, causing disaster and death.\n The Court instructed the jury that if the plaintiff was injured as a direct result of the negligence of either company or of both they should find for the plaintiff. There was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff and the judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 42 F.(2d) 70. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n282 \nU.S. 826\n, 51 S. Ct. 75, 75 L. Ed. -.\n The petitioner states the question as being whether it is liable for an injury to a passenger caused by the negligence of the employees of the other company in failing to \n\n[283 U.S. 136, 139]\n\u00a0\n close the switch that connected the two roads, which was installed, owned and operated exclusively by and for the benefit of the Evansville Company; was so constructed, maintained and operated under the compulsion of a statute of Indiana, and was so constructed and operated under a contract expressly authorized by the statutes of Indiana. But this statement needs a good deal of qualification. It is doubtful whether the statute in the word 'unite' contemplates more than intersection. It certainly did not require the contract that the petitioner made. The terms of that contract were of the petitioner's own choosing and they gave the paramount authority to the Southern road. As was to be expected the main track remained its own and subject to its control. There is no dispute that the collision was caused by an interruption of the course of the main line through the misplacement of a switch in consequence of a defect in the signal. The Southern road had not abdicated its control over its main line or its ultimate authority over the switch. If, as the jury must have found under the instructions, the defect in the light was not due to a sudden inevitable accident but could have been avoided by care, the Southern road owed that care to the plaintiff, and therefore whether the men immediately in contact with the switch were employees of the Evansville or the Southern Company the Southern was responsible for this condition to the passengers in its train.

Jeffries, all of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Charles A. Lich, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was instituted in a state court and removed to the District Court for Eastern Missouri. Respondent, the minor plaintiff, averred in his declaration that, as he was in the act of crossing defendant's track on Bond avenue, East St. Louis, he was struck by a train and seriously injured. The negligence alleged was failure to sound a \n\n[284 U.S. 190, 192]\n\u00a0\n bell or other signal when the train was approaching the crossing, failure to maintain a proper and sufficient lookout, and failure to comply with an order of the Illinois Commerce Commission requiring defendant to stop all trains and flag the crossing before they crossed Bond avenue. The answer was a general denial.\n At the trial both parties presented proofs, and at the close of the plaintiff's case, as well as at the conclusion of all the evidence, the defendant moved for a binding direction, which was refused. The trial judge withdrew from the jury's consideration all the specifications of negligence except that which charged a failure to stop the train and flag the crossing before proceeding over Bond avenue. He charged the jury that, if these precautions were omitted, the verdict should be for plaintiff, but, if they were observed, they should find for defendant. The jury found for the plaintiff, and on appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a judgment entered upon that verdict. \n1\n This Court granted certiorari. \n2\n We need consider only whether upon the whole case defendant was entitled to a binding direction.\n The tracks on which the accident occurred extend from the railway company's main line to a freight yard and run approximately north and south, almost parallel with, and some seventy-five feet west of, Eighth street. Bond avenue, which extends eastwardly and westwardly, crosses the tracks at a right angle. The train involved in the accident consisted of a locomotive running tender-first and pulling fifty freight cars in a northerly direction from the freight yard towards the main tracks.\n The plaintiff called four adult witnesses who were at the scene of the accident, none of whom saw its actual occurrence. Each of them was to the east of the train and each first noticed the plaintiff lying to the west of it after the locomotive and several cars had completely crossed Bond avenue. \n\n[284 U.S. 190, 193]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff, who was between five and six years of age at the time of the accident, testified that he was about to cross the railroad tracks from west to east and was struck by the front of the locomotive. He stated repeatedly that the train was coming from the north, whereas it is beyond question that it was coming from the south; and he described the portion of the locomotive which struck him as the front end which had the cowcatcher and headlight on it, although it is beyond question that the tender was in front. He twice denied that he saw the train before he was struck, then said he saw it half a block distant when he was on the first track (there were three tracks at this point and the train was on the easternmost), and did not see it again until just as he was struck. He did not testify whether or not the train stopped.\n A boy, nine years old at the date of the occurrence, who was standing near the crossing, deposed that several boys traversed the tracks before the train reached Bond avenue, and that the plaintiff, following these boys, was hit by it and thrown back. He stated there was a box car in front of the locomotive, and that the car had passed before the plaintiff received his injury. He probably confused the tender with a box car, and his description of the accident would indicate that the plaintiff collided with the side of the locomotive near the cab.\n A girl, who was ten years old at the time of the accident, testified that she saw the occurrence from the vestibule of a schoolhouse located south of Bond avenue and west of the railroad tracks. She stated that she was able to see what happened by looking through an aperture in a board fence caused by the falling down of a gate in the fence. The only gate to which her testimony could have referred was at a point so situated with reference to the crossing as to render it impossible for one standing where she was to see the crossing through the gateway. She says the locomotive struck the plaintiff, but does not say \n\n[284 U.S. 190, 194]\n\u00a0\n what part of it came into contact with him. She also states that the train did not stop before entering upon the crossing.\n Only one of the adult witnesses stated the train did not come to a stop. She was a passenger in an automobile, traveling west on Bond avenue, which was held up by the passing train. This testimony was shown to have no adequate foundation by her admission that when she first noticed the train the locomotive and several cars had crossed Bond avenue.\n It is argued that it may be inferred from the speed of the train when some of the witnesses observed it crossing other streets as well as Bond avenue, and from a guess of the engineer as to the time required to get up such speed after a full stop, that none could have been made at Bond avenue. But the argument amounts to mere speculation in view of the limited scope of the witnesses' observation, the down grade of the railway tracks at the point, and the time element involved. Compare Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Coogan, \n271 \nU.S. 472\n, 46 S. Ct. 564. Five witnesses for defendant testified that a full stop was made and the crossing flagged, and that no one was hit by the rear of the tender, which was the front of the train.\n An examination of the record requires the conclusion that the evidence on the issue whether the train was stopped before crossing Bond avenue was so insubstantial and insufficient that it did not justify a submission of that issue to the jury. Gulf, M. & N. R. Co. v. Wells, \n275 \nU.S. 455\n, 48 S. Ct. 151; Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Jones, \n276 \nU.S. 303\n, 48 S. Ct. 308; New York Central R. Co. v.

Ct. 281.\n There is no proof whatever that the alleged failure to stop before entering the crossing was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury. Such direct testimony as there is on his behalf indicates a collision between him and the side \n\n[284 U.S. 190, 195]\n\u00a0\n of the train after the front part of it, which in this case was the rear end of the tender, had passed him; and all of the evidence both for plaintiff and for defendant is consistent with this view of what happened. It is clear that on this ground also a binding direction in favor of the defendant should have been given.\n The judgment is reversed and the case remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 47 F.(2d) 3. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] \n283 \nU.S. 815\n, 51 S.

Catesby Jones, of New York City, for respondent. \n\n[283 U.S. 284, 285]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Dreyfus & Co. purchased wheat at $1.38 1\/2 a bushel, C. I. F. Montreal. The wheat was shipped on the steamship Glenorchy from Port Arthur to Montreal by the seller, who had insured it, with respondent, for buyer's account, at a valuation of $1.42 a bushel, the risk to begin immediately after the loading of the vessel. Dreyfus also effected insurance, with petitioner, covering 'increased value' of the grain above its C. I. F. cost. That value was stipulated to be the difference between C. I. F. cost and the highest market value per bushel between the day of sailing and the day on which cargo would have arrived at destination if the loss had not occurred, plus 5 cents. The applicable clause of the policy, so far as material, is printed in the margin. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n A collision of the Glenorchy with the steamship Leonard B. Miller resulted in a total loss of the cargo. In a proceeding for limitation of liability, brought by the owner of the Miller, in the District Court for Northern Ohio, both vessels were held at fault, and the cargo owner recovered $309,500 for the insured wheat, with interest from \n\n[283 U.S. 284, 286]\n\u00a0\n the date of collision. That was its value, at $1.54 3\/4 a bushel, at the time and place of shipment, which is the value recoverable for loss of cargo by maritime tort. The Vaughan & Telegraph, 14 Wall. 258, 267, 268.\n Respondent paid Dreyfus $284,000, the full amount of its policy. Petitioner paid $62,500, stipulated to be the amount due on its policy at the rate of 31 1\/4 cents per bushel, the difference between $1.38 1\/2, the C. I. F. price, and $1.69 3\/4, the highest market value within the ten days after departure required for the voyage, plus 5 cents. Both insurers intervened in the limitation proceeding, each asserting its right to be subrogated to the cargo owner's right of recovery. The special commissioner to whom the matter was submitted reported that petitioner and respondent were coinsurers of cargo, and that they should share pro rata, in proportion to their policy liabilities, in the cargo owner's recovery, after payment of his exens es in litigating the claim.\n The District Court decreed payment to respondent of $284,000, the full amount of its insurance liability, with interest from the date of loss, and payment to petitioner of the balance, after deducting the commissioner's fees. In re Columbia S. S. Co., 28 F.(2d) 540. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. Standard Marine Ins. Co. v. Scottish Metropolitan Assur. Co., 39 F. (2d) 436. Both courts thought that as the insurer, on payment of the loss, is subrogated only to such right of recovery as the insured had, Phoenix Ins. Co. v. Erie & W. Trans. Co., \n117 \nU.S. 312\n, 6 S. Ct. 750, and as the latter had no right to recover for any increase in value beyond that at the time and place of shipment, petitioner, so far as it had insured such an increase in value, was not entitled to participate in the recovery, since participation would amount to the assertion of a right of recovery which the insured did not possess.\n This court granted certiorari, \n282 \nU.S. 822\n, 51 S. Ct. 32, 75 L. Ed . -, October 13, 1930, on a petition setting up, as grounds for the writ, the importance of the question and an alleged conflict between the decision \n\n[283 U.S. 284, 287]\n\u00a0\n below and that of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Brown v. Merchants' Marine Insurance Co., 152 F. 411.\n Coinsurers, on payment of the loss insured against, are subrogated to the right of the insured to recover from one who causes the loss, and participate pro rata in the recovery. As the policy liabilities of the present insurers were occasioned by the destruction of the same cargo by the same peril, and as the insured has recovered for its destruction by that peril, the question precisely stated is not whether petitioner may assert, by way of subrogation, a right of recovery which the insured did not possess, but the extent to which petitioner is entitled to be subrogated to the right which the insured did possess and assert against the colliding vessels. Hence the disposition of the present case turns upon the question whether petitioner and respondent were coinsurers against the same risk, or independent insurers against different risks.\n We think it clear, and it seems to be conceded, that, since respondent is an insurer against loss of cargo, petitioner, if its policy be regarded as insuring against loss of profits of the venture, is not a coinsurer with respondent, even though the liability of both accrued by reason of the destruction of the cargo by the same peril. The very purpose of insurance of profits is to protect the insured against risk of loss which is not covered by insurance upon the cargo itself. See Canada Sugar- Refining Co. v. Insurance Co. of North America, \n175 \nU.S. 609\n, 20 S. Ct. 239; Patapsco Insurance Co. v. Coulter, 3 Pet. 222; 1 Arnould on Marine Insurance (11th Ed.)  236, 287, 288; cf. O'Brien v.

A. 1917C, 722.\n When the insured thus separates and separately insures two distinct elements of risk-value of cargo and profits which may be earned on it-both insurers cannot share by subrogation in his right to recover against wrongdoers for cargo damage alone. For, while destruction of the cargo has in a sense occasioned both losses, the wrong- \n\n[283 U.S. 284, 288]\n\u00a0\n doer is liable for one and not the other; and hence there is no right of recovery by the insured for loss of profits to which the insurer against that loss may be subrogated. The object of subrogation is to make indemnity to the insured, up to the amount of the policy, the measure of the liability of the insurer, and that is its justification. But the liability would be less than such indemnity if the insurer could be subrogated to a right of recovery by the insured for a loss other than that insured against.\n Petitioner insists that its insurance was not of anticipated profits, but of increased value of the property, not differing from any other insurance on property, with respect to which the insurer when called upon to contribute to loss of it va lue becomes entitled to share pro rata with other insurers of the property in any recovery by the insured against third persons causing the loss. Brown v. Merchants' Marine Insurance Co., supra. But this argument leaves out of account the peculiar nature of insurance on increased value of cargo over its value at the port of departure which, for present purposes, is to be distinguished from insurance on hull or any other property, increase in value of which may be embraced in, and recovered under policies insuring against a loss of the property.\n It has long been the accepted rule, in the law of maritime torts and of maritime insurance, that the recoverable value of cargo lost or damaged at sea is that at time and place of shipment, without allowance for increase of value or anticipated profits. Smith v. Condry, 1 How. 28, 35; The Vaughan & Telegraph, supra, 14 Wall. pages 267, 268; The Scotland, \n105 U.S. 24\n, 35; The Aleppo, Fed. Cas. No. 158; The Umbria (C. C. A.) 59 F. 489, 490; Phillips on Insurance,  1226, 1229; 1 Arnould on Marine Insurance (11th Ed.)  365; see The Old Reliable (C. C. A.) 262 F. 108, 110; Guibert & Sons v. The George Bell (D. C.) 3 F. 581, 584, 585. The cargo is placed at risk when the voyage begins. Its value then is the measure of the risk and of the loss suffered if the cargo \n\n[283 U.S. 284, 289]\n\u00a0\n is lost or damaged on the voyage. Market value at destination on the date of the loss is not the measure, for that was not its value at the place of loss. To attribute to the cargo the market value at destination is to measure, not the loss, but the profits which would have accrued if the voyage had been completed, and if the market price at the time of loss had continued to be the market price at the time of arrival.\n Petitioner's policy describes the insurance as upon 'increased value on grain.' But so far as it covered the increase in value over that at the port of departure, it insured against a loss not covered by the insurance on cargo, or recoverable against tort-feasors causing cargo loss. See Strass v. Spillers & Bakers, (1911) 2 K. B. 759; British Marine Insurance Act, Dec. 21, 1906, 6 Edw. 7, c. 41,  16, which is a codification of the common law. Gow, Sea Insurance, p. v. (Preface). The liability on the policy above the value of cargo at Port Arthur represents profits, as valued, which it might reasonably be assumed would have accrued to insured if the cargo had reached Montreal. But whether that coverage may for all purposes be correctly described as insurance of profits or not, it can stand on no different footing in the present case, for, like insurance of profits, it covers risk of loss not covered by the cargo policy; and the reasons which preclude the insurer of profits from participating, by way of subrogation, in the recovery of the insured for maritme torts causing loss of the cargo should exclude petitioner from participation here.\n Had petitioner's policy been the usual one on cargo, but to the extent only that it was not covered by respondent's insurance, petitioner's liability would not have been the 31 1\/4 cents a bushel which it paid, the difference between C. I. F. price and the stipulated market value at destination, but 12 3\/4 cents a bushel, the difference between the value insured by respondent and sound value at port of shipment. To \n\n[283 U.S. 284, 290]\n\u00a0\n that extent petitioner and respondent would both have been insurers of cargo, entitled to share in the recovery of insured for its full loss, as the courts below permitted them to do. But petitioner's liability was for the larger amount; and, so far as bound to pay in excess of the value at shipment, it insured against a risk for which there could be no recovery on the cargo policy, and for which the owner did and could make no recovery against wrongdoers for the destruction of the cargo. Petitioner may not be subrogated to a recovery for a loss against which it did not insure.\n Brown v. Merchants' Marine Insurance Co., supra, on which petitioner relies, does not supor t its contention. In that case, a vessel having an actual value of $140,000 was insured by several time policies, in which it was valued at $75,000. There were also policies aggregating $12,200 on 'disbursements and\/or increased value.' The vessel was sunk in collision and became a total loss, which the underwriters paid. As both vessels were at fault, the damage was divided; and the insured recovered, as net collision damages, after payment of expenses, less than the $75,000 value stated in the policies.\n It was held that the insurers of increased value were entitled to share in the recovery pro rata with the other underwriters. But the recovery was based upon the loss of the total value of the ship, which, in that case, was the subject pro tanto of the increased value insurance. Without regard to possible rights of priority, among the several underwriters, to the fund which all were entitled to claim by subrogation, the question there was different from that presented here, where the fund recovered was for a loss against which petitioner did not insure, and to which for that reason it may not be subrogated.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'To cover 'Increased Value' on grain owned by the Assured or in which the Assured may have an interest, such 'Increased Value' for the purposes of this insurance, to be arrived at by taking the difference between the C.

Stephens, both of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n Mr. John Lord O'Brian, Asst. to Atty. Gen., for the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. Louis H. Strasser, of St. Louis, Mo., for appellee carriers.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in equity brought in the court below against the United States, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and some fifty interstate railway carriers, under the provisions of the Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219, abolishing the Commerce Court and transferring its jurisdiction to the several district courts of the United States. The provisions conferring jurisidction are found in chapter 309, 36 Stat. 539 (- \n\n[283 U.S. 235, 237]\n\u00a0\n U. S. C., title 28,  41 (27,28), 28 USCA  41 (27, 28) and include the following cases:\n'First. All cases for the enforcement, otherwise than by adjudication and collection of a forefeiture or penalty or by infliction of criminal punishment, of any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission other than for the payment of moeny.\n\n'Second. Cases brought to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend in whole or in part any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.'\n\n Appellant sought to enjoin and annul an order of the Commission dismissing two complaints filed with that body to recover damages for numerous alleged overcharges exacted by the carriers. The petition also prayed that the Commission be directed by the court to enter an order 'granting the prayer of said complaints, and finding that petitioner has been overcharged by an amount which is equal to the difference between the rates assessed by said defendant carriers and the rates lawfully applicable to said petitioner's shipments, and ordering a further hearing, if necessary, for the purpose of determining the amount of money to be paid by the defendant carriers to petitioner by way of reparation. ...' The complaints alleged overcharges on about 2,500 shipments of pertroleum products originating at Wood River, Ill., or at points west of the Mississippi River, and carried to various eastern destinations. It is unncessary, in view of our conclusions, to state the case at length. It is fully set out in the reports of the Commission (113 I. C. C. 597; 139 I. C. C. 297), and in the opinion of the court below.\n The rates assailed before the Commission were those charged according to what is called the 'Kelley tariff.' Appellant contended that there were in effect specific rates taking precedence which were lower and should have been applied. The order of the court below, constituted of three judges as required by the Urgent Deficiencies Act, \n\n[283 U.S. 235, 238]\n\u00a0\n was, in effect, a dismissal of the petition for the want of jurisdiction, 41 F.(2d) 836; and with that action we agree.\n First. The Commission made two reports, one following the original hearing, and the other after reargument. The order based upon these reports simply dismissed the complaints; that is to say, the Commission refused to grant any affirmative relief to the appellant. It is plain that the order is negative both in form and effect. The jurisdiction of the district courts (transferred from their predecessor, the Commerce Court), in this class of cases, embraces (1) those brought for the 'enforcement' of orders of the Commission, and (2) those brought to 'enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend in whole or in part' such orders. It is obvious that this language was not intended to apply to puely negative orders. A negative order which denies relief without more compels nothing requiring enforcement, and contemplates no action susceptible of being stayed by an injunction or affected by a decree setting aside, annulling, or suspending the order.\n The question in the present case depends upon the correct interpretation and application of the second subdivision of the act conferring jurisdiction, referred to and quoted supra; and necessarily the district court was without jurisdiction under the settled construction of that provision by which the authority of the court is limited to the review of affirmative orders, with 'power to relieve parties in whole or in part from the duty of obedience to orders which are found to be illegal.' Procter & Gamble v. United States, \n225 U.S. 282\n, 292-293, 32 S. Ct. 761, 765; Manufacturers Ry. Co. v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 457, 483\n, 38 S. Ct. 383; Piedmont & Nor. Ry. v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 469, 477\n, 50 S. Ct. 192.\n Second. The case before the Commission did not, as contended, involve merely the construction of the written words employed in a rate tariff-a simple question of law; but required consideration of matters of fact and \n\n[283 U.S. 235, 239]\n\u00a0\n the application of expert knowledge for the ascertainment of the technical meaning of the words and a correct appreciation of a variety of incidents affecting their use. It is evident from an inspection of the record, as the Commission in its first report said, that 'both cases concern unusually complicated and technical tariff situations,' the proper determination of which called for the exercise of the trained judgment of that body of experts, 'appointed by law and informed by experience.' Illinois Cent. etc., R. R. v. Inter. Com. Comm., \n206 \nU.S. 441, 454\n, 27 S. Ct. 700. And to that body, in the 700. And to that body, in the must be left.\n In Gt. No. Ry. v. Merchants Elev. Co., \n259 U.S. 285\n, 291-292, 42 S. Ct. 477, 479, this court held that to determine whether a rate is reasonable for the future, or whether a shipper has been wronged by the exaction of an unreasonable or discriminatory rate in the past, preliminary resort to the Commission is required.\n'It is required because the inquiry is essentially one of fact and of discretion in technical matters; and uniformity can be secured only if its determination is left to the Commission. Moreover, that determination is reached ordinarily upon voluminous and conflicting evidence, for the adequate appreciation of which acquaintance with many intricate facts of transportation is indispensable, and such acquaintance is commonly to be found only in a body of experts. But what construction shall be given to a railroad tariff presents ordinarily a question of law which does not differ in character from those presented when the construction of any other document is in dispute.'\n\n Then, after pointing out that resort to extrinsic evidence is sometimes necessary to establish the meaning of words appearing in a written instrument, in which case the function of construction is preceded by the determination of a matter of fact, the court said that:\n\n\n[283 U.S. 235, 240]\n\u00a0\n ... where the document to be construed is a tariff of an interstate carrier, and before it can be construed it is necessary to determine upon evidence the peculiar meaning of words or the existence of incidents alleged to be attached by usage to the transaction, the preliminary determination must be made by the Commission; and not until this determination has been made, can a court take jurisdiction of the controversy. If this were not so, that uniformity which it is the purpose of the Commerce Act to secure could not be attained.'\n There being nothing to suggest that the Commission acted arbitrarily or without evidence to support its conclusions, or that it transcended its constitutional or statutory powers, Int. Com. Comm. v. Union Pacific R. R., \n222 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 32 S. Ct. 108, it follows that, part from what is said in support of the ground first above stated, the order of the Commission was not susceptible of review by the courts. Compare Int. Comm. Comm. v. Del., L. & ,W. R. R., \n220 \nU.S. 235, 251\n, 31 S. Ct. 392; United States v. Louis. & Nash. R. R., \n235 \nU.S. 314, 320\n, 35 S. Ct. 113; East Tenn. etc., Ry. Co. v. Interstate Com., \n181 \nU.S. 1, 27\n, 21 S. Ct. 516.\n Third. But putting the foregoing grounds entirely aside, and assuming the correctness of appellant's contentions to the contrary, nevertheless, having regard to the remedy invoked and the relief sought by the petition, we think the district court was without jurisdction. Section 9 of the Interstate Commerce Act, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, 382 (U. S. C., title 49,  9 (49 USCA  9)), provides that a claim for damages against a common carrier may be brought before the Commission by complaint, or by an action in a federal district court of competent jurisdiction, but that the claimant or claimants 'shall not have the right to pursue both of said remedies, and must in each case elect which one of \n\n[283 U.S. 235, 241]\n\u00a0\n the two methods of procedure herein provided for he or they will adopt.' Having elected to proceed and having proceeded to a determination before the Commission, appellant was, by force of this provision, precluded from seeking reparation upon the same claims by the alternative method of procedure. Compare Geo. A. Hormel & Co. v. Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. (C. C. A.) 283 F. 915, 918.\n It is true that appellant sought to enjoin and set aside the order of the Commission, but only as a preliminary step toward obtaining, by a decision upon the merits of the claims, the same relief it failed to secure from the Commission. This is made clear by the prayer of the petition, already quoted, namely, that the Commission be directed by the court to grant the prayer of the complaints; find that petitioner has been overcharged to the extent set forth; and order a further hearing, if necessary, to determine the amount to be paid by way of reparation. It is of no importance that the adjudication sought is to take the form of a direction to the Commission to grant the prayer of the complaints filed before that body, etc., instead of a plenary judgment to the same end, for the prayer in that form is nothing less than an attempt to avoid the statute by indirection. In substance and in principle the claim before the Commission and the claim before the court were the same, and the district court was without authority to entertain the controversy. It is hardly necessary to add that, since section 9 contemplates that the jurisdiction in such cases shall be exercised by the federal district courts as ordinarily constituted, the specially constituted court is without jurisdiction to dispose of an action under that section even if brought in the District Court in the first instance.\n The order of dismissal is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","134":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTANDARD OIL CO.

Dorr, of New York City, for secondary appellants.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Thomas D. Thacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the United States in June, 1924, in the federal court for northern Illinois, to enjoin further violation of section 1 and section 2 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Trust Act July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209 (15 USCA  1, 2). The violation charged is an illegal combination to create a monopoly and to restrain interstate commerce by controlling that part of the supply of gasoline which is produced by the process of cracking. Control is alleged to be exerted by \n\n[283 U.S. 163, 166]\n\u00a0\n means of seventy-nine contracts concerning patents relating to the cracking art. The parties to the several contracts are named as defendants. Four of them own patents covering their respective cracking processes, and are called the primary defendants. Three of these, the Standard Oil Company of Indiana, the Texas Company, and the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, are themselves large producers of cracked gasoline. The fourth, Gasoline Products Company, is merely a licensing concern. The remaining forty-six defendants manufacture cracked gasoline under licenses from one or more of the primary defendants. They are called secondary defendants.\n Upon the filing of the answers, which denied the violation charged, the case was referred to a special master to take and report the evidence to the court, together with his findings of fact and conclusions of law. Although the Attorney General had filed an expediting certificate1 on February 24, 1925, it was not until January 20, 1930, that the District Court entered its final decree. This hearings before the master extended over nearly three years. The evidence, including 327 exhibits, fills more than 4,300 pages of the printed record. The master's report, which occupies 240 pages, is devoted largely to a discussion of the seventy- three patents and seventy-nine license contracts. The master found that the primary defendants had not pooled their patents relating to cracking processes; that they had not monopolized or attempted to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce in gasoline; and that none of the defendants had entered into any combination in restraint of trade. He recommended that the bill be dismissed for want of equity. After a hearing, on 273 exceptions filed by the Government, the District Court granted some of the relief asked. 33 F. (2d) 617. \n\n[283 U.S. 163, 167]\n\u00a0\n The primary defendants and twenty-five of the secondary defendants appealed to this Court. An order of severance was entered; and the injunction was stayed.\n The issues to which most of the evidence was addressed have been eliminated. The violation of the Sherman Act now complained of rests substantially on the making and effect of three contracts entered into by the primary defendants. The history of these agreements may be briefly stated. For about half a century before 1910, gasoline had been manufactured from crude oil exclusively by distillation and condensation at atmospheric presure. When the demand for gasoline grew rapidly with the widespread use of the automobile, methods for increasing the yield of gasoline from the available crude oil were sought. It had long been known that from a given quantity of crude, additional oils of high volatility could be produced by 'cracking'; that is, by applying heat and pressure to the residum after ordinary distillation. But a commercially profitable cracking method and apparatus for manufacturing additional gasoline had not yet been developed. The first such process was perfected by the Indiana Company in 1913; and for more than seven years this was the only one practiced in America. During that period the Indiana Company not only manufactured cracked gasoline an large scale, but also had licensed fifteen independent concerns to use ats process and had collected, prior to January 1, 1921, royalties aggregating $15,057,432.46.\n Meanwhile, since the phenomenon of cracking was not controlled by any fundamental patent, other concerns had been working independently to develop commercial processes of their own. Most prominent among these were the three other primary defendants, the Texas Company, the New Jersey Company, and the Gasoline Products Company. Each of these secured numerous patents covering its particular cracking process. Beginning in \n\n[283 U.S. 163, 168]\n\u00a0\n 1920, conflict developed among the four companies concerning the validity, scope, and ownership of issued patents. One infringement suit was begun; cross-notices of infringement, antecedent to other suits, were given; and interferences were declared on pending applications in the Patent Office. The primary defendants assert that it was these difficulties which led to their executing the three principal agreements which the United States attacks; and that their sole object was to avoid litigation and losses incident to conflicting patents.\n The first contract was executed by the Indiana Company and the Texas Company on August 26, 1921; the second by the Texas Company and Gasoline Products Company on January 26, 1923; the third by the Indiana Company, the Texas Company, and the New Jersey Company, on September 28, 1923. The three agreements differ from one another only slightly in scope and terms. Each primary defendant was released thereby from liability for any past infringement of patents of the others. Each acquired the right to use these patents thereafter in its own process. Each was empowered to extend to independent concerns, licensed under its process, releases from past, and immunity from future claims of infringement of patents controlled by the other primary defendants. And each was to share in some fixed proportion the fees received under these multiple licenses. The royalties to be charged were definitely fixed in the first contract; and minimum sums per barrel, to be divided between the Taxes and Indiana companies, were specified in the second and third. These royalty provisions, and others, will be detailed later.\n First. The defendants contend that the agreements assailed relate solely to the issuance of licenses under their respective patents; that the granting of such licenses, like the writing of insurance, New York Life Insurance Co. v. Deer Dodge County, \n231 \nU.S. 495\n, 34 S. Ct. 167, is not interstate commerce; and that the Sherman Act is therefore inapplicable. This \n\n[283 U.S. 163, 169]\n\u00a0\n contention is unsound. Any agreement between competitors may be illegal if part of a larger plan to control interstate markets. Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 \nU.S. 38\n, 24 S. Ct. 307; Shawnee Compress Co. v. Anderson, \n209 \nU.S. 423\n, 28 S. Ct. 572. Such contracts must be scrutinized to ascertain whether the restraints imposed are regulations reasonable under the circumstances, or whether their effect is to suppress or unduly restrict competition. Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 231, 238\n, 38 S. Ct. 242; Paramount Famous Lasky Corp. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 30, 43\n, 51 S. Ct. 42. Moreover, while manufactre i  not interstate commerce, agreements concerning Ed. 145. Moreover, while manufacture is to fix the price of goods entering into interstate commerce, or which have been executed for that purpose, are within the prohibitions of the Act. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 397\n, 25 S. Ct. 276; Coronado Coal Co. v. United Mine Workers, \n268 \nU.S. 295, 310\n, 47 S. Ct. 551; United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., \n273 \nU.S. 392\n, 47 S. Ct. 377, 50 A. L. R. 989. And pooling arrangements may obviously result in restricting competition. Compare Northern Securities Co. v. United States, \n193 \nU.S. 197, 326\n, 24 S. Ct. 436. The limited monopolies granted to patent owners do not exempt them from the prohibitions of the Sherman Act and supplementary legislation. Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Co. v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 20\n, 33 S. Ct. 9; Virtue v. Creamery Package Manufacturing Co., \n227 \nU.S. 8\n, 33 S. Ct. 202; Compare United Shoe-Machinery Co. v. United States, \n258 \nU.S. 451\n, 42 S. Ct. 363; United States v. General Electric Co., \n272 \nU.S. 476\n, 47 S. Ct. 192.2 Hence the necessary \n\n[283 U.S. 163, 170]\n\u00a0\n effect of patent interchange agreements, and the operations under them, must be carefully examined in order to determine whether violations of the Act result. Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Co. v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 20\n, 33 S. Ct. 9.3\n Second. The Government contends that the three agreements constitute a pooling by the primary defendants of the royalties from their several patents; that thereby competition between them in the commercial exercise of their respective rights to issue licenses is eliminated; that this tends to maintain or increase the royalty charged secondary defendants and hence to increase the manufacturing cost of cracked gasoline; that thus the primary defendants exclude from interstate commerce gasoline which would, under lower competitive royalty rates, be produced; and that interstate commerce is thereby unlawfully restrained. There is no provision in any of the agreements which restricts the freedom of the primary defendants individually to issue licenses under their own patents alone or under the patents of all the others; and no contract between any of them, and no license agreement with a secondary defendant executed pursuant thereto, now imposes any restruction upon the quantity of gasoline to be produced, or upon the price, terms, or conditions of sale, or upon the territory in which sales may be made. \n4\n The only restraint thus charged is that necessarily arising out of the making and effect of the provisions for cross-licensing and for division of royalties.\n The Government concedes that it is not illegal for the primary defendants to cross-license each other and the respective licensees; and that adequate consideration can egal ly be demanded for such grants. But it contends \n\n[283 U.S. 163, 171]\n\u00a0\n that the insertion of certain additional provisions in these agreements renders them illegal. It urges, first, that the mere inclusion of the provisions for the division of royalties, constitutes an unlawful combination under the Sherman Act (15 USCA  1 et seq.) because it evidences an intent to obtain a monopoly. This contention is unsound. Such provisions for the division of royalties are not in themselves conclusive evidence of illegality. Where there are legitimately conflicting claims or threatened interferences, a settlement by agreement, rather than litigation, is not precluded by the Act. Compare Virtue v. Creamery Package Co., \n227 \nU.S. 8, 33\n, 33 S. Ct. 202. An interchange of patent rights and a division of royalties according to the value attributed by the parties to their respective patent claims is frequently necessary if technical advancement is not to be blocked by threatened litigation. \n5\n If the available advantages are upon on reasonable terms to all manufacturers desiring to participate, such interchange may promote rather than restrain competition. \n6\n Compare American Column & Lumber Co. v. United States, \n257 U.S. 377\n, 414-15, 42 S. Ct. 114, 21 A. L. R. 1093; Maple Flooring Manufacturers Association v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 563, 578\n, 45 S. Ct. 578, 592\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 163, 172]\n\u00a0\n Third. The Government next contends that the agreements to maintain royalties violate the Sherman Law because the fees charged are onerous. The argument is that the competitive advantage which the three primary defendants enjoy of manufacturing cracked gasoline free of roylty, while licensees must pay to them a heavy tribute in fees, enables these primary defendants to exclude from interstate commerce cracked gasoline which would, under lower competitive royalty rates, be produced by possible rivals. This argument ignores the privileges incident to ownership of patents. Unless the industry is dominated, or interstate commerce directly restrained, the Sherman Act does not require cross-licensing patentees to license at reasonable rates others engaged in interstate commerce. Compare Bement v. National Harrow Co., \n186 \nU.S. 70\n, 22 S. Ct. 747; United States v. General Electric Co., \n272 \nU.S. 476, 490\n, 47 S. Ct. 192. The allegation that the royalties charged are onerous is, standing alone, without legal significance;7 and, as will \n\n[283 U.S. 163, 173]\n\u00a0\n be shown, neither the alleged domination, nor restraint of commerce, has been proved.\n Fourth. The main contention of the Government is that even if the exchange of patent rights and division of royalties are not necessarily improper and the royalties are not oppressive, the three contracts are still obnoxious to the Sherman Act because specific clauses enable the primary defendants to maintain existing royalties and thereby to restrain interstate commerce. The provisions which constitute the basis for this charge are these. The first contract specifies that the Texas Company shall get from the Indiana Company one-fourth of all royalties thereafter collected under the latter's existing license agreements; and that all royalties received under licenses thereafter issued by either company shall be equally divided. Licenses granting rights under the patents of both are to be issued at a fixed royalty-approximately that charged by the Indiana Company when its process was alone in the field. By the second contract, the Taxas Company is entitled to receive one-half of the royalties thereafter collected by the Gasoline Products Company from its existing licensees, and a minimum sum per barrel for all oil cracked by its future licensees. The third contract gives to the Indiana Company one- half of all royalties thereafter paid by existing licensees of the New Jersey Company, and a similar minimum sum for each barrel treated by its future licensees,-subject in the latter case to reduction if the royalties charged by the Indiana and Texas companies for their processes should be reduced. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[283 U.S. 163, 174]\n\u00a0\n The alleged effect of these provisions is to enable the primary defendants, because of their monopoly of patented cracking processes, to maintain royalty rates at the level established originally for the Indiana process.\n The rate of royalties may, of course be a decisive factor in the cost of production. If combining patent owners effectively dominate an industry, the power to fix and maintain royalties is tantamount to the power to fix prices. 9 National Harrow Co. v. Hench (C. C.) 76 F. 667, affirmed (C. C. A.) 83 F. 36, 39 L. R. A. 299, see also (C. C.) 84 F. 226; Blount Manufacturing Co. v. Yale & Towne Maunfacturing Co. (C. C.) 166 F. 555. Where domination exists, a pooling of competing process patents, or an exchange of licenses for the purpose of curtailing the manufacture and supply of an unpatented product, is beyond the privileges conferred by the patents and constitutes a violation of the Sherman Act. The lawful individual monopolies granted by the patentstat utes cannot be unitedly exercised to restrain competition. Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Co. v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 20\n, 33 S. Ct. 9; United States v. New Departure Manufacturing Co. (D. C.) 204 F. 107; United States v. Motion Picture Patents Co. (D. C.) 225 F. 800, appeal dismissed, \n247 \nU.S. 524\n, 38 S. Ct. 578.

C.) 226 F. 62, appeal dismissed, \n255 \nU.S. 578\n, 41 S. Ct. 321.10 But an agreement for cross-licensing and division of royalties violates the Act only when used to effect a monopoly, or to fix prices, or to impose otherwise an unreasonable restraint upon interstate commerce. Compare Bement v. National Harrow Co., \n186 \nU.S. 70\n, 22 S. Ct. 747; Cement Manufacturers Protective Association v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 588, 604\n, 45 S. Ct. 586, 592; United States v. General Electric Co., \n272 \nU.S. 476, 490\n, 47 S. Ct. 192; United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., \n273 \nU.S. 392, 397\n, 47 S. Ct. 377, 50 A. L. R. 989. In the case at bar, the primary defendants own competing patented processes for manufacturing an unpatented product which is sold in interstate commerce; and agreements concerning such processes are likely to engender the evils to which the Sherman Act was directed. Compare United States v. International Harvester Co. (D. C.) 214 F. 987, appeal dismissed \n248 \nU.S. 587\n, 39 S. Ct. 5. We must, therefore, examine the evidence to ascertain the operation and effect of the challenged contracts.\n Fifth. No monopoly, or restriction of competition, in the business of licensing patented cracking processes resulted from the execution of these agreements. Up to 1920 all cracking plants in the United States were either owned by the Indiana Company alone, or were operated under licenses from it. In 1924 and 1925, after the cross-licensing arrangements were in effect, the four primary defendants owned or licensed, in the aggregate, only 55 per cent. of the total cracking capacity, and the remainder was distributed among twenty-one independently owned cracking processes. This development and commercial expansion \n\n[283 U.S. 163, 176]\n\u00a0\n of competing processes is clear evidence that the contracts did not concentrate in the hands of the four primary defendants the licensing of patented processes for the production of cracked gasoline. \n11\n Moreover, the record does not show that after the execution of the agreements there was a decrease of competition among them in licensing other refiners to use their respective processes. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n No monopoly, or restriction of competition, in the production of either ordinary or cracked gasoline has been proved. The output of cracked gasoline in the years in question13 was about 26 per cent. of the total gasoline production. Ordinary or straight run gasoline is indistinguishable from cracked gasoline and the two are either mixed or sold interchangeably. Uner these circumstances the primary defendants could not effectively control the sup- \n\n[283 U.S. 163, 177]\n\u00a0\n ply or fix the price of cracked gasoline by virtue of their alleged monopoly of the cracking processes, unless they could control, through some means, the remainder of the total gasoline production from all sources. \n14\n Proof of such control is lacking. Evidence of the total gasoline production by all methods, of each of the primary defendants and their licensees is either missing or unsatisfactory in character. \n15\n The record does not accurately \n\n[283 U.S. 163, 178]\n\u00a0\n show even the total amount of cracked gasoline produced,16 or the production of each of the licensees, or competing refiners. Widely variant estimates of such production figures have been submitted. These were not accepted by the master and there is no evidence which would justify our doing so.17\n No monopoly, or restriction of competition, in the sale of gasoline has been proved. On the basis of testimony relating to the marketing of both cracked and ordinary gasoline, the master found that the defendants were in active competition among themselves and with other refiners; that both kinds of gasoline were refined and sold in large quantities by other companies; and that the primary defendants and their licensees neither individually or collectively controlled the market price or supply of any gasoline moving in interstate commerce. There is ample evidence to support these findings. \n\n[283 U.S. 163, 179]\n\u00a0\n Thus it appears that no monopoly of any kind, or restraint of interstate commerce, has been effected either by means of the contracts or in some other way. In the absence of proof that the primary defendants had such control of the entire industry as would make effective the alleged domination of a part, it is difficult to see how they could by agreeing upon royalty rates control either the price or the supply of gasoline, or otherwise restrain competition. By virtue of their patents they had individually the right to determine who should use their respective processes or inventions and what the royalties for such use should be. To warrant an injunction which would invalidate the contracts here in question, and require either new arrangements or settlement of the conflicting claims by litigation, there must be a definite factual showing of illegality. Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 231, 238\n, 38 S. Ct. 242. \n\n[283 U.S. 163, 180]\n\u00a0\n Sixth. In the District Court, the Government undertook to prove the violation charged by showing that the three agreements challenged were made by the primary defendants in bad faith. The bulk of the testimony introduced by it, is directed to this issue and relates to the validity and scope of twenty-three jointly-used patents which were selected by it for attack. \n18\n This evidence was admitted, over objection, for the purpose of showing that these patents were either invalid or narrow in scope; that there was no substantial foundation for the alleged conflicts and threatened infringement suits; that these were a pretext; and that the patents had been secured, and their infringement was being asserted, merely as a means of lending color of legality to the making of the contracts by which competition would inevitably be suppressed. \n19\n The master found, after an elaborate review of the entire art, that the presumption of validity attaching to the patents had not been negatived in any way; that they merited a broad interpretation; that they had been acquired in \n\n[283 U.S. 163, 181]\n\u00a0\n good faith; and that the scope of the several groups of patents overlapped sufficiently to justify the threats and fear of litigation. The District Court stated that the particular claims should be interpreted narrowly, and that the respective inventions might be practised without infringement of adversely owned patents. But it confirmed the finding of presumptive validity and did not question the finding of good faith. It held that the patents were adequate consideration for the cross-licensing agreements and that the violation charged could not be predicated on patent invalidity. Inasmuch as the Government did not appeal from these findings, we need not consider any of the issues concerning the validity or scope of the cracking patents; and we accept the finding that they were acquired in good faith. Neither the findings nor the evidence on this issue supply any ground for invalidating the contracts. \n20\n\u00a0\n\n Seventh. The remaining issues in the case have become moot. The Government objected to a number of early Indiana Company licenses which contained certain territorial restrictions on the production of cracked gasoline; and also to a provision in the first contract between primary defendants, and in licenses thereunder, by which the Indiana Company secured an option to purchase a portion of the cracked gasoline manufactured in, or shipped into, its sales territory. At the hearing before the District Court it appeared that these provisions had never been enforced. Upon the court's request the objectionable clauses were voluntarily cancelled some months before the entry of the decree. Similarly, the propriety \n\n[283 U.S. 163, 182]\n\u00a0\n of certain blanket acknowledgments of patent validity in the first contract, and in a number of licenses under later contracts, were questioned by the lower court. At its suggestion, these provisions also were formally cancelled by the parties. As the relief here sought is an injunction, and hence relates only to the future, United States v. Hamburg- Amerikanische Packetfahrt-Actien Gesellschaft, \n239 \nU.S. 466, 475\n, 36 S. Ct. 212; the alleged validity of such provisions has become moot. Berry v. Davis, \n242 \nU.S. 468\n, 37 S. Ct. 208; Commercial Cable Co. v. Burleson, \n250 \nU.S. 360\n, 39 S. Ct. 512; Alejandrino v. Quezon, \n271 \nU.S. 528\n, 46 S. Ct. 600; United States v. Anchor Coal Co., \n279 \nU.S. 812\n, 49 S. Ct. 262.\n Eighth. The District Court accepted the Government's estimates of cracked gasoline production; found that the primary defendants were able to control both supply and price by virtue of their control of the cracking patents; held that although these patents were valid consideration for the cross-licenses, the agreement to maintain royalties was in effect a method for fixing the price of cracked gasoline; and concluded that a monopoly existed as a result of such agreements. This appears to be the only basis for the relief granted. But the widely varying estimates, relied upon to establish dominant control of the production of cracked gasoline were insufficient for that purpose. \n21\n And the court entirely disregarded not only the fact that the manufacture of the cracked is only a part of the total gasoline production, but also the evidence showing active competition among the defendants themselves and with \n\n[283 U.S. 163, 183]\n\u00a0\n others. Its findings are without adequate support in the evidence. The bill should have been dismissed.\n The Government now seeks no relief against the secondary defendants. It concedes that fifty-three of the seventy-nine contracts, originally set out in the petition, are wholly beyond attack, because they are licenses issued to secondary defendants prior to the execution by their licensors of the three main agreements challenged. As to the remaining contracts between primary and secondary defendants, the Government on this appeal agreed that the decree should be modified to declare such contracts voidable at the opion of the licensees. This modfica tion was assented to at the bar by counsel for the primary defendants. But as we are of the opinion that the decree should be reversed and the bill dismissed, we see no occasion for interfering with the present license arrangements.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Pursuant to the Act of February 11, 1903, c. 544, 32 Stat. 823, as amended by Act of June 25, 1910, c. 428, 36 Stat. 854 (15 USCA  28). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Historically, patent grants were only narrow exceptions to the general public policy against monopolies which developed from the Case of Monopolies, Moore 671, 11 Co. 84, and culminated in the Statute of Monopolies, 21 Jac.

A patent may be rendered quite useless, or 'blocked,' by another unexpired patent which covers a vitally related feature of the manufacturing process.

This agreement was renewed as to existing patents in 1925. See Epstein, The Automobile Industry, pp. 227-239, 361.

Compare Notes 11, 17 infra. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Payments received by the Texas and Indiana companies under the second and third contracts are divided equally by these companies pursuant to the terms of the first.

Cas. 1913D, 715. \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] There is no evidence in the record showing the ratio of defendants' processes to those of other companies after 1925. Ratios since then are indicated in the official Bureau of Mines surveys of cracking plants which, beginning in 1929, report the distribution of the various cracking processes. See Petroleum Refining Statistics, 1928, Department of Commerce, Bureau of Mines, Bull. 318, pp. 122-23; Id., Survey of Cracking Plants, January 1, 1930, Information Circular No. 6305, p. 6. \n[\nFootnote 12\n] Between the execution of the respective contracts and the bringing of this suit, the Indiana Company issued two new licenses, the Texas Company two, and Gasoline Products ten. Between the filing of the bill and May, 1925, the Gasoline Products Company appears to have issued ten additional new licenses. There is no evidence concerning the licensing operations of the other three primary defendants in this period. \n[\nFootnote 13\n] The estimates of the production of cracked gasoline, and other evidence upon which the injunction was issued in January, 1930, cover only the period to 1925. Much of this evidence, including statements of the production of two of the three producing primary defendants, relates to operations no later than 1924. Although frequently given in terms of barrels, production figures, where used in this opinion, have been uniformly converted into gallons. \n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] In addition to straight run and cracked gasoline, which are refined from crude oil, a third kind, known as natural-gas or casing-head gasoline, is produced from natural gas. In 1925 this method accounted for 7.6 per cent. of the total gasoline production. Petroleum Refining Statistics, 1926, Department of Commerce, Bureau of Mines, Bull. No. 289, pp. 57, 58. Because of its great volatility, natural-gas gasoline is now mainly used for blending with other types. See American Petroleum Institute, Petroleum Facts and Figures (2d Ed., 1929) pp. 152-154. Thus it increases the total amount of gasoline refined, and, to this extent, control of production of natural-gas gasoline might be necessary to secure complete domination of the gasoline refining industry. There is, however, no evidence as to the production or purchase of this type of gasoline by any of the primary defendants except the New Jersey Company and its subsidiaries, which in 1925 manufactured about one-fifth of all the natural-gas gasoline recovered. \n[\nFootnote 15\n] In 1924 the total gasoline production in gallons was 8,959,680,198; in 1925 it was 10,886,127,000. The New Jersey Company and its subsidiaries, as to which complete estimates alone are given in the record, produced by all methods 1,445,273,195 gallons, or about 16 per cnt. of the total in 1924; and 1,581,314,145 gallons, or about 14.5 per cent. in 1925. The Texas Company estimated its total production, exclusive of its licensees, for the year 1924 at 602,918,348 gallons, or about 6.6 per cent. of the total. These are the only estimates as to the total production of all kinds of gasoline. In the absence of definite figures as to such total gasoline production by all methods, domination of the refining industry by the three primary defendants cannot be shown. Compare Federal Trade Commission, Prices, Profits, and Competition in the Petroleum Industry, Sen. Doc. No. 61, 70th Cong. 1st Sess. p. 157 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] No Bureau of Mines statistics on the production of gasoline, distributed according to method of refining, exist for the period prior to January, 1925. See Petroleum Refining Statistics, 1916-25, Department of Commerce, Bureau of Mines, Bull. No. 280, p. 125. Hence all the statistics presented as to the total amount of cracked gasoline produced theretofore are only estimates. \n[\nFootnote 17\n] The Government estimated that in 1924 the total production of cracked gasoline amounted to 1,443,036,000 gallons. The New Jersey Company estimated that the total production in that year was 1,680,000,000 gallons; and an estimate based on a Bureau of Mines statement that cracked gasoline was 20 per cent. of the total, comes to 1,791,938,400 gallons. If the New Jersey figure is accepted as a base, it appears that in 1924, the Indiana Company produced 444,307,600 gallons of cracked gasoline, or 26.5 per cent. of the total; the Taxas Company, 316,552,110 gallons, or 18.8 per cent; and the New Jersey Company and its subsidiaries, 350,491,190 gallons, or 20.8 per cent. Thus, on this basis, these three primary defendants manufactured 66.1 per cent. of the total cracked gasoline in 1924. In reliance on its own estimated total production, which was the lowest submitted, the Government alleged that they manufactured 81.04 per cent. in the same year. The inaccuracy of all of these estimates of total production of cracked gasoline is aptly illustrated by the first official Bureau of Mines figures for the next year, 1925. See Note 16, supra. For that year the total cracked gasoline production is reported at 2,880,486, 000 gallons-or over a billion gallons more than the highest estimate for 1924. Compare Bull. 280, loc. cit. supra, Note 16.\n Moreover, to determine the total production of both primary and secondary defendants, the Government calculated the production of each licensee by dividing its royalty payments by varying estimates of the amount of royalty per gallon. Adding these amounts to its estimated production of the three producing primary defendants, it submitted that in 1921 the primary defendants and their licensees refined about 86 per cent. of the total cracked gasoline produced, and in 1924 about 94 per cent. But in most cases royalties were paid by the secondary licensees on the basis of the amount of 'charging stock' or residual oil treated. To determine a licensee's production from its royalty payments, it was thus first necessary to estimate the rate of conversion into finished cracked gasoline. Sufficient data for doing so accurately for each licensee was lacking. The rate of conversion differs with the type of installation, composition of stock treated, and plant efficiency, and the estimated conversion rates relied upon by the Government varied from 25 per cent. to 31 per cent. \n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] Prior to trial the United States propounded eighty-one interrogatories to each of the primary defendants, concerning the use of some seventy-three patents. These interrogatories were answered in detail with the reservation that the admissions of use were merely opinions of counsel, but that nevertheless each defendant believed adversely held patents to constitute a basis for suit. The Government selected twenty- three patents for attack. One hundred and thrity-one of the 273 exceptions filed by it to the master's report concern these patents. The evidence relating to them comprises five volumes of the present record. \n[\nFootnote 19\n] After the first hearing the master certified the question whether this evidence was admissible. The District Court held that it was. Nevertheless, in his final report the master stated that he was of the opinion that examination of the prior art could be made only for the purpose of determining whether the patents were useful, of adequate scope, and reasonably related to the contracts. He also ruled that it was not necessary to determine whether any of the ompe ting process patents actually infringed another. These rulings were not disturbed by the Court. \n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] The District Court also dismissed, upon the master's findings and recommendation, a supplementary petition against two additional defendants which charged that certain patents had been secured by fraud and that a conspiracy had been entered into to injure the owner of a competing cracking process. The United States did not appeal from this order. \n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] The Court apparently accepted, as accurate, the Government's estimates of cracked gasoline production, and stated: 'It is the actual production rather than 'cracking capacity' that is significant. To ascertain whether a monopoly exists we must look to the production rather than the capacity percentages.' 33 F.(2d) 617, 625. But the estimates of total cracked gasoline production cannot be accepted, and there was no adequate showing of the proportion actually manufactured by these defendants.

Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 270, 272]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In February, 1915, Stange made a return of taxable income for the year 1914, under the Revenue Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16, 38 Stat. 114, and paid the tax assessed thereon. In February, 1924, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue made a deficiency assessment. Proceedings for collection were instituted in March, 1925. In order to avoid distraint, Stange paid the amount assessed with interest, and duly made claim for a refund on the ground that the return made in 1915 had included all the income taxable. Upon the rejection of this claim, he filed a supplementary claim for a refund on the ground that the collection of the additional tax had been barred by the statute of limitations contained in section 250(d) of the Revenue Act of November 23, 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 265. After the lapse of six months without a determination by the Commissioner, he brought this suit in the Court of Claims to recover the money so paid. There he urged both contentions. In answer to the latter, the Government insisted that the statute had been waived by a written agreement signed by Stange in November, 1922, and by the Commissioner in March, 1923.

This court granted a writ of certiorari, limited 'to the questions involving the validity and effect of the waiver of the statute of limitations.' \n281 \nU.S. 707\n, 50 S. Ct. 238, 239\n\n\n No constitutional question is presented. Whether the petitioner is entitled to recover depends upon the construction and effect of section 250(d) and of the written agreement called the waiver. That section provides:\n'The amount of income, excess-profits, or war-profits taxes due ... under any return made ... under prior income, excess-profits, or war-proits tax Acts, \n\n[282 U.S. 270, 273]\n\u00a0\n or under section 38 of the Act entitled 'An Act to provide revenue, equalize duties, and encourage the industries of the United States, and for other purposes,' approved August 5, 1909, shall be determined and assessed within five years after the return was filed, unless both the Commissioner and the taxpayer consent in writing to a later determination, assessment, and collection of the tax; and no suit or proceeding for the collection of any such taxes due under this Act or under prior income, excess-profits, or war-profits tax Acts, or of any taxes due under section 38 of such Act of August 5, 1909, shall be begun, after the expiration of five years after the date when such return was filed, but this shall not affect suits or proceedings begun at the time of the passage of this Act. ...' 42 Stat. 265.\n\n The waiver provides:\n'C. H. Stange, of Merrill, Wisconsin, in consideration of the assurance given him by officials of the Income Tax Unit of the Bureau of Internal Revenue that his liability for all Federal taxes imposed by the act of Congress approved October 3, 1913, ... on his net income received from all sources in the year ended December 31, 1914 , ... shall not be determined except after deliberate, intensive, and thorough consideration, hereby waives any and all statutory limitations as to the time within which assessments based upon such liability may be entered. ...'\n\n First. It is contended that the waiver was of no effect because executed more than five years after the filing of the return. \n1\n The argument is that to give effect to a \n\n[282 U.S. 270, 274]\n\u00a0\n waiver executed after the expiration of the period of limitation would give to the statute a retroactive effect, which Congress cannot be presumed to have intended. There was no lack of power. Prior to the 1921 Act no legislation barred the enforcement of the liability for a tax under the Act of 1913 (38 Stat. 114). Taxes duly assessed could be collected at any time by suit. There was a three-year limitation on assessment2 ( section 2(E), 38 Stat. 169), which if duly made might be followed by distraint. But there was no limitation upon the time within which the tax liability could be enforced by suit without a prior assessment. \n3\n The 1921 Act was the first to interpose a limitation upon the right of the Government to enforce a tax liability already accrued. \n4\n It barred collection in \n\n[282 U.S. 270, 275]\n\u00a0\n any manner after five years only in case no waiver was given. Congress must have intended that a waiver should be operative even though before the passage of the act, five years had elapsed from the time the return had been filed. Among the earlier Revenue Acts referred to in section 250( d) was that of 1909, the returns under which were required to be filed more than ten years prior to the passage of the 1921 Act. Section 38, Third, 36 Stat. 114. And returns under the Revenue Act of 1913 were required to be filed more than six years before the passage of the 1921 Act. Section 2(D), 38 Stat. 168. The consent clause in section 250(d) deals broadly with all assessments and collections under past and future acts, and there is no indication of an intention to confine it to those few cases under the early revenue acts in which no return had been filed or a socalled common law waiver had been given prior to 1921. Unless it is to be rendered practically meaningless as applied to tax returns under these earlier acts, it must be construed to permit the execution of waivers after the period of five years. Moreover, there is the analogy of the rule that private debts barred by the statute of limitations may be effectively revived, after the bar has fallen, by a new promise without new consideration. Williston, Contracts,  160-184.\n Second. It is contended that the socalled waiver was inoperative because its provisions did not conform to section 250(d) of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 265), in that it waived 'any and all statutory limitations as to the time within which assessments based upon such liability way be entered,' but did not in terms refer to the 'determination' or 'collection' of the tax. \n5\n The argument is that Con- \n\n[282 U.S. 270, 276]\n\u00a0\n gress had, in respect to a waiver, prescribed an exact and mandatory procedure under which the Commissioner was authorized to defer action only if the taxpayer expressly waived the limitations on all three steps, determination, assessment, and collection-reliance being had on the use of the conjunctive 'and' in the section; that the statutory authority given the Commissioner to consent to a later performance of these three steps did not imply a like authority as to any one of them; that under section 250(d) the periods within which both assessment and collection must be made run concurrently five years from the filing of the return; and that nothing was accomplished by consenting to the assessment, since the assent to a later collection was withheld.\n We are of the opinion that the validity of a waiver under section 250( d) was not conditioned on the precise use of the three words therein mentioned.\n As pointed out in Florsheim Bros., etc., v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 453, 466\n, 50 S. Ct. 215, a waiver is not a contract, and the provision requiring the Commissioner's signature was inserted for purely administrative purposes and not to convert into a contract what is essentially a voluntary, unilateral waiver of a defense by the taxpayer. The ambit of the Commissioner's authority may be in many respects limited by the statute, Florsheim Bros., etc., v. United States, supra, at page 464, of 280 U. S., 50 S. Ct. 215, but no reason appears why it was essential that specific reference be made to the period for collection, or why he could not, with the taxpayer's consent, employ one word instead of three to secure the desired result. The waiver, in terms, was executed by the taxpayer in order 'that his liability ... might be determined' only after intensive and thorough reconsideration by the Commis- \n\n[282 U.S. 270, 277]\n\u00a0\n sioner. The parties cannot have intended to have the amount of the tax ascertained and to leave the taxpayer free to pay it or not. They clearly contemplated the entire procedure necessary to determination and collection of the tax. This does not mean that the distinctions between assessment and collection were to be disregarded, but merely that the employment of a single term comprehended both steps.\n In November, 1922, both parties understood that the tax would be assessed and collected after a proper consideration of the taxpayer's objections to any additional assessment. To secure sufficient time for this purpose, the socalled waiver was executed. The failure to insert in the written consent words expressly waiving the statutory limitation upon collection is explained by the belief prevailing prior to the decision in Bowers v. N. Y. & Albany Lighterage Company, \n273 \nU.S. 346\n, 47 S. Ct. 389, that distraint, the common method for coercing payment, was possible even when the statutory period for collection by suit had expired. That the parties at the time may have believed that collection was possible independent of any waiver, does not make less effective the instrument given for the purpose of tolling the limitation on the ultimate determination and collection of the tax. It must be assumed that an effective and not a futile act was intended.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] On this question, there has been conflict in the lower federal courts.

JACKSON(1931)\nNo. 183\nArgued: March 5, 1931Decided: May 18, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 527, 528]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Joseph W. Hutchinson, George W. Hufsmith, and James M. Ogden, all of Indianapolis, Ind., for appellants.\n Messrs. Wm. H. Thompson, of Indianapolis, Ind., and Martin A. Schenck and Clark McKercher, both of New York City, for appellee.\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 527, 530]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from the decree1 of a specially constituted District Court2 perpetually enjoining the appellants from enforcing against the appellee the provisions of chapter 207 of Acts of 1929 of the General Assembly of the state of Indiana. The appellee, by bill filed on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, charged that the \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 531]\n\u00a0\n statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution and two sections of the Constitution of Indiana. It averred, and the answer admitted, that, unless enjoined, appellants would institute prosecutions against appellee under certain sections of the act. After hearing, the District Court entered a perpetual injunction, holding the law offensive to the Federal and to the State Constitution.\n The statute provides that it shall be unlawful for any person, firm, association, or corporation, foreign or domestic, to establish or operate any store3 within the state without first obtaining from the appellants a license, which must be renewed annually. It makes the operation of a store without a license a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than $25 nor more than $100 for each day it is so operated.\n Section 5 of the act provides:\n'Every person,firm , corporation, association or copartnership opening, establishing, operating or maintaining one or more stores or mercantile establishments, within this state, under the same general management, supervision or ownership, shall pay the license fees hereinafter prescribed for the privilege of opening, establishing, operating or maintaining such stores or mercantile establishments. The license fee herein prescribed shall be paid annually, and shall be in addition to the filing fee prescribed in sections 2 and 4 of this act.\n\n'The license fees herein prescribed shall be as follows:\n\n'(1) Upon one store, the annual license fee shall be three dollars for each such store; \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 532]\n\u00a0\n '(2) Upon two stores or more, but not to exceed five stores, the annual license fee shall be ten dollars for each such additional store;\n\n'(3) Upon each store in excess of five, but not to exceed ten, the annual license fee shall be fifteen dollars for each such additional store;\n\n'(4) Upon each store in excess of ten, but not to exceed twenty, the annual license fee shall be twenty dollars for each such additional store;\n\n'(5) Upon each store in excess of twenty the annual license fee shall be twenty-five dollars for each such additional store.'\n\n It is this section which appellee asserts renders the act unconstitutional as applied to him.\n The bill of complaint alleges, and it is admitted, that the appellee is engaged in the business of selling groceries, fresh vegetables, and meats at wholesale and retail in Indianapolis, and has been so engaged for more than ten years, has capital invested in his business in excess of $ 200,000, and annual sales of over $1,000,000. He operates two hundred and twenty-five stores in the said city, and more than five hundred persons, firms, associations, and corporations, foreign and domestic, are engaged in the operation of two or more stores in the state.\n The bill charges that the graduation of the tax per store according to the number of stores under a single ownership and management is based on no real difference between a store part of such a group and one individually and separately owned and operated, or between the business transacted in them; that the number of stores conducted by one owner bears no relation to the public health, welfare, or safety, none to the size of the enterprise as a whole, to its capital, its earnings, or its value; that the classification made by the statute is without basis in fact, is unreasonable and arbitrary, and results \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 533]\n\u00a0\n in depriving him of his property without due process, and denying him the equal protection of the laws.\n In the court below appellants defended on the grounds that the statute was an exercise of the police power and was also a revenue measure which levied an ordinary occupation tax. They offered no evidence to sustain the first ground mentioned, and do not press it here. They now stand only upon the power of the Legislature in prescribing an occupation tax, to classify businesses, so long as its action is not unreasonable and arbitrary. They say that the act fulfills the constitutional requirement that, in so classifying, the lawmaking body shall apply the same means and methods to all persons of the same class, so that the law will operate equally and uniformly, and all similarly circumstanced will be treated alike. The District Court held that the statute failed to conform to this standard.\n The act adopts a different measure of taxation for stores known as chain stores, from that applied to those owned and operated as individual units. Evidence was offered by the appellee intended to demonstrate that there are no substantial or significant differences between the business and operation of the two kinds of stores, such as would justify the classification, and by the appellants to prove the existence of such differences.\n The District Court failed to make findings of fact and law as now required by Equity Rule 70 1\/2 (28 USCA  723), but contented itself with a partial summary of the facts and certain genral conclusions of law. Had the rule been in force at the time of the trial, we should feel constrained to remand the case with directions to make such findings. We shall, in the circumstances, summarize the proofs.\n In addition to the facts averred in the bill, above set forth, the appellee offered uncontradicted evidence on the following points. Of the retail stores of the country ap- \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 534]\n\u00a0\n proximately 63 per cent. are independent or community stores, 16 per cent. are department stores, 12 per cent. are chain stores, and 4 per cent. are mail order houses. Several department stores in Indianapolis doing a much larger business than the appellee pay a tax of only $3 as contrasted with his tax of $5,443, although their business is highly competitive with that of chain stores. Persons owning a greater number of stores, and with more money invested, in a business similar to that of appellee, but having only one store in Indiana, pay $3 because they have but one store in the state. Large numbers of stores independently owned and controlled are members of associations or 'voluntary chains' under which co-operative buying is conducted for the group, but each of them is required to pay a license fee of only $3. The mere addition of a new unit or store to an existing chain of stores does not increase the sales more than arithmetically. The additional unit has its own expenses, and the volume of sales of the former stores in the chain, to which it constitutes an addition, is not increased by adding it.\n The appellants produced evidence to prove that there are many points of difference between chain stores and independently owned units. These consist in quantity buying, which involves the application of the mass process to distribution, comparable to the mass method used in production; buying for cash and obtaining the advantage of a cash discount; skill in buying, so as not to overbuy, and at the same time keep the stores stocked with products suitable in size, style, and quality for the neighborhood customers who patronize them; warehousing of goods and distributing from a single warehouse to numerous stores; abundant supply of capital, whereby advantage may be taken of opportunities for establishment of new units; a pricing and sales policy different from that of the indi- \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 535]\n\u00a0\n vidual store, involving slightly lower prices; a greater turnover, and constant analysis of the turnover to ascertain relative profits on varying items; unified and therefore cheaper and better advertising for the entire chain in a given locality; standard forms of display for the promotion of sales; superior management and method; concentration of management in the special lines of goods handled by the chain; special accounting methods; standardization of store management, sales policies, and goods sold.\n The appellants' evidence indicated that all of these advantages are interrelated and interdependent in the chain store business. The witnesses conceded that some of them may be found in large independent grocery or drug stores or the like, but they did not, as appellee claims, state that all of them combined exist therein, as in chain stores.\n The record shows that the chain store has many features and advantages which definitely distinguish it from the individual store dealing in the same commodities. With respect to associations of individual stores for purposes of co-operative buying, exchange of ideas as to advertising, sales methods, etc., it need only be remarked that these are voluntary groups, and that series of independent units cannot, in the nature of things, be as efficiently and successfully integrated as a chain under a single ownership and management.\n But the appellee in proof and argument drew a comparison between the chain store and the department store which he insists exhibits the classification of the statute as illusory and arbitrary. He proved that there are two department stores in Indianapolis, each doing a business in excess of $8,000,000 a year, one having 124 and the other 86 separate departments, and tha und er the law each pays a tax of only $3. He uses these facts to give point to \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 536]\n\u00a0\n his assertion that a store is not a unit of value. This argument ignores the fact that, in determining how it shall classify occupations for taxation, the Legislature is not confined merely to the value of the business taxed, but may have regard to other elements.\n While it is true that large department stores reap many of the advantages and employ many of the methods of a chain store group, such as large capital, buying in quantity, and the ability to command the highest type of management, it is nevertheless evident that, whereas a department store spreads its efforts over a number of different sorts of shops under one roof, the chain store owner concentrates its energy upon the conduct of but one kind of stores located in many neighborhoods. Obviously greater specialization in management and methods is possible in the latter type of enterprise than in the former, whose management, however capable, must after all consist of many separate types each devoted to a single store similar to an independent retail store. The mass buying done by a chain store owner for a number of units selling the same goods, is not comparable to the individuated purchasing of a department store for its grocery, its shoe, its drug, and each of its other departments. It is not to be expected that the management problems of stores, essentially separate and differing entirely in the character of their business, under the aegis of a single department store, will be the same as those involved in the intensive selling of a chain store owner operating an equal number of units all devoted to a single line of business.\n Notwithstanding the differences disclosed between chain and other stores, the court below found that 'all persons engaged in the operation of one or more stores ... belong to the same class, for occupational tax purposes, as plaintiff, and should pay the same license fee, regardless of the number of stores owned and operated by them,' and that any other classification is arbitrary \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 537]\n\u00a0\n and unconstitutional. It is this holding which the appellants challenge.\n The principles which govern the decision of this cause are well settled. The power of taxation is fundamental to the very existence of the government of the states. The restriction that it shall not be so exercised as to deny to any the equal protection of the laws does not compel the adoption of an iron rule of equal taxation, nor prevent variety or differences in taxation, or discretion in the selection of subjects, or the classification for taxation of properties, businesses, trades, callings, or occupations. Bell's Gap R. R. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232\n, 10 S. Ct. 533; Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 \nU.S. 114\n, 30 S. Ct. 496; Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, \n217 \nU.S. 563\n, 30 S. Ct. 578. The fact that a statute discriminates in favor of a certain class does not make it arbitrary, if the discrimination is founded upon a reasonable distinction, American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 \nU.S. 89\n, 21 S. Ct. 43, or if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived to sustain it. Rast v. Van Deman, \n240 \nU.S. 342\n, 36 S. Ct. 370, 374, L. R. A. 1917A, 421, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 455; Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59\n, 32 S. Ct. 192. As was said in Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, supra, at page 573 of 217 U. S., 30 S. Ct. 578, 580:\n'A very wide discretion must be conceded to the legislative power of the state in the classification of trades, callings, businesses, or occupations which may be subjected to special forms of regulation or taxation through an excise or license tax. If the selection or classification is neither capricious nor arbitrary, and rests upon some reasonable consideration of difference or policy, there is no denial of the equal protection of the law.'\n\n It is not the function of this Court in cases like the present to consider the propriety or justness f th e tax, to seek for the motives, or to criticize the public policy which prompted the adoption of the legislation. Our duty is to sustain the classification adopted by the Legislature if there are substantial differences between the occupations \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 538]\n\u00a0\n separately classified. Such differences need not be great. The past decisions of the Court make this abundantly clear.\n In American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, supra, a license tax imposed upon persons and corporations carrying on the business of refining sugar and molasses, which excepted planters and farmers grinding and refining their own sugar and molasses, was held not to work an unconstitutional discrimination.\n In Cargill v. Minnesota, \n180 \nU.S. 452\n, 21 S. Ct. 423, a state statute requiring the proprietors of warehouses situated on the right of way of a railroad to secure a license from a state commission, and containing no such requirement with respect to warehouses not so situated but doing exactly the same business, was held valid.\n In Armour Packing Co. v. Lacy, \n200 \nU.S. 226\n, 26 S. Ct. 232, a North Carolina statute imposed an occupation tax upon every meat- packing house doing business in that state. The Armour Company, which was taxed under this statute, had its packing house at Kansas City and shipped its packed products to various depots in the state, where they were sold and delivered in competition with wholesalers and commission merchants who were not required to pay the tax. The statute was sustained.\n In Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, supra, a statute of Montana imposing a license fee on hand laundries was held not to constitute a denial of the equal protection of the laws because it did not apply to steam laundries, and because it exempted from its operation laundries not employing more than two women.\n In Bradley v. Richmond, \n227 \nU.S. 477\n, 33 S. Ct. 318, an ordinance imposed a tax on the conduct of various businesses and gave a power of classification to a committee of the council. That committee classified private bankers, placing a tax of one amount on certain of them and of a different amount on others. It appeared that the busi- \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 539]\n\u00a0\n ness of those in the one class was that of lending money at high rates upon salaries and household furniture, while that done by the other class was that of lending money upon commercial securities. The classification was held not to offend the constitutional provision for equal protection of the laws.\n In Metropolis Theatre Co. v. Chicago, \n228 \nU.S. 61\n, 33 S. Ct. 441, 443, an ordinance classified theatres for license fees based on and graded according to the admission charged. It was shown that some of the theatres charging a higher admission had less revenue than those charging a smaller price, and therefore paying lower license fees. This Court held the classification valid.\n In Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Brickell, \n233 \nU.S. 304\n, 34 S. Ct. 493, 497, there was drawn in question a statute of Alabama which provided that every person, firm, or corporation selling or delivering sewing machines in person or through agents should pay a tax of $ 50 annually for each county in which they might sell or deliver said articles, and for each wagon and team used in delivering or displaying the same an additional sum in each county of $25 annually. It exempted merchants selling sewing machines at their regularly established places of business. The Singer Company, a foreign corporation, was engaged in many counties in the state in selling and renting sewing machines, in part from regularly established places of business and in part by means of wagons going from place to place in counties where its stores were located. It attacked the statute on the ground that it involved an arbitrary discrimination between merchants selling at their stores and merchants selling by means of wagons. It was shown that the merchants who sold at their stores usually delivered the articles sold by wagon. This Court sustained the tax, sayig wi th respect to the two kinds of business:\n\n\n[283 U.S. 527, 540]\n\u00a0\n 'But there is an evident difference, in the mode of doing business, between the local tradesman and the itinerant dealer, and we are unable to say that the distinction made between them for purposes of taxation is arbitrarily made. In such matters the states necessarily enjoy a wide range of discretion, and it would require a clear case to justify the courts in striking down a law that is uniformly applicable to all persons pursuing a given occupation on the ground that persons engaged in other occupations more or less like it ought to be similarly taxed.'\n In Rast v. Van Deman, supra, a statute placing taxes additional to the usual occupations taxes on persons who offered, with merchandise bargained or sold in the course of trade, coupons, profit-sharing certificates, or the like, was attacked as being arbitrary and unreasonable, in that the only difference between the other merchants and those who used trading stamps was a difference in the method of advertising. This Court said, however:\n'The difference between a business where coupons are used, even regarding their use as a means of advertising, and a business where they are not used, is pronounced. Complainants are at pains to display it. The legislation which regards the difference is not arbitrary within the rulings of the cases. It is established that a distinction in legislation is not arbitrary, if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it. ...'\n\n In Armour & Co. v. Virginia, \n246 \nU.S. 1\n, 38 S. Ct. 267, 269, the statute under attack laid a tax on merchants doing business in the state based on the amount of their purchases during the license period, including as purchases all goods and merchandise manufactured by the licensee and sold or offered for sale in the state. It excluded from its operation domestic manufacturers, taxed on capital, who offered for sale at the place of manufacture goods and merchan- \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 541]\n\u00a0\n dise manufactured by them. It applied alike to citizens and residents of Virginia and noncitizens and nonresidents who manufactured in Virginia. The state Supreme Court (118 Va. 242, 87 S. E. 610) held that it applied to Armour & Co., who manufactured part of their products without the state and sold them within it. This Court said:\n'In the first place we are of opinion that the distinction upon which the classification in the statute rests between a manufacturer selling goods by him made at their place of manufacture and one engaged as a merchant in whole or in part in selling goods of his manufacture at a place of business other than where they were made is so obvious as to require nothing but a mere statement of the two classes. All question concerning the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment may therefore be put out of view.'\n\n In view of the numerous distinctions above pointed out between the business of a chain store and other types of store, we cannot pronounce the classification made by the statute to be arbitrary and unreasonable. That there are differences and advantages in favor of the chain store is shown by the number of such chains established and by their astonishing growth. More and more persons, like the appellee, have found advantages in this method of merchandising and have therefore adopted it. What was said in Metropolis Theatre Co. v. Chicago, supra, is quite applicable here:\n'... The distinction obtains in every large city of the country. The reason for it must therefore be substantial; and if it be so universal in the practice of the business, it would seem not unreasonable if it be adopted as the basis of governmental action.'\n\n The court below fell into the error of assuming that the distinction between the appellee's business and that of the other sorts of stores mentioned was solely one of own- \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 542]\n\u00a0\n ership. It disregarded the differences shown by the record. They consist not merely in ownership, but in organization, management, and type of business transacted. The statue tr eats upon a similar basis all owners of chain stores similarly situated. In the light of what we have said, this is all that the Constitution requires. Clark v. Titusville, \n184 \nU.S. 329\n, 22 S. Ct. 382; Magoun v. Illinois Tr. & Savings Bank, \n173 \nU.S. 283\n, 18 S. Ct. 594\n\n\n Article 1,  23, of the Constitution of Indiana,4 which the court below held the statute violates, seems to us not to set any different standard than does the Fourteenth Amendment. No decision of the Indiana courts is cited in support of the court's conclusion, and those referred to by appellants demonstrate that the section permits classification for purposes of taxation and that the same principles are applicable as under the Fourteenth Amendment. Kersey v. Terre Haute, 161 Ind. 471, 68 N. E. 1027; Gafill v. Bracken, 195 Ind. 551, 145 N. E. 312, 146 N. E. 109. Article 10,  1,5 is declared by the Supreme Court of the state to be applicable only to the assessment made under a general levy, and not to occupation or license taxes. Thomasson v. State, 15 Ind. 449; Bright v. McCullough, 27 Ind. 223; Gafill v. Bracken, supra. We cannot, therefore, hold the statute repugnant to the clauses of the State Constitution on which the appellee relies. \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 543]\n\u00a0\n The judgment of the District Court must be reversed, and the cause remanded, with instructions to dismiss the bill.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND (dissenting).\n By the statute here under review, the operation of any 'store' within the state without a license is made unlawful. The license fees to be paid are graduated according to the number of 'stores' to be operated 'under the same general management, supervision or ownership.' Upon one store, the annual license fee is $3; upon two or more up to five, $10 for each additional store; in excess of five but not exceeding ten, $15 for each additional store; in excess of ten but not exceeding twenty, $20 for each additional store; and in excess of twenty, $25 for each additional store.\n Upon the face of the statute, the sole differentiation on which the graduated and rapidly mounting license fees depend consists in the number of stores operated. But the tax is imposed in respect of a single 'store,' without regard to kind, value, size, amount invested, amount or character of business done, income derived, or other distinguishing feature. The number of stores is a collateral circumstance used only to determine the amount of the license fee to be exacted in respect of each of them. A retailer pays the same as a wholesaler; the owner of a small corner grocery, operated by him alone, the same as the owner of a large department store employing hundreds of clerks. To determine that a tax of $ 25, instead of $3, $10, $15, or $20, shall be imposed in respect of any store, it is necessary only to have an affirmative answer to the inquiry, Is this store operated by a person who already owns or operates twenty or more stores? These facts are of controlling importance because they give rise to the \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 544]\n\u00a0\n point upon which the question of constitutionality depends.\n It is settled that the power of the state to classify for purposes of taxation is of wide range and flexibility; but that, while the difference upon which the classification is based need not be great, mere difference is not enough. Classification, to be legitimate, must rest upon some ground of difference having a reasonable and just relation to the object of the legislation. All persons similarly circustan ced must be treated alike. Louisville Gas Co. v. Coleman, \n277 \nU.S. 32, 37\n, 48 S. Ct. 423, and cases cited. These principles, repeatedly stated by this court, are fundamental; and it reasonably cannot be doubted that their application to the present act, unless saved by certain extrinsic circumstances to be considered later, necessarily condemns it as unconstitutional. I am unable to find in any of these circumstances, or in all of them together, justification for a classification which results in distributing the burden of taxation with such evident inequality.\n The purpose of the act is to raise revenue, and upon that theory the decision of this Court is based. The contention that the act constitutes an exercise of the police power finds no support in the record and was but faintly urged at the bar. Whether the classification could be justified if the statute were other than a revenue measure is a question, therefore, with which we are not now concerned. The pertinent and only question is whether between a store constituting one of a series under unified management, supervision, or ownership, and a store under single and distinct management, supervision, or ownership, there are such differences as to justify putting them in separate categories with the object of imposing, for the sole purpose of revenue, a larger tax in respect of one than in respect of the other. If the differences bear no just and reasonable relation to that object, the classification cannot be sustained, although the same differences \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 545]\n\u00a0\n might bear such a relation to some other and different object.\n In the state of Indiana there are approximately 44,000 retail stores engaged in the same general lines of business, only 8 per cent. of which are so-called 'chain stores.' Among them are single stores each of greater value than all the stores of appellee combined, and each doing a business in excess of all that done by appellee. For example, there are two large department stores in the city of Indianapolis each doing a business of more than $8,000,000 per annum, one operating 124 separate departments and the other, 86 separate departments, but each pays a license fee under the statute of only $3 per annum; while appellee, owning 225 separate stores and doing a total business of approximately $1,000,000 per annum, pays license fees of $5,443 per annum-eighteen hundred times as much! Each of several owners of a large number of stores, (145 in one instance) who happens to have only one store in Indiana, pays a license fee of $3, contrasted with the payment of $25 for each store over twenty owned by appellee. Appellee, upon 205 of his stores, pays the aggregate sum of $5, 125; while the proprietors of 205 stores, held and operated separately, pay in the aggregate only $615, although they or some of them may be of equal or greater value, equally well or better located, doing as much or more business, and producing as much or more income. The evidence further shows that a 'co-operative volunteer chain' consisting of several hundred stores in Indiana paying an annual license fee of only $3 each, operates under an association called the Independent Grocers' Alliance. The association carries on co-operative buying and advertising for the benefit of the members of the group; and it seems clear that as to most, if not all, of the advantages said to be enjoyed by the chain stores the volunteer co-operative group occupies a position of equality. \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 546]\n\u00a0\n These are obvious and flagrant discriminations which put upon the act the clear stamp of unconstitutionality, unless the differences relied upon are germane to, and reasonably sufficient in substance to sustain, the proposed imposition of license fees of such unequal amounts upon different persons following identical occupations.\n What, then, are the differences, or so called advantages, relied upon to justify the classification? They were, in their strongest aspect, stated by an expert witness called by the appellants in support of the act, as follows: The abilit of the chain stores to make large quantity purchases; to pay cash and thus obtain the advantage of discounts; skill in buying so as to avoid either overstocking or understocking; warehousing in, and distribution from, a single warehouse for numerous stores; large capital with the advantages flowing therefrom; certain pricing and sales policies resulting in slightly lower prices on the part of the chain stores as compared with single stores; more rapid turnover of goods; cheaper and better advertising; superior management; standardization in the matter of display; standardization of store management; and similar elements thought to have a beneficial effect upon the disposition of goods.\n But the effect of this enumeration of supposed advantages is completely swept away by the testimony of the same witness on cross- examination, which stands upon the record without dispute, that they are not confined to the chain stores, but are enjoyed as well by such of the favored taxpayers as are engaged in large business, whether in a single establishment or in many establishments.\n'Every advantage that I have spoken of as relating to the chain group is that which inheres, primarily, in volume and management without respect to whether it is involved in a chain group or in a single store. Good management makes for volume and volume makes for the \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 547]\n\u00a0\n possibility of making or acquiring more capital, and more capital makes for the possibility of employing the highest grade of experts, so that there is constant intercommunication or revolving. I would find the same advantage adhering in a large department store over a small one. Every quality that I have enumerated as going to the manner of organization relates itself, primarily, to there being a sufficient capital structure and volume of business to permit it to be carried on and I would add management in that it is an essential part of it. ...\n\n'Q. So that it does not relate itself to the form of organization- whether they are administering fifty or a hundred stores, or administering one store? A. No, no. ...\n\n'Q. The fact that it is administering multiplely owned stores has nothing to do with it, but it is the fact that it is administering a large business that develops the situation that you have referred to? A. That is true. But I might add that the management of a large number of stores may contribute to the more rapid increases in the size.\n\n'Q. Just as the manager of a large unit store, with many departments, may develop the ability to strengthen and enlarge those departments? A. Yes.\n\n'Q. And the problem would be identical, wouldn't it in the case of Macy or Gimbel-or, taking it locally, in connection with Ayres, or Block? A. Yes, I would say the problem would be the same. There is no difference in the functions that are performed here-the function of retailing.'\n\n It thus appears that the advantages attributed to the chain store lie not in the fact that it is one of a number of stores under the same management, supervision, or owner- \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 548]\n\u00a0\n ship, but in the fact that it is one of the parts of a large business. In other words, the advantages relied upon arise from the aggregate size of the entire business, and not from the number of parts into which it is divided. For the want of a valid ground upon which to stand, therefore, the classification should fall, because it is made to depend, not upon size or value or character, amount of capital invested or income received, but upon the mere circumstance-wholly irrelevant so far as any of the advantages claimed are concerned-that the business of one is carried on under many roofs, and that of the other under one only. Reduced to this single detail of difference, what fairly conceivable reason is there in the policies or objects of taxation which gives countenance to the requirement that the former shall make an annual contribution to the revenues of the state eighteen hundred times as much as the latter? A classification comparable in principle would be to make the amount of an income tax deped up on the number of sources from which the income is derived, without regard to the character of the sources or the amount of the income itself.\n Since the supposed differences thus are reduced to the one of number only, and since that turns out to be irrelevant and wholly without substance, it follows that the act is a 'clear and hostile discrimination' against a selected body of taxpayers, Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S. Ct. 533, a mere subterfuge by which the members of one group of taxpayers are unequally burdened for the benefit of the members of other groups similarly circumstanced. All of which is to say that the Legislature has misapplied its power to classify with the result of reaching an end forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n To this situation the language of Mr. Justice Field in County of Santa Clara v. Southern Pac. R. Co. (C. C.) 18 F. 385, 399, seems peculiarly applicable:\n\n\n[283 U.S. 527, 549]\n\u00a0\n 'Unequal taxation, so far as it can be prevented, is, therefore, with other unequal burdens, prohibited by the amendment. There undoubtedly are, and always will be, more or less inequalities in the operation of all general legislation arising from the different conditions of persons from their means, business, or position in life, against which no foresight can guard. But this is a very different thing, both in purpose and effect, from a carefully devised scheme to produce such inequality; or a scheme, if not so devised, necessarily producing that result. Absolute equality may not be attainable, but gross and designed departures from it will necessarily bring the legislation authorizing it within the prohibition. The amendment is aimed against the perpetration of injustice, and the exercise of arbitrary power to that end. The position that unequal taxation is not within the scope of its prohibitory clause would give to it a singular meaning. It is a matter of history that unequal and discriminating taxation, leveled against special classes, has been the fruitful means of oppressions, and the cause of more commotions and disturbance in society, of insurrections and revolutions, than any other cause in the world.'\n It seems plain enough that we have in the present case 'a carefully devised scheme to produce such inequality; or a scheme, if not so devised, necessarily producing that result.'\n In Quaker City Cab Co. v. Penna., \n277 \nU.S. 389\n, 48 S. Ct. 553, this court held invalid a Pennsylvania statute which imposed a tax upon the gross receipts of a corporation engaged in the general taxicab business, but not upon like receipts of individuals and partnerships engaged in the same business. The differences relied upon as justifying the tax are fairly comparable with those relied upon in the present case. It was said that there were advantages peculiar to the corporate organization not enjoyed by indi- \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 550]\n\u00a0\n viduals or partnerships, such as those pointed out in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 162\n, 31 S. Ct. 342, 353, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312: 'The continuity of the business, without interruption by death or dissolution, the transfer of property interests by the disposition of shares of stock, the advantages of business controlled and managed by corporate directors, the general absence of individual liability, these and other things inhere in the advantages of business thus conducted, which do not exist when the same business is conducted by private individuals or partnerships.'\n These advantages, although brought sharply to the attention of the court, were not considered as constituting differences having a reasonable relation to the object of the Taxing Act, and the tax was held unconstitutional as denying to the corporation the equal protection of the laws. It is hard to see how that conclusion can be reconciled, in principle, with the present decision. See, also, Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, \n253 \nU.S. 412, 415\n, 40 S. Ct. 560; Bethlehem Motors Corp. v. Flynt, \n256 \nU.S. 421\n, 41 S. Ct. 571, 65 L. Ed 102 9; Kans. City So. Ry. v. Road Imp. Dist. No. 6, \n256 \nU.S. 658\n, 41 S. Ct. 604; Air-Way Corp. v. Day, \n266 \nU.S. 71, 83\n, 85 S., 45 S. Ct. 12; Louisville Gas Co. v. Coleman, \n277 \nU.S. 32, 37\n, 48 S. Ct. 423. A long list of illustrative cases which tend to support the view that the act in question is violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment readily could be added; but nothing would be gained by doing so.\n A large number of decisions are cited in support of the act. They, as well as those cited above, demonstrate the impossibility of stating precisely or categorically the distinction between such statutes as fall within, and such as fall without, the ban of the Constitution. The decisions have depended not only upon the varying facts which constituted the background for the particular legislation under consideration, but also, to some extent, upon the point of view of the courts or judges who have been called upon to deal with the question. Some of the cases press \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 551]\n\u00a0\n to the limit fixed by the Constitution; and that fact, while affording no ground for objection to the cases themselves, admonishes us to use caution in applying them to other sets of substantially dissimilar circumstances, lest, by doing so, we pass into the forbidden territory which lies wholly beyond the verge. I am unable to discover in any of the prior decisions of this court, including those cited, anything, which in the light of the facts and circumstances herein set forth, lends support to the claim of validity for the classification here under consideration. To attempt an extended review of the cases thought to do so is not necessary. It will be enough to refer to those which seem to be regarded as most strongly in point.\n American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 \nU.S. 89\n, 21 S. Ct. 43, involved the validity of a license tax upon those carrying on the business of refining sugar and molasses, but exempted planters and farmers grinding and refining their own sugar and molasses. The classification was upheld upon the ground that the steps taken by planters and farmers to perfect their product for the market were an incident to the original growth of the cane; and that this distinction saved the classification from being purely arbitrary, oppressive, or capricious. It was, as this court pointed out in Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., \n184 \nU.S. 540, 561\n, 22 S. Ct. 431, a tax upon the business of refining sugar and molasses, exempting therefrom those who refined only their own sugar and molasses.\n In W. W. Cargill Co. v. Minnesota, \n180 \nU.S. 452\n, 21 S. Ct. 423, the statute required that the owner of an elevator or warehouse situated on the right of way of a railroad, etc., should procure a license therefor at a nominal fee. The act was assailed because it did not apply to elevators and warehouses not so situated. The court sustained the classification because the railroad was a public highway, the use of which could be so regulated as to promote the ends for which the corporation was created and thus subserve the interests \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 552]\n\u00a0\n of the general public. Moreover, it was neither alleged nor proved in that case that there were in the state any elevators or warehouses not situated upon a railroad right of way.\n In Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59\n, 32 S. Ct. 192, the statute involved imposed a license fee on hand laundries, but not upon steam laundries, and exempted from its operation laundries not employing more than two women. The classification was sustained, principally upon the authority of the two cases referred to immediately above.\n In Metropolis Theatre Co. v. Chicago, \n228 \nU.S. 61\n, 33 S. Ct. 441, a classification of theatres for license fees graded according to the prices of admission was held not to be arbitrary or unreasonable, because, although there might be exceptional cases, there was a natural relation between the price of admission and revenue.\n While opinions migt di ffer in respect of the wisdom or fairness of some of the statutes involved, as, for example, the laundry tax statute which taxed the small hand laundry and exempted the large steam laundry, the differences were germane to the object and sufficiently substantial to save the classification in each case from being condemned as purely arbitrary or capricious.\n It may be that here the maximum tax of $25 for each store, while relatively high, is not, if considered by itself, excessive; but to sustain it will open the door of opportunity to the state to increase the amount to an oppressive extent. This court frequently has said, and it cannot be too often repeated in cases of this character, that the power to tax is the power to destroy; and this constitutes a reason why that power, however moderately exercised in given instances, should be jealously confined to the limits set by the Constitution. Compare Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 60\n, 20 S. Ct. 747. In Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, a tax of 10 per cent. imposed on the notes of state banks was upheld, although it 'drove out of existence every State \n\n[283 U.S. 527, 553]\n\u00a0\n bank of circulation within a year or two after its passage.' Citizens' Sav . & Loan Association v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 655, 663, 664. In the face of this decision, and others which might be cited, there does not seem to be any sure comfort in the suggestion, sometimes made, that this court may be expected to intervene whenever the tax reaches the point of destruction.\n For the foregoing reasons, the judgment below should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, and Mr. Justice BUTLER concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Leave to petition for rehearing granted 51 S.

The claim is based upon a sale by the United States of the surplus power generated by it at its dam at Muscie Shoals, Alabama, under the Act of June 3, 1916, c. 134,  124, 39 Stat. 166, 215 (50 USCA  79). The Government demurred on the ground that the petition does not set forth a cause of action within the jurisdiction of the Court. The demurrer was sustained and the petition dismissed upon its merits. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n281 \nU.S. 718\n, 50 S. Ct. 463\n\n\n We are of opinion that the petition should be dismissed, not upon the merits, which would import jurisdiction to deal with them, but for want of jurisdiction under the Act establishing the powers of the Court of Claims. Judicial Code,  145, U. S. Code, title 28,  250 (28 USCA  250). That jurisdiction extends to 'all claims (except for pensions) founded upon the Constitution of the United States or any law of Congress, upon any regulation of an executive department, upon any contract, express or implied, with the Government of the United States, or for damages, liquidated or unliquidated, in cases not sounding i to rt, in respect of which claims the party would be entitled to redress against the United States either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty if the United States were suable: Provided,' etc.\n The contract to be recovered upon under section 145, Jud. Code, must be an actual one, and, if implied, must be implied in fact. not merely implied by fiction, or as it is said, by law. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 592, 597\n, 43 S. Ct. 425. There is no ground for asserting an actual contract here. The State suggests that cases of property \n\n[282 U.S. 502, 507]\n\u00a0\n taken by eminent domain furnish an analogy. But in those cases where there is a recovery the United States admits the title that it takes and in view of the Constitution reasonably is understood to promise the compensation that in such circumstances it is bound to pay. Phelps v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 341, 343\n, 47 S. Ct. 611; International Paper Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 399\n, 51 S. Ct. 176. But here the United States has not admitted and does not admit the right of the State to tax it for its sales and therefore does not by selling import a promise to pay for what so far as appears it does under a claim of right. Levying a tax does not create a contract. It is a unilateral act of superior power, not depending for its effect upon concurrence of the party taxed.\n We do not see how the claim of the State can be said to be founded upon the Constitution. If the claim is valid, which we are far from implying, it is under the State's original powers as such, and the only bearing of the Constitution is that it did not take the power away. Neither do we regard the claim as one for damages in a case not sounding in tort within the meaning of the Act. There are few cases of this sort that cannot be brought under the head of a contract implied in law and it being established that such contracts are not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, we think that this phrase cannot be extended to a controversy concerning the boundary between the two sovereign powers. The claim is not technically one for damages as was the claim in assumpsit. It is a claim for a tax that the United States never has promised to pay and for a penalty. It does not fall within the Act as it has been construed for many years.\n Judgment reversed.\n Petition to be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","138":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF ALABAMA v.

The case was then heard on final hearing by three other judges on precisely the same evidence; and they dismissed the bill, 42 F.(2d) 469. The case is now here on direct appeal from the final decree.\n The order complained of was entered in an extensive investigation, instituted by the Interstate Commerce Commission on its own motion in 1924, into the rates on fertilizers and fertilizer material in the southern territory. \n1\n With that proceeding there was consolidated, among others, a complaint theretofore filed by steam railroads \n\n[283 U.S. 776, 778]\n\u00a0\n operating in Alabama, charging that the state commission had entered an order which required them to establish intrastate rates on fertilizers and fertilizer material lower than those permitted or required by the interstate traffic; and that the observance by the carriers of the order of the Alabama commission would result in unjust discrimination against interstate commerce and in undue prejudice to persons and localities in interstate commerce. \n2\n The Alabama commission refused to permit the intrastate rates to be increased to the level which the federal Commission found to be necessary to prevent such discrimination, whereupon the order challenged was entered. \n3\n It is contended that this action was arbitrary; \n\n[283 U.S. 776, 779]\n\u00a0\n that there was not a full hearing; that the issue determined was not the issue pleaded or heard; that there was no finding showing a competitive relationship of any rates interstate with any rates intrastate and no definite finding justifying the regulation of all intrastate rates; that there was no evidence to sustain any such findings; and none to sustain the finding and order which prescribed like rates for joint and single line hauls; and, finally, that the rates prescribed intrastate are not in harmony with the interstate rates.\n The findings of the Interstate Commerce Commission are definite; they afford a sufficient basis for the order; and they are supported by evidence. None of the objections of the appellant is well taken. The comprehensive investigation of the Interstate Commerce Commission appears to have been conducted with great care and thoroughness. \n4\n The Alabama commission, as well as the reg- \n\n[283 U.S. 776, 780]\n\u00a0\n ulatory bodies of five contiguous states, were represented at the hearings and took an active part in developing the record. A report proposed by the examiner was served upon their counsel who took exceptions which were considered by the Commission. Some modification was made in the report. All the objections to the order now urged were twice presented to, and passed upon by, the District Court. They were, in part, considered by this Court on the appeal from the decree denying an interlocutory injunction. Nothing could be gained by further discussion. The decree of the District Court is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Both the interstate and intrastate rates on these commodities, of which two-thirds of the total United States production is used in the southern territory (113 I. C. C. 392 Y), had therefore been before the Commission in a great many cases. See Royster Guano Co. v. Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co., 31 I. C. C. 4 58; Id., 38 I. C. C. 190; Id., 51 I. C.

United States, \n283 \nU.S. 765\n, 51 S. Ct. 619, October term, 1930, decided this day. No order concerning intrastate rates was entered in the original proceedings because it was 'believed that the respective State commissions will cooperate in authorizing such revisions as may be necessary.' 113 I. C. C. 435. Thereafter the railroads operating in Alabama petitioned the state commission to establish intrastate rates in harmony with the interstate rates established by the federal Commission. This relief was denied on July 18, 1927. On September 3, 1927, these same carriers requested the federal Commission to enter an order raising the intrastate rates on these commodities in Alabama. On the basis of its former hearings and findings, the Commission issued, without further hearin, th e order here attacked. It was also stipulated that a general petition for rehearing was filed by the Alabama commission after the announcement of the findings in the original investigation. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The present case differs from Georgia Public Service Commission v. United States, supra, note 3, Y in that the question of discrimination against interstate commerce was examined only in the initial hearing and not also in a supplemental hearing. In the original hearing and report, the percentage of intrastate as against interstate traffic, the similarity in transportation conditions, the location of interstate and intrastate shippers, and the reasons for and against the allowance of joint-line differentials, were thoroughly canvassed. Whether such differentials should not be allowed in rates on fertilizers, a relatively high value commodity, even though they are permitted, as in the Georgia case, on low value commodities, is a matter wholly within the informed discretion of the Commission, provided the question was considered and appropriate findings, supported by evidence, were made.

Section 1 (43 USCA  617).\n The Colorado River Compact is an agreement for the apportionment of the water of the river and its tributaries. After several years of preliminary informal discussion, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California-the seven States through which the river system extends-appointed commissioners in 1921 to formulate an agreement; and Congress, upon request, gave its assent, and authorized the appointment of a representative to act for the United States. Act of August 19, 1921, c. 72, 42 Stat. 171. On November 24, 1922, these commissioners and the federal representative signed an agreement to become effective when ratified by Congress and the Legislatures of all of these States. The Boulder Canyon Project Act approved this agreement subject to certain limitations and conditions, the approval to become effective upon the ratification of the compact, as so modified, by the Legislatures of California and at least five of the six other states. The Legislatures of all these states, except Arizona, ratified the modified compact, and the act was accordingly declared to be in effect. Proclamation of June 25, 1929, 46 Stat. 20.\n On October 13, 1930, Arizona filed this original bill of complaint against Ray Lyman Wilbur, Secretary of the Interior, and the states of California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. It charges that Wilbur is proceeding in violation of the laws of Arizona to invade its quasi sovereign rights by building at Black Canyon on the Colorado river a dam, half of which is to be in Arizona, and a reservoir to store all the water of the river flowing above it in Arizona, for the purpose of diverting part of these waters from Arizona for consumptive use \n\n[283 U.S. 423, 450]\n\u00a0\n elsewhere, and of preventing the beneficial consumptive use in Arizona of the unappropriated water of the river now flowing in that state; that these things are being done under color of authority of the Boulder Canyon Project Act; that this act purports to authorize the construction of the dam and reservoir, the diversion of the water from Arizona, and its perpetual use elsewhere; that the act directs and requires Wilbur to permit no use or future appropriation of the unappropriated water of the main stream of the Colorado river, now flowing in Arizona and to be stored by the said dam and reservoir, except subject to the conditions and reservations contained in the Colorado River Compact; and that the act thus attempts to enforce as against Arizona, and to its irreparable injury, the compact which it has refused to ratify. The bill prays that the compact and the act 'and each and every part thereof, be decreed to be unconstitutional, void and of no effect; that the defendants and each of them be permanently enjoined and restrained from enforcing or carrying out said compact or said act, or any of the provisions thereof, and from carrying out the three pretended contracts hereiabov e referred to, or any of them, or any of their provisions, (meaning certain contracts executed by Wilbur on behalf of the United States for the use of the stored water and developed power after the project shall have been completed) and from doing any other act or thing pursuant to or under color of said Boulder Canyon Project Act.'\n Process was made returnable on January 12, 1931; and on that day all of the defendants moved that the bill be dismissed. The grounds assigned in the motions are: (1) That the bill does not join the United States, an indispensable party; (2) that the bill does not present any case or controversy of which the court can take judicial cognizance; (3) that the proposed action of the defendants will not invade any vested right of the plaintiff or of any \n\n[283 U.S. 423, 451]\n\u00a0\n of its citizens; (4) that the bill does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against any of the defendants. The case was heard on these motions.\n The wrongs against which redress is sought are, first, the threatened invasion of the quasi sovereignty of Arizona by Wilbur in building the dam and reservoir without first securing the approval of the state engineer as prescribed by its laws; and, second, the theatened invasion of Arizona's quasi sovereign right to prohibit or to permit appropriation, under its own laws, of the unappropriated water of the Colorado river flowing within the state. The latter invasion, it is alleged, will consist in the exercise, under the act and the compact, of a claimed superior right to store, divert, and use such water.\n First. The claim that quasi sovereign rights of Arizona will be invaded by the mere construction of the dam and reservoir rests upon the fact that both structures will be located partly within the state. At Black Canyon, the site of the dam, the middle channel of the river is the boundary between Nevada and Arizona. The latter's statutes prohibit the construction of any dam whatsoever until written approval of plans and specifications shall have been obtained from the state engineer; and the statutes declare in terms that this provision applies to dams to be erected by the United States. Arizona Laws 1929, c. 102,  1-4. See, also, Revised Code of 1928,  3280-3286. The United States has not secured such approval; nor has any application been made by Wilbur, who is proceeding to construct said dam in complete disregard of this law of Arizona.\n The United States may perform its functions without conforming to the police regulations of a state. Johnson v. Maryland, \n254 \nU.S. 51\n, 41 S. Ct. 16; Hunt v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 96\n, 49 S. Ct. 38. If Congress has power to authorize the construction of the dam and reservoir, Wilbur is under no obligation to submit the plans and specifications to the state \n\n[283 U.S. 423, 452]\n\u00a0\n engineer for approval. \n1\n And the federal government has the power to create this obstruction in the river for the purpose of improving navigation if the Colorado river is navigable. Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 18 How. 421, 430; South Carolina v. Georgia, \n93 U.S. 4\n, 11; Gibson v. United States, \n166 \nU.S. 269\n, 17 S. Ct. 578; United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53, 64\n, 33 S. Ct. 667; Greenleaf-Johnson Lumber Co. v. Garrison, \n237 \nU.S. 251, 258\n, 269 S., 35 S. Ct. 551. Arizona contends both that the river is not navigable, and that it was not the purpose of Congress to improve navigation.\n The bill alleges that 'the river has never been, and is not now, a navigable river.' The argument is that the question whether a stream is navigable is oe of fact; and that hence the motion to dismiss admits the allegation that the river is not navigable. It is true that whether a stream is navigable in law depends upon whether it is navigable in fact, United States v. Utah, \n283 U.S. 64\n, 51 Sup. Ct. 438;2 and that a motion to dismiss, like a demurrer, admits every well-pleaded allegation of fact, Payne v. Central Pacific Ry. Co., \n255 \nU.S. 228, 232\n, 41 S. Ct. 314. But a court may take judicial notice that a river within its jurisdiction is navigable. United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., \n174 \nU.S. 690, 697\n, 19 S. Ct. 770; Wear v. Kansas, \n245 \nU.S. 154, 158\n, 38 S. Ct. 55. \n\n[283 U.S. 423, 453]\n\u00a0\n We knew judicially, from the evidence of history, that a large part of the Colorado river south of Black Canyon was formerly navigable,3 and that the main obstacles to navigation have been the accumulations of silt coming from the upper reaches of the river system, and the irregularity in the flow due to periods of low water. \n4\n Commercial \n\n[283 U.S. 423, 454]\n\u00a0\n disuse resulting from changed geographical conditions, and a congressional failure to deal with them, does not amount to an abandonment of a navigable river or prohibit future exertion of federal control. Economy Light & Power Co. v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 113, 118\n, 124 S., 41 S. Ct. 409. We know from the reports of the committees of the Congress which recommended the Boulder Canyon project that, in the opinion of the government engineers, the silt will be arrested by the dam; that, through use of the stored water, irregularity in its flow below Black Canyon can be largely overcome; and that navigation for considerable distances both above and below the dam will become feasible. \n5\n Compare St. Anthony Falls Water-Power Co. v. Board of Water Commissioners of City of St. Paul, \n168 \nU.S. 349, 359\n, 18 S. Ct. 157; United States v. Cress, \n243 \nU.S. 316, 326\n, 37 S. Ct. 380.\n The bill further alleges that the 'recital in said act that the purpose thereof is the improvement of navia- \n\n[283 U.S. 423, 455]\n\u00a0\n tion ... is a mere subterfuge and false pretense.' It quotes a passage in article IV of the compact, to which the act is subject, which declares that: 'Inasmuch as the Colorado River has ceased to be navigable for commerce and the reservation of its waters for navigation would seriously limit the development of its basin, the use of its waters for purposes of navigation shall be subservient to the uses of such waters for domestic, agricultural, and power purposes;' and alleges that 'even if said river were navigable, the diversion, sale and delivery of water therefrom, as authorized in said act, would not improve, but would destroy, its navigable capacity.' \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Into the motives which induced members of Congress to enact the Boulder Canyon Project Act, this court may not inquire.

New, \n243 \nU.S. 332, 358\n, 359 S., 37 S. Ct. 298, L. R. A. 1917E, 938, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1024; United States v. Doremus, \n249 \nU.S. 86, 93\n, 94 S., 39 S. Ct. 214; Dakota Central Telephone v.

Kansas City Title & Trust Co., \n255 \nU.S. 180, 210\n, 41 S. Ct. 243.7 The act declares that the authority to construct the dam and reservoir is conerre d, among other things, for the purpose of 'improving navigation and regulating the flow of the Colorado River.' As the river is navigable and the means which the act provides are not unrelated \n\n[283 U.S. 423, 456]\n\u00a0\n to the control of navigation, United States v. River Rouge Improvement Co., \n269 \nU.S. 411, 419\n, 46 S. Ct. 144, the erection and maintenance of such dam and reservoir are clearly within the powers conferred upon Congress. Whether the particular structures proposed are reasonably necessary, is not for this court to determine. Compare Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 U.S. 698\n, 712-714, 13 S. Ct. 1016; Oceanic Steam Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, \n214 \nU.S. 320, 340\n, 29 S. Ct. 671; United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53, 65\n, 72 S., 73, 33 S. Ct. 667; Everard's Breweries v. Day, \n265 \nU.S. 545, 559\n, 44 S. Ct. 628. And the fact that purposes other than navigation will also be served could not invalidate the exercise of the authority conferred, even if those other purposes would not alone have justified an exercise of Congressional power. Compare Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 548; Kaukauna Water Power Co. v. Green Bay & Mississippi Canal Co., \n142 U.S. 254\n. 275, 12 S. Ct. 173; In re Kolock, \n165 \nU.S. 526, 536\n, 17 S. Ct. 444; Weber v. Freed, supra; United States v. Doremus, supra.\n It is urged that the court is not bound by the recital of purposes in the act; that we shall determine the purpose from its probable effect; and that the effect of the project will be to take out of the river, now nonnavigable through lack of water, the last half of its remaining average flow. But the act specifies that the dam shall be used: 'First, for river regulation, improvement of navigation, and flood control; second, for irrigation and domestic uses and satisfaction of present perfected rights ...; and third, for power.' Section 6 (43 USCA  617e). It is true that the authority conferred is stated to be 'subject to the Colorado River Compact,' and that instrument makes the improvement of navigation subservient to all other purposes. But the specific statement of primary purpose in the act governs the general references to the compact. This court may not assume that Congress had no purpose \n\n[283 U.S. 423, 457]\n\u00a0\n to aid navigation, and that its real intention was that the stored water shall be so used as to defeat the declared primary purpose. Moreover, unless and until the stored water, which will consist largely of flood waters now wasted, is consumed in new irrigation projects or in domestic use, substantially all of it will be available for the improvement of navigation. The possible abuse of the power to regulate navigation is not an argument against its existence. Lottery Case, \n188 \nU.S. 321, 363\n, 23 S. Ct. 321; Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 168\n, 169 S., 31 S. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312; Wilson v. New, \n243 \nU.S. 332, 354\n, 37 S. Ct. 298, L. R. A. 1917E, 938, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1024; Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries, supra; Alaska Fish Salting & By-Products Co. v. Smith, \n255 \nU.S. 44, 48\n, 41 S. Ct. 219.\n Since the grant of authority to build the dam and reservoir is valid as an exercise of the Constitutional power to improve navigation, we have no occasion to decide whether the utho rity to construct the dam and reservoir might not also have been constitutionally conferred for the specified purpose of irrigating public lands of the United States. \n8\n Compare United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., \n174 \nU.S. 690, 703\n, 19 S. Ct. 770; United States v. Alford, \n274 \nU.S. 264\n, 47 S. Ct. 597. Or for the speci- \n\n[283 U.S. 423, 458]\n\u00a0\n fied purpose of regulating the flow and preventing floods in this interstate river. \n9\n Or as a means of conserving and apportioning its waters among the states equitably entitled thereto. Or for purpose of performing international obligations. \n10\n Compare Missouri v. Holland, \n252 \nU.S. 416\n, 40 S. Ct. 382, 11 A. L. R. 984.\n Second. The further claim is that the mere existence of the act will invade quasi sovereign rights of Arizona by preventing the state from exercising its right to prohibit or permit under its own laws the appropriation of unappropriated waters flowing within or on its borders. The opportunity and need for further appropriations are fully set forth in the bill. Arizona is arid, and irrigation is necessary for cultivation of additional land. The future growth and welfare of the state are largely dependent \n\n[283 U.S. 423, 459]\n\u00a0\n upon such reclamation. It is alleged that there are within Arizona 2,000, 000 acres not now irrigated which are susceptible of irrigation by further appropriations from the Colorado river. \n11\n To appropriate water means to take and divert a specified quantity thereof and put it to beneficial use in accordance with the laws of the state where such water is found, and, by so doing, to acquire under such laws, a vested right to take and divert from the same source, and to use and consume the same quantity of water annually forever, subject only to the right of prior appropriations. Under the law of Arizona, the perfected vested right to appropriate water flowing within the state cannot be acquired without the performance of physical acts through which the water is and will in fact be diverted to beneficial use. Topographical conditions make it necessary that land in the state be irrigated in large projects. The Colorado river flows, both on the boundary between Arizona and Nevada, and in Arizona alone, through an almost continuous series of deep canyons, the walls of which rise in Arizona to a height varying from a few hundred to more than 5,000 feet. The cost of installing the dams, reservoirs, canals, and distribution works required to effect any diversion will be very heavy; and financing on a large scale is indispensible. Such financing will be impossible unless it clearly appears that, at or prior to the time of constructing such works, vested rights to the permanent use of the water will be acquired. \n\n[283 U.S. 423, 460]\n\u00a0\n The alleged interference with the right of the state to control additional appropriations is based upon the following facts; The average annual flow of the Colorado river system, including the tributaries, is 18, 000,000 acre-feet. 12 Only 9,000,000 acre-feet have been appropriated by Arizona and the defendant states. Of this 3,500,000 acre-feet have been appropriated in Arizona under its laws, and the remaining 5,500,000 acre- feet by the other states. The 9,000,000 acre-feet unappropriated are now subject to appropriation in Arizona under its laws. It is alleged that there are numerous sites suitable for the construction, maintenance, and operation of dams and reservoirs required for the irrigation of land in Arizona; and that actual projects have been planned for the irrigation of 1,000,000 acres, including 100,000 acres owned by the state. For this purpose 4,500,000 acre-feet annually will be additionally required. Permits to appropriate this water have been granted by the state; and definite plans to carry out projects for the building of dams on that part of the river flowing in or on the borders of Arizona have been approved by the state engineer. It is stated that, but for the passage of the Boulder Canyon Project Act, construction work would long since have commenced.\n It is conceded that the continued use of the 3,500,000 acre-feet of water already appropriated in Arizona is not now threatened. And there is no allegation that at the present time the enjoyment of these rights is being interfered with in any way. The claim strenuously urged is that the existence of the act, and the threatened exercise of the authority to use the stored water pursuant to its terms, will prevent Arizona from exercising its right to control the making of further appropriations. It is argued \n\n[283 U.S. 423, 461]\n\u00a0\n that such needed additional appropriations will be prevented because Wilbur proposes to store the entire unappropriated flow of the main stream of the Colorado river at the dam; that Arizona, and those claiming under it, will not be permitted to take any water from the reservoir except upon agreeing that the use shall be subject to the compact; that under the terms of the compact they will not be entitled to appropriate anywate r in excess of that to which there are now perfected rights in Arizona;13 and that, in order irrigate land in Arizona, it is frequently necessary to utilize rights of way over lands of the United States, and, since the act provides that all such \n\n[283 U.S. 423, 462]\n\u00a0\n rights of way or other privileges to be granted by the United States shall be upon the express condition and with the express covenant that they shall be subject to the compact, the act in effect prevents Arizona and those claiming under it from acquiring such rights.\n This contention cannot prevail because it is based, not on any actual or threatened impairment of Arizona's rights, but upon assumped potential invasions. The act does not purport to affect and legal right of the state, or to limit in any way the exercise of its legal right to appropriate any of the unappropriated 9,000,000 acre-feet which may flow within or on its borders. On the contrary, section 18 (43 USCA  617q) specifically declares that nothing therein 'shall be construed as interfering with such rights as the States now have either to the waters within their borders or to adopt such policies and enact such laws as they may deem necessary with respect to the appropriation, control, and use of waters within their borders, except as modified' by interstate agreement. As Arizona has made no such agreement, the act leaves its legal rights unimpaired. There is no allegation of definite physical acts by which Wilbur is interfering, or will interfere, with the exercise by Arizona of its right to make further appropriations by means of diversions above the dam or with the enjoyment of water so appropriated. \n14\n Nor any \n\n[283 U.S. 423, 463]\n\u00a0\n specific allegation of physical acts impeding the exercise of its right to make future appropriations by means of diversions below the dam, or limiting the enjoyment of rights so acquired, unless it be by preventing an adequate quantity of water from flowing in the river at any necessary point of diversion.\n When the bill was filed, the construction of the dam and reservoir had not been commenced. Years must elapse before the project is completed. If by operations at the dam any then perfected right of Arizona, or of those claiming under it, should hereafter be interfered with, appropriate remedies will be available. Compare Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46, 117\n, 27 S. Ct. 655. The bill alleges, that plans have been drawn and permits granted for the taking of additional water in Arizona pursuant to its laws. But Wilbur threatens no physical interference with these projects; and the act interposes no legal inhibitions on their execution. 15 There is no occasion for determining \n\n[283 U.S. 423, 464]\n\u00a0\n now Arizona's rights to interstate or local waters which have not yet been, and which may never be, appropriated.

Arizona has, of course, no constitutional right to use, in aid of appropriation, any land of the United States, and it cannot complain of the provision conditioning the use of such public land. Compare Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, \n243 U.S. 389\n, 403-405, 37 S. Ct. 387.\n As we hold that the grant of authority to construct the dam and reservoir is a valid exercise of congressional power, that the Boulder Canyon Project Act does not purport to abridge the right of Arizona to make, or permit, additional appropriations of water flowing within the state or on its boundaries, and that there is now no threat by Wilbur, or any of the defendant states, to do any act which will interfere with the enjoyment of any presentor f uture appropriation, we have no occasion to consider other questions which have been argued. The bill is dismissed without prejudice to an application for relief in case the stored water is used in such a way as to interfere with the enjoyment by Arizona, or those claiming under it, of any rights already perfected or with the right of Arizona to make additional legal appropriations and to enjoy the same.\n Bill dismissed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of the opinion that the motions to dismiss should be overruled and the defendants required to answer. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The further allegation that the proposed dam, reservoir, and power plants, when completed, may not be subject to the taxing power of Arizona, may be disregarded. The act provides that the title to such works shall remain forever in the United States, and such exemption is but an ordinary incident of any public undertaking by the federal government. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Compare The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 563; The Montello, 20 Wall. 430; St. Anthony Falls Water Power Co. v.

After leaving Utah, the main river flows for 292 miles wholly in Arizona. Then, the middle of the channel forms the boundary between Arizona and Nevada for 145 miles; and for 235 miles, the boundary between Arizona and California. Tributaries of the river flow within Arizona for a combined length of 836 miles, and most of these enter the main stream below Black Canyon. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] An acre-foot is the quantity of water required to cover an acre to a depth of one foot-43,560 cubic feet. See Wyoming v. Colorado, \n259 \nU.S. 419, 458\n, 42 S. Ct. 552. \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The allegation is, in substance, this: Of the average annual flow of 18,000,000 acre-feet, the act and compact permit the present final appropriation of only 15,000,000. This quantity must satisfy all existing appropriations as well as all future appropriations. Of these 15,000,000, one-half is apportioned to the so-called Upper Basin, which includes Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico. The remaining 7,500,000 acre-feet have been allotted to the so-called Lower Basin, which includes Arizona and parts of Nevada and California. Of the water thus allotted to the Lower Basin, 6,500,000 acre-feet have already been appropriated; and, under a contract made by Wilbur with the Metropolitan water district of Southern California, the remaining 1,000,000 are to be diverted to it. Thus it is argued that, consistently with the act and compact, it will be impossible for Arizona to make any further appropriation, unless it be under the following provision. The compact provides that no part of the 3,000,000 acre-feet of the estimated annual flow, not now apportioned, shall be appropriated until after October 1, 1963, as such water may be required to satisfy rights of Mexico, through which country the river flows after leaving the United States. If the satisfaction of recognized Mexican rights reduces the unappropriated water below 1,000,000 acre-feet annually, the Lower Basin States may require the Upper Basin States to deliver from their apportionment, one-half of the amount required to meet the deficit. It is claimed that Arizona thus may use, but not legally appropriate, any unappropriated water which is available for use by it; and that this restricted right does not justify the expenditures necessary for putting the water to beneficial use in Arizona. \n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] There is in the bill a further allegation that, under color of the act, Wilbur has seized and taken possession of all that part of the Colorado river which flows in Arizona and on the boundary thereof, and of the water now flowing therein, and of all the dam sites and reservoir sites suitable forirri gation of the Arizona land and for the generation of electric power 'and now has said river, said water and said sites in his possession; and has excluded and is now excluding the State of Arizona, its citizens, inhabitants, and property owners from said river, said water and said sites, and from all access thereto; has prevented and is now preventing said State, its citizens, inhabitants and property owners from appropriating any of said 8,000,000 acre-feet of unappropriated water. ... ' But from other parts of the bill and from the argument, it is clear that there has been no physical taking of possession of anything, and that Wilbur has not trespassed on lands belonging either to Arizona or any of its citizens. This allegation is thus merely a conclusion of law from the fact that Wilbur, in conformity with the provisions of the act, has made plans for the construction of the dam and reservoir, promulgated regulations concerning the use of the water to be stored, and executed contracts for the use of some of it. \n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] It is also argued that, of the 7,500,000 acre-feet allotted by the compact to the Upper Basin States, only 2,500,000 have already been appropriated, and that thus the presently unused surplus of 5,000,000 acre- feet cannot be appropriated in Arizona. But Arizona is not bound by the compact as it has withheld ratification. If and when withdrawals pursuant to the compact by the Upper Basin States diminish the amount of water actually available for use in Arizona, appropriate action may then be brought.\n The allegation that the inclusion in the compact of the waters of the Gila river (all of which are said to have been appropriated in Arizona) operates to reduce the amount of water which may be taken by that state can likewise be disregarded. Not being bound by the compact, Arizona has not assented to this inclusion of the Gila appropriations in the allotment to the Lower Basin; and there is no allegation that Wilbur or any of the defendant states are interfering with perfected rights to the waters of that river, which enters the Colorado 286 miles below Black Canyon. \n\n\n\n\n","140":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF CONNECTICUT v. COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS(1931)\nNo. 12\nArgued: Decided: February 24, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 660, 661]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ernest L. Averill, of Branford, Conn., and Benedict M. Holden, of Hartford, Conn., for the State of Connecticut.\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 660, 662]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Bentley W. Warren, of Boston, Mass., and Gerald J. Callahan, of Springfield, Mass., for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The State of Connecticut brought this suit against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to enjoin her from diverting waters from the watershed of the Connecticut river to provide water for Boston and neighboring cities and towns.\n Legislation of Massachusetts authorizes diversion into the Wachusett reservoir of the flood waters of the Ware river, chapter 375, St. 1926, and of certain waters of the Swift river, chapter 321, St. 1927. The watersheds of these rivers are about midway between the Boston district and the westerly boundary of the Commonwealth. They are tributaries of the Chicopee; all are nonnavigable streams wholly within Massachusetts. The Chicopee empties into the Connecticut just above Springfild. The latter rises in Canada and northern New Hampshire. It flows between New Hampshire and Vermont through Massachusetts and Connecticut into Long Island Sound. It is about 345 miles long and drains 11,300 square miles of which 1,385 are in Connecticut.\n The complaint alleges:\n Connecticut and Massachusetts recognize the common-law doctrine that riparian owners have the right to the undiminished flow of the stream free from contamination or burden upon it. Connecticut appears as owner of riparian lands and of the bed of the river and as parens \n\n[282 U.S. 660, 663]\n\u00a0\n patriae. The proposed diversion will take water tributary to the Connecticut entirely out of its watershed, will impair navigability of that stream, will take flood waters, and thereby cause damage to agricultural lands that are subject to yearly inundation. The Connecticut is now heavily burdened with offensive matter put into the river in Massachusetts and requires all the water that naturally comes down the river to prevent it from becoming a nuisance and menace to public health. The diversion will destroy property of Connecticut and of its inhabitants without due process of law and cause injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law. The diversion presently proposed is only a portion of that covered by the plan adopted by Massachusetts which includes the acquisition of the waters of other tributaries of the Connecticut.\n By its answer and amendments thereto Massachusetts denies that the proposed diversion will cause any injury or damage, and avers that the amount of water to be taken is negligibel when compared with the flow of the river where it enters Connecticut, that an emergency exists in Massachusetts constituting a justification for a reasonable use of such waters, that the serious injury to the people of the Commonwealth if diversion be prohibited compared to the trival damage possibly caused to Connecticut and its people if diversion be permitted should lead a court of equity to give substitutional relief rather than that specifically prayed, that Connecticut's contention that the diversion will interfere with navigation is not open in the absence of proof that Massachusetts has diverted or actually proposes to divert more water than is permitted by the War Department, that the proposed diversion is in all respects a reasonable use of the waters in question, and that the project will stabilize the flow of the river and result in benefit to Connecticut and the lower riparian owners. \n\n[282 U.S. 660, 664]\n\u00a0\n By its reply, Connecticut denies Massachusetts' affirmative allegations and alleged that there is no necessity for the diversion and that there is an adequate supply of water in the eastern part of Massachusetts.\n The Court appointed Charles W. Bunn of Minnesota as special master and authorized him to take and report to the Court the evidence together with his findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendations for a decree. The master filed his report and the evidence introduced by the respective parties. It shows that he heard arguments in their behalf, and sets forth his findings and conclusions with a recommendation that the bill be dismissed and that (if it be held that lack of present purpose further to develop power at King's Island does not warrant denial of injunction on that ground) the decree contain a provision for the protection of the owner of the dam and power at that place. Connecticut filed numerous exceptions. Massachusetts made no objection to the report. The Court has heard the arguments of counsel and considered their briefs for and against the exceptions and upon the final submission of the case.\n The report shows that Connecticut sought to prove that any subtraction from the flow of the Connecticut river through that State will cause serious damage to the State and its people in that it will impair the navigability of the stream, lessen productivity of river bottom lands by diminution of inundation during times of high water in each year, diminish the power capable of development at King's Island, diminih t he run of shad in the river and decrease its capacity to discharge and destroy sewage.\n The brief substance of the master's findings of fact follows:\n Boston and the surrounding metropolitan area are faced with a serious water shortage in the near future and there is need for a large quantity of additional water. That district includes 35 cities and towns having a population \n\n[282 U.S. 660, 665]\n\u00a0\n of 1,900,000. Other nearby cities and towns are likely in the future to depend on that district for water supply. The total population concerned is now 2,860,000 and it is estimated that it will reach 4,572,000 within forty years. There is no serious dispute about the need of the region to provide presently for additional water.\n Massachusetts applied to the Secretary of War (Act March 3, 1899,  10, 30 Stat. 1151 (33 USCA  403)) for authority to make the proposed diversions. After hearing both sides and examining the facts, the Secretary permitted diversion of the flood waters of the Ware in excess of 85 million gallons per day between October 15 and June 15 and prohibited the taking of any water except during that period. He permitted diversion of all waters of the Swift except enough to maintain a flow therein of 20 million gallons per day; but he required that, during the period from June 1 to November 30 there shall be released from the impounding dam 110 cubic feet per second (71 million gallons per day) whenever the flow of the Connecticut at Sunderland, Mass. (a town 20 miles north of the confluence of the Chicopee and Connecticut), is 4,650 cubic feet per second or less, and 70 cubic feet per second (45 million gallons per day) when the flow is more than 4,650 and less than 4,900 cubic feet per second. The Secretary found that the discharge at Sunderland of 4,650 cubic feet per second corresponds to an average gauge height at Hartford of 2 feet and that a discharge of 4,900 cubic feet per second corresponds to 2.1 gauge height at Hartford.\n The annual flow of the Connecticut at the Massachusetts-Connecticut boundary is about 17,000 cubic feet per second, approximately 11,000 million gallons a day. The watershed above that boundary is 9,915 square miles. The drainage of the Ware at the point of diversion on that river is 98 square miles and that of the Swift at the point of diversion is 186 square miles. The diversion permitted \n\n[282 U.S. 660, 666]\n\u00a0\n by the Secretary will furnish about 191 million gallons per day. The Massachusetts Acts do not authorize the diversion of any waters other than the Ware and Swift and as to these the record shows that (as far as counsel can commit it) Massachusetts proposes to abide by the War Department requirements and restrictions.\n The total area subject to such diversions is 2.93 per cent. of the watershed above Connecticut. The permitted diversions represent an average yearly subtraction from the flow of the Connecticut at the state line of about 2 per cent.; but 94 per cent. of this occurs when the Hartford gauge reads above 3.5 feet which means 11.5 feet depth of water. The Government has heretofore sought to maintain 10 feet of water below Hartford. A War Department project contemplates a 12 foot channel. (On that bottom level, 3.5 feet on the gauge would mean 13.5 feet of water.)\n Dredging is required every year to maintain a channel of 10 feet over numerous bars below Hartford. Navigation is difficult when the depth falls below 10 feet. There is no difficulty when there is 12 or even 11 feet. The required release of water from the Swift river reservoir during periods of low water will somewhat benefit navigation. The maximum diversions are at high water and lessen depth 5 to 6 inches. At medium stages the diversion is less and at very low stages the flow is increased. The diversion will not perceptibly or materially interfere with navigation.\n The height of floods will be lessened from one to six inches. Because of the diversion, small pieces of hay land will fail to receive flood waters. It is impossible to determine from the evidence to what extent that will occur. Te l essening of spring floods will have its advantages and disadvantages; it will reduce some damages and increase others. The damage to the hay land is not shown to be of serious magnitude; and, far from being \n\n[282 U.S. 660, 667]\n\u00a0\n established by clear and convincing evidence, it is not shown by evidence making it possible of computation or proving that it is large.\n There is shown one possible development of power. It is at King's Island in Connecticut where 4,000 horse power is now produced. The owner has been authorized by the Federal Power Commission to build a higher dam to develop approximately 50,000 horse power. It is not shown that the company has determined so to do, or that the necessary capital has been arranged for. The present use of the water for power purposes will not be distrubed the water for power purposes will not be disturbed be developed to the extent of 50,000 horse power, the diversion will cause an injury of $ 80,000.\n Connecticut failed to establish that the taking of flood waters will be materially injurious to the shard run or that the diversion will perceptibly increase the pollution of the river.\n The legislative determination to use the waters of the Ware and Swift was made and the acts of 1926 and 1927 were passed as the result of long- continued and careful study. Connecticut submits two plans to show that the northeastern part of Massachusetts has abundant supplies of water for the Boston district.\n The first involves combining water from 15 watersheds on the Assabet, Sudbury, Shawsheen, and Ipswich rivers. The plan involves pumping and also treatment of the water for its purification. From an engineering standpoint it is inferior to that adopted for the Ware-Swift development. And, while a considerable amount of water from these sources may be made available, most of it is of a quality much inferior to the waters of the Ware and Swift. And the amount would be inadequate and constitute only a part of the needed supply. The operation of the plan would be of uncertain duration and might have to be abandoned. \n\n[282 U.S. 660, 668]\n\u00a0\n The second plan is based on the taking of water from the Merrimack. That stream drains a large watershed mainly in New Hampshire. It is polluted and the pollution is practically beyond the control of Massachusetts. There is no certainty of its improvement or that it will not become worse. Unquestionably, polluted water may be made wholesome by proper treatment. A considerable amount of industrial waste from mills, cellulose plants, tanneries, rendering works, and gas works, of which there are many in New Hampshire, is peculiarly difficult to eliminate from water. The necessary treatment of waters so polluted involves several processes storage for 30 to 90 days in a large reservoir, aeration, filtration, chlorination. These introduce a human element subject to weaknesses and failures of human nature. Instances of breakdowns are given. There is a small element of danger involved in every elaborate system of water purification. With a single exception, all the witnesses expressed preference for a supply of originally pure water over a purified polluted one. Lawrence is the only city in Massachusetts using Merrimack water for drinking. It consumes an extraordinary amount of bottled water the cost of which in 1916 was about 55 per cent. of the amount paid for public water for all purposes. The plan contemplates the taking of 200 million gallons per day from the Merrimack at Tyng's Island, just below the New Hampshire line. That is about one-quarter of its flow. Factories below the proposed takeout would be liable to suffer damage from the diversion. The stream is navigable below Haverhill and it is not certain whether the taking of that amount would be permitted by the Government. The master says: 'I find the taking from the Merrimack ought not to be imposed upon the Boston District. Because first the water is a polluted water and Massachusetts has no adequate control of the pollution or adequate remedy to cure it; that the water is of quality \n\n[282 U.S. 660, 669]\n\u00a0\n much infrio r to the Ware and Swift and the proposed project inferior from an engineering standpoint to the reservoir and tunnel which the Ware and Swift development involves.'\n The Massachusetts legislation confines itself to the taking of certain waters of the Ware and Swift. The Secretary of War has imposed additional limitations. Massachusetts declares that she intends to divert no more water than the Secretary of War permits and that she will in every way follow the conditions he imposes.\n The exceptions filed by Connecticut need not be set forth or considered in detail. The governing rule is that this Court will not exert its extraordinary power to control the conduct of one State at the suit of another unless the threatened invasion of rights is of serious magnitude and established by clear and convincing evidence. New York v. New Jersey, \n256 \nU.S. 296, 309\n, 41 S. Ct. 492; Missouri v. Illinois, \n200 \nU.S. 496, 521\n, 26 S. Ct. 268. The burden on Connecticut to sustain the allegations on which it seeks to prevent Massachusetts from making the proposed diversions is much greater than that generally required to be borne by one seeking an injunction in a suit between private parties. North Dakota v. Minnesota, \n263 \nU.S. 365, 374\n, 44 S. Ct. 138. There has been brought forward no adequate reason for disturbing the master's findings of fact. They are amply sustained by the evidence and are adopted by the Court.\n Connecticut suggests that, under the common law in force in both States, each riparian owner has a vested right in the use of the flowing waters and is entitled to have them to flow as they were wont, unimpaired as to quantity and uncontaminated as to quality. It maintains that the taking of waters from the Ware and Swift infringes vested property rights in that State which cannot be taken without its consent against the will of the owners. And it insists that this Court, following the law enforced by each of the States within its own boundaries, \n\n[282 U.S. 660, 670]\n\u00a0\n should grant injunction against any diversion from the watersheds of these rivers.\n But the laws in respect of riparian rights that happen to be effective for the time being in both States do not necessarily constitute a dependable guide or just basis for the decision of controversies such as that here presented. The rules of the common law on that subject do not obtain in all the States of the Union, and there are variations in their application. The doctrine of appropriation prevails in some States. And every State is free to change its laws governing riparian ownership and to permit the appropriation of flowing waters for such purposes as it may deem wise. United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., \n174 \nU.S. 690, 702\n, 19 S. Ct. 770\n\n\n For the decision of suits between States, federal, state and international law are considered and applied by this Court as the exigencies of the particular case may require. The determination of the relative rights of contending States in respect of the use of streams flowing through them does not depend upon the same considerations and is not governed by the same rules of law that are applied in such States for the solution of similar questions of private right. Kansas v. Colorado, \n185 \nU.S. 125, 146\n, 22 S. Ct. 552. And, while the municipal law relating to like questions between individuals is to be taken into account, it is not to be deemed to have controlling weight. As was shown in Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46, 100\n, 27 S. Ct. 655, such disputes are to be settled on the basis of equality of right. But this is not to say that there must be an equal division of the waters of an interstate stream among the States through which it flows. It means that the principles of right and equity shall be applied having regard to the 'equal level or plane on which all the States stand, in point of power and right, under our constitutional system' and that, upon a consideration of the pertinent laws \n\n[282 U.S. 660, 671]\n\u00a0\n of the contending States nd all other relevant facts, this Court will determine what is an equitable apportionment of the use of such waters. Wyoming v. Colorado, \n259 \nU.S. 419, 465\n, 470 S., 42 S. Ct. 552.\n The development of what Mr. Justice Brewer, speaking for the Court in Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46, 98\n, 27 S. Ct. 655, refers to as interstate common law is indicated and its application for the ascertainment of the relative rights of States in respect of interstate waters is illustrated by Missouri v. Illinois, \n200 \nU.S. 496\n, 26 S. Ct. 268; Kansas v. Colorado, supra; Wyoming v. Colorado, supra; and Wisconsin v. Illinois, \n278 \nU.S. 367\n, 49 S. Ct. 163; Id ., \n281 \nU.S. 179\n, 50 S. Ct. 266. Two of these cases are much like the one at bar.\n Kansas v. Colorado was a suit to prevent the latter from withholding waters of the Arkansas river from flowing as they were wont through Kansas. The common law rule as to riparian ownership was then generally recognized in Kansas while in Colorado the doctrine of appropriation prevailed. The Court held that the upper State was not entitled to use the waters of the Arkansas flowing therein as it chose regardless of resulting conditions or impairment of the right to the use of such waters in the lower State. It was shown that, without diversion from the watershed, the waters of the Arkansas in Colorado were and for many years had been used to irrigate and make productive what theretofore had been barren lands. It was found that the resulting diminution of the flow of the river caused perceptible injury to a portion of the valley in Kansas but that it had been of little, if any, detriment to the great body of the valley. The Court held (206 U. S. at page 114, 27 S. Ct. 655) that the rule of equality of right forbade interference with the existing withdrawals of water in Colorado.\n In Wyoming v. Colorado the former used to prevent a diversion of the waters of the Laramie river which rises \n\n[282 U.S. 660, 672]\n\u00a0\n in Colorado and flows into Wyoming. Both States are in the arid region and apply the doctrine of appropriation. Wyoming objected on the ground that the diversion was to another watershed. The Court held (page 467 of 259 U. S., 42 S. Ct. 552, 558) that: 'The principle of such diversions being recognized in both states, its application to this interstate stream does not in itself afford a ground for complaint, unless the practice in both be rejected in determining what, as between them, is reasonable and admissible as to this stream, which we think should not be done.' The problem there presented was expressed as follows (page 467 of 259 U. S., 42 S. Ct. 552, 558): 'We are thus brought to the question of the basis on which the relative rights of these states in the waters of this interstate stream should be determined. Should the doctrine of appropriation, which each recognizes and enforces within her borders, be applied? Or is there another basis which is more consonant with right and equity?' After an elaborate discussion of the facts, the Court said (page 470 of 259 U. S., 42 S. Ct. 552, 559): 'We conclude that Colorado's objections to the doctrine of appropriation as a basis of decision are not well taken, and that it furnishes the only basis which is consonant with the principles of right and equity applicable to such a controversy as this is.'\n It is very clear that, under earlier decisions here, the strict rules for which Connecticut contends are not necessarily controlling in this case. There is nothing in the master's findings of fact to justify an inference that any real or substantial injury or damage will presently result to Connecticut from the diversions by Massachusetts authorized by the acts of 1926 and 1927 as limited and defined by the Secretary of War. No discussion is required as to the effect of the proposed diversion upon the navigability of the river, agriculture, fish life or pollution in Connecticut.\n\n\n[282 U.S. 660, 673]\n\u00a0\n The proposed taking of the waters of the Swift and Ware will not affect the present dam, works or production of power at King's Island. While the owing company has secured authority to build the higher dam, it has not resolved so to do. It is not found and there is nothing to show that it intends to construct any dam or works of a kind or capacity that, if now in use, would be injuriously affected by such diversion. At most there is a mere possibility that at some undisclosed time the owner, were it not for the diversion, might construct additional works capable of using all of the flow of the river including the waters proposed to be taken by Massachusetts. Injunction will not issue in the absence of actual or presently threatened interference. The facts disclose no basis for relief in respect of that property. New York v. Illinois, \n274 \nU.S. 488\n, 47 S. Ct. 661; New Jersey v. Sargent, \n269 \nU.S. 328, 331\n, 338 S., 46 S. Ct. 122.\n Drinking and other domestic purposes are the highest uses of water. An ample supply of wholesome water is essential. Massachusetts, after elaborate research, decided to take the waters of the Ware and Swift rather than to rely on the sources in the eastern part of the Commonwealth where all are or are liable to become polluted. We need not advert to other considerations, disclosed by the evidence and findings, to show that the proposed use of the waters of the Ware and Swift should not be enjoined.\n Connecticut maintains that the presently prposed diversion will not be adequate for the future needs of the Boston district and that the size and character of the works as well as legislative reports and other circumstances disclose an intention on the part of Massachusetts, when the need shall arise, to draw from other rivers-Millers, Deerfield, Quaboag and Westfield-tributary to the Connecticut and insists that the decree should \n\n[282 U.S. 660, 674]\n\u00a0\n restrain Massachusetts forever from increasing its diversion to an amount in excess of what the Secretary of War has already indicated would cause no damage to the navigation of the connecticut.\n The scope of the project is that shown by the Acts as limited by the determination of the War Department. It involves no diversion from streams other than the Ware and Swift. Massachusetts declares that she intends to and must obey these findings of the War Department. Her statements before the master and here clearly negative any threat, intention or purpose to make any diversion of water in excess of that specified or otherwise than as set forth in the determinations of the Was Department. Injunction issues to prevent existing or presently threatened injuries. One will not be granted against something merely feared as liable to occur at some indefinite time in the future. New York v. Illinois, supra; New Jersey v. Sargent, supra.\n Connecticut's bill of complaint will be dismissed without prejudice to her right to maintain a suit against Massachusetts whenever it shall appear that substantial interests of Connecticut are being injured through a material increase of the amount of the waters of the Ware and Swift diverted by or under the authority of Massachusetts over and above the quantities authorized by the acts of 1926 and 1927 as heretofore limited by the War Department. Each party will pay its own costs, one-half of the expenses incurred by the special master and one-half the amount to be fixed by the Court as his compensation.\n Counsel for Massachusetts will prepare a form of decree in consonance with this decision and furnish a copy to counsel for Connecticut within fifteen days; and, within ten days after such submission, the draft decree together with suggestions in behalf of Connecticut, if any, will be submitted to the Court. \n\n\n\n","141":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF CONNECTICUT v.

Co. \n\n[282 U.S. 194, 202]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The state of Florida and the members of its Railroad Commission ( appellants in No. 16) brought suit in the District Court to restrain the enforcement of that part of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission which dealt with certain intrastate rates of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company in Florida. The order, made August 2, 1928, required the railroad company to establish carload rates for logs (except walnut, cherry, and cedar) in intrastate commerce 'within the State of Florida' which should be the same as the rates prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission as reasonable for transportation in interstate commerce from points in the northern portion of Florida to destinations in Georgia. The order in that respect was assailed as being outside the scope of the issues raised in the proceeding in which the order was entered and without substantial evidence to support it, and as extending beyond the statutory authority of the Commission and the limits of federal power under the Constitution.\n Suits for similar relief were brought by the Brooks-Scanlon Corporation and other corporations (appellants in No. 17) and by the Wilson Lumber Company (appellant in No. 18), manufacturers and shippers of lumber in Florida. The Public Service Commission of Georgia was permitted to intervene, and the three suits were consoli- \n\n[282 U.S. 194, 203]\n\u00a0\n dated and heard before a court of three judges as required by the applicable statute.\n The court was of the opinion that the order of the Commission touching intrastate rates could be construed as being limited to points of origin on the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in the northern part of Florida, as the Commission had confined its order to these points of origin in fixing interstate rates. Taking the view that, if construed so as to apply to intrastate rates throughout the state, the order would probably be invalid, the court sustained it upon the narrower construction. Decrees were entered accordingly in January, 1929, dismissing the bills. 30 F.(2d) 116.\n Thereupon the Interstate Commerce Commission amended its order by inserting additional exceptions of logs, and also with respect to intrastate rates, 'for the purpose of clarification,' by substituting for the phrase 'within the State of Florida' the words 'within and throughout the entire State of Florida, without exception.' Petitions for rehearing and for leave to file supplemental bills were then presented to the District Court and were granted. The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company was allowed to intervene. On the rehearing, both the original and supplemental bills were dismissed. 31 F.(2d) 580. The court upheld the amended order of the Commission as to intrastate rates, in its state-wide operation, not 'because of undue prejudice to shippers and localities, or because of undue discrimination against the particular interstate commerce' in the described logs, but solely upon the ground that the order was aimed at a discrimination 'against general interstate commerce,' caused by intrastate rates which were so low as to throw an undue burden upon the interstate revenues of the carrier.\n From the decrees entered accordingly the present appeals are brought. \n\n[282 U.S. 194, 204]\n\u00a0\n The proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission was begun by the filing of a complaint by the Georgia Public Service Commission against the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company. The complaint stated that its object was to secure reasonable rates on logs from points on the railroad company's line within Florida to all destinations on its line in Georgia, and to remove any unjust discrimination found to exist as provided in the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  1 et seq.). The complaint alleged that there was competition between mills and consumers in Georgia and those in Florida in the purchase and transportation of logs from points in Florida to destinations in Georgia. The intrastate log rates of that railroad in Florida, and its interstate log rates between Florida and Georgia, for distances up to 170 miles, were set forth, and it was alleged that the interstate rates greatly exceeded the intrastate rates for like distances upon traffic moving under substantially similar conditions. The complaint charged that the interstate rates were unjust and unreasonable in violation of section 1, were unjustly discriminatory in violation of section 2, and were unduly prejudicial to the interstate shipper and preferential in favor of the intrastate shipper in violation of section 3, of the Interstate Commerce Act. It was also charged that the carrier's intrastte rates in Florida gave unreasonable preference to intrastate shippers in that state and were unduly prejudicial to interstate shippers in Georgia, causing an unjust discrimination against interstate commerce in violation of section 13 of the act. The complaints asked for an order requiring the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company to desist from the described violations of the act, and prescribing just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory interstate rates to be charged by the defendant carrier for the transportation of carload shipments of logs from all Florida points to all destinations in Georgia, and that the measure of such rates should be no higher than \n\n[282 U.S. 194, 205]\n\u00a0\n those concurrently in effect for the same kind of property moving in intrastate commerce in Florida.\n The state of Florida was notified of the proceeding, and the Florida Railroad Commission appeared in defense of the Florida intrastate rates. There were a number of interveners, including shippers of logs in intrastate commerce in Florida, Georgia lumber companies, and railroad companies operating in Florida and between Florida and Georgia, and all parties were fully heard.\n In its report, the Interstate Commerce Commission stated that, while the complainant assailed the rates from all Florida points, the record showed that, so far as interstate rates were concerned, relief was desired only with respect to the rates on logs 'from that portion of Florida lying north of and including Jacksonville, Gainesville, Burnett's Lake, and High Springs,' described as North Florida, 'to destinations in Georgia for distances not exceeding 170 miles.' The Commission pointed out that the Florida intrastate rates under attack were published for carload lots for 170 miles and less. The history of these rates was reviewed. With certain modifications and extensions, they were what was generally known as the 'Cummer scale,' which had originally been established by contract between a predecessor railroad company and a lumber company. This contract, the obligations of which were assumed by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company, expired in 1918 and was not renewed. Meanwhile, in 1914, the railroad company had entered into a similar contract with the predecessor in interest of the intervener Brooks-Scanlon Corporation, and this contract was to continue in effect until certain timber, tributary to the line of the railroad, had been transported. Accordingly, the railroad company filed schedules with the Florida Railroad Commission extending the Cummer Scale for described distances. The State Commission refused to permit the proposed rates to become effective because \n\n[282 U.S. 194, 206]\n\u00a0\n they were applicable only on trainloads and were not available to all shippers. That Commission further advised the railroad company that the rates were too low and such as might be deemed confiscatory. The rates were republished to apply on carloads over all of the company's lines in Florida. These rates, extended with respect to distances and modified by certain increases and reductions, have been continued by the railroad company for the purpose of complying with its contractual obligations and not because it has considered the scale to be a proper one for general application on intrastate traffic within Florida.\n While not admitting that the interstate rates were unreasonable, the railroad company submitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission a proposal for their revision. The Commission made a tabular comparison of the existing interstate and intrastate rates and the proposed interstate rates from North Florida, and after a further statement of the evidence concluded that the interstate rates thus proposed were reasonable.\n The Commission then made the following findings as to interstate and intrastate rates:\n'We find that the interstate rates on logs, except walnut, cherry, and cedar, in carloads, from points on defendant's lines in Florida north of and including Jacksonville, Gainesville, Burnett's Lake, and High Springs, to destinations on its lines in Georgia for distanes not exceeding 170 miles are, and for the future will be, unreasonable to the extent that they exceed, or may exceed, the following distance scale of rates in cents per 100 pounds, minimum weight 40,000 pounds, which rates we find are and will be reasonable' (inserting schedule ). ...\n\n'We further find that the Florida intrastate rates assailed, which are lower than the interstate rates herein found reasonable for corresponding distances, result, and \n\n[282 U.S. 194, 207]\n\u00a0\n will result, in undue preference and advantage of shippers of intrastate traffic within the State of Florida, in undue prejudice to shippers of interstate traffic from points in the State of Florida to points in the State of Georigia, and in unjust discrimination against interstate commerce.\n\n'We further find that said undue preference and advantage, undue prejudice, and unjust discrimination can and should be removed by the establishment of rates for intrastate application within Florida which shall correspond with the rates herein found reasonable for interstate application from Florida to Georgia.\n\n'We further find that whether the aforesaid rates pertain to transportation in interstate commerce or to transportation in intrastate commerce the transportation services in each instance are performed by defendant under substantially similar circumstances and conditions.'\n\n The order of the Commission, entered upon this report, after prescribing the interstate rates from Northern Florida to Georgia, continued with respect to intrastate rates in Florida as follows:\n'It is further ordered, that said defendant be, and it is hereby notified and required to cease and desist from practicing the undue preference and advantage, undue prejudice, and unjust discrimination found in said report to exist in the relation of intrastate and interstate rates and to establish, put in force, and maintain rates for the transportation of logs, except walnut, cherry, and cedar, in carloads, minimum weight 40,000 pounds, in intrastate commerce within the State of Florida which shall be the same as those prescribed in the next preceding paragraph hereof as reasonable for transportation in interstate commerce from points in the State of Florida to destinations in the State of Georgia.'\n\n This order, as already stated, was amended so as definitely to provide that the requirement as to intrastate \n\n[282 U.S. 194, 208]\n\u00a0\n rates should apply throughout the entire state of Florida, without exception. In making this amendment there was no further report or finding of the Commission.\n We agree with the conclusion of the District Court that, on the facts that have been found by the Commission, the order with respect to intrastate rates in its state-wide application cannot be sustained by reason of a proper determination of undue prejudice 'as between persons or localities in intrastate commerce on the one hand and interstate ... commerce on the other hand.' Interstate Commerce Act,  13(4), as added by Transportation Act  416 (49 USCA  13(4). The limitation of the Commission's finding as to interstate rates, and of the order prescribing them, to transportation from points in the northern part of Florida to points in Georgia, defined the interstate commerce which was deemed to be concerned. All of this commerce was potential, no actual movement from Florida to Georgia having been shown. It would be an extreme and unwarranted assumption that, to protect this interstate commerce from unjust discrimination as between persons or localities, it was necessary to alter the existing rates for the transportation of logs between all points whatever within Florida. Such a conclusion would not only require evidence to support it but findings of appropriate definiteness to express it. Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. State Public Utilities Commission, \n245 \nU.S. 493, 507\n, 508 S., 38 S. Ct. 170; Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563, 579\n, 580 S., 42 S. Ct. 232, 22 A. L. R. 1086; New York v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 591, 600\n, 2 S.  . Ct. 239. The District Court, again examining the record upon the rehearing, reaffirmed its opinion that there was no such evidence, and it is sufficient on this appeal to observe that there are no findings of proper explicitness to that effect. Recognizing that the state-wide order of the Commission as to intrastate rates was upheld only because the intrastate rates were deemed to \n\n[282 U.S. 194, 209]\n\u00a0\n be so low as to cause 'undue discrimination against the carrier's general interstate commerce,' the government and the Commission have addressed their argument before this court to the defense of the order upon that ground.\n Dealing with the order in this aspect, we may briefly dismiss the appellants' preliminary objections in relation to the scope of the proceeding and the adequacy of the hearing before the Commission. As the Florida Railroad Commission appeared in defense of the intrastate rates, and the railroad company, the rates of which were in question, and other parties in interest, both shippers and carriers, were heard, the question now presented relates to the substance of the determination of the Commission and its support in the evidence rather than to mere matters of pleading and procedure. In making its order, the Commission could exercise all the authority conferred by the Interstate Commerce Act for the purpose of removing such unjust discrimination as was found to exist. If the Commission had made adequate findings supported by evidence upon the point under consideration, we should not be disposed to conclude that the order must be upset because of the manner in which the proceeding was initiated or of the generality of the allegations of the complaint.\n Nor do we find that the order exceeds the authority of the Commission in the view that the intrastate rates under consideration were not 'made or imposed' by authority of the state within the meaning of section 13(3) of the act, as added by Transportation Act,  416 (49 USCA  13(3). While the 'Cummer scale' of rates was not prescribed by the Florida Railroad Commission and was not the result of any affirmative action on its part, these rates were maintained in intrastate commerce subject to the authority of the state and were published as required by its laws. These rates may thus be regarded as made by the authority of the state and within the purview of the act unless its provisions disclose an intention to ex- \n\n[282 U.S. 194, 210]\n\u00a0\n clude intrastate rates of this sort. But it is clear that the fundamental purpose of the Congress in enacting section 13, subdivisions (3) and (4), was to reach intrastate rates that were found to result in unjust discrimination against interstate commerce. It was not the fact that the rate was affirmatively prescribed by the state, but that it was maintained as an intrastate rate, and as such was inimical to the proper interests of interstate commerce, that led the Congress to give to the Interstate Commerce Commission express authority to take cognizance of that rate and to prescribe the intrastate rate that should be charged thereafter in order to remove the undue discrimination. See Board of Railroad Commissioners v. Great Northern Railway Co., \n281 U.S. 412\n, 424-428, 50 S. Ct. 391. The provision of section 13(3) for notice to, and conference with, the authorities of the state, is important, not only where the rates have been prescribed by the state, but also where they are in force with the permission of the state and, as intrastate rates, would otherwise be subject to the jurisdiction of the state. To hold, as some of the appellants urge, that there can be no adjustment of intrastate rates by the Interstate Commerce Commission so far as may be needed to protect interstate commerce until the state itself has first 'sat in judgment on the issue of the lawfulness of those intrastate rates' would be to impose a limitation not required by the terms of the statute and repugnant to the grant of authority.\n The power of the Congress to authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission to establih i ntrastate rates in order to remove an unjust discrimination against interstate commerce is not open to dispute.

In the exercise of this power, the Congress has given to the Commission authority, not only to remove an undue prejudice as between persons or localities, but to establish a state-wide level of intrastate rates when this is found to be necessary to accomplish the purpose of the statute. In construing the statute this court has held that the general provision of section 13(4), prohibiting 'unjust discrimination against interstate or foreign commerce' and authorizing the Commission to establish intrastate rates to prevent such discrimination, is to be read in connection with section 15a, both of which were added by Transportation Act, 1920 (sections 416, 422, 42 Stat. 484, 488 (49 USCA  13(4), 15a)). There is what this court has called a 'dovetail relation' between the two provisions. The authority granted by section 13(4) is thus to be considered in the light of the affirmative duty of the Commission to fix rates and to take other important steps to maintain an adequate national railway system.\n As intrastate rates and the income from them must play a most important part in maintaining such a system, the effective operation of the act requires that intrastate traffic should pay 'a fair proportionate share' of the cost of maintenance. And if there is interference with the accomplishment of the purpose of the Congress because of a disparity of intrastate rates as compared with interstate rates, the Commission is authorized to end the disparity by directly removing it. Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co., pages 585, 586 of 257 U. S., 42 S. Ct. 239, supra; New York v. United States, supra.\n The question in the present cases, then, is not one of authority, but of its appropriate exercise. The propriety of the exertion of the authority must be tested by its relation to the purpose of the grant and with suitable regard to the principle that, whenever the federal power is exerted within what would otherwise be the domain of state \n\n[282 U.S. 194, 212]\n\u00a0\n power, the justification of the exercise of the federal power must clearly appear. Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. State Public Utilities Commission, supra. The Commission has no general authority to regulate intrastate rates, and the mere existence of a disparity between particular rates on intrastate and interstate traffic does not warrant the Commission in prescribing intrastate rates. Arkansas Railroad Commission v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Co., surpa. If the action of the Commission is not simply for the removal of undue prejudice against interstate commerce as between persons or localities, and the Commission undertakes to prescribe a state-wide level of intrastate rates in order to avoid an undue burden, from a revenue standpoint, upon the interstate carrier, there should be appropriate findings upon evidence to support an order idrected to that end. Thus, in Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co., supra, at page 566 of 257 U. S., 42 S. Ct. 232, where the question related to the general level of intrastate passenger fares, there were findings as to the effect of the maintenance of the intrastate fares upon the revenues of the carriers, warranting the ultimate finding of undue discrimination against interstate commerce as a whole. Similar facts were shown in New York v. United States, supra, at page 601 of 257 U. S., 42 S. Ct. 232. In the present instance, the Commission did not undertake to estabish a statewide level of rates for the interstate transportation of logs, and, in order to sustain the state- wide order as to intrastate rates (as one needed to avoid an undue burden on the revenues of the carrier and a consequent interference with the maintenance of an adequate transportation system), it must appear that there are findings, supported by evidence, of the essential facts as to the particular traffic and revenue, and the effect of the intrastate rates, both as existing and as prescribed, upon the income of the carrier, which would justify that conclusion. \n\n[282 U.S. 194, 213]\n\u00a0\n In the paragraph, which we have quoted, containing the ultimate finding of the Commission with respect to the unjust discrimination caused by the existing intrastate rates as between persons and localities, there is a concluding clause that the intrastate rates result 'in unjust discrimination against interstate commerce.' This general statement in the language of the statute, neither standing alone nor taken in its context, could be regarded as sufficient to support a state-wide order from the standpoint of income, in the absence of supporting findings of fact as to the revenue from the traffic in question.\n In its report, the Commission stated that the Florida Railroad Commission, and the interveners from that state, had contended that the intrastate rates were remunerative to the carrier. The State Commission introduced a cost study to support its contention, and the carrier also submitted evidence as to the cost of transporting logs on its line. The Interstate Commerce Commission said that both cost studies were based on 'arbitrary assumptions' and that neither could be accepted 'to show the approximate actual cost of transporting logs in single carloads intrastate throughout Florida.' The Commission made a comparison of 'present interstate and intrastate rates and the proposed interstate rates from north Florida in cents per 100 pounds, and the earnings thereunder per car of 50,000 pounds for distances to 170 miles.' The 'earnings' thus set forth were merely the amounts receivable per car for the given number of pounds under the rates for the prescribed distances. The Commission also thated that the carrier had shown that the earnings under the Florida intrastate rates on logs were materially lower than the earnings under the interstate rates from Florida to Georgia on brick, sand, lime and cement. Comparing the Florida intrastate rates on logs with other intrastate rates and with interstate rates, the Commission reached the conclusion that the intrastate rates assailed were less than reasonably compensatory. \n\n[282 U.S. 194, 214]\n\u00a0\n But to justify the Commission in the alteration of intrastate rates, it was not enough for the Commission merely to find that the existing intrastate rates on the particular traffic were not remunerative or reasonably compensatory. The authority to determine the reasonableness per se of intrastate rates lay with the state authorities and not with the Interstate Commerce Commission. In dealing with unjust discrimination as between persons and localities in relation to interstate commerce, the question is one of the relation of rates to each other. In considering the authority of the Commission to enter the state field and to change a scale of intrastate rates in the interest of the carrier's revenue, the question is that of the relation of rates to income. The raising of rates does not necessarily increase revenue. It may in particular localities reduce revenue instead of increasing it, by discouraging patronage. \n1\n Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co., supra. The Commission stated in its report that witnesses for the Florida interveners had testified 'that any material increase in the Florida intrastate rates would either cause them to move their plants to the timber or abandon operations,' and that in either event the carrier would lose considerable traffic.\n The Commission made no findings as to the revenue which had been derived by the carrier from the traffic \n\n[282 U.S. 194, 215]\n\u00a0\n in question, or which could reasonably be expected under the increased rates, or that the alteration of the intrastate rates would produce, or was likely to produce, additional income necessary to prevent an undue burden upon the carrier's interstate revenues and to maintain an adequate transportation service.\n The question is not merely one of the absence of elaboration or of a suitably complete statement of the grounds of the Commission's determination, to the importance of which this court has recently adverted ( Beaumont, Sour Lake & Western Railway Co. v. United States, decided November 24, 1930, \n282 \nU.S. 74\n, 51 S. Ct. 1), but of the lack of the basic or essential findings required to support the Commission's order. In the absence of such findings, we are not called upon to examine the evidence in order to resolve opposing contentions as to what it shows or to spell out and state such conclusions of fact as it may permit. The Commission is the fact-finding body, and the Court examines the evidence not to make findings for the Commission but to ascertain whether its findings are properly supported. If the facts as to intrastate transportation of logs in Florida are such as to justify an order as to intrastate rates in order to end an unjust discrimination as against interstate commerce either as between persons and localities, or because of an undue burden upon the revenues of the carrier, the Interstate Commerce Commission is still at liberty, acting in accordance with the authority conferred by the statute, to make such determinations as the situation may require.\n We conclude that the portion of the order of the Commission which is now under review, with respect to intrastate rates, is not supported by the findings of the Commission and this part of the order must be set aside.\n Decrees reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the Florida Fertilizer Case, 151 I. C. C. 602, the Interstate Commece Commission, in refusing to order an increase in the Florida intrastate rates on fertilizer, said: 'Furthermore, it is not certain that if the Florida intrastate rates were increased to the interstate level, additional revenue would accrue to the carriers, for if the prophesies of the interior plants and of the Florida commission are justified, practically all shipments would be made from the ports with the result that the total charges would probably be no greater than they now are.' \n\n\n\n\n","143":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF LOUISIANA v. STATE OF MISSISSIPPI(1931)\nNo. 98\nArgued: Decided: February 2, 1931\n\n\n\n Messrs. Gerard Brandon, of Natchez, Miss., John Dale, of Vidalia, La., Robert Ash, of Washington, D. C., and Percy Saint, of New Orleans, La., for complainant \n\n[282 U.S. 458, 459]\n\u00a0\n State of Louisiana.\n Messrs. H. H. Creekmore, Rufus Creekmore, Rush H. Knox, and Elmer C. Sharp, all of Jackson, Miss., for defendant State of Mississippi.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The bill seeks a decree locating and establishing a portion of the boundary line of Louisiana and Mississippi, between Willow Point and adjacent premises in the former, and lands in township 9 north, range 8 west, in the latter state, where the Mississippi river forms what is known as Albemarle Bend.\n In 1823 the thread of the navigable channel of the river was the true boundary line, and is correctly located by surveys made by the Mississippi River Commission in 1823 and 1824. At that time the territory now in dispute was within Mississippi, and consisted of an island (then known as Tullos Island, which lay to the east of the thread of the river, and was separated from the Mississippi mainland by a chute) and certain portions of the mainland east thereof. Prior to 1882 the island was renamed 'Island No. 98.'\n The complainant asserts:\n That between 1823 and 1913 erosions occurred which ate away all of Tullos Island and large portions of the Mississippi shore.\n That accretions attached to the Louisiana shore.\n That the river, and consequently the interstate boundary line, gradually and imperceptibly moved eastwardly and northwardly a distance of five or six miles.\n That the accretions to the Louisiana shore became the territory of complainant; \n\n[282 U.S. 458, 460]\n\u00a0\n That in 1912-1913 the river suddenly changed its course, cut across the bar formed by the said accretions on the Louisiana side, and by avulsion formed a new channel to the west, severing from the Louisiana shore a large portion of the accretion theretofore formed.\n That, as the last change was by avulsion, the boundary line remained and now is at the thread of the extreme easterly and northeasterly channel of the river as it was in 1912-1913.\n The Mississippi River Commission surveyed the river in 1882, and admittedly its chart made from that survey correctly shows the shore lines and bar lines and other relevant data as of that year. A further survey was made by the Commission, and a plotting taken therefrom in 1894, and a similar survey and plotting shows the river as it was in 1912-1913. These demonstrate that the river had moved to the eastward from its position in 1823, each survey placing it considerably east of its location at the time of the next earlier one.\n The respondent avers:\n That the complainant has failed to show how the change in the channel came about between the surveys of 1823-1824 and that of 1882\n\n\n That as complainant has the burden of showing that the change took place by accretion rather than by avulsion, and has failed to carry that burden, it can make no claim for the land added to the Louisiana shore prior to 1882.\n That subsequent to 1882 the river above the point in controversy cut into the Louisiana bank above and along the northern border of Willow Point, was deflected in a northeasterly direction, so that instead of striking Tullos Island it curved around the head of what then remained of the island (as it is shown on the survey of 1882) and enlarged the chute between that island and the Mississippi shore, forming a new channel there. \n\n[282 U.S. 458, 461]\n\u00a0\n That subsequently the old channel, which had run to the west of the island, filled up, and thereby the island became attached to the Louisiana shore.\n That the new channel running to the north and east of what was left of Tullos Island added by accretion to the easterly side of the island and cut farther into the Mississippi shore until 1912-13, when the river suddenly abandoned the new channel and returned to the old 1882 channel.\n That thereby what theretofore had been Tullos Island again became an island separated from the Louisiana shore, although greatly enlarged over its dimensions in 1882 by the accretions added to its easterly side.\n As an additional and alternative defense Mississippi asserts that its title to the disputed territory cannot now be assailed because of long- continued possession and exercise of soverignty and dominion, with the acquiescence of Louisiana.\n On the issues thus made testimony was taken before a commissioner, and was referred to Thomas G. Haight, a member of the bar of this court, as special master, with direction and authority to report his findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations for a decree. He has filed his report, recommending a decree in accordance with the contentions of the complainant. The respondent has filed exceptions.\n The parties are in agreement as to the applicable legal principles. The exceptions raise no questions of law, but go solely to the correctness of the master's fact findings and conclusions. We have therefore examined the proofs, consisting of documentary evidence and oral testimony, to determine whether the master's findings are in accord therewith. In brief he finds:\n\n\n (1)\n That the changes between 1823 and 1912-13 were by gradual erosion of the Mississippi shore and gradual accretions to the Louisiana shore, and not be avulsions. \n\n[282 U.S. 458, 462]\n\u00a0\n (2) That the change in 1912-13 was due to an avulsion.\n\n\n (3)\n That the accretions up to the avulsion of 1912-13 and thereafter, so long as the current flowed in the easterly channel as it was prior to the avulsion, became Louisiana territory.\n\n\n (4)\n That the avulsion of 1912-13 did not change the boundary line.\n\n\n (5)\n That Mississippi did not by possession or exercise f  overeignty or dominion acquire right or title to the disputed territory; and, as a consequence of the foregoing,\n\n\n (6)\n That the present true boundary line is the middle of the navigable channel prior to the avulsion of 1912-13, as that channel was when the current ceased to flow therein by reason of the formation of the new channel by the avulsion of 1912-13, and the filling of the former channel.\n There is no challenge of findings 2 and 4. The whole controversy revolves about the correctness of findings 1 and 3 as to the physical changes which actually took place and finding 5 as to the exercise of dominion by the respondent.\n I. With respect to the physical changes which have taken place in the location of the Mississippi River, the proofs may conveniently be divided into two parts-those which apply to the period prior to 1882 and those which have to do with that between 1882 and 1912.\n It was impossible to procure much or very persuasive oral evidence as to conditions prior to 1882. The master had before him, however, the charts of the Mississippi River Commission of 1823-24 and of 1882, and plats from surveys made in 1866 and 1870. By comparing these and noting facts deducible from them, he concluded that the river moved eastward from its 1823 channnel to its 1882 channel gradually and not by avulsion. He found that the Louisiana shore was eroded above Albemarle \n\n[282 U.S. 458, 463]\n\u00a0\n Bend and extended to the eastward by accretions at Willow Point. He further found that, while this was occurring, the eastward sweep of the river gradually cut away the greater portion of Tullos Island. During all of this time the river remained of approximately the same width, thus negativing Mississippi's contention as to the possibility of the change in the channel being sudden and by avulsions of nature. His conclusions were also supported by the relative locations of sand bars and river banks at the dates of the successive surveys. In 1882 a towhead, so-called, had been formed on the sandbar created by the accretions to the Louisiana shore, which was named 'Newman's Towhead' because the owner of the Louisiana mainland at the point from which the bar had made out was a man named Newman. On This towhead there had sprung up a growth of willow and cottonwood timber.\n From an examination of the proofs and a checking of the processes of reasoning and deduction adopted by the master, we are satisfied that his findings on this branch of the case are justified; and that the contention of Mississippi that he has relied upon mere inferences, which do not rise to the dignity of affirmative proofs, is not well founded.\n A more serious controversy, complicated by conflicting oral testimony, is disclosed as to what occurred between 1882 and 1912. The complainant adduced proofs tending to show that the eastward and northeastward movement of the channel continued after 1882. These further tend to show that by 1894 all that was left of Tullos Island in 1882 had been washed away, and that the main channel of the river was in part where that island had formerly been and in part east of its location; that the eastward movement of the river and the direction of the current to the east eroded a substantial portion of the \n\n[282 U.S. 458, 464]\n\u00a0\n former Mississippi mainland; that from 1894 to 1912 this movement eastward continued until whole sections of township 9 north, range 8 west, in Mississippi, had caved away; that in periods of high water in 1912 and 1913 the river overflowed the bar extending out from the Louisiana shore to Newman's Towhead and took a southwesterly course, cutting across the accretions theretofore formed and leaving the eastern portions of the bar, including the towhead, an island; that a portion of this new island occupied the lication of what was formerly Tullos Island. Thus complainant claimed that, prior to 1912, the old island had been washed away by the eastward progress of the river channel, and had been replaced by accretions along the westerly side of the river adjacent to Louisiana.\n Respondent offered evidence tndi ng to show that, while the river reached the extereme easterly position averred by the complainant, it did so not by washing away Tullos Island and moving eastwardly over the former location of that island, but by swinging around to the north and east of that island, enlarging and scouring out the former chute or narrow channel between the island and the Mississippi mainland; that thereafter the river added by accretions to the eastern side of what was left of the island, and that the old channel to the west of it gradually filled up.\n If the weight of the evidence is with the complainant, the territory in controversy belongs to Louisiana; if the contrary be found, the disputed territory, originally within the boundaries of Mississippi, so remains.\n There is much conflicting testimony as to the location of the main channel between 1890 and 1912; as to whether Tullos Island was scoured away; as to the character of the soil and timber on the island; as to whether the alleged clay soil of the island disappeared and was afterwards replaced by a sandbar formed by accretion; as to \n\n[282 U.S. 458, 465]\n\u00a0\n whether the original virgin timber which was on it fell into the river and disappeared with it, or in part still stands as mute evidence that the island was never entirely washed away.\n Mindful of the fact that the special master did not see and hear the witnesses, we have felt it incumbent upon us to study the proofs, documentary and oral, to examine the deductions made therefrom, and thereby to test the stated conclusions. The preponderance of the evidence supports the master's finding that from 1882 to 1894 the river moved eastwardly, caving away Tullos Island along its western shore, until it had wiped out that island; that the continued eastward movement caved the Mississippi shore, at the same time adding to the accretions which had already formed on the Louisiana shore opposite Willow Point; and that the bar was continuous from the old high bank on the Louisiana side to the end of Newman's Towhead. Thus by 1912 an area five or six miles in length and several miles in width had been added to the Louisiana shore.\n As matters stood in 1912 and 1913, the boundary line between the states was the thread of the navigable channel far to the eastward of the present channel. As above stated, there is no controversy as to what occurred in 1912-13. The river by a sudden avulsion made a short-cut to the west of Albemarle Bend, as it then was; and subsequently the channel in the old bend to the eastward of the new channel silted and filled until it entirely closed at the upper end. This sudden avulsion did not change the boundary line between the states.\n II. It remains to discuss the proofs bearing upon the master's fifth finding. The survey of 1882 discloses that accretions attached to the Louisiana shore had at that time extended to the eastward so far as to cover a portion of the territory formerly belonging to Mississippi. The \n\n[282 U.S. 458, 466]\n\u00a0\n 1894 survey shows these accretions covering a much larger portion, and that of 1912-13 shows a still greater extension over former Mississippi territory. The Newmans, who lived on Willow Point, La., had a house about one hundred yards east of the 1824 mainland, between the levee and the stream, and just above Albemarle Bend proper. It must, therefore, have been built on accretions formed subsequent to 1824. It caved into the river in 1905. The master found that the possession of the Newmans extended at least to those accretions which had attached to the shore up to the time that their house was destroyed. The disputed territory is low alluvial land subject to overflow at times of high water, and is not protected by levees or dikes. Upon portions of it cottonwood and willow timber has grown. The land is not fitted for cultivation or settlement except in a haphazard way. It took its name from the Newman family, and was known as the 'Newman Towhead.' After the avulsion of 1912-13 severed a large portion of it from the Louisiana shore, the successors in title of the Newmans leased the cut-off portion of it, lying to the eastward of the new channel, to one Towns. The lease described it as part of the Bell and Willow Point plantations, located in East Carroll parish, La. It was occupied under the lease for six or eight years for the pasturing of hogs.\n The first knowledge that complainant's witnesses had of any claim on behalf of Mississippi or its citizens was shortly before this action was brought. It appears that in or about 1923 Mississippi sold some of the land in question for delinquent taxes. On the assessment rolls of Issaquena county, Miss., the purchasers at these tax sales first appeared as owners in 1925-1926. The respond- \n\n[282 U.S. 458, 467]\n\u00a0\n ent put in evidence assessment rolls for certain years between 1848 and 1926. They show that after 1883 certain of the lands within the original boundary of Tullos Island are marked 'in river,' or 'in Mississippi River,' and from time to time these lands so designated were assessed for taxation, sometimes for nominal amounts and sometimes for substantial sums. At times 'Island No. 98' appears as a separate item on the rolls, although the surveys show that at those times the island had disappeared. It is described as of greatly varying sizes in different years. The evidence to be drawn from this source is quite contradictory, and fails to show any dominion by Mississippi over the disputed territory.\n The record sustains the master's finding that there is no proof that Louisiana of its citizens knew of or acquiesced in any purported dominion of Mississippi over the disputed territory. The respondent has failed to meet the test laid down in Michigan v. Wisconsin, \n270 \nU.S. 295\n, 46 S. Ct. 290, with respect to exercise of sovereignty and dominion over the disputed territory, and acquiescence by complainant in such alleged possession. The master's fifth finding is sustained.\n A decree should be entered as recommended by the master, appointing a commission to locate the thread of the main channel of the Mississippi river as the same was immediately prior to the avulsion of 1912-13; and the line when so located is decreed to be the boundary between the states, between latitude 32 39 on the north and the division line between Issaquena and Warren counties, Miss. (as extended westward), on the south. The parties are accorded forty days within which to submit a decree in accordance with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","144":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF LOUISIANA v.

It prays an injunction re- \n\n[283 U.S. 473, 477]\n\u00a0\n straining the city from dumping garbage into the ocean or waters of the United States off the coast of New Jersey and from otherwise polluting its waters and beaches.\n Defendant by its amended answer denies the allegations that constitute the gravamen of the complaint.\n For a first defense it states that for many years it has dumped garbage into the Atlantic Ocean under the supervision of the supervisor of the harbor of New York and in accordance with permits issued by him under the Act of June 29, 1888 (33 U. S. C.,  441, 443, 449 and 451 (33 USCA  441, 443, 449, 451)) at points about 8, 12, and 20 miles southeast from the Scotland Lightship and about 10, 12 1\/2, and 22 miles respectively from the New Jersey shore and not in the waters of New Jersey or of the United States, and that in view of these facts the Court has no authority to enjoin it from so dumping garbage.\n And for a second defense it alleges that for many years garbage in large quantities has been and is being dumped by others inside and outside the entrance of the harbor and at various places from 2 1\/2 to 8 miles from the New Jersey shore and at other places from 3 to 25 miles southeast of Scotland Light, that this material would float upon the New Jersey beaches alleged to have been polluted, that it is impossible to determine whether garbage dumped by defendant is carried to such beaches, and that, if any injury or damage is suffered by New Jersey, its municipalities or citizens, the injury is not chargeable to defendant.\n And for a third defense it alleges that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to entitle plaintiff to any relief.\n The Court appointed Edward K. Campbell as special master and authorized him to take and report the evidence together with his findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendations for a decree. The master filed his report and the evidence introduced by the parties. It sets forth his findings, conclusions, and recommendations. \n\n[283 U.S. 473, 478]\n\u00a0\n The substance of the findings of facts follows:\n New Jersey borders on the Atlantic for about 100 miles. The shore principally involved extends from Atlantic Highlands southerly 50 miles to Beach Haven. On this stretch of shore, there are 29 municipalities. The state has conveyed or leased portions of the frontage to municipalities and individuals. It still owns 285,000 lineal feet between Sea Bright and Beach Haven. Municipalities have about 13,000 lineal feet and private parties the rest. The assessed value of property within these municipalities exceeds $139,000,000, and their population is more than 160, 000. They are summer resorts and the number of summer visitors is many times greater than their population. The beaches are gently sloping and wide and have been improved at great expense. The ocean and bathing, fishing and boating are the principal attractions. Inhabitants of the municipalities chiefly depend for their livelihood upon the business of maintaining these summer resorts. Approximately 500 persons are engaged in the operation of fish pounds constructed under authority of the state within three nautical miles from the coastline. This is a commercial activity that results in the taking of large quantities of fish annually.\n Vast amounts of garbage are cast on the beaches by the waters of the ocean and extend in piles and windrows along them. These deposits are unsightly and noxious, constitute a menace to public health and tend to reduce property values. Prompt removal is necessary, and men are regularly employed to haul them away. At times there are 50 truckloads deposited on a single beach. When garbage is carried upon the shore the adjacent waters hold large quantities in suspension. Floating garbage makes bathing impracticable, frequently tears and damages fish pound nets and injuriously affects the business of fishing. Usually the sea along the shore clears within a few days \n\n[283 U.S. 473, 479]\n\u00a0\n and sometimes within a single day. The deposits generally occur when the winds are from the east or northeast but sometimes southeast winds bring them in. The heavier deposits occur four or five times in a season and frequently throughout the year varying in number on different beaches.\n For about 20 years prior to 1918 defendant disposed of its garbage by a reduction system and, except for a brief period in 1906, did not dump any at sea. A plant was destroyed by fire in 1917 and a contractor failed. It then applied to the supervisor of the harbor for permission to dispose of its garbage at sea and, because of the conditions then existing, he gave such permission and designated a dumping place. But later, because of complaint from New Jersey beaches, he designated the areas specified in defendant's answer. The defendant has installed and uses some incinerating plants but, by reason of increasing population and volume of garbage, the quantities still being dumped at sea are very large.\n Weather permitting, the city dumps garbage daily. Less is dumped in the winter than in the summer. In February, 1929, the quantity was 52,000 cubic yards while in June of the same year it was 192,000. When dumped the mass forms piles about a foot above the water, spreads over the surface and breaks into large areas. Some materials remain on the surface and others are held in suspension. These masses float for indefinite periods and have been found to move at the rate of more than a mile per hour. Areas of garbage have been seen between the dumping places and the New Jersey beaches, and some have been followed from the place where dumped to the shore. In his report to the chief of engineers for 1918 and in each of his subsequent annual reports the supervisor of the harbor of New York stated that garbage deposited in the sea, no matter what the distance from the shore, is liable to wash up on the beaches. \n\n[283 U.S. 473, 480]\n\u00a0\n The master concluded that large parts of these floating and submerged areas of garbage dumped by the defendant, are driven and carried by winds and water to and upon the shores of the plaintiff, and constitute the objectionable materials thereon and in the adjacent water.\n In 1907 a committee appointed bythe mayor reported to him: 'All of the refuse collections could be dumped into the Atlantic ocean, but unfortunately the least harmful material sinks and the foulest floats, so that much of the floatable mass will be scattered along beaches through the action of current and wind. This fouling of beaches creates a nuisance that the public should not be asked to tolerate.' In June, 1921, a committee composed of heads of departments and officials of the city reported to the mayor: 'Aside, however, from the question of cost it seems undesirable to dump garbage at sea as it is being done at present. It is known that the Federal authorities quietly resent, if they do not openly object to it, and there is always the possibility of objections from other communities which have in the past claimed that they have been injured by the practice. When these objections become sufficiently strong it may be that New York will find itself so unprepared as to be unable to quickly introduce a more satisfactory form of disposal.' The defendant, through its mayor and other representatives, has for years been informed that the dumping of its garbage is undesirable, and that other municipalities by the sea have suffered injury as the result of such dumping. Governors and the legislature of New Jersey have repeatedly complained to defendant. In 1929 the city had 20 incinerators and considerable garbage is being destroyed by them. In December of that year the department of sanitation presented to the mayor a program for increasing the number. The cause of the delay in providing an adequate disposal system was not shown. \n\n[283 U.S. 473, 481]\n\u00a0\n The master concluded that the method of disposing of garbage by dumping at sea was not an approved or a good system and disposition of such material by incineration or the 'reduction system' was a proper way to dispose of the same. He found that the delay of defendant in adopting a proper method of disposal had been unreasonably long.\n The master found that whatever garbage reaches the plaintiff's shores from vessels and other dumpings than those of the defendant was negligible in comparison with that constantly being dumped by the defendant.\n As his conclusions of law, the master reports that the defendant has created and continues to create a public nuisance on the property of New Jersey and that the latter is entitled to relief in accordance with the prayer of its complaint, but that defendant should be given reasonable time within which to put into operation sufficient incinerators. He recommends that decree be entered accordingly.\n The plaintiff filed no exceptions to the master's report. The defendant excepted to substantially all material findings and conclusions. The Court has heard the arguments of counsel for the respective parties and considered their briefs for and against the exceptions and upon final submission of the case. The evidence abundantly sustains the findings of fact.\n The defendant maintains that the master erred in concluding that it has unnecessarily delayed providing incinerators. The record shows that garbage gathered in the boroughs of Queens and Richmond has not been dumped at sea. The quantities shown to have been so dumped were taken from the boroughs of Manhattan, Bronx, and Brooklyn. The amounts collected, the amounts dumped and the percentage that the latter is of the former for the years 1924 to 1929 inclusive were shown in the evidence \n\n[283 U.S. 473, 482]\n\u00a0\n and are indicated in the margin.* While such percentages have substantially decreased, the diminution of quantities actually dumped has been relatively slight.\n Further discussion of the evidence would serve no useful purpose. It is enouh to say that defendant has suggested no adequate reason for disturbing the findings. They are approved and adopted by the Court.\n Defendant contends that, as it dumps the garbage into the ocean and not within the waters of the United States or of New Jersey, this Court is without jurisdiction to grant the injunction. But the defendant is before the Court and the property of plaintiff and its citizens that is alleged to have been injured by such dumping is within the Court's territorial jurisdiction. The situs of the acts creating the nuisance, whether within or without the United States, is of no importance. Plaintiff seeks a decree in personam to prevent them in the future. The Court has jurisdiction. Cf. Massie v. Watts, 6 Cranch, 148, 158 et seq.; Hart v. Sansom, \n110 \nU.S. 151, 154\n, 3 S. Ct. 586; Cole v. Cunningham, \n133 \nU.S. 107, 116\n, 10 S. Ct. 269; Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, \n223 \nU.S. 605, 622\n, 623 S., 32 S. Ct. 340.\n There is no merit in defendant's contention, suggested in its amended answer, that compliance with the supervisor's permits in respect of places designated for dumping of its garbage leaves the Court without jurisdiction to grant the injunction prayed and relieves defendant in respect of the nuisance resulting from the dumping. There is nothing in the Act that purports to give to one \n\n[283 U.S. 473, 483]\n\u00a0\n dumping at places permitted by the supervisor immunity from liability for damage or injury thereby caused to others or to deprive one suffering injury by reason of such dumping of relief that he otherwise would be entitled to have. There is no reason why it should be given that effect.\n The master's conclusions of law and recommendations for a decree are approved.\n A decree will be entered declaring that the plaintiff, the state of New Jersey, is entitled to an injunction as prayed in the complaint, but that before injunction shall issue a reasonable time will be accorded to the defendant, the city of New York, within which to carry into effect its proposed plan for the erection and operation of incinerators to destroy the materials such as are now being dumped by it at sea or to provide other means to be approved by the decree for the disposal of such materials. And, inasmuch as the evidence does not disclose what is such reasonable time the case is referred to the same special master for findings of fact upon that subject. He is authorized and directed to hear witnesses presented by each of the parties, and, should he deem it necessary so to do, to call witnesses of his own selection and then with all convenient speed to report to the Court his findings and a form of decree.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n Amount collected (from 3 boroughs Amount Approximate \n[\nFootnote *\n] Year only) cu yds.

The denial of the injunction as above is subject to the following conditions.\n\n\n (a)\n Before any diversion shall be made an efficient plant for the treatment of sewage at Port Jervis, N. Y., shall be constructed and the sewage of Port Jervis entering the Delaware or Neversink rivers shall be treated to such an extent as to effect a reduction of 85 per cent. in the organic impurities. And the effluent from such plant shall be treated with a chemical germicide, or otherwise, so that the B. coli originally present in the sewage shall be reduced by 90 per cent.\n Untreated industrial waste from plants in said town of Port Jervis shall not be allowed to enter the Delaware or Neversink rivers, and the treatment of such industrial wastes shall be such as to render the effluent practically free from suspended matter and nonputrescent; and said \n\n[283 U.S. 805, 806]\n\u00a0\n treatment of sewage and industrial waste shall be maintained so long as any diversion is made from the Delaware river or its tributaries.\n\n\n (b)\n At any time the stage of the Delaware river falls below .50 c. s. m. at Port Jervis, N.

Chandler, of Philadelphia, Pa., for intervener State of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n[283 U.S. 336, 341]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity by which the State of New Jersey seeks to enjoin the State of New York and the City of New York from diverting any waters from the Delaware River or its tributaries, and particularly from the Neversink River, Willowemoc River, Beaver Kill, East Branch of the Delaware River and Little Delaware River, or from any part of any one of them. The other rivers named are among the headwaters of the Delaware and flow into it where it forms a boundary between New York and Pennsylvania. The Delaware continues its course as such boundary to Tristate Rock, near Port Jervis in New York, at which point Pennsylvania and New York \n\n[283 U.S. 336, 342]\n\u00a0\n are met by New Jersey. From there the river marks the boundary between Pennsylvania and New Jersey until Pennsylvania stops at the Delaware state line, and from then on the river divides Delaware from New Jersey until it reaches the Atlantic between Cape Henlopen and Cape May.\n New York proposes to divert a large amount of water from the above- named tributaries of the Delaware and from the watershed of that river to the watershed of the Hudson River in order to increase the water supply of the City of New York. New Jersey insists on a strict application of the rules of the common law governing private riparian proprietors subject to the same sovereign power. Pennsylvania intervenes to protect its interests as against anything that might be done to prejudice its future needs.\n We are met at the outset by the question what rule is to be applied. It is established that a more liberal answer may be given than in a controversy between neighbors members of a single State. Connecticut v. Massachusetts, \n282 \nU.S. 660\n, 51 S. Ct. 286, February 24, 1931 (see, also, Id., \n283 \nU.S. 789\n, 51 S. Ct. 356, 75 L. Ed. -). Different considerations come in when we are dealing with independent sovereigns having to regard the welfare of the whole population and when the alternative to settlement is war. In a less degree, perhaps, the same is rule of the quasi-sovereignties bound together in the Union. A river is more than an amenity, it is a treasure. It offers a necessity of life that must be rationed among those who have power over it. New York has the physical power to cut off all the water within its jurisdiction. But clearly the exercise of such a power to the destruction of the interest of lower States could not be tolerated. And on the other hand equally little could New Jersey be permitted to require New York to give up its power altogether in order that the river might come down to it undiminished. Both States have real and substantial interests in the River that must be reconciled \n\n[283 U.S. 336, 343]\n\u00a0\n as best they may. The different traditions and practices in different parts of the country may lead to varying results but the effort always is to secure an equitable apportionment without quibbling over formulas. See Missouri v. Illinois, \n200 \nU.S. 496, 520\n, 26 S. Ct. 268; Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46, 98\n, 117 S., 27 S. Ct. 655; Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., \n206 \nU.S. 230, 237\n, 27 S. Ct. 618, 11 Ann. Cas. 488; Wyoming v. Colorado, \n259 \nU.S. 419, 465\n, 470 S., 42 S. Ct. 552; Connecticut v. Massachusetts, February 24, 1931\n\n\n This case was referred to a Master and a great mass of evidence was taken. In a most competent and excellent report the Master adopted the principle of equitable division which clearly results from the decisions of the last quarter of a century. Where that principle is established there is not much left to discuss. The removal of water to a different watershed obviously must be allowed at times unless States are to be deprived of the most beneficial use on formal grounds. In fact it has been alowe d repeatedly and has been practiced by the States concerned. Missouri v. Illinois, \n200 \nU.S. 496, 526\n, 26 S. Ct. 268; Wyoming v. Colorado, \n259 \nU.S. 419, 466\n, 42 S. Ct. 552; Connecticut v. Massachusetts, February 24, 1931.\n New Jersey alleges that the proposed diversion will transgress its rights in many respects. That it will interfere with the navigability of the Delaware without the authority of Congress or the Secretary of War. That it will deprive the State and its citizens who are riparian owners of the undiminished flow of the stream to which they are entitled by the common law as adopted by both States. That it will injuriously affect water power and the ability to develop it. That it will injuriously affect the sanitary conditions of the River. That it will do the same to the industrial use of it. That it will increase the salinity of the lower part of the River and of Delaware Bay to the injury of the oyster industry there. That it will injure the shad fisheries. That it will do the \n\n[283 U.S. 336, 344]\n\u00a0\n same to the municipal water supply of the New Jersey towns and cities on the River. That by lowering the level of the water it will injure the cultivation of adjoining lands; and finally, that it will injuriously affect the River for recreational purposes. The bill also complains of the change of watershed, already disposed of; denies the necessity of the diversion; charges extravagant use of present supplies, and alleges that the plan will violate the Federal Water Power Act, 16 USCA  791-823 (but see U. S. Code, tit. 16,  821 (16 USCA  821)), interfere with interstate commence, prefer the ports of New York to those of New Jersey and will take the property of New Jersey and its citizens without due process of law.\n The Master finds that the above-named tributaries of the Delaware are not navigable waters of the United States at and above the places where the City of New York proposes to erect dams. Assuming that relief by injunction still might be proper if a substantial diminution within the limits of navigability was threatened, United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., \n174 \nU.S. 690, 709\n, 19 S. Ct. 770, he called as a witness General George B. Pillsbury, Assistant Chief of Engineers of the United States Army, who was well acquainted with the River and the plan, and who although not speaking officially for the War Department, satisfied the Master's mind that the navigable capacity of the River would not be impaired. Of course in that particular as in some others New York takes the risk of the future. If the War Department should in future change its present disinclination to interfere, New York would have to yield to its decision, and the possible experiences of the future may make modifications of the plan as it now stands necessary in unforeseen particulars. This will be provided for in the decree. Subject to these considerations and to what remains to be said the New York plan as qualified here is reasonably necessary. Some plan must be formed and soon acted upon, \n\n[283 U.S. 336, 345]\n\u00a0\n and taking into account the superior quality of the water and the other advantages of the proposed site over others, it at least is not arbitary or beyond the freedom of choice that must be left to New York.\n With regard to water power the Master concludes that any future plan of New Jersey for constructing dams would need the consent of Congress and of the States of New York and Pennsylvania and though possible as a matter of engineering probably would not pay. He adds that there is no such showing of a present interest as to entitle New Jersey to relief. New York v. Illinois, \n274 \nU.S. 488, 490\n, 47 S. Ct. 661; New Jersey v. Sargent, \n269 \nU.S. 328\n, 46 S. Ct. 122. We have spoken at the outset of the more general qualifications of New Jersey's rights as against another State. The Master finds that the taking of 600 millions of gallons daily from the tributaries will not materially affect the River or its sanitary condition, or as a source of mnici pal water supply, or for industrial uses, or for agriculture, or for the fisheries for shad. The effect or the use for recreation and upon its reputation in that regard will be somewhat more serious as will be the effect of increased salinity of the River upon the oyster fisheries. The total is found to be greater than New Jersey ought to bear, but the damage can be removed by reducing the draft of New York to 440 million gallons daily; constructing an efficient plant for the treatment of sewage entering the Delaware or Neversink (the main source of present pollution) thereby reducing the organic impurities 85%, and treating the effluent with a germicide so as to reduce the Bacillus Coli originally present in the sewage by 90%; and finally, subject to the qualifications in the decree, when the stage of the Delaware falls below 50 c. s. m. at Port Jervis, New York, or Trenton, Mew Jersey, by releasing water from the impounding reservoirs of New York, sufficient to restore the flow at those points to .50 c. s. m. We are of opinion that the Master's report should \n\n[283 U.S. 336, 346]\n\u00a0\n be confirmed and that a decree should be entered to the following effect, subject to such modifications as may be ordered by the Court hereafter.\n\n 1. \nThe injunction prayed for by new Jersey so far as it would restrain the State of New York or City of New York from diverting from the Delaware River or its tributaries to the New York City water supply the equivalent of 440 million gallons of water daily is denied, but is granted to restrain the said State and City from diverting water in excess of that amount. The denial of the injunction as above is subject to the following conditions.\n\n\n (a)\n Before any diversion shall be made an efficient plant for the treatment of sewage at Port Jervis, New York, shall be constructed and the sewage of Port Jervis entering the Delaware or Neversink Rivers shall be treated to such an extent as to effect a reduction of 85% in the organic impurities. And the effluent from such plant shall be treated with a chemical germicide, or otherwise, so that the B. coli originally present in the sewage shall be reduced by 90%.\n Untreated industrial wasts from plants in said town of Port Jervis shall not be allowed to enter the Delaware or Neversink Rivers, and the treatment of such industrial wastes shall be such as to render the effluent practically free from suspended matter and non-putrescent; and said treatment of sewage and industrial waste shall be maintained so long as any diversion is made from the Delaware River or its tributaries.\n\n\n (b)\n At any time the stage of the Delaware River falls below .50 c. s. m. at Port Jervis, New York, or Trenton, New Jersey, or both (.50 c. s. m. being equivalent to a flow of 1535 c. f. s. at Port Jervis and 3400 c. f. s. at Trenton), water shall be released from one or more of the impounding reservoirs of New York City in sufficient volume to restore the flow at Port Jervis and Trenton to .50 \n\n[283 U.S. 336, 347]\n\u00a0\n c. s. m., provided, however, that there is not required to be released at any time water in excess of 30% of the diversion area yield, and the diversion area yield having been ascertained to be 2.2 c. s. m., the maximum release required shall be 30% of that amount, or .66 cubic feet per second per square mile of the areas from which water is diverted.\n In determining the quantity of water to be released so as to add to the flow of the Delaware River, the Neversink River shall be treated as if it flowed into the Delaware River above Port Jervis, and the number of second feet of water released from the impounding reservoir on the Neversink River shall be added to the number of second feet of water released from other reservoirs, so as to determine whether the quantity of water, required by this decree to be released, has been released.\n\n\n (c)\n That the State of New Jersey and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, through accredited representatives, shall at all reasonable times have the right to inspect the dams, reservoirs and other works constructed by the City of New York nd t o inspect the diversion areas and the inflow, outflow and diverted flow of said areas, and to inspect the meters and other apparatus installed by the City of New York and to inspect all records pertaining to inflow, outflow and diverted flow.\n\n 2. \nThe diversion herein allowed shall not constitute a prior appropriation and shall not give the State of New York and City of New York and superiority of right over the State of New Jersey and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the enjoyment and use of the Delaware River and its tributaries.\n\n 3. \nThe prayer of the intervenor, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, for the present allocation to it of the equivalent of 750 million gallons of water daily from the Delaware River or its Pennsylvania tributaries is denied without prejudice. \n\n[283 U.S. 336, 348]\n\u00a0\n 4. The prayer of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the appointment of a river master is denied without prejudice.\n\n 5. \nThis decree is without prejudice to the United States and particularly is subject to the paramount authority of Congress in respect to navigation and navigable waters of the United States and subject to the powers of the Secretary of War and Chief of Engineers of the United States Army in respect to navigation and navigable waters of the United States.\n\n 6. \nAny of the parties hereto, complainant, defendants or intervenor, may apply at the foot of this decree for other or further action or relief and this Court retains jurisdiction of the suit for the purpose of any order or direction or modification of this decree, or any supplemental decree that it may deem at any time to be proper in relation to the subject matter in controversy.\n\n 7. \nThe costs of the cause shall be divided and shall be paid by the parties in the following proportions: State of New Jersey 35 per cent, City of New York 35 per cent, State of New York 15 per cent, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 15 per cent.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","148":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE TAX COMMISSION OF MISSISSIPPI v.

Lauderdale, of Jackson, Miss., on the brief), for appellants.[ State Tax Commission of Mississippi v. Interstate Natural Gas Co. \n284 U.S. 41\n (1931) ]\n\n\n[284 U.S. 41, 43]\n\u00a0\n Mr. David Clay Bramlette, of Woodville, Miss., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.\n This is an appeal from a decree of three judges sitting according to statute in the District Court, by which the tax commission of the state of Mississippi is permanently enjoined from enforcing a Privilege Tax Law of that state, being chapter 88 of the laws of 1930, against the Interstate Natural Gas Company, the plaintiff in this suit.\n The facts are agreed. The plaintiff has a trunk line of pipe extending from gas fields in Louisiana through Mississippi and back to Louisiana; 72.42 miles having a diameter of 22 inches, 8.11 miles having a diameter of 12 inches, and 4.99 miles a diameter of 10 inches. It sells daily to distributors in Louisiana about 70,000,000 cubic feet of natural gas in summer, and about 75,000,000 feet in winter. In Mississippi, it sells as will be explained from 204,000 to 520,000 feet according to the season. The gas flows continuously from the gas fields in Louisiana and obviously, for much the greater part at least, in interstate commerce. But the appellants rely upon business done under two similar contracts made in New York to show that there was intrastate commerce in Mississippi that may be taxed without burdening the main activity that the state cannot touch. Ozark Pipe Line Corporation v. Monier, \n266 \nU.S. 555, 563\n, 45 S. Ct. 184; East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Commission of Ohio, \n283 \nU.S. 465, 470\n, 51 S. Ct. 499. Distributing companies tap the plaintiff's pipes near Natchez and the town of Woodville. The gas withdrawn by the distributors is measured by a thermometer and a meter furnished by the plaintiff, which is the only way in which it can be measured. The pressure of the gas is reduced by the plaintiff \n\n[284 U.S. 41, 44]\n\u00a0\n before it passes into the purchaser's hands. The work done by the plaintiff is done upon the flowing gas to help the delivery, and seems to us plainly to be incident to the interstate commerce between Louisiana and Mississippi. The plaintiff simply transports the gas and delivers it wholesale, not otherwise worked over than to make it ready for delivery to the independent parties that dispose of it by retail. Missouri v. Kansas Gas Co., \n265 \nU.S. 298\n, 44 S. Ct. 544; Public Utilities Commission v. Landon, \n249 \nU.S. 236, 245\n, 39 S. Ct. 268; Ozark Pipe Line Corporation v. Monier, \n266 \nU.S. 555\n, 45 S.

Percy S. Stephenson, of Norfolk, Va., and Littleton M. Wickham, of Richmond, Va., for State-Planters' Bank & Trust Co., and others.\n Messrs. John W. Oast, Jr., and Leon T. Seawell, both of Norfolk, Va., for Parker and others.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The facts stated in the certificate follow:\n July 1, 1925, Edwards-Slaughter Company, Inc., executed a deed of trust to State-Planters' Bank & Trust Company to secure $60,000 in bonds, the payment of which was guaranteed by First National Company. It also executed and delivered to the bank its promissory note in the sum of $20, 000, secured by a preferred maritime mortgage on \n\n[283 U.S. 332, 333]\n\u00a0\n one of its vessels, to be held under the terms of the trust instrument as security for the bonds. In accordance with article 10 of the deed, which required that, so long as any of the bonds should be outstanding, the bankrupt should carry fire and marine insurance on its steamers, indorsed to the trustee, policies upon the vessel in the amount of $60,000, payable to the bankrupt and to the bank as trustee, were duly delivered to the latter Subsequently, when these policies were about to lapse for nonpayment of premiums, the bank paid the same and renewed the policies with funds furnished to it upon demand by the guarantor.\n The steamship was destroyed by fire on September 18, 1927, and the net sum of $58,256.67 was collected on the policies. A controversy arose as to whether the whole fund or only $20,000 thereof was applicable to the bonds secured by the deed of trust, the bank contending that it was entitled to apply the entire amount to this purpose, because of a provision of the deed to the effect that all proceeds of insurance should be treated in the same manner as those from a sale by foreclosure and should be applied in payment of bonds. For the purpose of determining this dispute, the bank filed its bill in the state court, against the bankrupt and others, in which it alleged that the holders of the bonds and coupons were entitled to the entire proceeds of the policies, but that, as certain claims had been asserted thereagainst by others than the bond and coupon holders, it desired to have the guidance and protection of the court, and therefore requested it to supervise the distribution of the fund. The bankrupt and the guarantor filed answers alleging that the whole of the insurance moneys should be applied to the payment of the bonds and coupons, and praying that same be so used.\n The suit was institute Feb ruary 8, 1928. and on May 24 was referred to a master in chancery, who filed his re- \n\n[283 U.S. 332, 334]\n\u00a0\n port on September 29. Prior thereto, on August 8, Edwards-Slaughter Company, Inc. had been adjudged a bankrupt. Upon the filing of the master's report, the District Judge issued a rule against the bank and its attorneys, Leake and Buford, to show cause why they should not be enjoined from further prosecuting the suit in the state court. This rule was made absolute, and an order was entered directing the bank to pay the fund in its hands into the bankruptcy court. From this order the bank and its attorneys appealed. Pursuant to the order, the fund was paid over to the trustees and is now held by them.\n First National Company, not having been made a party to the rule, filed its petition challenging the jurisdiction of the court to interfere with the state court proceedings, or summarily to require an adverse claimant of the fund in controversy to pay the same into court, and praying that the injunction and order be set aside and the money returned to the bank. Upon objection by the trustees in bankruptcy, the court declined to permit the guarantor to intervene or file its petition, and it also has appealed.\n Three questions are certified. The first is:\n\n\n (1)\n Where a trustee under a mortgage, having in its possession a fund which it claims to be subject to the mortgage, institutes a suit in a state court of chancery asking the court to declare the rights of the parties in the fund and supervise the distribution thereof, and makes parties thereto and obtains service upon all persons claiming an interest in the fund, who file answers praying action on the part of the court, does the state court acquire such jurisdiction of the res as gives it exclusive jurisdiction to determine the rights of the parties in the fund and order the distribution thereof?\n This need not be answered. It is unnecessarily general, and has no reference to any conflict between the jurisdiction of a court of bankruptcy and a state court. See White v. Johnson, \n282 \nU.S. 367, 371\n, 51 S. Ct. 115, and cases cited. \n\n[283 U.S. 332, 335]\n\u00a0\n The second and third questions may be considered together. They are:\n\n\n (2)\n Where a state court has acquired jurisdiction of the res in a suit instituted by a trustee to have the rights of claimants declared in a trust fund and to have such fund distributed under direction of the court, does the bankruptcy of one of the claimants of the fund occurring more than four months after the institution of the suit in the state court oust the state court of jurisdiction and vest exclusive jurisdiction in the bankruptcy court to determine the rights of the parties in the fund?\n\n\n (3)\n Where a fund claimed by a trustee in bankruptcy is held by a trustee under a mortgage executed by the bankrupt under a bona fide and substantial claim that it should be applied on bonds secured by the mortgage, has the court of bankruptcy the power to order its transfer to the trustee in bankruptcy in a summary proceeding?\n These constitute but one question. The facts stated do not involve the right of a trustee in bankruptcy to institute a plenary suit against an adverse claimant, or to be substituted for the bankrupt in a pending proceeding. The only question is as to the power to proceed summarily in disregard of an existing action in a state court having jurisdiction.\n We do not answer these questions, because the certificate does not contain a sufficient statement of the facts upon which the propositions of law arise (Cincinnati H. & D. R. Co. v. McKeen, \n149 \nU.S. 259\n, 13 S. Ct. 840; United States v. City Bank, 19 How. 385; Cross v. Evans, \n167 \nU.S. 60\n, 17 S. Ct. 733), and suggests the existence of facts which might require a different answer from that which would be given were they absent. See White v. Johnson, supra.\n Without expressing an opinion upon their legal effect, we not the following matters:\n The other claims which were made against the fund in the hands of th mor tgage trustee are not defined; if they \n\n[283 U.S. 332, 336]\n\u00a0\n were claims of liens, the nature, the dates of creation, and the possible priorities of such liens are not stated. How the bankruptcy of the debtor might affect them cannot be determined. It does not appear whether the owners of these claims were made parties to the proceeding from which the appeal was taken, or whether they had notice of it.\n We are told that the bankrupt answered in the state court action and prayed that the fund be applied in payment of bonds and coupons, but the date when this occurred is not given.\n It is not clear whether the only question before the state court was one of law, namely, the construction of a clause of the deed of trust, or whether there were other questions of law or fact involved. It is disclosed that the guarantor of the bonds, although a defendant in the state court, was not made a party in the bankruptcy proceeding, was refused a hearing therein, and is one of the appellants.\n Inasmuch as the summary jurisdiction of the District Court is challenged, any of these features of the case may have an important bearing upon a correct decision. To answer the questions as framed would, in view of what is omitted from them, though brought to our notice by the statement of facts, lead rather to misunderstanding and confusion than to the clarification of applicable rules of law.\n The certificate will be dismissed.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","150":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTORAASLI v. STATE OF MINN.(1931)\nNo. 393\nArgued: Decided: March 23, 1931\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles Bunn and Pierce Butler, Jr., both of St. Paul, Minn., for appellant. \n\n[283 U.S. 57, 58]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry N. Benson and James E. Markham, both of St. Paul, Minn., for the State of Minnesota.\n\n\n[283 U.S. 57, 59]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By chapter 57 of the General Laws of Minnesota of 1889 that state ceded to the United States jurisdiction of the territory constituting the Ft. Snelling Military Reservation, which lies entirely within the boundaries of Minnesota, immediately adjacent to the city limits of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Its greatest length from north to sough is three and three-quarters miles, and from east to west two miles. The cession was upon condition that the public highways across the reservation be kept open for public traffic. Concurrent jurisdiction to serve process, civil and criminal, of the state, and to arrest persons charged with offenses against the laws of the state, was retained. There was no other limitation.\n The reservation is occupied by the military forces of the United States, and, save as above noted, jurisdiction therein is exercised by the federal government to the exclusion of the state.\n The Constitution of Minnesota provides1 that a member of the military forces of the United States shall not be deemed a resident of the state as a consequence of being stationed within its borders. It also grants2 to the Legislature power to tax motor vehicles using the public streets and highways of the state on a more onerous basis than other personal property, such tax to be in lieu of all other taxes thereon, except wheelage taxes, so called, which may be imposed by any borough, city, or village. Any such law may, in the discretion of the Legislature, provide for the exemption from taxation of any motor vehicle owned by a nonresident transiently or temporarily using the streets and highways of the state. The proceeds of such tax is to be paid into the trunk highway sinking fund. \n\n[283 U.S. 57, 60]\n\u00a0\n By virtue of this constitutional authority, the Legislature enacted a law providing for the imposition of a motor vehicle registration tax. \n3\n Pursuant to the statute, the secreary of state filed in the office of the clerk of the district court of Ramsey county a list of motor vehicles on which the tax and penalty for 1929 appeared delinquent. The appellant's automobile was included in the list. Appellant filed answer to the notice, denying that any tax or penalty was due the state; alleging that he was the sole owner of the vehicle, was a nonresident of the state of Minnesota, a member of the military forces of the United States quartered and resident upon the Ft. Snelling Reservation, that the vehicle had not been operated for hire, nor been present within the jurisdiction of Minnesota upon its roads, highways, or streets, for any period of ten days, and was never operated thereon, except as a visitor for brief periods.\n After averring that the reservation is solely under the control of the United States, and that all governmental functions, including police power, traffic control, and maintenance of highways, are vested in and exercised by the commanding officer under the laws of the United States, to the total exclusion of control by the state, and that the reservation is no part of the state of Minnesota, the answer states that the commanding officer has created and maintains, pursuant to his powers, a complete system of automobile registration, with rules and regulations, and that the vehicle in question is duly registered under such laws and regulations and has license plates and a registration certificate issued by federal authority, which has at all times been carried. It asserts appellant's willingness and ability to comply with all the laws of Minnesota applicable to nonresidents who have occasion to use its roads and streets, and that he has so notified the state officials, \n\n[283 U.S. 57, 61]\n\u00a0\n and has complied with all the traffic laws and regulations of the state when operating upon its highways.\n On appellee's motion, judgment was entered on the pleadings for the tax and penalty. Upon appeal, the Supreme Court of Minnesota affirmed the judgment. 4 The appellant brought the case to this Court, having at all stages in the courts below asserted rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, which were passed on and determined adversely to his contentions. He claims that the tax in question is a property tax, and that the state may not tax property located on the Ft. Snelling Reservation. In the alternative he says, if the act levies a privilege tax, as applied to him, it deprives him of equal protection of the laws by imposing upon him a greater burden than that laid on residents of Minnesota, or residents of neighboring states.\n The argument that the tax is one on property is founded on the fact that it is measured by the cost of the motor car (less certain annual allowances for depreciation), and that it is in lieu of all other taxes thereon except wheelage taxes levied by municipalities. \n5\n It is to be remarked, however, that a minimum tax is prescribed for cars of certain weights, irrespective of value; that the act levies the tax on vehicles 'using the public streets or highways in the State'; and provides that they 'shall be privileged to use the public streets and highways, on the basis and at the rates for each calendar year as follows.' ...6\n The state court held that 'the license tax is both a property tax and a privilege tax. ... It is a property tax in the sense that it exempts the vehicle licensed from other taxation as property. It is in lieu of other taxes. But is is equally clear that it is a privilege tax. ... The character of a privilege tax extends to the whole tax.' \n\n[283 U.S. 57, 62]\n\u00a0\n This Court, while bound by the state court's decision as to the meaning and application of the law, decides for itself the character of the tax, and whether as applied to the appellant it affects his constitutional rights. We think it plain that the levy is an excise fr t he privilege of using the highways.\n It is denominated a privilege tax. The car cannot use the highways unless it is paid. The statute contains the usual provisions for registration, issuance, and display of number plates, etc. \n7\n Residents of other states who desire to use the highways for more than the period specified in certain sections extending the privilege must register their vehicles and pay the same tax as residents of Minnesota. \n8\n The claim that the state is attempting to tax appellant's property situate without its jurisdiction cannot be sustained.\n Viewed as imposing a privilege tax, the statute is alleged to discriminate against appellant in favor of residents, because it exempts vehicles licensed under it from payment of property taxes. But the exemption is a proper and lawful one, and appellant cannot make out a discrimination against him from the mere fact that he is not in a position to claim it. Doubtless in the case of every taxing act which creates exemptions there are those who cannot bring themselves within the exempt class, but this does not deprive them of the equal protection of the law.\n Finally, appellant says the act accords certain privileges to residents of neighboring states, which are denied to him, and hence the law operates unequally as against him. The section of the statute to which he refers provides that vehicles owned by nonresidents, properly registered in the country or state of the owner, and carrying license number plates of such state, are authorized to use Minnesota \n\n[283 U.S. 57, 63]\n\u00a0\n highways for ten days without registration or tax, and, upon making proper filing with the registrar of motor vehicles within the ten-day period, are authorized to use the highways of the state for a total period of ninety days without any payment whatever. \n9\n Appellant says that, as he is a nonresident of Minnesota, has registered his car in the Ft. Snelling Reservation, as required by the authorities thereof, carries license number plates issued by such authorities, and has offered to make proper filing in Minnesota, to refuse him the privilege accorded to other nonresidents deprives him of the equal protection of the law.\n But as was pointed out in Kane v. New Jersey,10 the absence of any such provision in favor of nonresidents would not render the law discriminatory. A resident of the state who desires to operate his car for a single day is liable for the entire year's tax. If the state determines to extend a privilege to nonresidents, it may with propriety limit the concession to those who have duly registered their vehicles in another state or country. The mere fact that appellant has not so registered his car and cannot, therefore, bring himself within the class benefited by the exemption, does not create a discrimination against him. The state was not bound to make a classification with respect to exemptions for him and those similarly situated. Nothing said in Hendrick v. Maryland11 establishes any such principle. Nor are the authorities which forbid a difference in the method of calculating the amount of the tax itself depending solely on the fact of residence within or without the state relevant to the issue in this case. \n12\n We \n\n[283 U.S. 57, 64]\n\u00a0\n find no improper classification or discrimination. The judgment is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Article 7,  4. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Article 16,  3. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Mason's Minn.

Proctor, of Boston, Mass., and Isadore Levin, of Detroit, Mich., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 555, 558]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward F. McClennen, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n\n[282 U.S. 555, 559]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action arising unde th e Sherman Anti-Trust Act to recover damages resulting from an alleged conspiracy between respondents and West Carrollton Parchment Company, not joined for lack of jurisdiction, to monopolize interstate trade and commerce in vegetable parchment, exclude the petitioner therefrom, and destroy its business in such trade and commerce. A jury returned a verdict for petitioner in the sum of $65,000, but in the alternative for the respondents 'if, as a matter of law, the plaintiff is not entitled to a verdict.' The trial court approved the verdict and rendered judgment for treble the amount of the damages in accordance with section 7 of the act (15 USCA  15). On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, \n\n[282 U.S. 555, 560]\n\u00a0\n the judgment was vacated and the case remanded to the trial court, with directions to enter judgment for respondents upon the ground that petitioner had not sustained the burden of proving that it had suffered recoverable damages. 37 F.(2d) 537.\n Respondents seek to sustain this judgment upon that ground, and also upon the additional ground, which the lower court found against them, that there was no evidence of a conspiracy or combination to monopolize interstate trade. Because there was no cross-petition for certiorari, petitioner insists that the additional ground is not open here for consideration. But respondents do not invoke that ground in order to overthrow the judgment below, but to sustain it; and this they may do. Langnes v. Green, \n282 \nU.S. 531\n, 51 S. Ct. 243, decided this day.\n The point, however, is readily disposed of. There is evidence in the record to the effect that the three companies named, prior to the time petitioner entered the field, had maintained uniform prices and enjoyed a substantial monopoly of the interstate trade in parchment paper. There is also evidence, sufficient to justify the action of the District Court in submitting the issue to the jury, that, after petitioner began business, the three companies combined and conspired to continue this monopoly in violation of section 2 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, chapter 647, 26 Stat. 209 (15 USCA  2). The verdict of the jury and the judgment thereon of the District Court have the effect of a finding in favor of petitioner upon that issue; and to that extent the verdict and judgment were sustained by the court below. There is enough evidence in the record to preclude an interference on our part with these concurrent findings. That the petitioner was injured in its business and property as a result of this unlawful combination we think also finds sufficient support in the evidence. Questions in respect of the liability of the wrongdoers to respond in damages alone remain to be considered. \n\n[282 U.S. 555, 561]\n\u00a0\n The trial court submitted to the jury for consideration only two items of damages: (1) The difference, if any, between the amounts actually realized by petitioner and what would have been realized by it from sales at reasonable prices except for the unlawful acts of the respondents; and ( 2) the extent to which the value of petitioner's property had been diminished as the result of such acts.\n The view of the Court of Appeals that no recovery could be had in respect of the first item apparently rests upon its conclusions that there was no basis for a reasonable inference that prices in excess of those actually realized would have prevailed if there had been no combination; and that, in any event, there was no damage which could be measure and expressed in figures not based on speculation and conjecture.\n There was evidence from which the jury reasonably could have found that, in pursuance of the conspiracy, respondents sold their goods below the point of fair profit, and finally below the cost of production; that petitioner had an efficient plant and sales organization, and was producing a quality of paper superior to that produced by either of the three companies; and that current prices, shown in detail, were higher during a period antedating the unlawful combination and price cutting in pursuance ofit than afterward. It does not necessarily follow, of course, that these higher prices would have continued except for the conspiracy, but it is fair to say that the natural and probable effect of the combination and price cutting would be to destroy normal prices; and there was evidence of the prices received by petitioner before the cut prices were put into operation, and those received after, showing actual and substantial reductions, and evidence from which the probable amount of the loss could be approximated. The trial court fairly instructed the jury in substance that, if they were satisfied that the old prices were \n\n[282 U.S. 555, 562]\n\u00a0\n reasonable, and that they would not have changed by reason of any economic condition, but would have been maintained except for the unlawful acts of the respondents, the jury might consider as an element of damages the difference between the prices actually received and what would have been received but for the unlawful conspiracy.\n Upon a consideration of the evidence, we are of opinion that it was open to the jury to find that the price cutting and the resulting lower prices were directly attributable to the unlawful combination; and that the assumption indulged by the court below, that respondents' acts would have been the same if they had been acting independently of one another, with the same resulting curtailment of prices, must be rejected as unsound.\n Nor can we accept the view of that court that the verdict of the jury, in so far as it included damages for the first item, cannot stand because it was based upon mere speculation and conjecture. This characterization of the basis for the verdict is unwarranted. It is true that there was uncertainty as to the extent of the damage, but there was none as to the fact of damage; and there is a clear distinction between the measure of proof necessary to establish the fact that petitioner had sustained some damage and the measure of proof necessary to enable the jury to fix the amount. The rule which precludes the recovery of uncertain damages applies to such as are not the certain result of the wrong, not to those damages which are definitely attributable to the wrong and only uncertain in respect of their amount. Taylor v. Bradley, 39 N. Y. 129, 4 Abb. Ct. App. Dec. 363, 366, 367, 100 Am. Dec. 415:\n'It is sometimes said that speculative damages cannot be recovered, because the amount is uncertain; but such remarks will generally be found applicable to such damages as it is uncertain whether sustained at all from the breach. Sometimes the claim is rejected as being too \n\n[282 U.S. 555, 563]\n\u00a0\n remote. This is another mode of saying that it is uncertain whether such damages resulted necessarily and immediately from the breach complained of.\n\n'The general rule is, that all damages resulting necessarily and immediately and directly from the breach are recoverable, and not those that are contingent and uncertain. The latter description embraces, as I think, such only as are not the certain result of the breach, and does not embrace such as are the certain result, but uncertain in amount.'\n\n Where the tort itself is of such a nature as to preclude the ascertainment of the amount of damages with certainty, it would be a perversion of fundamental principles of justice to deny all relief to the injured person, and thereby relieve the wrongdoer from making any amend for his acts. In such case, while the damages may not be determined by mere speculation or guess, it will be enough if the evidence show the extent of the damages as a matter of just and reasonable inference, although the result be only approximate. The wrongdoer is not entitled to complain that they cannot be measured with the exactness and precision that would be possible if the case, which he alone is responsible for making, were otherwise. Eastman Co. v. Southern Photo Co., \n273 \nU.S. 359, 379\n, 47 S. Ct. 400. Compare The Seven Brothers (D. C.) 170 F. 126, 128; Pacific, etc., Co. v. Packers' Ass'n, 138 Cal. 632, 638, 72 P. 161. As the Supreme Court of Michign h as forcefully declared, the risk of the uncertainty should be thrown upon the wrongdoer instead of upon the injured party. Allison v. Chandler, 11 Mich. 542, 550-556. That was a case sounding in tort, and at page 555 the court, speaking through Christiancy, J., said:\n'But shall the injured party in an action of tort, which may happen to furnish no element of certainty, be allowed to recover no damages ( or merely nominal), because he can not show the exact amount with cer- \n\n[282 U.S. 555, 564]\n\u00a0\n tainty, though he is ready to show, to the satisfaction of the jury, that he has suffered large damages by the injury? Certainty, it is true, would thus be attained; but it would be the certainty of injustice. ...\n\n'Juries are allowed to act upon probable and inferential as well as direct and positive proof. And when, from the nature of the case, the amount of the damages can not be estimated with certainty, or only a part of them can be so estimated, we can see no objection to placing before the jury all the facts and circumstances of the case, having any tendency to show damages, or their probable amount; so as to enable them to make the most intelligible and probable estimate which the nature of the case will permit.'\n\n And again in Gilbert v. Kennedy, 22 Mich. 117, 129 et seq., also a tort action, the court, through the same eminent judge, pointed out that cases will often occur in which it is evident that large damages have resulted, but where no reliable data or element of certainty can be found by which to measure with accuracy the amount. Rejecting the view that in such cases the jury should give only nominal, that is, in effect, no damages, leaving the injured party without redress, the court said (page 130 of 22 Mich.):\n'To deny the injured party the right to recover any actual damages in such cases, because they are of a nature which cannot be thus certainly measured, would be to enable parties to profit by, and speculate upon, their own wrongs, encourage violence and invite depredation. Such is not, and cannot be the law, though cases may be found where courts have laid down artificial and arbitrary rules which have produced such a result.'\n\n After pointing out that there could be no just principle requiring a higher degree of certainty in the evidence upon which the damages are to be estimated than in reference to other branches of the case, the court said that, \n\n[282 U.S. 555, 565]\n\u00a0\n where from the nature of the case damages could not be measured with certainty by a fixed rule, the facts and circumstances tending to show the probable amount of such damages should be submitted to the jury to enable them to form\n -'such reasonable and probable estimate, as in the exercise of good sense and sound judgment they shall think will produce adequate compensation. There is no sound reason in such a case, as there may be, to some extent, in actions upon contract, for throwing any part of the loss upon the injured party, which the jury believe from the evidence he has sustained; though the precise amount cannot be ascertained by a fixed rule, but must be matter of opinion and probable estimate. And the adoption of any arbitrary rule in such a case, which will relieve the wrongdoer from any part of the damages, and throw the loss upon the injured party, would be little less than legalized robbery.\n'Whatever of uncertainty there may be in this mode of estimating damages, is an uncertainty caused by the defendant's own wrongful act; and justice and sound public policy alike require that he should bear the risk of the uncertainty thus produced. ...'\n\n As was said by Judge Anderson in his dissenting opinion below, there are many cases in which damages are allowed where the element of uncertainty is at least equal to that in the present cass-as, for example, copyright and trade-mark cases, cases of unfair competition, and many cases of personal injury. See, also, Straus v. Victor Talking Mach. Co. (C. C. A.) 297 F. 791, 802, a case very much like the present one, except that the plaintiffs were buyers, and were compelled to pay highe pr ices for goods because of the unlawful acts of defendants, instead of being obliged, as here, to sell at lower prices. Numerous decisions are there cited in support of the statement that 'the constant tendency of the courts is to find some way \n\n[282 U.S. 555, 566]\n\u00a0\n in which damages can be awarded where a wrong has been done. Difficulty of ascertainment is no longer confused with right of recovery.'\n It is not easy to reconcile the decision in the present case with what was said by the same court in Linen Thread Co. v. Shaw, 9 F.(2d) 17, 19, namely, that 'the rule that damages, if uncertain, cannot be recovered, applies to their nature, and not to their extent. If the damage is certain, the fact that its extent is uncertain does not prevent a recovery.' recovery.'\n Disposing of the second item of damages, the court below, after referring to evidence tending to show that petitioner was not in a thriving financial condition, said that petitioner was without capital to meet the situation which it faced, even if there had been no conspiracy and there had been open competition; and that its failure was inevitable either from lack of capital or inefficient management or both. The court therefore concluded that petitioner had not sustained the burden of proving that the depreciation in value of its plant was due in any measurable degree to any violation of the Sherman Act by the respondents. But this conclusion rested upon inferences from facts within the exclusive province of the jury, and which could not be drawn by the court contrary to the verdict of the jury without usurping the functions of that fact finding body. Whether the unlawful acts of respondents or conditions apart from them constituted the proximate cause of the depreciation in value was a question, upon the evidence in this record, for the jury, 'to be determined as a fact, in view of the circumstances of fact attending it.' Milwaukee, etc., Railway Co. v. Kellogg, \n94 U.S. 469\n, 474. And the finding of the jury upon that question must be allowed to stand, unless all reasonable men, exercising an unprejudiced judgment, would draw an opposite conclusion from the facts. Missouri, K. & T. Ry. Co. v. Byrne ( C. C. A.) 100 F. 359, 363; Travelers' \n\n[282 U.S. 555, 567]\n\u00a0\n Ins. Co. v. Melick (C. C. A.) 65 F. 178, 181, 27 L. R. A. 629; Chicago G. W. Ry. Co. v. Price (C. C. A.) 97 F. 423, 429. It would be going far here to say that this qualifying exception has been met.\n There was evidence to the effect that petitioner's plant had cost $ 235,000, of which $90,000 had been used to purchase and install a parchmentizing machine. After petitioner had been compelled to close its business, as a result, we must now assume, of the unlawful acts of the respondents, this property for the purpose of that business was abandoned. That some depreciation in the value of the plant must have resulted is obvious. The treasurer of petitioner estimated the market value of the plant after it had been closed down at $75,000. If this estimate be accepted, the depreciation was far more than the entire amount of the verdict, which included both items of damages. It is true that the treasurer was an interested witness, and that he was not an expert; and the court in its charge expressly directed the attention of the jury to those facts. But it was for the jury to determine the weight of the evidence, the credit to be given the witness, and the extent to which his testimony should be acted upon. That there was actual damage due to depreciation in value was not a matter of speculation, but a fact which could not be gainsaid. The amount alone was in doubt; and, in the light of the foregoing discussion as to the first item of damages, the proof is sufficiently certain and definite to support the verdict of the jury in that respect.\n Other assignments of error made on the appeal from the District Court were not considered by the court below. No argument in support of these assignments has been submitted here, and respondents assume that they will be remitted for the consideration ofthe court below if the judgment of that court be reversed. The entire record, however, is before this court with power to review the action of the Court of Appeals and direct such disposition of the case as that court might have made of it upon the \n\n[282 U.S. 555, 568]\n\u00a0\n appeal from the District Court. Lutcher & Moore Lumber Co. v. Knight, \n217 \nU.S. 257, 267\n, 30 S. Ct. 505; Delk v. St. Louis & San Francisco R. R., \n220 \nU.S. 580, 588\n, 31 S. Ct. 617. And see Langnes v. Green, supra. Accordingly, we have examined these assignments, some eight in number. One or more of them involve questions which have been disposed of by the foregoing opinion. We find nothing in any of the others of sufficient substance or materiality to call for consideration.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and that of the District Court affirmed. \n\n\n\n","152":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTRATON v. NEW(1931)\nNo. 137\nArgued: March 3, 1931Decided: April 20, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 318, 319]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Randolph Bias, of Williamson, W. Va., for Straton and others.\n Mr. Arthur F. Kingdon, of Bluefield, W. Va., for New, Trustee, etc.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The District Court for Southern West Virginia entered an order in the bankruptcy of the Fall Branch Coal Company enjoining commissioners appointed by a West Virginia state court from proceeding with the sale of certain real estate of the bankrupt pursuant to a decree of that court. The petitioners were the trustee in bankruptcy and two mortgagees.\n The petition alleged that the commissioners were advertising for sale only the property of the bankrupt in West Virginia, that it would be advantageous to all parties to have this property sold with property of the bankrupt situate in Kentucky, and that the bankruptcy court had exclusive jurisdiction to make the sale. The respondents in their answer denied the right of the District Court to enjoin the proceedings in the state court, and appealed from an order awarding an injunction.\n April 11, 1927, one Alley obtained judgment against the coal company in the Circuit Court of Mingo County, West Virginia, which was docketed May 5, 1927, and thus be- \n\n[283 U.S. 318, 320]\n\u00a0\n came a lien on its estate in that county. February 20, 1928, Alley filed in the same court a judgment creditors' suit against the coal company, and made parties thereto all creditors having liens against its real estate, including the two mortgagees who were co-petitioners with the trustee in the bankruptcy court. In his bill he prayed that the liens and assets be marshalled and that the company's real estate be sold and the proceeds distributed among the lien claimants according to their respective rights. The cause was duly matured and, at April term, 1928, was referred to a commissioner in chancery to report the real estate owned by the debtor and the liens thereon. At the July term, 1928, the commissioner presented his report, and thereupon the respondents were appointed to make sale of the property. August 4, 1928, sixteen months after rendition of Alley's judgment, and five and one-half months after the filing of the creditors' bill, the coal company filed its voluntary petition in bankruptcy, and on October 11, 1928, while the commissioners of the state court were proceeding to carry out its order of sale, the petition was filed to enjoin them from frthe r proceeding.\n Upon these facts the question certified is:\n Where creditors have obtained and docketed judgments constituting liens on the real estate of defendant, and have instituted a creditors' suit in a state court to marshal and enforce the liens and sell the real estate subject thereto, does the bankruptcy of defendant occurring more than four months after the institution of the creditors' suit oust the state court of jurisdiction, or vest in the court of bankruptcy power to enjoin further proceedings in the state court?\n The purpose of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA) passed pursuant to the power of Congress to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the United States, is to place the property of the bankrupt, whereever found, under the control of the court, for equal distribution among the \n\n[283 U.S. 318, 321]\n\u00a0\n creditors. The filing of the petition is an assertion of jurisdiction with a view to the determination of the status of the bankrupt and a settlement and distribution of his estate. This jurisdiction is exclusive within the field defind by the law, and is so far in rem that the estate is regarded as in custodia legis from the filing of the petition. Acme Harvester Co. v. Beekman Lumber Co., \n222 \nU.S. 300\n, 32 S. Ct. 96. It follows that liens cannot thereafter be obtained nor proceedings be had in other courts to reach the property, the district court having acquired the exclusive right to administer all property in the bankrupt's possession. Lazarus, Michel & Lazarus v. Prentice, \n234 \nU.S. 263\n, 34 S. Ct. 851; White v. Schloerb, \n178 \nU.S. 542\n, 20 S. Ct. 1007; Murphy v. John Hofman Co., \n211 \nU.S. 562\n, 29 S. Ct. 154; U. S. F. & G. Co. v. Bray, \n225 \nU.S. 205\n, 32 S. Ct. 620; Hebert v. Crawford, \n228 \nU.S. 204\n, 33 S. Ct. 484. It may inquire into the validity of liens, marshal them, and control their enforcement and liquidation. Isaacs v. Hobbs Tie & Timber Co., \n282 \nU.S. 734\n, 51 S. Ct. 270, and authorities cited; Whitney v. Wenman, \n198 \nU.S. 539\n, 25 S. Ct. 778; Remington, Bankruptcy (3d Ed.)  2472\n\n\n Though a lien be not discharged by bankruptcy, its owner may not, without the bankruptcy court's permission, institute proceedings in a state court to enforce it, since his so doing might interfere with the orderly administration of the estate. Thus a mortgagee will be restrained from instituting or proceeding further in a foreclosure action, begun after the date of the petition in bankruptcy. \n1\n And a creditor holding a valid judgment \n\n[283 U.S. 318, 322]\n\u00a0\n more than four months old will be enjoined from enforcing its lien by suit brought after the date of the petition. \n2\n And as the lien created by a judgment entered within four months in avoided, the court of bankruptcy has jurisdiction to administer the property regardless of the lien and will restrain the prosecution of an action to enforce it. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The bankruptcy law contains no express provision preserving liens acquired by legal proceedings more than four months before the petition is filed. But it is clearly implied that they shall be saved from the operation of the law, for section 67f4 voids only liens obtained by legal proceedings within that period. It has consequently been held that those acquired earlier, if valid under state law, are preserved, and will be accorded priority by the bankruptcy court in distribution of the estate, in accordance with applicable local law. \n 5\n\u00a0\n\n There is no dispute concerning these propositions. Appellants, however, assert that the jurisdiction in bankruptcy to ascertain, marshal and enforce liens, is not exclusive, but concurrent with that of other courts competent to that end, if the liens in question are not discharged but recognized as valid in bankruptcy, and that the rule of comity is applicable that the court first lawfully taking jurisdiction shall retain it. Wabash R. Co. v. \n\n[283 U.S. 318, 323]\n\u00a0\n Adelbert College, \n208 \nU.S. 38\n, 28 S. Ct. 182; Harkin v. Brundage, \n276 \nU.S. 36\n, 48 S. Ct. 268. They contend that when the petition was filed in this case, the state court was proceeding in a suit within its jurisdiction and had taken possession of the res for the purpose of enforcing such a lien.\n The certificate states that the judgment of the plaintiff in the creditors' suit constituted a lien on real estate from a date sixteen months prior to the initiation of the bankruptcy proceeding. It is obvious that it and any other judgments involved in that suit, and the mortgage liens which were to be marshalled in it, including those of the two mortgagees who joined in the petition for injunction against further action by the state court, were valid notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because the creditors' suit was filed five and one-half months before the petition in bankruptcy, and all such other judgments and liens must then have been in existence and matured, or they would not have been proper subjects for the state court's action.\n If appellants are correct in their contention that the creditors' suit was no more than a proceeding to enforce liens saved from discharge by the subsequent bankruptcy of the debtor, it follows, as they claim, that the District Court sitting in bankruptcy had no power to enjoin that action.\n In Metcalf v. Barker, \n187 \nU.S. 165\n, 23 S. Ct. 67, Lesser Brothers were adjudged bankrupts on their own petition, on May 12, 1899. They had on October 2, 1896, being insolvent, transferred all their property, partnership and individual, to certain favored creditors. On October 22, 1896, and October 29, 1896, Metcalf recovered judgments in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against the Lessers, upon which executions were issued and returned unsatisfied. On December 17, 1896, Metcalf commenced a judgment creditors' action in the Supreme Court of New York, which came to trial on December 17, 1897, as a result \n\n[283 U.S. 318, 324]\n\u00a0\n whereof the transfers were adjudged fraudulent and void as to plaintiff. 22 Misc. Rep. 664, 50 N. Y. S. 1060. The transfers had involved both personal property and real estate. The judgment of the court set aside the transfers of personal property and of the real estate in favor of the plaintiff. Meantime receivers had been appointed for the Lessers and the judgment of the Supreme Court determined that the tangible property and its proceeds then in the hands of the receivers, and certain claims by the receivers, were to be administered by them for the benefit of the creditors of the partnership, including Metchalf, while the real estate ivolv ed became subject to the lien of the judgments of Metcalf as of October 22 and 29, 1896.\n From this judgment there were appeals (35 App. Div. 596, 55 N. Y. S. 179; 161 N. Y. 587, 56 N. E. 67), as a result of which the decree in favor of Metcalf did not become final until March 12, 1900. On March 8, 1900, the trustee in bankruptcy procured from the United States District Court an order on Metcalf to show cause why an injunction should not issue enjoining him from taking any further proceedings under any judgment in the creditors' action. Objection was made to the jurisdiction of the court, which was overruled, and the injunction made permanent. Metcalf presented a petition to revise to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which certified to this Court certain questions, amongst others, whether the District Court had jurisdiction to make the injunction order, and whether Metcalf, by the commencement of the creditors' action, acquired a lien on the property of the bankrupts superior to the title of the trustee. This Court answered that the District Court had no jurisdiction, and that Metcalf did acquire such a lien.\n The bill was a technical creditors' bill; its purpose was to subject equitable assets to the lien of a judgment which the judgment did not bind at law. This Court held that the lien when established related back to the date of the filing of the bill, which was much more than four months \n\n[283 U.S. 318, 325]\n\u00a0\n before the initiation of the cause in bankruptcy. It was urged that at the date of bankruptcy the claim was contingent and was only an equitable lien, and that in truth and in substance the judgment was recovered within four months of bankruptcy, and under  67f, 11 USCA 107(f) must be declared null and void. This Court overruled the contention, quoted  67f, and said ( page 174 of 187 U. S., 23 S. Ct. 67, 71):\n'In our opinion the conclusion to be drawn from this language is that it is the lien created by a levy, or a judgment, or an an attachment, or otherwise, that is invalidated, and that where the lien is obtained more than four months prior to the filing of the petition, it is not only not to be deemed to be null and void on adjudication, but its validity is recognized. ... A judgment or decree in enforcement of an otherwise valid preexisting lien is not the judgment denounced by the statute, which is plainly confined to judgments creating liens.'\n\n In Clarke v. Larrenmore, \n188 \nU.S. 486\n, 23 S. Ct. 363, 364, a judgment was recovered, but did not constitute a lien on the debtor's personal property. Within four months prior to the filing of a bankruptcy petition the judgment creditor issued execution under which levy was made on the debtor's goods. It was held that the levy and the sale thereunder were avoided. The Court said: 'The judgment in favor of petitioner against Kenney was not like that in Metcalf Bros. v. Barker , ... one giving effect to a lien theretofore existing, but one which, with the levy of an execution issued thereon, created the lien. ...'\n In Globe Bank & Trust Co. v. Martin, \n236 \nU.S. 288\n, 35 S. Ct. 377, 381, the Court said: 'The difference, having the provisions of the act in view, between the beginning of a proceeding to assert liens that existed more than four months before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, and the attempt to create them by attachment and other proceedings within four months, has been recognized in decisions of this court' (citing Metcalf v. Barker). \n\n[283 U.S. 318, 326]\n\u00a0\n Following these cases the federal courts have with practical unanimity held that where a judgment which constitutes a lien on the debtor's real estate is recovered more than four months prior to the filing of the petition, the bankruptcy court is without jurisdiction to enjoin the prosecution of the creditor's action, instituted prior to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, to bring about a judicial sale of the real estate. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n - \n\n[283 U.S. 318, 327]\n\u00a0\n The trustee in bankruptcy may intervene in such suits of protect the interests of the estate. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n It is clear that if the action in the state court was merely in the nature of an execution or proceeding to obtain the avails of the judgment lien it should not have been enjoined by the district court.\n The appellees, however, insist that the purpose and function of the creditors' bill was a general disposition and distribution of the debtor's property; that it was a winding up proceeding pursuant to state law, and was therefore superseded by the bankruptcy. They invoke the settled rule that state insolvency laws which are tantamount to bankruptcy because they provide for an administration of the debtor's assets and a winding up of his affairs similar to that provided by the national act are suspended while the latter remains in force, and proceedings under them are utterly null and void whether commenced within four months of the filing of a petition in bankruptcy or before. Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122; Mayer v. Hellman, \n91 U.S. 496\n; Hanover Nat. Bank v. Moyses, \n186 \nU.S. 181\n, 22 S. Ct. 857; Miller v. New Orleans Acid & Fertilizer Co., \n211 \nU.S. 496\n, 29 S. Ct. 176; Stellwagen v. Clum, \n245 \nU.S. 605\n, 38 S. Ct. 215; nter national Shoe Co. v. Pinkus, \n278 \nU.S. 261\n, 49 S. Ct. 108.\n It was pointed out in Stellwagen v. Clum, supra, that state laws which provide for sale and distribution of a debtor's property may not amount to insolvency laws; and it was there held that such laws, if not inconsistent with the administration of the bankruptcy act, are available to litigants. Appellees must therefore show that the \n\n[283 U.S. 318, 328]\n\u00a0\n statutory action in the state court is, in fact, an insolvency proceeding. The certificate states no facts which lead to such a conclusion, nor does it so denominate the creditors' suit. Reference to the statutes of West Virginia, of which we take judicial notice, demonstrates that it is not in that category.\n In that State a judgment is a lien on the debtor's real estate as against all except bona fide purchasers for value without notice, and as against the latter from the date of docketing it in the county where the land lies. \n8\n The debtor's real estate cannot be sold under execution. In re McGraw (D. C.) 254 F. 442. The plaintiff must resort for enforcement of his judgment against real estate to such a proceeding as is described in the certificate. \n9\n He may do so without exhausting his legal remedies, as against personal property. \n10\n The statute provides for a course of procedure such as is described in the certificate,-namely, that the liens and the debtor's real estate shall be determined by a commissioner appointed by the court and, if \n\n[283 U.S. 318, 329]\n\u00a0\n the claims which he reports be not paid, a decree shall be made for a sale of the real estate subject to the liens so far as may be necessary to pay them according to their priorities, if any. If a lien-holder, after notice has been given of the proceeding as required by the statute, does not appear and present his claims he is barred from participation, except that if a surplus remain after the payment of claims presented he may share in such surplus upon proving his claim at any time before final decree. There is also a provision for the presentation and participation of lien claims where judgment has been recovered before final decree in the creditors' action. This statute says nothing about a distribution of assets amongst general creditors. It contains no provision that lien claims presented which cannot be paid because the proceeds of the sale are insufficient shall be wiped out as debts of the defendant. It does not purport to discharge the debtor from his indebtedness generally. It is merely a proceeding in equity to do what would be done by a sheriff or marshal under an appropriate writ for the sale of real estate in execution at law. In re McGraw, supra. Such officer upon receiving the proceeds of a judicial sale would under the supervision of the court pay them to those whose liens were discharged by the sale. He would marshal the liens against the proceeds precisely as this statute directs the chancellor to do. The act is in no sense an insolvency statute, and a proceeding thereunder is not therefore avoided by the adjudication of the debtor as a bankrupt. On the contrary, it is a mere proceeding to enforce a valid lien or liens against the real estate bound thereby, and falls within the rule announced in Metcalf v. Barker, supra. 11 This is the view of the Supreme Court \n\n[283 U.S. 318, 330]\n\u00a0\n of West Virginia, which has held that the action is merely one to enforce liens, and that where the bankruptcy of the debtor occurred six months after its institution, it need not be stayed, since the state court which had first acquired jurisdiction was entitled to proceed to final decree. Abney-Barnes Co. v. Davy-Pocahontas Coal Co., 83 W. Va. 292, 98 S. E. 298.\n It is suggested that the commissioners appointed by the state court were in effect receivers, and it was stated in argument that they did not qualify by giving bond until within four months of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, and that therefore the state court action should be enjoined and the property taken into possession of the bankruptcy court. But as above said, the statute of West Virginia merely substitutes these commissioners for the usual judicial officer who makes a sale and reports the result thereof to the court. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Assuming them to be receivers, their function is not that of an officer charged with winding up the affairs of the debtor, such as would cause a conflict with the bankruptcy law. \n13\n Moreover, we find nothing in the certificate to the effect that the commissioners had not qualified more than four months prior to the filing of the petition in the bankruptcy court.\n The appellees rely upon In re Watts, \n190 \nU.S. 1\n, 23 S. Ct. 718, 726. But that case does not support their contentions.\n It is suffi- \n\n[283 U.S. 318, 331]\n\u00a0\n cient to say that there a state court made an order appointing a general receiver for a corporation. He proceeded to inventory and appraise the assets of the debtor, asked for orders requiring the creditors to prove their claims, and was proceeding to a complete winding up. Within a month and a half after the appointment a petition in bankruptcy was filed. This Court said:\n'We do not understand it to be contended that the passage of the bankruptcy act in itself suspended the statute of Indiana in relation to the appointment of receivers, but only that when the proceedings for such appointment took the form, as they did here, of winding up the affairs of the insolvent corporation, the proceedings in bankruptcy displaced those in the state court and terminated the jurisdiction of the latter.'\n\n This was merely a statement of the well settled principle that a general winding up receivership is tantamount to an insolvency proceeding which will be superseded by bankruptcy, and, a fortiori, if, as in that case, the petition is filed within four months of the appointment of the receiver. The language quoted from that case by appellees respecting the paramount and exclusive jurisdiction of the court of bankruptcy must be read in connection with the facts on which it was predicated.\n Most of the cases ited by the appellees to the effect that the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings confers on the district court jurisdiction to enjoin pending suits in state courts deal with the situation where a lien was acquired within four months of the filing of the petition, or where, after the filing of the petition an action was begun to enforce a lien valid in bankruptcy. As heretofore noted, there are a few cases which have held that the bankruptcy court may enjoin proceedings, brought prior to the filing of the petition, to enforce valid liens which are more than four months old at the date of bankruptcy;14 but \n\n[283 U.S. 318, 332]\n\u00a0\n these cases are contrary to the decisions of this Court and to the great weight of federal authority.\n The question is answered, 'No.' \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Isaacs v.

PEOPLE OF STATE OF CALIFORNIA(1931)\nNo. 584\nArgued: April 15, 1931Decided: May 18, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 359, 360]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John Beardsley, of Los Angeles, Cal., for appellant.\n Mr. John D. Richer, of Los Angeles, Cal., for the People of the State of California.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant was convicted in the superior court of San Bernardino county, California, for violation of \n\n[283 U.S. 359, 361]\n\u00a0\n section 403a of the Penal Code of that State. That section provides:\n'Any person who displays a red flag, banner or badge or any flag, badge, banner, or device of any color or form whatever in any public place or in any meeting place or public assembly, or from or on ahy house, building or window as a sign, symbol or emblem of opposition to organized government or as an invitation or stimulus to anarchistic action or as an aid to propaganda that is of a seditious character is guilty of a felony.'\n\n The information, in its first count, charged that the appellant and other defendants, at the time and place set forth, 'did wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously display a red flag and banner in a public place and in a meeting place as a sign, symbol and emblem of opposition to organized governmnent and as an invitation and stimulus to anarchistic action and as an aid to propaganda that is and was of a seditious character.'\n The information contained a second count charging conspiracy, but this need not be considered, as the conviction on that count was set aside by the state court. The appellant alone was convicted on the first count.\n On the argument of a general demurrer to the information, the appellant contended, as was permitted by the practice in Californi, th at the statute was invalid because repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The demurrer was overruled, and the appellant pleaded not guilty. Conviction followed, motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were denied, and on appeal to the District Court of Appeal the judgment was affirmed. People v. Mintz, 290 P. 93. Petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court of California was denied, and an appeal has been taken to this Court.\n This Court granted an order, 51 S. Ct. 343, 75 L. Ed. -, permitting the appellant to prosecute the appeal in forma pauperis and, for the \n\n[283 U.S. 359, 362]\n\u00a0\n purpose of shortening the record, a stipulation of facts has been presented on behalf of the appellant and the Attorney General of the State. It appears that the appellant, a young woman of nineteen, a citizen of the United States by birth, was one of the supervisors of a summer camp for children, between ten and fifteen years of age, in the foothills of the San Bernardino mountains. Appellant led the children in their daily study, teaching them history and economics. 'Among other things the children were taught class-consciousness, the solidarity of the workers and the theory that the workers of the world are of one blood and brothers all.' Appellant was a member of the Young Communist League, an international organization affiliated with the Communist Party. The charge against her concerned a daily ceremony at the camp, in which the appellant supervised and directed the children in raising a red flag, 'a camp-made reproduction of the flag of Soviet Russia, which was also the flag of the Communist Party in the United States.' In connection with the flag-raising, there was a ritual at which the children stood at salute and recited a pledge of allegiance 'to the workers' red flag, and to the cause for which it stands, one aim throughout our lives, freedom for the working class.' The stipulation further shows that 'a library was maintained at the camp containing a large number of books, papers and pamphlets, including much radical communist propaganda, specimens of which are quoted in the opinion of the state court.' These quotations abundantly demonstrated that the books and pamphlets contained incitements to violence and to 'armed uprisings,' teaching 'the indispensability of a desperate, bloody, destructive war as the immediate task of the coming action.' Appellant admitted ownership of a number of the books, some of which bore her name. It appears from the stipulation that none of these books or pamphlets were used in the teaching at the camp. \n\n[283 U.S. 359, 363]\n\u00a0\n With respect to the conduct of the appellant, the stipulation contains the following statement: 'She' (the appellant) 'testified, however, that none of the literature in the library, and particularly none of the exhibits containing radical communist propaganda, was in any way brought to the attention of any child or of any other person, and that no word of violence or anarchism or sedition was employed in her teaching of the children. There was no evidence to the contrary.'\n The charge in the information, as to the purposes for which the flag was raised, was laid conjunctively, uniting the three purposes which the statute condemned. But in the instructions to the jury, the trial court followed the express terms of the statute and treated the described purposes disjunctively, holding that the appellant should be convicted if the flag was displayed for any one of the three purposes named. The instruction was as follows:\n'In this connection you are instructed that if the jury should believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants, or either of them, displayed, or caused to be displayed, a red flag, banner, or badge, or any flag, badge, banner, or device of any color or form whatever in any public place or in any meeting place, as charged in count one of the information, and if you further believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that said flag, badge, banner, or device was displayed, or caused to be displayed, as a sign, symbol, or emblm of opposition to organized government, or was an invitation or stimulus to anarchistic action, or was in aid to propaganda that is of a seditious character, you will find such defendants guilty as charged in count one of the information.\n\n'In this connection you are instructed that if you believe a red flag, such as herein described, was displayed in either of the places mentioned in said information, that it is only necessary for the prosecution to prove to you, beyond a reasonable doubt, that said flag was displayed \n\n[283 U.S. 359, 364]\n\u00a0\n for any one or more of the three purposes mentioned in the information; in other words, if the prosecution should prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that the red flag, such as herein described, was displayed at the place or either of said places and for the purposes and objects as alleged in said information, it is only necessary for the prosecution to prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that said flag was displayed for only one or more of the three purposes alleged in said information, and it is not necessary that the evidence show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that said red flag was displayed for all three purposes charged in said information. Proof, beyond a reasonable doubt of any one or more of the three purposes alleged in said information is sufficient to justify a verdict of guilty under count one of said information.'\n\n Appellant, before the District Court of Appeal, accepted this instruction as correct and waived any claim of error on that account. But appellant continued her challenge of the constitutionality of the statute, and the court on appeal entertained her contention and decided the constitutional question against her. In the District Court of Appeal there were three justices, and the concurrence of two justices was necessary to pronounce a judgment. Cal. Const., art. 6,  4a; Cal. St., 1929, c. 691, pp. 1202, 1203. Two opinions were delivered, one by a single justice, and another by the remaining two justices. The three justices concurred with respect to the affirmance of the conviction of the appellant under the first count, and there was a dissent only in relation to the proceedings on the reversal of the judgment under the second count for conspiracy, a point not in question here. The opinions make it clear that the appellant insisted that, under the Fourteenth Amendment, the statute was invalid as being 'an unwarranted limitation on the right of free speech.'\n As the trial court had treated the three purposes of the statute disjunctively, and the appellant had accepted that \n\n[283 U.S. 359, 365]\n\u00a0\n construction, we think that the only fair interpretation of her contention is that it related to the validity, not merely of the statute taken as a whole, but of each one of the three clauses separately relied upon by the State in order to obtain a conviction. Her concession as to the interpretation of the statute emphasizes, rather than destroys, that contention. The opinion of the two concurring justices explicitly states: 'She' (the appellant) 'directs her argument to the phrase in section 403a of the Penal Code 'of opposition to organized government.\" Thus directing her argument, we do not think that it can properly be said that the appellant having agreed that, according to the terms of the statute, her conviction could rest exclusively upon that ground, was not contending that the statute was invalid to the extent that it was so applied.\n We are not left in doubt as to the construction placed by the state court upon each of the clauses of the statute. The first purpose described, that is, relating to the display of a flag or banner 'as a sign, symbol or emblem of opposition to organized government,' is discussed by the two concurring justices. After referring, in the language above quoted, to the constitutional question raised by the appellant with respect to this clause, these justices said in their opinion:\n'If opposition to organized government were the only act prohibited by this section, we might be forced to agree with appellant. 'Opposition' isa wo rd broad in its meaning. It has been defined as follows:\n\n\"The act of opposing or resisting; antagonism. The state of being opposite or opposed; antithesis; also, a position confronting another or a placing in contrast. That which is, or furnishes an obstacle to some result; as, the stream flows without opposition. The political party opposed to the ministry or administration; often used adjectively, as, the opposition press.'\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 359, 366]\n\u00a0\n 'It might be construed to include the peaceful and orderly opposition to a government as organized and controlled by one political party by those of another political party equally high minded and patriotic, which did not agree with the one in power. It might also be construed to include peaceful and orderly opposition to government by legal means and within constitutional limitations. Progress depends on new thought and the development of original ideas. All change is, to a certain extent, achieved by the opposition of the new to the old, and in so far as it is within the law, such peaceful opposition is guaranteed to our people and is recognized as a symbol of independent thought containing the promise of progress. It may be permitted as a means of political evolution, but not of revolution.'\n With respect to the second purpose described in the statute, the display of a flag or banner 'an an invitation or stimulus to anarchistic action,' the concurring justices quoted accepted definitions and judicial decisions as to the meaning of 'anarchistic action.' These authorities, as set forth and approved in the opinion, show clearly that the term was regarded by the state court as referring to the overthrow by force and violence of the existing law and order, to the use of 'unlawful, violent and felonious means to destroy property and human life.' The conclusion was thus stated: 'It is therefore clear that when section 403a of the Penal Code prohibits a display of a red flag as an invitation or stimulus to anarchistic action it prohibits acts which have a well-defined and well- settled meaning in the law of our land, a teaching which, if allowed to be put into force and effect, would mean revolution in its most dreaded form.'\n The state court further gave its interpretation of the third clause of the statute, that is, in relation to the display of a flag or banner 'as an aid to propaganda that is of a seditious character.' Both opinions dealt with the \n\n[283 U.S. 359, 367]\n\u00a0\n meaning of this clause. Thus in one opinion it is said: 'Appellants' counsel concedes that sedition laws which 'interdict against the use of force or violence' are consistently upheld by the courts, and all of the authorities cited by him support that proposition. ... 'Sedition' is defined as the stirring up of disorder in the state, tending toward treason, but lacking an overt act. Certainly the 'advocacy of force or violence' in overturning the government of a state falls within that definition.' The other opinion takes a similar view. Assuming that the local statute is thus construed by the state court as referring to the advocacy of force or violence in the overthrow of government, we do not find it necessary, for the purposes of the present case, to review the historic controversy with respect to 'sedition laws' or to consider the question as to the validity of a statute dealing broadly and vaguely with what is termed seditious conduct, without any limiting interpretation either by the statute itself or by judicial construction.\n Having reached these conclusions as to the meaning of the three clauses of the statute, and doubting the constitutionality of the first clause, the state court rested its decision upon the remaining clauses. The basis of the decision, as more fully stated in the opinion of the two concurring justices, was this: 'The constitutionality of the phrase of this section, 'of opposition to organized government,' is questionable. This phrase can be eliminated from the section without materially changing its purposes. The section is complete without it and with it eliminated it ca be upheld as a constitutional enactment by the Legislature of the State of California.' Accordingly, disregarding the first clause of the statute, and upholding the other clauses, the conviction of the appellant was sustained.\n We are unable to agree with this disposition of the case. The verdict against the appellant was a general \n\n[283 U.S. 359, 368]\n\u00a0\n one. It did not specify the ground upon which it rested. As there were three purposes set forth in the statute, and the jury was instructed that their verdict might be given with respect to any one of them, independently considered, it is impossible to say under which clause of the statute the conviction was obtained. If any one of these clauses, which the state court has held to be separable, was invalid, it cannot be determined upon this record that the appellant was not convicted under that clause. It may be added that this is far from being a merely academic proposition, as it appears, upon an examination of the original record filed with this Court, that the State's attorney upon the trial emphatically urged upon the jury that they could convict the appellant under the first clause alone, without regard to the other clauses. It follows that instead of its being permissible to hold, with the state court, that the verdict could be sustained if any one of the clauses of the statute were found to be valid, the necessary conclusion from the manner in which the case was sent to the jury is that, if any of the clauses in question is invalid under the Federal Constitution, the conviction cannot be upheld.\n We are thus brought to the question whether any one of the three clauses, as construed by the state court, is upon its face repugnant to the Federal Constitution so that it could not constitute a lawful foundation for a criminal prosecution. The principles to be applied have been clearly set forth in our former decisions. It has been determined that the conception of liberty under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment embraces the right of free speech. Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652, 666\n, 45 S. Ct. 625; Whitney v. California, \n274 \nU.S. 357, 362\n, 371 S., 373, 47 S. Ct. 641; Fiske v. Kansas, \n274 \nU.S. 380, 382\n, 47 S. Ct. 655. The right is not an absolute one, and the State in the exercise of its police power may punish the abuse of this freedom. There is no question but that the State may thus pro- \n\n[283 U.S. 359, 369]\n\u00a0\n vide for the punishment of those who indulge in utterances which incite to violence and crime and threaten the overthrow of organized government by unlawful means. There is no constitutional immunity for such conduct abhorrent to our institutions. Gitlow v. New York, supra; Whitney v. California, supra. We have no reason to doubt the validity of the second and third clauses of the statute as construed by the state court to relate to such incitements to violence.\n The question is thus narrowed to that of the validity of the first clause, that is, with respect to the display of the flag 'as a sign, symbol or emblem of opposition to organized government,' and the construction which the state court has placed upon this clause removes every element of doubt. The state court recognized the indefiniteness and ambiguity of the clause. The court considered that it might be construed as embracing conduct which the State could not constitutionally prohibit. Thus it was said that the clause 'might be construed to include the peaceful and orderly opposition to a government as organized and controlled by one political party by those of another political party equally high minded and patriotic, which did not agree with the one in power. It might also be construed to include peaceful and orderly opposition to government by legal means and within constitutional limitations.' The maintenance of the opportunity for free political discussion to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people and that changes may be obtained by lawful means, an opportunity essential to the security of the Republic is a fundamental principle of our constitutional system. A statute which upon its face, and as authoritatively construed, is so vague and indefinite as to permit the punishment of the fair use of this opportunity is repugnant to the guaranty of liberty contained in the Fourteenth Amendment. The first \n\n[283 U.S. 359, 370]\n\u00a0\n clause of the statute being invalid upon its face, the conviction of the appellant, which so far as the record discloses may have rested upon that clause exclusively, must be set aside.\n As for this reason the case must be remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, and other facts may be adduced in such proceedings, it is not necessary to deal with the questions which have been argued at the bar as to the constitutional validity of the second and third clauses of the statute, not simply upon their face, but as applied in the instant case; that is, to consider the conclusions of fact warranted by the evidence, either as shown by the original record filed with the Court on the present appeal, or as disclosed by the stipulation, as to the import of which the parties do not agree.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n This Court often has announced, and scores, perhaps hundreds of times has applied the rule, that it may not pass upon any question in a cause coming from a state court which the record fails to show was there determined or duly presented for determination.\n The only federal matter ruled upon by the court below (District Court of Appeals), and the only one there submitted, arose upon the general demurrer to the information. Did this adequately set forth an offense for which the defendant could be punished without violating the Fourteenth Amendment?\n Section 403a, Penal Code of California, provides: 'Any person who displays a red flag, banner or badge or any flag, badge, banner, or device of any color or form whatever in any public place or in any meeting place or public assembly, or from or on any house, building or window as a sign, symbol or emblem of opposition to organ- \n\n[283 U.S. 359, 371]\n\u00a0\n ized government or as an invitation or stimulus to anarchistic action or as an aid to propaganda that is of a seditious character is guilty of a felony.' And the information charged that the plaintiff 'did wilfully, unlawfully, and feloniously display a red flag and banner in a public place and a meeting place as a sign, symbol, and an emblem of opposition to organized government and as an invitation and stimulus to anarchistic action and as an aid to propaganda that is and was of a seditious character.'\n Below, counsel definitely 'stated that he was satisfied that the instructions (to the jury) were correct, and waived any claim of error on that account.' Accordingly, decision was not requested upon any question arising out of the charge; no such question was decided. The instructions were properly disregarded and are now unimportant.\n The sole matter of a federal nature considered by the Court of Appeals was the claim that the provisions of Section 403a of the Penal Code were in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment. It held the statute divisible and that as petitioner stood charged with violating all of the inhibitions therein, some of which were certainly good, the conviction could not be upset even if one paragraph were invalid. The conclusion seems plainly right and, I think, the challenged judgment should be affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.\n The Court decides that, in so far as section 403a declares it a crime to display a flag for the first purpose specified, 'as (an) emblem of opposition to organized government,' the section denies right of free speech, and the court holds that right to be included in the concept of 'liberty' safeguarded against state action by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It sustains the parts for- \n\n[283 U.S. 359, 372]\n\u00a0\n bidding the public display of a flag 'as an invitation or stimulus to anarchistic action or as an aid to propaganda that is of a seditious character.' The count on which the convictionrest  charges that the appellant displayed a flag in ways and for all the purposes denounced by the section. Assuming all the clauses of the section to be valid, the display of a flag for the purpose specified in any one of them would be sufficient to warrant conviction. The Court holds the first clause invalid and, finding that the judgment may have rested upon that clause exclusively, sets aside the conviction.\n\n 1. \nI am of opinion that the record affirmatively shows that appellant was not convicted for violation of the first clause.\n Shortly prior to the trial of this case, the supreme court of California held invalid a city ordinance purporting to make unlawful the public display of a flag or emblem of an organization espousing for the government of the people of the United States principles antagonistic to our Constitution or form of government. In re Hartman, 182 Cal. 447, 188 P. 548. Under that decision the California lower courts were bound to hold invalid the first clause of section 403a construed as peaceable opposition to organized government. And the record shows that in the case before us counsel and the trial court had that decision in mind.\n The instruction quoted and relied on in the opinion here is No. 17, requested by the state's attorney. The opinion construes that instruction as if it stood alone. It does not stand alone. Defendant's attorney did not object or except to it but on the other hand requested, and the court gave, other instructions. They are Nos. 10 and 11 as follows:\n'You are instructed that the inhabitants of the United States have both individually and collectively the right to advocate peaceable changes in our constitution, laws, or form of government, although such changes may be based upon theories or principles of government antagonistic to those which now serve as their basis.\n\n'You are instructed that under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and of this State, an organization peaceably advocating changes in our constitution, laws \n\n[283 U.S. 359, 373]\n\u00a0\n or form of government, although such changes may be based upon theories or principles of government antagonistic to those which now serve as their basis, may adopt a flag or emblem signifying the purpose of such organization, and that the display or possession of such flag or emblem cannot be made an unlawful act.'\n\n The effect of the three instructions here referred to was definitely to direct the jury that defendant had the right without limit to advocate peaceable changes in our government, that under our constitution and laws an organization peaceably advocating changes in our government, no matter to what extent or upon what theories or principles, may adopt a flag signifying the purposes of such organization, and that it is impossible to make that unlawful.\n\n 2. \nThe record fails to show that, aside from having the trial judge give to the jury these instructions suggested by her, defendant did in any manner separately challenge in the trial court the validity of the first clause.\n That question could not have been raised by the demurrer to the information because it charged conjunctively the three purposes that are disjunctively denounced by the section. And the failure of defendant's counsel in any manner to object or except to state's instruction No. 17 coupled with his statement before the district court of appeal (People v. Mintz, 290 P. 93) that 'he was satisfied that the instructions were correct, and waived any claim of error on that account' indubitably shows that he was of opinion that the giving of defendant's instructions above quoted eliminated all possibility of con- \n\n[283 U.S. 359, 374]\n\u00a0\n viction for the display of a flag as an emblem of peaceable opposition to organized government.\n\n 3. \nAnd, if defendant at the trial did assail the first clause, that contention is shown by the opinion of the court below to have been definitely waived.\n It is there stated that (page 95 of 290 P.): 'The part of section 403a necessary to be considered in passing upon the questions raised by the appeal reads as fllow s: 'Any person who displays a red flag, ... in any meeting place ... as an aid to propaganda that is of a seditious character is guilty of a felony.\" That statement is closely followed by the one showing that defendant's counsel was satisfied with the instructions.\n Those definite statements in the opinion were agreed to by the three judges constituting the court. They are not in any manner negatived or impaired by the concurring opinion of two of the judges. Pages 96-102 of 290 P. The first clause was discussed in the concurring opinion only for the purpose of showing that, notwithstanding its questionable validity, the rest of the section should be held valid. Clearly these judges did not intend to sustain a conviction resting on the clause so questioned in their opinion.\n The full substance of all they say that has any bearing follows (page 97 of 290 P.): 'Appellant's contention that section 403a of the Penal Code is unconstitutional, on the ground that it is an unwarranted limitation on the right of free speech guaranteed to the people by the Constitutions of the United States and of the state of California, deserves serious consideration. She directs her argument to the phrase in section 403a of the Penal Code; 'of opposition to organized government.' If opposition to organized government were the only act prohibited by this section, we might be forced to agree with appellant.' After some pages of discussion they conclude as to the second clause \n\n[283 U.S. 359, 375]\n\u00a0\n (page 9 of 290 P.): 'It is therefore clear that when section 403a of the Penal Code prohibits a display of a red flag as an invitation or stimulus to anarchistic action it prohibits acts which have a well-defined and well- settled meaning in the law of our land, a teaching which, if allowed to be put into force and effect, would mean revolution in its most dreaded form.'\n Turning then to a consideration of the third clause, they say: 'The section in question also prohibits the display of a red flag as an aid to propaganda that is of a seditious nature.' After discussion, they conclude ( page 99 of 290 P.) that: 'The term 'sedition' and the word 'seditious' have well-defined meanings in law. That the teaching of sedition against our government can be, and has long been, prohibited, needs no further citation of authorities.'\n Then summing up as to the second and third clauses, they say (page 99 of 290 P.): 'As we view the provisions of section 403a of the Penal Code, its prohibition of displaying a red flag 'as an invitation or stimulus to anarchistic action or as an aid to propaganda that is of a seditious character' is certain, and a proper and constitutional and legislative enactment. It is not contrary to the provisions of either the state or federal Constitutions guaranteeing freedom of speech to our people.'\n They refer again to the first clause: 'The constitutionality of the phrase of this section, 'of opposition to organized government,' is questionable.' And, disclosing the purpose of the reference, they say: 'This phrase can be eliminated from the section without materially changing its purposes. The section is complete without it, and with it eliminated it can be upheld as a constitutional enactment by the Legislature of the State of California.'\n I am of opinion that fair consideration of both opinions in all their parts makes it very clear that defendant did not claim below that under the charge the jury might or could \n\n[283 U.S. 359, 376]\n\u00a0\n have found her guilty of violating the first clause of the section, that the district court of appeal did not decide or consider whether conviction under that clause was or could lawfully be had, and that the validity of the first clause was discussed in the concurring opinion only upon the question whether, if that part of the section were unconstitutional, the other parts must also fail.\n\n 4. \nIt seems to me that on this record the Court is not called on to decide whether the mere display of a flag as the emblem of a purpose, whatever its sort, is speech within the meaning of the constitutinal protection of speech and press or to decide whether such freedom is a part of the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment or whether the anarchy that is certain to follow a successful 'opposition to organized government' is not a sufficient reason to hold that all activities to that end are outside the 'liberty' so protected.

SCOTT(1931)\nNo. 28-30\nArgued: October 22, 1931Decided: November 23, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 177, 178]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Rolland M. Edmonds, of Columbus, Ohio, for petitioners.\n Messrs. F. S. Monnett, of Columbus, Ohio, and Elwood Murphy, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent instituted five actions in a common pleas court in Ohio on as many policies of fire insurance. The causes were removed to the District Court for Southern Ohio, where they were consolidated, tried together, and resulted in verdicts and judgments for respondent. On appeal two of these judgments were reversed, and the three here under review were affirmed. \n1\n We granted certiorari. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Each suit seeks recovery upon a fire policy issued upon wool belonging to respondent. In each, defense was made that he placed a chattel mortgage on the property in violation of a provision of the policy as follows: 'This entire policy, unless otherwise provided by agreement endorsed hereon or added hereto, shall be void ... if the interest of the insured be other than unconditional and sole ownership; or if the subject of insurance be ... personal property and be or become incumbered by a chattel mortgage.'\n It is admitted that on June 19, 1926, the respondent executed a chattel mortgage on the insured property to a bank, and that the mortgage continued in force at the time of the fire. The policies of the Sun Insurance Office and the Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society, Limited, were is- \n\n[284 U.S. 177, 179]\n\u00a0\n sued on June 14, 1926. That of the Home Insurance Company of New York bore date July 6, 1926. Each of the policies had attached to it a 'loss payable clause' reading substantially as follows: 'Any loss under this policy that may be proved due the assured shall be payable to the assured and Cumberland Savings Bank Co., Cumberland, Ohio, subject, nevertheless, to all the terms and conditions of the policy.'\n These riders were attached by the local agent of petitioners, to the Sun and Norwich policies after their issuance, and to the Home policy on the date it was issued.\n To the petitioners' defense of violation of the chattel mortgage clause, the respondent answered that the loss payable clause, as a matter of law, constituted a waiver and a recognition of the interest of the bank as chattel mortgagee. He averred, moreover, that by custom in the community in which the policies were written such clause was so understood and was customarily used for the purpose of giving the insurers' consent to chattel mortgages. In the alternative he insisted that under section 9586 of the Ohio General Code a person who solicits insurance and procures the application therefor must be held to be the agent of the party, company, or association thereafter issuing a policy upon such application or a renewal thereof, anything in the application or policy to the contrary notwithstanding; and that if the loss payable clause did not have the effect for which he contended, nevertheless the agent who wrote the policies and attached the clause knew of the existence of the chattel mortgage, and his knowledge was to be imputed to the insurers and constituted an agreement on their part that notwithstanding the mortgage the insurance should remain in force.\n To this petitioners replied by denying any such custom as was alleged, and quoted a provision appearing in each of the policies that 'no officer, agent or other representative of this Company shall have power to waive any pro- \n\n[284 U.S. 177, 180]\n\u00a0\n vision or condition of this Policy except such as by the terms of this Policy may be the subject of agreement endorsed hereon or added hereto; and as to such provisions and conditions no officer, agent, or representative shall have such power or be deemed or held to have waived such provisions or conditions unless such waiver, if any, shall be written upon or attached hereto.'\n The Court of Appeals held that under the law of Ohio the chattel mortgage was valid as between respondent and the bank, and would have avoided the policies except for the loss payable clause, which it held either by its own force or by its customary use for the purpose constituted a waiver and consent on the part of the insurers. On this ground it affirmed the judgments.\n We are of opinion that upon the uncontradicted facts the petitioners made out a valid defense to the suits and were entitled to directed verdicts in their favor. The provision in the policies prohibiting chattel mortgages without consent indorsed on the policy is intended to reduce the moral hazard, and is a valid stipulation, the violation of which constitutes a complete defense. Hunt v. Springfield Fire & Marine Insurance Co., \n196 \nU.S. 47\n, 25 S. Ct. 179. The loss payable clause above quoted is not informative to the insurer of the existence of a chattel mortgage, but performs the office of protecting a creditor of the insured who has no interest in the insured property by mortgage or otherwise against the eventuality of fire loss.\n In Bates v. Equitable Insurance Co., 10 Wall. 33, a policy contained a covenant that if the property were sold the insurance should cease unless consent of the insurer to the sale were given in writing. The policy was indorsed, 'payable, in case of loss, to E. C. Bates,' to whom it appeared the insured goods had been sold. There was no evidence except the indorsement of any consent to accept Bates, the purchaser, as the party whose interest \n\n[284 U.S. 177, 181]\n\u00a0\n was insured. It was said of the practice of making such loss payable indorsements:\n'It is a mode of appointing that the loss of the party insured shall be paid by the company to such third person. This transaction is a very common mode of furnishing a species of security by a debtor to his creditor, who may be willing to trust to the debtor's honesty, his skill and success in trade, but who requires indemnity against such accidents as loss by fire, or the perils of navigation. ...\n\n'In the face of this frequent use of the two indorsements on the policy, it cannot be held that they imply of themselves a knowledge of the sale or a consent to insure the purchaser.'\n\n We are of opinion that the doctrine announced in the Bates Case is controlling here, that the attachment of a loss payable clause is entrirely consistent with the condition against change of interest, or incumbrance of the insured property, and does not constitute a waiver of the condition against sale or mortgaging, or a consent thereto.\n We find nothing in the record evidencing any customary use in the community where the policies were written of a loss payable clause as a consent to change of title or encumbrance of the subject-matter of the insurance, beyond the fact that in the three instances in question the agent of the insurers did, with alleged knowledge of the chattel mortgage, attach to each of the policies a loss payable rider. This is clearly insufficient to establish a custom or to change the normal office of such an indorsement.\n The respondent insists that laying the loss payable indorsement out of view, the uncontradicted evidence that Bracken, the insurers' local agent, knew of the chattel mortgage, constitutes a consent on the part of the insurers that the policies should remain in force notwithstanding the incumbrance. He claims that for this pur- \n\n[284 U.S. 177, 182]\n\u00a0\n pose the knowledge of the agent is that of his principals. Reliance is placed upon section 9586 of the Ohio General Code, which makes a person who solicits or takes an application for insurance the agent of the company, 'anything in the application or policy to the contrary notwithstanding.' He asserts that the decisions of the Ohio courts interpreting this statute are to the effect that the agency thus imputed to the solicitor extends to all matters of contract with respect to the policy, including consent to the alteration of its terms.\n On its face the statute does not go so far. We have examined the authorities cited and fail to find that they give it any such force or effect. \n3\n They do not, as respondent claims, define the scope of the agency created by the statute, but leave it to be defined by applicable principles of common law. In the present cases the policy limits its scope, and we think the written contract must control.\n For the reasons given it is clear that the petitioners did not waive the condition against incumbrance nor consent to the giving of the chattel mortgage, and that there was nothing in the situation which deprived them of their defense based upon that condition.\n In the petition for the writ of certiorari and in the argument other defenses made by the petitioners, which the courts below overruled, were pressed upon us. It is unnecessary to consider them, as what we have said disposes of the cases.\n The judgments must be reversed and the causes remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] (C.

Williams, of Bel Air, Md., for appellant.\n Messrs. Wm. L. Marbury Jr., of Baltimore, Md., and Chas. H. MacNabb, of Cardiff, Md., for appellee. \n\n[283 U.S. 297, 298]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on appeal, section 237 Jud. Code (28 USCA  344) as amended by Act of January 31, 1928 (28 USCA  861a, 861b) from a judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland, 151 A. 39, upholding an order of appellee, the State Tax Commission, which fixed an assessment on the capital stock of appellant, for 1929 taxation, at $6,000,000.\n The assessment was made under the provisions of article 81,  154, 163, 166, and 166A, of the Maryland Code. Sections 163, 166, and 166A impose a tax on the capital stock of every domestic corporation, which 'shall be collected from' the corporation, and which, when paid, may be charged to stockholders, and is a lien upon their stock. At the time of the adoption of section 163, corporations were exempt from taxation on their real and personal property; but section 163 provided that 'in no case shall the stock of any corporation, in the aggregate, be valued at less thn th e full value of the real estate and chattels, real or personal, held by or belonging to such corporation.' Direct taxation of real property of domestic corporations was restored by Laws 1896, c. 1208  1, subd. 2; and by section stock showed its gross assets to be $46,821,885.28, the stock of corporations for taxation, the taxable value should be ascertained by deducting the assessed value of the corporation's real estate from the aggregate value of all its stock.\n Appellant is a Maryland corporation, and has been granted a license by the Federal Power Commission. Acting under it, it has constructed a dam on the Susquehanna river, in connection with which it has established and is operating a power project. See Susquehanna Power Co. v. State Tax, commission, \n283 \nU.S. 291\n, 51 S. Ct. 434, decided this day. All its shares of capital stock are owned by the Philadelphia \n\n[283 U.S. 297, 299]\n\u00a0\n Electric Power Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, with its only place of business in that commonwealth. The report of appellant to the Commission for the assessment of its capital stock showed its gross assets to be $46, 821,885.28 of which its tangible personal property was not less than $6, 000,000, its total liabilities $41,954,998.92, and its net worth $4,866, 886.36. The order of the Commission fixed the aggregate value of the capital stock at $28,726,132, from which it deducted $22,726,132, the assessed value of its real estate, leaving $6,000,000 as the assessed value of the stock.\n Appellant challenges the taxing statute, as applied, on the ground that it violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because the assessed valuation required by it is arbitrary and excessive, and because it imposes a tax on intangible shares of stock owned by a nonresident, which have a situs, for purposes of taxation, only at the owner's residence. Appellant also assails the statute on the ground that, as the assessed value of the capital stock includes a value attributable to the license granted to appellant by the Federal Power Commission, the tax is on a federal instrumentality, which the Constitution impliedly forbids.\n The Court of Appeals of Maryland, in upholding the assessment, pointed out that it did not exceed the value of appellant's tangible personal porperty within the state, and that the tax was in lieu of any direct tax on that property; and sustained it as an indirect tax on the property. It said (151 A. at page 42):\n'There is in this state no direct tax on the personal property of the corporation, Code, art. 81,  163, and the value of the real estate upon which there is a direct tax is deducted from the aggregate value of both its real and personal property before its stock is finally valued for assessment, so that the final assessment of the shares, in \n\n[283 U.S. 297, 300]\n\u00a0\n so far as it represents tangible property, includes no part of the value of the real estate, but is based upon the value of the personal property alone. ... Under the amended law the value of the real property was excluded for the valuation of its stock, and that valuation represented only the tangible and intangible personal property of the corporation, without regard to any liens thereon. And, since it could have taxed such property directly without reference to such liens, there is no valid reason why it may not be taxed indirectly through appellant's capital stock, on an assessment made without reference to liens or debts, for in neither case would the corporation be called upon to pay taxes upon more than the assessable value of its property. And there is no possible basis for the contention that the method adopted subjects any of the corporate property to double taxation, for under it the realty is subjected only to direct taxation, and the personal property only to indirect taxation, based in both instances on the fair value of the property taxed.'\n\n The tax was thus sustained on an adequate state ground, and it is unnecessary to consider the objections made to it on constitutional grounds. None of them is directed at the staute viewed, as the state court has construed its, as imposing a tax on the personal property of appellant. Nor is it necessary on this record to consider how far any objection made may be availed of by the nonresident stockholder, in the event of an attempted enforcement of the provisions of the statute which authorize the tax to be charged to stockholders, and create a lien upon the stock.\n The objection that the property used by appellant in its power project is a federal instrumentality is not specifically raised on this record; but it was considered and rejected in Susquehanna Power Co. v. State Tax Commission, supra.\n Dismissed. \n\n\n\n","156":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSUSQUEHANNA POWER CO. v.

Marbury, Jr., and Robert H. Archer, both of Baltimore, Md., for appellee. \n\n[283 U.S. 291, 292]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on appeal, secton 237 Judicial Code (28 USCA  344) as amended by the Act of January 31, 1928 (28 USCA  861a-861b), from a judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland, 151 A. 29, which upheld an order of appellee, the state ax c ommission, assessing 2,110 acres of appellant's submerged lands, for 1929 taxation, at $2,349,300.\n Appellant is a licensee of the Federal Power Commission, created under the Act of June 10, 1920, c. 285, 41 Stat. 1063 (16 USCA  791-823). Acting under the license, it has constructed a dam across the Susquehanna river which, for present purposes, we assume to be navigable, and has established an adjacent power plant at a point within the state. As a part of the power project, it acquired by purchase from private owners, and by grant from the state, large areas of land, including the bed of the river and adjoining upland. On completion of the dam, the waters of the Susquehanna were backed up, forming a pool about fourteen miles in length, and submerging a large area formerly upland, including a town site, and land previously occupied and used as a canal. The lands assessed by appellee lie under the pool created by appellant's dam, and are used, and derive their chief value, as a part of the power project.\n In the present suit, brought to review the order of the Commission fixing the assessment, appellant assailed its action, taken under laws of Maryland, 1914, c. 841, Bagby, Ann. Code (1924), art. 81,  249(2), directing assessment of property for taxation, as in conflict with the Federal Constitution. Appellant urges, as principal grounds for reversal, first, that in constructing and operating its power plant under the federal license, it, and its lands and property used in the power project, are agencies \n\n[283 U.S. 291, 293]\n\u00a0\n or instrumentalities of the federal government, state taxation of which is impliedly prohibited by the Constitution, and, second, that in assessing the lands for taxation appellee has assigned to them a value attributable to appellant's license, likewise immune from taxation, and to the river waters, not appellant's property, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n 1. \nThe Federal Power Commission is authorized to grant to licensees permission to construct dams on navigable waterways, and to make use of surplus water not necessary for navigation. Act of June 10, 1920, supra. The act contemplates the use of such surplus water in the development of power, and, for that purpose, the construction and operation of works and transmission lines.

It provides (section 14 (16 USCA  807)) that, after the expiration of a license, the government shall have the right to take over and operate the licensed project upon payment of just compensation as defined by the act. The Commission is given extensive regulatory and supervisory powers over the construction, maintenance, operation, financing, rates, and service of licensed projects, and over the system of accounting maintained by licensees. The act does not deal directly with state taxation, but section 8 (16 USCA  801), forbiding voluntary transfers of licenses, provides that 'tax sales shall not be deemed voluntary transfers. ...'\n Appellant is a business corporation, operating its power plant for profit. The challenged tax is imposed, not on the license, but on the private property of the licensee use in its business. Lands privately owned are subject to state taxation, although lying under navigable waters, Central R. Co. v. Jersey City, \n209 \nU.S. 473\n, 28 S. Ct. 592; Leary v. Jersey city, \n248 \nU.S. 328\n, 39 S. Ct. 115, as is private property in which the federal government may have an interest, Baltimore Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. Baltimore, \n195 \nU.S. 375\n, 25 S. Ct. 50; New Brunswick v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 547\n, 48 S. Ct. 371; Shaw v. \n\n[283 U.S. 291, 294]\n\u00a0\n Oil Corp., \n276 \nU.S. 575\n, 48 S. Ct. 333, or which is subject to its control in the exercise of its power over navigable waters, Henderson Bridge Co. v. Kentucky, \n166 \nU.S. 150\n, 17 S. Ct. 532; Keokuk & Hamilton Bridge Co. v. Illinois, \n175 \nU.S. 626\n, 20 S. Ct. 205. Hence th pre sent lands are subject to the taxing power of the state, unless they are to be regarded as instrumentalities of the federal government because of their use as a part of the project which it has licensed.\n Assuming, for present purposes, that the license of the Power Commission is a federal instrumentality, immune from taxation or other direct interference by the state, it does not follow that the property appellant uses in its power project is clothed with that immunity. The exemption of an instrumentality of one government from taxation by the other must be given such a practical construction as will not unduly impair the taxing power of the one or the appropriate exercise of its functions by the other. Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514, 523\n, 524 S., 46 S. Ct. 172.\n With that end in view, the distinction has long been taken between a privilege or franchise granted by the government to a private corporation in order to effect some governmental purpose, and the property employed by the grantee in the exercise of the privilege, but for private business advantage. The distinction was pointed out by Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 436, and in Osborn v. Bank, 9 Wheat. 738, 867; see Union Pac. Railroad Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 34-37. It has been followed without departure, and property so owned and used has uniformly been held to be subject to state taxation. Thomson v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 9 Wall. 579; Central Pacific R. co. v.California, \n162 \nU.S. 91\n, 16 S. Ct. 766; Union Pac. Railroad Co. v. Peniston, supra; Baltimore Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v.

Ct. 273. 75 L. Ed. 496, decided February 24, 1931; see Choc- \n\n[283 U.S. 291, 295]\n\u00a0\n taw, O. & G. R. Co. v. Mackey, \n256 \nU.S. 531\n, 41 S. Ct. 582; Group No. 1 Oil Corp. v. Bass, \n283 \nU.S. 279\n, 51 S. Ct. 432, decided this day.\n The present case is not only controlled by the earlier decisions of this Court, but it would be difficult to suppose any case in which the adverse effect of a tax upon a governmental purpose would be more remote or attenuated, or in which the asserted immunity would more seriously impair the sovereign power of the state to tax, than in this one.\n Appellant is not aided by Long v. Rockwood, \n277 \nU.S. 142\n, 48 S. Ct. 463, on which it chiefly relies. It was there held that royalties derived from a patent granted upon an invention by the federal government could not be taxed by a state. But there would be no warrant for extending such immunity to property of the patentee used to manufacture the patented article, and only a comparable extension would justify the immunity claimed here for appellant's lands because used as a part of its licensed power project.\n\n 2. \nNo basis is laid in the present record for assailing the tax on constitutional grounds, either because the Commission has placed a higher value on appellant's lands than on others having a similar location and use, or because it has directly taxed appellant's license. The contention urged is that the lands are assessed at a higher value than they were before they were submerged, and higher than farm uplands in the neighborhood, and that, since their use as a part of appellant's power project is rendered possible only by the federal license and by the water in the river, the assessment at the higher value, in effect, involves a forbidden tax on the license, and taxation of appellant for the value of the waters of a navigable stream.\n Accepting, as we must on this record, the valuation of the Commission as neither excessive nor discriminatory, we can perceive no basis, either legal or economic, for relieving appellant from the burden of the tax by attempt- \n\n[283 U.S. 291, 296]\n\u00a0\n ing the segregation of a part of that alue and attributing it to independent legal interests, not subject to taxation, because those interests have a favorable influence on the value of the property.\n An important element in the value of land is the use to which it may be put. That may vary with its location and its relationship to the property or legal interests of others. See Winnipiseogee Lake Cotton & Woolen Manufacturing Co. v. Gilford, 64 N. H. 337, 10 A. 849. Its proximity to means of transportation, highways, railroads, or tidewater, see New York, L. E. & W. R. Co. v. Yard, 43 N. J. Law, 632; Trask v. Carragan, 37 N. J. Law, 264; cf. Hersey v. Barron County, 37 Wis. 75, or its location in the vicinity of water power belonging to another but available for use upon it, State v. Flavell, 24 N. J. Law, 370, may increase its utility and hence its taxable value. A dock on New York harbor may have a greater value than one on nonnavigable waters, cf. Leary v. Jersey City, supra; Central R. Co. v. Jersey City, supra, even though the advantages of the former may be terminated through the exercise of the superior power of the federal government over navigable waters, see United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53\n, 33 S. Ct. 667\n\n\n A large part of the value of property in civilized communities has been built up by its inter-related uses; but it is a value ultimately reflected in earning capacity and the price at which the property may be sold, and hence is an element to which weight may appropriately be given in determining its taxable value. It has never been thought that the taxation of such property at its enhanced value is in effect taxation of its owner for the property of others. Nor can we say that the present tax, based upon what must be taken to be the fair value of appellant's lands profitably used in the business of developing and selling power, is forbidden because that use would not have been possible without the control which appellant has acquired over navigable waters through the grant of \n\n[283 U.S. 291, 297]\n\u00a0\n its license. Those considerations which lead to the recognition of the power of a state to tax the property used by the grantee in the enjoyment of a federal license require recognition of the power to tax it on the basis of accepted standards of value, customarily applied in the taxation of other forms of property. See Union Pac. Railroad Co. v. Peniston, supra.\n We have examined other objections to the tax, made in brief and argument; but we do not discuss them, as they are unsubstantial, and as the objections, on federal grounds, were not presented by the record or passed upon by the state court.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","157":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTWIN CITY PIPE LINE CO. v. HARDING GLASS CO.(1931)\nNo. 330\nArgued: Decided: May 4, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 353, 354]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Harry P. Daily and J. P. Woods, both of Ft. Smith, Ark., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Joseph R. Brown and James B. McDonough, both of Ft. Smith, Ark., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Twin City Pipe Line Company is a public utility. The Industrial Oil & Gas Company is a producer of natural gas in Arkansas. The majority of the stock of these companies is owned by the same shareholders. The respondent operates a large glass factory at Ft. Smith. The pipe line company takes all the gas produced by the oil company, transports it by pipe line from the fields to Ft. Smith, and there furnishes it at prices fixed by public authority to industrial consumers and to another utility, the Ft. Smith Light & Traction Company, which distributes it to domestic and commercial consumers.\n Three suits, in which all the above-named companies and one Hale were parties, were commenced in the latter part of 1925. Two were brought by the pipe line company to recover for gas furnished to the glass company. The other was a suit in equity in which the glass company was plaintiff and the other companies and Hale were defendants. At that time gas for the operation of the glass plant was being furnished from a main of the pipe line company laid in a street on which the site of the plant abuts. The plant was the largest consumer of gas in Ft. \n\n[283 U.S. 353, 355]\n\u00a0\n Smith, and required a dependable supply of from a million to a million and a half cubic feet per day. In its complaint the glass company alleged that the petitioners discriminated against it and failed to furnish an adequate supply; it asserted that the pipe line company was bound to construct a line about half a mile in length to connect a main, used to deliver gas to the traction company, with the glass plant and to drill additional gas wells to provide an adequate supply. The traction company objected to the proposed connctio n on the ground that the pressure and supply of gas available for the service of its customers thereby would be impaired. The suits were consolidated and tried. July 26, 1926, the court entered its decree denying the glass company the relief sought in its suit, giving to the pipe line company judgment against the glass company for $17,155.46, to the latter judgment over against Hale and to him judgment over against the oil company for the same amount. The glass company and the oil company appealed.\n By written instrument dated August 30, 1926, the parties settled all matters involved in the litigation. It was agreed that all judgments be satisfied and canceled, that all existing contracts between the parties be abrogated, and that the appeals and suits be dismissed. The pipe line company agreed to build the additional line for the service of the glass company. The latter agreed to take all its requirements of gas so long as the pipe line company could adequately supply them and to pay the rates then in effect or thereafter fixed by public authority. The glass company agreed that, in the event of a shortage of gas so that there was not enough adequately to supply domestic consumers, the pipe line company might discontinue serving the glass company upon condition that the same character of service be given to it that was given to other industries. \n\n[283 U.S. 353, 356]\n\u00a0\n All the agreements, save that of the glass company to continue to take its requirements of gas from the pipe line company, have been fully performed. The cost of the additional line constructed to serve the glass plant was $4,489.92. The oil company brought in seven wells while the suits were pending and twelve more after the contract was made. The gas from these was made available to the pipe line company for the service of its customers, inculding the glass company. The latter took gas as agreed until January 2, 1929. About that time a company controlled by it completed a pipe line from gas fields to the glass plant. The glass company asserted that the contract was invalid because contrary to public policy, and began to take practically all the gas it needed from its own subsidiary.\n Petitioners brought this suit to enjoin the glass company from taking gas from any one other than the pipe line company and to require it specifically to perform the contract. The District Court entered its decree granting the relief prayed. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case, with directions to dismiss the bill. 39 F.(2d) 408.\n The question is whether the contract is unenforceable because contrary to public policy of Arkansas.\n The general rule is that competent persons shall have the utmost liberty of contracting and that their agreements voluntarily and fairly made shall be held valid and enforced in the courts. Printing Company v. Sampson, L. R. 19 Eq. 462, 465; Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern Ry. v. Voigt, \n176 \nU.S. 498, 505\n, 20 S. Ct. 385. The meaning of the phrase 'public policy' is vague and variable; courts have not defined it, and there is no fixed rule by which to determine what contracts are repugnant to it. The principle that contracts in contravention of public policy are not enforceable should beapplied with caution and only in cases plainly within the reasons on which that \n\n[283 U.S. 353, 357]\n\u00a0\n doctrine rests. It is only because of the dominant public interest that one who, like respondent, has had the benefit of performance by the other party will be permitted to avoid his own promise. Steele v. Drummond, \n275 \nU.S. 199, 205\n, 48 S. Ct. 53; Black & White Taxi Cab Co. v. B. & Y. Taxi Co., \n276 \nU.S. 518, 528\n, 48 S. Ct. 404, 57 A. L. R. 426; Holman v. Johnson, Cowp. 341, 343.\n In determining whether the contract here in question contravenes the public policy of Arkansas, the Constitution, laws, and judicial decisions of that state, and as well the applicable principles of the common law, are to be considered. Primarily it is for the lawmakers to determine the public policy of the stat. Ke llogg v. Larkin, 3 Pin. (Wis.) 123, 136, 56 Am. Dec. 164; Buck v. Walter, 115 Minn. 239, 244, 132 N. W. 205, Ann.

St. Rep. 319. The Constitution of Arkansas (article 2,  19) declares: 'Perpetuities and monopolies are contrary to the genius of a republic, and shall not be allowed. ...' This provision is a restraint upon the state Legislature. Cap. F. Bourland Ice Co. v. Franklin Utilities Co., 180 Ark. 770, 22 S.W.(2d) 993, 68 A. L. R. 1018. No question of perpetuity is presented. And it is not shown that this contract was made as a part of a plan to create a monopoly or restrain trade or that it infringes any statute or regulation made under the authority of the state. Cf. sections 7368, 7373, Crawford & Moses' Digest.\n We need not pause to determine whether the pipe line company was bound by franchise, statute, or regulation to construct the additional pipe line demanded by the glass company for the service of its plant. The court decided against the glass company's claim. The settlement of that matter and the others in controversy constituted adequate consideration for the agreement to take and pay for the gas in question. Mississippi River Logging Co. v. Robson (C. C. A.) 69 F. 773. It may not be held \n\n[283 U.S. 353, 358]\n\u00a0\n invalid, in the absence of a clear showing that some definite public detriment will probably result from its performance. Steele v. Drummond, supra, \n275 \nU.S. 305\n, 48 S. Ct. 53; Black & White Taxicab Co. v. B. & Y. Taxi Co., supra, \n276 \nU.S. 528\n, 48 S. Ct. 404, 57 A. L. R. 426; Kellogg v. Larkin, supra, 3 Pin. (Wis.) 136, 56 Am. Dec. 164.\n The contract was not arbitrarily or unfairly imposed upon the glass company. It secured the exceptional means of service which the court held the pipe line company was not bound to furnish. The contract left the glass company free to obtain its supply elsewhere, unless the pipe line company's service was adequate and bound the latter to rates-presumably just-fixed by public authority. Public utilities may enter into reasonable arrangements with their customers when warranted by special circumstances. Warmack v. Major Stave Co., 132 Ark. 173, 178, 200 S. W. 799; Hartford Ins. Co. v. Chicago, etc., Railway, \n175 \nU.S. 91, 99\n, 20 S. Ct. 33; Mann v. Pere Marquette R. Co., 135 Mich. 210, 218, 97 N. W. 721. It is not suggested that, when there is taken into account the gas made available by the wells brought in after the glass company's suit was commenced, the performance of the contract by the pipe line company leaves it without sufficient gas adequately to supply its other customers or interferes with the proper discharge of any of its duties as a public utility. The contract does not subject the glass company to, or tend in any manner to impose upon the public, any wrong, disadvantage, or evil attributable to monopoly or restraint of trade.\n The glass company has failed to show that the contract has any tendency to injury the public, and no reason appears why it should not be enforced according to its terms. The decision of the District Court is in principle strongly supported by the Supreme Court of Arkansas in Ft. Smith Light & Traction Co. v. Kelley, 94 Ark. 461, 127 S. W. 975. And see Kimbro v.

C., for the United States.\n Emily Marx, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is ruled by the decision just announced in United States v. Macintosh, \n283 \nU.S. 605\n, 51 S. Ct. 570\n\n\n The respondent, an applicant for citizenship, was a native of Canada and came to the United States in 1914. She had duly declared her intention to become a citizen. She refused to take the oath of allegiance prescribed by the statute to defend the Constitution and laws of the United States against all enemies, etc., except with the written interpolation of the words, 'as far as my conscience as a Christian will allow.' It is unnecessary to review her testimony. The only difference between the position she took, and that taken by the respondent in the Macintosh Case, is that, in addition to refusing positively to bear rms in defense of the United States under any \n\n[283 U.S. 636, 637]\n\u00a0\n circumstances, she required an actual amendment of the oath as already stated, instead of reserving the point by parol. As we said in the Macintosh Case, this is a circumstance which has no distinguishing effect. The substance of the oath has been definitely prescribed by Congress. The words of the statute do not admit of the qualification upon which the applicant insists. For the court to allow it to be made is to amend the act and thereby usurp the power of legislation vested in another department of the government.\n The examiner reported against the applicant, and the court of first instance, after a full hearing, denied the application. We think its decree was right.\n The decree of the Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES, dissenting.\n What I have said in the case of United States v. Macintosh, \n283 U.S. 605\n 51 S. Ct. 570, with respect to the interpretation of the provisions of the Naturalization Act and of the prescribed oath, I think applies also to this case. The petitioner is a nurse who spent nine months in the service of our government in France, nursing United States soldiers and aiding in psychiatric work. She has religious scruples against bearing arms. I think that it sufficiently appears that her unwillingness to take the oath was merely because of the interpretation that had been placed upon it as amounting to a promise that she would bear arms despite her religious convictions. It was the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the appellant may properly take the oath according to its true significance and should be permitted to take it. 42 F.(2d) 842, 844, 845.

Following long years of receivership with annual operating deficits there had been in 1915 a reorganization in which $35,000,000 in stocks and $14,500,000 in bonds were wiped out. Compare Valuation of Atlanta, Birmingham \n\n[282 U.S. 522, 525]\n\u00a0\n & Atlantic R. R. Co., 75 I. C. C. 645, 703. By the reorganization of 1926, $ 30,000,000 more of stock was wiped out and the holders of the $8,600,000 bonds then outstanding received for them only 60 per cent. of their face value in 5 per cent. preferred stock of the new company. The 1926 reorganization was effected pursuant to an agreement between the bondholders' committee and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, under which the committee purchased at foreclosure sale all the property; transferred the same to the new company in exchange for all of its stock, being $5,180, 344.07 redeemable preferred and 150,000 shares nopar common; transferred the common stock to the Atlantic Coast Line in consideration of its extinguishing the prior liens on the property, aggregating $4,080,699.80, and guaranteeing the preferred stock; and distributed the preferred stock among the bondholders. Thus, the Atlantic Coast Line acquired, for $4,080, 699.80 in cash and its guaranty of the preferred stock, complete ownership of the property subject only to the $5,180,344.07 redeemable preferred stock. These two sums aggregate $9,261,043.87-the sum set forth in the passage of the report of October 9, 1929, which is challenged as an order.\n The order of the Comis sion dated December 21, 1926, which authorized the new company to issue the preferred and common stock (117 I. C. C. 181, 439, 443), and thus made possible the 1926 reorganization, contained this provision:\n'Provided, however, that authority to issue said stock is granted upon the express condition, that, for the purposes of the accounting, as provided in the classification of investment in road and equipment in the text of account 41, 'Cost of road purchased,' the cash value of the preferred stock issued must, in stating the transactions in the accounts, be reckoned on a basis not in excess of its \n\n[282 U.S. 522, 526]\n\u00a0\n par value; and that the cash value of the common stock issued must be reckoned on a basis not in excess of the amount received therefor.' \n1\n 117 I. C. C. 443.\n\n When the books of the new company were being opened, its accountants sought to set up in its balance sheet as 'Investment in road and equipment' the sum of $29,271,859 instead of the $9,261,043.87 above shown. The larger entry was contended for on the grounds that this amount (with adjustments) had, on July 20, 1923, been determined by the Commission pursuant to section 19a of the Act of March 1, 1913, c. 92, 37 Stat. 701 ( 49 USCA  19a), to be the value of the property for rate-making purposes, estimated on the basis of 1914 reproduction costs. 75 I. C. C. 645. The Director of the Bureau of Accounts refused to permit the company to set up the investment of road and equipment as being $29,271,859. Treating the preferred stock as having been paid for at par, he directed that the value of the 150,000 shares of common stock should be set up at $4,080,699.80, that being the sum of money \n\n[282 U.S. 522, 527]\n\u00a0\n which the Atlantic Coast Line had disbursed in extinguishing the prior liens upon the property.\n The new company then filed an application with the Commission requesting a hearing in support of its contention that the above quoted proviso in the order of December 21, 1926, authorized such entry of $29, 271,859; and requested that oral argument be permitted. Without hearing oral argument, the Commission denied the application on April 9, 1928. The original bill in this suit was then brought to set that order aside. The court granted the relief and directed that the company's application 'stand for further hearing before said commission.' Atlanta, Birmingham & Coast R. R. Co. v. United States (D. C.) 28 F.(2d) 885. The Commission granted the further hearing and thereupon, on October 9, 1929, filed the report first cited. In it, the Commission stated that the value of the property for rate-making purposes fixed in 1923, pursuant to section 19a, is not 'pertinent or material evidence in the determination of investment, as that term is used in our accounting regulations.' The report concluded with the passage quoted which appellee contends amounts to an order. 158 I. C.C. 6, 14.\n First. The jurisdiction conferred upon district courts under the Urgent Deficiencies Act is that formerly exercised by the Commerce Court over 'cases brought to enjoin, set aside, annual, or suspend in whole or in part any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.' Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309,  1, 36 Stat. 539 (28 USCA  41(28)). The action here complained of is not in form an order. It is a part of a report-an opinion as distinguished from a mandate. The distinction between a report and an order has been observed in the practice of the Commission ever since its organization-and for compelling reasons. Its functions are manifold in character. In some matters its duty is merely to investigate and to report facts. See United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake R. R. Co., \n273 \nU.S. 299, 310\n, 47 S. Ct. 413. In others, to make determinations. See Great \n\n[282 U.S. 522, 528]\n\u00a0\n Northern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 172\n, 48 S. Ct. 466. In some, it acts in an advisory capacity. Compare Minneapolis & St. Louis R. R. Co. v. Peoria & Pekin Union Ry. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 580, 584\n, 585 S., 46 S. Ct. 402. In others in a supervisory. Even in the regulation of rates, as to which the Commission possesses mandatory power, it frequently seeks to secure the desired action without issuing a command. In such cases it customarily points out in its report what the carriers are expected to do.2 Such action is directory as distinguished from mandatory. No case has been found in which matter embodied in a report and not followed by a formal order has been held to be subject to judicial review. \n3\n In Kansas City Southern Ry. v. United States, \n\n[282 U.S. 522, 529]\n\u00a0\n \n231 \nU.S. 423\n, 34 S. Ct. 125, 52 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1, the accounting regulations which were challenged had been adopted by formal order of the Commission. Compare Interstate Commerce Commission v. Goodrich Transit Co., \n224 \nU.S. 194\n, 32 S. Ct. 436. There are many cases in which action of the Commission although embodied in the form of an order, has been held by the Court not to be reviewable under the Urgent Deficiencies Act. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n As the District Court said in passing upon the original bill now relied upon: 'Independently of the Commission's power under section 20, subsection 1 and subsection 5 (49 USCA  20(1, 5), to establish uniformity in and prescribe the forms of accounts of carriers, section 1, subdivision 20 (49 USCA  1(20), authorizes the imposition of conditions upon its grant of a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the acquisition and operation of a railroad, and by necessary implication it has power to see that the condition is complied with. Disobedience to an order made to this end touching the accounts would be punishable under section 20, subsection 7 (49 USCA  20(7)), of the act as a willful failure to make a correct entry and the keeping of a record other than that approved by the Commission.' 28 F.(2d) 885, 887. The basis for such a liability should be certain. Compare United States v. Fruit Growers' Express Co., \n279 \nU.S. 363, 369\n, 49 S. Ct. 374.\n Second. In support of the contention that the passage in the report of the Commission of October 9, 1929, is legally an order, the company insist that it must be \n\n[282 U.S. 522, 530]\n\u00a0\n read in connection not only with the action of April 9, 1928, attacked by the original bill, but also with the certificate of public necessity and convenience dated October 26, 1926, authorizing the new company to acquire the property, and the order of December 21, 1926, authorizing the issue of the $5,180,344.07 preferred stock and 150,000 shares of nopar common. Neither the original bill nor the supplemental bill attacks either the certificate or the order of December 21st. The validity of the certificate and of that order is not now challenged. Moreover, the record discloses that the certificate and the order have been acted upon by the acquisition of the property and issue of the stock.\n Third. The company contends that the decree of the District Court on the original bill, in which the defendants acquiesced, is a final adjudication of the issues involved in this case. The original bill dealt with the order of April 9, 1928; the supplemental bill with the alleged order of October 9, 1929. The Commission insists that the decree on the original bill did not deal with the merits, but determined only that the company must be accorded a hearing on its application. We need not determine whether jurisdiction existed to review the action of April 9, 1928, or the scope of the issues litigated in the original suit. For a finding of jurisdiction to review that order, or acquiescence by the defendants in the decree rendered on the original bill, would not have made res judicata the question whether jurisdiction existed to review the later action of October 9, 1929. Compare Cromwell v. County of Sac, \n94 U.S. 351\n. Pell v. McCabe, \n250 \nU.S. 573, 577\n, 40 S. Ct. 43. The lack of power to review, because of the absence of any order, cannot be cured by bringing the suit in the form of a supplemental rather than a new bill. Jurisdiction is equally lacking in either case.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The classification of primary accounts referred to as Account 41, 'Cost of Road Purchased' prescribes:\n'This account shall include the cash cost of any road or portion thereof purchased.

When the car service rule discussed in United States v. New River Co., \n265 \nU.S. 533\n, 44 S. Ct. 610, 611, was first before the Commission, its report finding the rule unreasonable concluded with the statement: 'We have not required that car service rules be filed as tariff schedule. We will not in this proceeding direct that the rules which we herein find to be reasonable be so filed. We shall expect, however, that defendants will promptly amend their car service rules so as to conform with our findings and evidence same by filing copies thereof with us.' Referring to this statement, this Court said (page 540, 541 of 265 U. S., 44 S. Ct. 610, 612): 'The Commission refrained from making an order that the rule be filed as a tariff schedule, but announced that it expected the carriers promptly to amend their car service rules to conform with its findings.'

He came to the United States in 1916, and in 1925 declared his intention to become a citizen. His petition for naturalization was presented to the federal District Court for Connecticut, and that court, after hearing and consideration, denied the application upon the ground that, since petitioner would not promise in advance to bear arms in defense of the United States unless he believed the war to be morally justified, he was not attached to the principles of the Constitution. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree and directed the District Court to admit respondent to citizenship. 42 F.(2d) 845.\n The Naturalization Act,  4, c. 3592, 34 Stat. 596 (U. S. C. title 8 ,  372 et seq. (8 USCA  372 et seq.)), provides that an alien may be admitted to citizenship in the manner therein provided and not otherwise. By section 3 of the same act, jurisdiction to naturalize aliens is conferred upon the District Courts of the United States and other enumerated courts of record. U. S. C. title 8,  357 (8 USCA  357). The applicant is required to make \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 614]\n\u00a0\n and file a preliminary declaration in writing setting forth, among other things, his intention to become a citizen of the United States and to renounce all allegiance to any foreign prince, etc. Section 4 of the act ( U. S. C. title 8,  381, 382 (8 USCA  381, 382)) provides:\n'Third. He shall, before he is admitted to citizenship, declare on oath in open court that he will support the Constitution of the United States, and that he absolutely and entirely renounces and ajure  all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, and particularly by name to the prince, potentate, state or sovereignty of which he was before a citizen or subject; that he will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and bear true faith and allegiance to the same.\n\n'Fourth. It shall be made to appear to the satisfaction of the court admitting any alien to citizenship that immediately preceding the date of his application he has resided continuously within the United States, five years at least, and within the State or Territory where such court is at the time held one year at least, and that during that time he has behaved as a man of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same. In addition to the oath of the applicant, the testimony of at least two witnesses, citizens of the United States, as to the facts of residence, moral character, and attachment to the principles of the Constitution shall be required. ...'\n\n Section 9 of the act, 34 Stat. 599 (U. S. C. title 8,  398 (8 USCA  398)), requires that every final hearing upon a petition for naturalization shall be had in open court; that every final order upon the petition shall be under the hand of the court; and that 'upon such final hearing of such petition the applicant and witnesses shall be examined under \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 615]\n\u00a0\n oath before the court and in the presence of the court.' By section 11, 34 Stat. 599 (U. S. C. title 8,  399 (8 USCA  399), it is provided that the United States shall have the right to appear in the proceeding for the purpose of cross-examining the petitioner and witnesses produced in support of the petition 'concerning any matter touching or in any way affecting his right to admission to citizenship, and shall have the right to call witnesses, produce evidence, and be heard in opposition to the granting of any petition in naturalization proceedings.'\n By the petition for naturalization, a case is presented for the exercise of the judicial power under the Constitution, to which the United States is a proper, and always a possible, adverse party. Tutum v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 568, 576\n, 577 S., 46 S. Ct. 425.\n Naturalization is a privilege, to be given, qualified, or withheld as Congress may determine, and which the alien may claim as of right only upon compliance with the terms which Congress imposes. That Congress regarded the admission to citizenship as a serious matter is apparent from the conditions and precautions with which it carefully surrounded the subject. Thus, among other provisions, it is required that the applicant not only shall reside continuously within the United States for a period of at least five years immediately preceding his application, but shall make a preliminary declaration of his intention to become a citizen at least two years prior to his admission. He must produce the testimony of witnesses as to the facts of residence, moral character, and attachment to the principles of the Constitution, and in open court take an oath renouncing his former allegiance and pleading future allegiance to the United States. At the final hearing in open court, he and his witnesses must be examined under oath, and the government may appear for the purpose of cross-examining in respect of 'any matter touching or in any way affecting his right to \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 616]\n\u00a0\n admission,' introduce countervailing evidence, and be heard in opposition.\n In specifically requiring that the court shall be satisfied that the applicant, during his residence in the United States, has behaved as a man of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, etc., it is obvious that Congress regarded the fact of good character and the fact of attachment to the principles of the Constitution as matters of the first importance. The applicant' beh avior is significant to the extent that it tends to establish or negative these facts.\n But proof of good behavior does not close the inquiry. Why does the statute require examination of the applicant and witnesses in open court and under oath, and for what purpose is the government authorized to cross- examine concerning any matter touching or in any way affecting the right of naturalization? Clearly, it would seem, in order that the court and the government, whose power and duty in that respect these provisions take for granted, may discover whether the applicant is fitted for citizenship-and to that end, by actual inquiry, ascertain, among other things, whether he has intelligence and good character; whether his oath to support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States, and to bear true faith and allegiance to the same, will be taken without mental reservation or purpose inconsistent therewith; whether his views are compatible with the obligations and duties of American citizenship; whether he will upon his own part observe the laws of the land; whether he is willing to support the government in time of war, as well as in time of peace, and to assist in the defense of the country, not to the extent or in the manner that he may choose, but to such extent and in such manner as he lawfully may be required to do. These, at least, are matters which are of the essence of the statutory requirements, and in respect of which the mind and conscience of the applicant \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 617]\n\u00a0\n may be probed by pertinent inquiries, as fully as the court, in the exercise of a sound discretion, may conclude is necessary.\n The settled practice of the courts having jurisdiction in naturalization proceedings has, from the beginning, been in accordance with this view. In re Bodek (C. C.) 63 F. 813; In re Meakins (D. C.) 164 F. 334; In re Mudarri (C. C.) 176 F. 465, 466; In re Ross (C. C.) 188 F. 685; United States v. Bressi (D. C.) 208 F. 369, 372; Schurmann v. United States (C. C. A.) 264 F. 917, 920, 18 A. L. R. 1182; In re Sigelman (D. C.) 268 F. 217. And it finds support in the decisions of this court. As early as 1830, in Spratt v. Spratt, 4 Pet. 393, 407, Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the court, said:\n'The various acts upon the subject submit the decision on the right of aliens to admission as citizens to courts of record. They are to receive testimony, to compare it with the law, and to judge on both law and fact.' United States v. Schwimmer, \n279 \nU.S. 644, 649\n, 49 S. Ct. 448.\n\n With the foregoing statutory provisions and the scope of the powers and duties of the courts of first instance in respect thereof in mind, we come to a consideration of the case now before us. The applicant had complied with all the formal requirements of the law, and his personal character and conduct were shown to be good in all respects. His right to naturalization turns altogether upon the effect to be given to certain answers and qualifying statements made in response to interrogatories propounded to him.\n Upon the preliminary form for petition for naturalization, the following questions, among others, appear: '20. Have you read the following oath of allegiance? (which is then quoted). Are you willing to take this oath in becoming a citizen?' '22. If necessary, are you willing to take up arms in defense of this country?' In response to the questions designated 20, he answered 'Yes.' In response to the question designated 22, he answered, 'Yes; but I should want to be free to judge of the neces- \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 618]\n\u00a0\n sity.' By a written memorandum subsequently filed, he amplified these answers as follows:\n'20 and 22. I am willing to do what I judge to be in the best interests of my country, but only in so far as I can believe that this is not going to be against the best interests of humanity in the long run. I do not undertake to support 'my country, right or wrong' in any dispute which may arise, and I am not willing to promise beforehand, and without knowing the cause for which my country may go to war, either that I will or that I will not 'take up arms in defense of this country,' however 'necessary' the war may seem to be to the Government of the day.\n\n'It is only in a sense consistent with these statements that I am willing to promise to 'support and defend' the Government of the United States 'against all enemies, foreign and domestic.' But, just because I am not certain that the language of questions 20 and 22 will bear the construction I should have to put upon it in order to be able to answer them in the affirmative, I have to say that I do not know that I can say 'Yes' in answer to these two questions.'\n\n Upon the hearing before the District Court on the petition, he explained his position more in detail. He said that he was not a pacifist; that, if allowed to interpret the oath for himself, he would interpret it as not inconsistent with his position and would take it. He then proceeded to say that he would answer question 22 in the affirmative only on the understanding that he would have to believe that the war was morally justified before he would take up arms in it or give it his moral support. He was ready to give to the United States all the allegiance he ever had given or ever could give to any country, but he could not put allegiance to the government of any country before allegiance to the will of God. He did not anticipate engaging in any propaganda against the prosecution of a war which the \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 619]\n\u00a0\n government had already declared and which it considered to be justified; but he preferred not to make any absolute promise at the time of the hearing, because of his ignorance of all the circumstances which might affect his judgment with reference to such a war. He did not question that the government under certain conditions could regulate and restrain the conduct of the individual citizen, even to the extent of imprisonment. He recognized the principle of the submission of the individual citizen to the opinion of the majority in a democratic country; but he did not believe in having his own moral problems solved for him by the majority. The position thus taken was the only one he could take consistently with his moral principles and with what he understood to be the moral principles of Christianity. He recognized, in short, the right of the government to restrain the freedom of the individual for the good of the social whole; but was convinced, on the other hand, that the individual citizen should have the right respectfully to withhold from the government military services (involving, as they probably would, the taking of human life), when his best moral judgment would compel him to do so. He was willing to support his country, even to the extent of bearing arms, if asked to do so by the government, in any war which he could regard as morally justified.\n There is more to the same effect, but the foregoing is sufficient to make plain his position.\n These statements of the applicant fairly disclose that he is unwilling to take the oath of allegiance, except with these important qualifications: That he will do what he judges to be in the best interests of the country only in so far as he believes it will not be against the best interests of humanity in the long run; that he will not assist in the defense of the country by force of arms or give any war his moral support unless he believes it to be morally justified, however necessary the war might \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 620]\n\u00a0\n seem to the government of the day; that he will hold himself free to judge of the morality and necessity of the war, and, while he does not anticipate engaging in propaganda against the prosecution of a war declared and considered justified by the government, he prefers to make no promise even as to that; and that he is convinced that the individual citizen should have the right to withhold his military services when his best moral judgment impels him to do so.\n Thus stated, the case is ruled in principle by United States v. Schwimmer, supra. In that case the applicant, a woan, testified that she would not take up arms in defense of the country. She was willing to be treated on the basis of a conscientious objector who refused to take up arms in the recent war, and seemed to regard herself as belonging in that class. She was an uncompromising pacifist, with no sense of nationalism, and only a cosmic sense of belonging to the human family. Her objection to military service, we concluded, rested upon reasons other than her inability to bear arms because of sex or age; and we held that her application for naturalization should be denied upon the ground, primarily, that she failed to sustain the burden of showing that she did not oppose the principle making it a duty of citizens, by force of arms when necessary, to defend their country against its enemies. At page 650 of 279 U. S., 49 S. Ct. 448, 450, we said:\n'That it is the duty of citizens by force of arms to defend our government against all enemies whenever necessity arises is a fundamental principle of the Constitution.\n\n'The common defense was one of the purposes for which the people ordained and established the Constitution. ... We need not refer to the numerous statutes that contemplate defense of the United States, its Constitution and laws, by armed citizens. This court, in the Selective Draft Law Cases, \n245 U.S. 366\n, page 378, 38 S. Ct. 159, 161, L. R. A. 1918C, 361, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 856, speaking through Chief Justice White, said that 'the very concep- \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 621]\n\u00a0\n tion of a just government and its duty to the citizen includes the reciprocal obligation of the citizen to render military service in case of need. ...'\n\n'Whatever tends to lessen the willingness of citizens to discharge their duty to bear arms in the country's defense detracts from the strength and safety of the government. And their opinions and beliefs as well as their behavior indicating a disposition to hinder in the performance of that duty are subjects of inquiry under the statutory provisions governing naturalization and are of vital importance, for if all or a large number of citizens oppose such defense the 'good order and happiness' of the United States cannot long endure. And it is evident that the views of applicants for naturalization in respect of such matters may not be disregarded. The influence of conscientious objectors against the use of military force in defense of the principles of our government is apt to be more detrimental than their mere refusal to bear arms. The fact that, by reason of sex, age or other cause, they may be unfit to serve does not lessen their purpose or power to influence others. It is clear from her own statements that the declared opinions of respondent as to armed defense by citizens against enemies of the country were directly pertinent to the investigation of her application.'\n\n And see In re Roeper (D. C.) 274 F. 490; Clarke's Case, 301 Pa. 321, 152 A. 92.\n There are few finer or more exalted sentiments than that which finds expression in opposition to war. Peace is a sweet and holy thing, and war is a hateful and an abominable thing, to be avoided by any sacrifice or concession that a free people can make. But thus far mankind has been unable to devise any method of indefinitely prolonging the one or of entirely abolishing the other; and, unfortunately, there is nothing which seems to afford \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 622]\n\u00a0\n positive ground for thinking that the near future will witness the beginning of the reign of perpetual peace for which good men and women everywhere never cease to pray. The Constitution, therefore, wisely contemplating the ever-present possibility of war, declares that one of its purposes is to 'provide for the common defense.' In express terms Congress is empowered 'to declare war,' which necessarily connotes the plenary power to wage war with all the force necessary to make it effective; and 'to raise ... armies' (Const. art. 1,  8, subds. 11, 12), which necessarily connotes the like power to say who shall serve in them and in what way.\n Fro its very nature the war power, when necessity calls for its exercise, tolerates no qualifications or limitations, unless found in the Constitution or in applicable principles of international law. In the words of John Quincy Adams, 'This power is tremendous; it is strictly constitutional; but it breaks down every barrier so anxiously erected for the protection of liberty, property and of life.' To the end that war may not result in defeat, freedom of speech may, by act of Congress, be curtailed or denied so that the morale of the people and the spirit of the army may not be broken by seditious utterances; freedom of the press curtailed to preserve our military plans and movements from the knowledge of the enemy; deserters and spies put to death without indictment or trial by jury; ships and supplies requisitioned; property of alien enemies, theretofore under the protection of the Constitution, seized without process and converted to the public use without compensation and without due process of law in the ordinary sense of that term; prices of food and other necessities of life fixed or regulated; railways taken over and operated by the government; and other drastic powers, wholly inadmissible in time of peace, exercised to meet the emergencies of war. \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 623]\n\u00a0\n These are but illustrations of the breadth of the power; and it necessarily results from their consideration that whether any citizen shall be exempt from serving in the armed forces of the nation in time of war is dependent upon the will of Congress and not upon the scruples of the individual, except as Congress provides. That body, thus far, has seen fit, by express enactment, to relieve from the obligation of armed service those persons who belong to the class known as conscientious objectors; and this policy is of such long standing that it is thought by some to be beyond the possibility of alteration. Indeed, it seems to be assumed in this case that the privilege is one that Congress itself is powerless to take away. Thus it is said in the carefully prepared brief of respondent:\n'To demand from an alien who desires to be naturalized an unqualified promise to bear arms in every war that may be declared, despite the fact that he may have conscientious religious scruples against doing so in some hypothetical future war, would mean that such an alien would come into our citizenry on an unequal footing with the native born, and that he would be forced, as the price of citizenship, to forego a privilege enjoyed by others. That is the manifest result of the fixed principle of our Constitution, zealously guarded by our laws, that a citizen cannot be forced and need not bear arms in a war if he has conscientious religious scruples against doing so.'\n\n This, if it means what it seems to say, is an astonishing statement. Of course, there is no such principle of the Constitution, fixed or otherwise. The conscientious objector is relieved from the obligation to bear arms in obedience to no constitutional provision, express or implied; but because, and only because, it has accorded with the policy of Congress thus to relieve him. The \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 624]\n\u00a0\n alien, when he becomes a naturalized citizen, acquires, with one exception, every right possessed under the Constitution by those citizens who are native-born (Luria v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 9, 22\n, 34 S. Ct. 10); but he acquires no more. The privilege of the native-born conscientious objector to avoid bearing arms comes, not from the Constitution, but from the acts of Congress. That body may grant or withhold the exemption as in its wisdom it sees fit; and, if it be withheld, the native-born conscientious objector cannot successfully assert the privilege. No other conclusion is compatible with the well-nigh limitless extent of the war powers as above illustrated, which include, by necessary implication, the power, in the last extremity, to compel the armed service of any citizen in the land, without regard to his objections or his views in respect of the jutice or morality of the particular war or of war in general. In Jacobson v. Massachusetts, \n197 \nU.S. 11, 29\n, 25 S. Ct. 358, 362, 3 Ann. Cas. 765, this court, speaking of the liberties guaranteed to the individual by the Fourteenth Amendment, said:\n'... And yet he may be compelled, by force if need be, against his will and without regard to his personal wishes or his pecuniary interests, or even his religious or political convictions, to take his place in the ranks of the army of his country, and risk the chance of being shot down in its defense.'\n\n The applicant for naturalization here is unwilling to become a citizen with this understanding. He is unwilling to leave the question of his future military service to the wisdom of Congress, where it belongs, and where every native-born or admitted citizen is obliged to leave it. In effect, he offers to take the oath of allegiance only with the qualification that the question whether the war is necessary or morally justified must, so far as his support is concerned, be conclusively determined by reference to his opinion. \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 625]\n\u00a0\n When he speaks of putting his allegiance to the will of God above his allegiance to the government, it is evident, in the light of his entire statement, that he means to make his own interpretation of the will of God the decisive test which shall conclude the government and stay its hand. We are a Christian people (Holy Trinity Church v. United States. \n143 \nU.S. 457, 470\n, 471 S., 12 S. Ct. 511), according to one another the equal right of religious freedom, and acknowledging with reverence the duty of obedience to the will of God. But, also, we are a nation with the duty to survive; a nation whose Constitution contemplates war as well as peace; whose government must go forward upon the assumption, and safely can proceed upon no other, that unqualified allegiance to the nation and submission and obedience to the laws of the land, as well those made for war as those made for peace, are not inconsistent with the will of God.\n The applicant here rejects that view. He is unwilling to rely, as every native-born citizen is obliged to do, upon the probable continuance by Congress of the long-established and approved practice of exempting the honest conscientious objector, while at the same time asserting his willingness to conform to whatever the future law constitutionally shall require of him; but discloses a present and fixed purpose to refuse to give his moral or armed support to any future war in which the country may be actually engaged, if, in his opinion, the war is not morally justified. the opinion of the nation as expressed by Congress to the contrary notwithstanding.\n If the attitude of this claimant, as shown by his statements and the inferences properly to be deduced from them, be held immaterial to the question of his fitness for admission to citizenship, where shall the line be drawn? Upon what ground of distinction may be hereafter reject another applicant who shall express his willingness to re- \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 626]\n\u00a0\n spect any particular principle of the Constitution or obey any future statute only upon the condition that he shall entertain the opinion that it is morally justified? The applicant's attitude, in effect, is a refusal to take the oath of allegiance except in an altered form. The qualifications upon which he insists, it is true, are made by parol and not by way of written amendment to the oath; but the substance is the same.\n It is not within the province of the courts to make bargains with those who seek naturalization. They must accept the grant and take the oath in accordance with the terms fixed by the law, or forego the privilege of citizenship. There is no middle choice. If one qualification of the oath be allowed, the door is opened for others, with utter confusion as the probable final result. As this Court said in United States v. Manzi, \n276 \nU.S. 463, 467\n, 48 S. Ct. 328, 329:\n'Citizenship is a high privilege, and when douts e xist concerning a grant of it, generally at least, they should be resolved in favor of the United States and against the claimant.'\n\n The Naturalization Act is to be construed 'with definite purpose to favor and support the government,' and the United States is entitled to the benefit of any doubt which remains in the mind of the court as to any essential matter of fact. The burden was upon the applicant to show that his views were not opposed to 'the principle that it is a duty of citizenship by force of arms when necessary to defend the country against all enemies, and that (his) opinions and beliefs would not prevent or impair the true faith and allegiance required by the act.' United States v. Schwimmer, supra, \n279 \nU.S. 649, 650\n, 653 S., 49 S. Ct. 448, 449. We are of opinion that he did not meet this requirement. The examiner and the court of first instance who heard and weighed the evidence and saw the applicant and witnesses so concluded. That conclusion, if we were in \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 627]\n\u00a0\n doubt, would not be rejected except for good and persuasive reasons, which we are unable to find.\n The decree of the Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES, dissenting.\n I am unable to agree with the judgment in this case. It is important to note the precise question to be determined. It is solely one of law, as there is no controversy as to the facts. The question is not whether naturalization is a privilege to be granted or withheld. That it is such a privilege is undisputed. Nor, whether the Congress has the power to fix the conditions upon which the privilege is granted. That power is assumed. Nor, whether the Congress may in its discretion compel service in the army in time of war or punish the refusal to serve. That power is not here in dispute. Nor is the question one of the authority of Congress to exact a promise to bear arms as a condition of its grant of naturalization. That authority, for the present purpose, may also be assumed.\n The question before the Court is the narrower one whether the Congress has exacted such a promise. That the Congress has not made such an express requirement is apparent. The question is whether that exaction is to be implied from certain general words which do not, as it seems to me, either literally or historically, demand the implication. I think that the requirement should not be implied, because such a construction is directly opposed to the spirit of our institutions and to the historic practice of the Congress. It must be conceded that departmental zeal may not be permitted to outrun the authority conferred by statute. If such a promise is to be demanded, contrary to principles which have been respected as fundamental, the Congress should exact it in unequivocal \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 628]\n\u00a0\n terms, and we should not, by judicial decision, attempt to perform what, as I see it, is a legislative function.\n In examining the requirements for naturalization, we find that the Congress has expressly laid down certain rules which concern the opinions and conduct of the applicant. Thus it is provided that no person shall be naturalized 'who disbelieves in or who is opposed to organized government, or who is a member of or affiliated with any organization entertaining and teaching such disbelief in or opposition to organized government, or who advocates or teaches the duty, necessity, or propriety of the unlawful assaulting or killing of any officer or officers, either of specific individuals or of officers generally, of the Government of the United States, or of any other organized government, because of his or their official character, or who is a polygamist.' Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3592 ,  7, 34 Stat. 596, 598, U. S. C., tit. 8,  364 (8 USCA  364). The respondent, Douglas Clyde Macintosh, entertained none of these disqualifying opinions and had none of the associations or relations disapproved. Among the specific requirements as to beliefs, we find none to the effect that one shall not be naturalized if b rea son of his religious convictions he is opposed to war or is unwilling to promise to bear arms. In view of the questions which have repeatedly been brought to the attention of the Congress in relation to such beliefs, and having regard to the action of the Congress when its decision was of immediate importance in the raising of armies, the omission of such an express requirement from the naturalization statute is highly significant.\n Putting aside these specific requirements as fully satisfied, we come to the general conditions imposed by the statute. We find one as to good behavior during the specified period of residence preceding application. No applicant could appear to be more exemplary than Macintosh. A Canadian by birth, he first came to the United \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 629]\n\u00a0\n States as a graduate student at the University of Chicago, and in 1907 he was ordained as a Baptist minister. In 1909 he began to teach in Yale University and is now a member of the faculty of the Divinity School, Chaplain of the Yale Graduate School, and Dwight Professor of Theology. After the outbreak of the Great War, he voluntarily sought appointment as a chaplain with the Canadian Army and as such saw service at the front. Returning to this country, he made public addresses in 1917 in support of the Allies. In 1918, he went again to France, where he had charge of an American Y. M. C. A. hut at the front until the armistice, when he resumed his duties at Yale University. It seems to me that the applicant has shown himself in his behavior and character to be highly desirable as a citizen, and, if such a man is to be excluded from naturalization, I think the disqualification should be found in unambiguous terms and not in an implication which shuts him out and gives admission to a host far less worthy.\n The principal ground for exclusion appears to relate to the terms of the oath which the applicant must take. It should be observed that the respondent was willing to take the oath, and he so stated in his petition. But, in response to further inquiries, he explained that he was not willing 'to promise beforehand' to take up arms, 'without knowing the cause for which my country may go to war,' and that 'he would have to believe that the war was morally justified.' He declared that 'his first allegiance was to the will of God'; that he was ready to give to the United States 'all the allegiance he ever had given or ever could give to any country, but that he could not put allegiance to the government of any country before allegiance to the will of God.' The question then is whether the terms of the oath are to be taken as necessarily implying an assurance of willingness to bear arms, so that one whose conscientious convictions or belief of su- \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 630]\n\u00a0\n preme allegiance to the will of God will not permit him to make such an absolute promise cannot take the oath and hence is disqualified for admission to citizenship.\n The statutory provision as to the oath which is said to require this promise is this: 'That he will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and bear true faith and allegiance to the same.' Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3592 ,  4, 34 Stat. 596, 598; U. S. C. tit. 8,  381 (8 USCA  381). That these general words have not been regarded as implying a promise to bear arms notwithstanding religious or conscientious scruples, or as requiring one to promise to put allegiance to temporal power above what is sincerely believed to be one's duty of obedience to God, is apparent, I think, from a consideration of their history. This oath does not stand alone. It is the same oath in substance that is required by act of Congress of Civil officers generally (except the President, whose oath is prescribed by the Constitution). The Congress, in prescribing such an oath for civil officers, acts under article 6,  3, of the Constitution, which provides: 'The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatres, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.' The general oath of office, in the form which has been prescribed by the Congress for over sixty years, contains the provision 'that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.' Rev. St.  1757 (U. S. C. tit. 5,  16 (5 USCA  16)). It goes without \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 631]\n\u00a0\n saying that it was not the intention of the Congress in framing the oath to impose any religious test. When we consider the history of the struggle for religious liberty, the large number of citizens of our country from the very beginning who have been unwilling to sacrifice their religious convictions, and, in particular, those who have been conscientiously opposed to war and who would not yield what they sincerely believed to be their allegiance to the will of God, I find it impossible to conclude that such persons are to be deemed disqualified for public office in this country because of the requirement of the oath which must be taken before they enter upon their duties. The terms of the promise 'to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic,' are not, I think, to be read as demanding any such result. There are other and most important methods of defense, even in time of war, apart from the personal bearing of arms. We have but to consider the defense given to our country in the late war, both in industry and in the field, by workers of all sorts, by engineers, nurses, doctors and chaplains, to realize that there is opportunity even at such a time for essential service in the activities of defense which do not require the overriding of such religious scruples. I think that the requirement of the oath of office should be read in the light of our regard from the beginning for freedom of conscience. While it has always been recognized that the supreme power of government may be exerted and disobedience to its commands may be punished, we know that with many of our worthy citizens it would be a most heart-searching question if they were asked whether they would promise to obey a law believed to be in conflict with religious duty. Many of their most honored exemplars in the past have been willing to suffer imprisonment or even death rather than to make such a promise. And we also know, in particular, that a promise to engage \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 632]\n\u00a0\n in war by bearing arms, or thus to engage in a war believed to be unjust, would be contrary to the tenets of religious groups among our citizens who are of patriotic purpose and exemplary conduct. To conclude that the general oath of office is to be interpreted as disregarding the religious scruples of these citizens and as disqualifying them for office because they could not take the oath with such an interpretation would, I believe, be generally regarded as contrary not only to the specific intent of the Congress but as repugnant to the fundamental principle of representative government.\n But the naturalization oath is in substantially the same terms as the oath of office to which I have referred. I find no ground for saying that these words are to be interpreted differently in the two cases. On the contrary, when the Congress reproduced the historic words of the oath of office in the naturalization oath, I should suppose that, according to familiar rules of interpretation, they should be deemed to carry the same significance.\n The question of the proper interpretation of the oath is, as I have said, distinct from that of legislative policy in exacting military service. The latter is not dependent upon the former. But the long- established pactice of excusing from military service those whose religious convictions oppose it confirms the view that the Congress in the terms of the oath did not intend to require a promise to give such service. The policy of granting exemptions in such cases has been followed from colonial times and is abundantly shown by the provisions of colonial and state statutes, of state Constitutions, and of acts of Congress. See citations in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals in the present case. 42 F.(2d) 845, 847, 848. The first Constitution of New York, adopted in 1777, in providing for the state militia, while strongly emphasizing the duty of defense, added: 'That all such of the inhabitants of this State being of the people called Quakers \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 633]\n\u00a0\n as, from scruples of conscience, may be averse to the bearing of arms, be therefrom excused by the legislature; and to pay to the State such sums of money, in lieu of their personal service, as the same may, in the judgment of the legislature, be worth.' Article 40. A large number of similar provisions are found in other states. The importance of giving immunity to those having conscientious scruples against bearing arms has been emphasized in debates in Congress repeatedly from the very beginning of our government, and religious scruples have been recognized in draft acts. Annals of Congress (Gales), 1st Congress, vol. I, pp. 434, 436, 729, 731; vol. II, pp. 1818-1827; Acts of February 24, 1864, 13 Stat. 6, 9; January 21, 1903, 32 Stat. 775; June 3, 1916, 39 Stat. 166, 197; May 18, 1917, 40 Stat. 76, 78. I agree with the statement in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals in the present case that: 'This federal legislation is indicative of the actual operation of the principles of the Constitution, that a person with conscientious or religious scruples need not bear arms, although, as a member of society, he may be obliged to render services of a noncombatant nature.'\n Much has been said of the paramount duty to the state, a duty to be recognized, it is urged, even though it conflicts with convictions of duty to God. Undoubtedly that duty to the state exists within the domain of power, for government may enforce obedience to laws regardless of scruples. When one's belief collides with the power of the state, the latter is supreme within its sphere and submission or punishment follows. But, in the forum of conscience, duty to a moral power higher than the state has always been maintained. The reservation of that supreme obligation, as a matter of principle, would unquestionably be made by many of our conscientious and law-abiding citizens. The essence of religion is belief in a relation to God involving duties superior to those \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 634]\n\u00a0\n arising from any human relation. As was stated by Mr. Justice Field, in Davis v. Beason, \n133 \nU.S. 333, 342\n, 10 S. Ct. 299, 300: 'The term 'religion' has reference to one's views of his relations to his Creator, and to the obligations they impose of reverence for his being and character, and of obedience to his will.' One cannot speak of religious liberty, with proper appreciation of its essential and historic significance, without assuming the existence of a belief in supreme allegiance to the will of God. Professor Macintosh, when pressed by the inquiries put to him, stated what is axiomatic in religious doctrine. And, putting aside dogmas with their particular conceptions of deity, freedom of conscience itself implies respect for an innate conviction of paramount duty. The battle for religious liberty has been fought and won with respect to religious beliefs and practices, which are not in conflict with good order, upon the very ground of the supremacy of conscience within its proper field. What that field is, under our system of government, presents in part a question of constitutional law, and also, in part, one of legislative policy in avoiding unnecessary clashes with the dictates of conscience. There is abundant room for enforcing the requisite authority of law as it is enacted and requirs ob edience, and for maintaining the conception of the supremacy of law as essential to orderly government, without demanding that either citizens or applicants for citizenship shall assume by oath an obligation to regard allegiance to God as subordinate to allegiance to civil power. The attempt to exact such a promise, and thus to bind one's conscience by the taking of oaths or the submission to tests, has been the cause of many deplorable conflicts. The Congress has sought to avoid such conflicts in this country by respecting our happy tradition. In no sphere of legislation has the intention to prevent such clashes been more conspicuous than in relation to the bearing of arms. It would require strong evidence \n\n[283 U.S. 605, 635]\n\u00a0\n that the Congress intended a reversal of its policy in prescribing the general terms of the naturalization oath. I find no such evidence.\n Nor is there ground, in my opinion, for the exclusion of Professor Macintosh because his conscientious scruples have particular reference to wars believed to be unjust. There is nothing new in such an attitude. Among the most eminent statesmen here and abroad have been those who condemned the action of their country in entering into wars they thought to be unjustified. Agreements for the renunciation of war presuppose a preponderant public sentiment against wars of aggression. If, while recognizing the power of Congress, the mere holding of religious or conscientious scruples against all wars should not disqualify a citizen from holding office in this country, or an applicant otherwise qualified from being admitted to citizenship, there would seem to be no reason why a reservation of religious or conscientious objection to participation in wars believed to be unjust should constitute such a disqualification.\n Apart from the terms of the oath, it is said that the respondent has failed to meet the requirement of 'attachment to the principles of the Constitution.' Here, again, is a general phrase which should be construed, not in opposition to, but in accord with, the theory and practice of our government in relation to freedom of conscience. What I have said as to the provisions of the oath I think applies equally to this phase of the case.\n The judgment in United States v. Schwimmer, \n279 \nU.S. 644\n, 49 S. Ct. 448, stands upon the special facts of that case, but I do not regard it as requiring a reversal of the judgment here. I think that the judgment below should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice STONE concur in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","162":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

Gen., for the United States.\n Messrs. W. Calvin Chesnut, of Baltimore. Md., Frank Lyon, of Washington, D. C., and Irving L. Evans, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The government instituted this proceeding, at the request of the Interstate Commerce Commission, undr  ection 20, subdivision (9), of the Interstate Commerce Act,1 for a mandamus to compel the Munson Steamship Line \n\n[283 U.S. 43, 45]\n\u00a0\n to file schedules covering rates and charges for transportation of goods by water from Baltimore, Md., to ports in Florida, upon the ground that the property was being transported partly by rail and partly by water under a common arrangement for continuous carriage and shipment from interior points to the Florida ports. The respondent's answer alleged that the transportation on its part consisted of an independent water movement with respect to which the filing of tariffs was not required. On a trial before the court and a jury, the District Judge directed a verdict for the respondent, 33 F.(2d) 211, and the judgment entered accordingly was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 37 F.(2d) 681. The government was granted a writ of certiorari.\n The facts, as found by the courts below, upon evidence substantially undisputed, may be summarized as follows: The respondent operates a line of steamers from Baltimore, Md., to Jacksonville and Miami, Fla. It accepts from rail carriers at Baltimore goods which have been transported from inland points and carries them to the Florida ports. The transportation is not covered by through bills of lading or by through or joint rates, and there is no agreement for the division, and no customary division, of rates between the respondent and the rail carriers. The goods are shipped by rail to Baltimore in care of, or with direction to notify, the respondent, and the name of the ultimate consignee in Florida is noted on the rail bill of lading. That bill shows Baltimore as the destination of the shipment. The shipper sends the rail bill of lading to the respondent with instructions as to the ultimate consignee. Upon the arrival of the goods at Baltimore, the rail carrier sends an arrival notice to the respondent; the latter advises the rail carrier of the ship which will transport the goods to Florida, and the goods are delivered to the respondent. The rail bill of lading is surrendered to the rail carrier, the charges of that carrier, unless they have been prepaid, are paid by the respond- \n\n[283 U.S. 43, 46]\n\u00a0\n ent which then issues its own bill of lading to the shipper, specifying its freight rate for the transportation of the goods by water from Baltimore to the point of destination in accordance with the separate advice which the respondent has received from the shipper. Upon delivery of the goods in Florida, the respondent collects from the consignee its own charges and also the rail charges which it has advanced, but the latter are collected, not as agent for or under any agreement with, the rail carrier, but because they have been advanced as an incident to the carrying out of the contract between the respondent and the shipper.\n The question relates solely to the application of section 6(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  6(1) providing for the filing of tariffs with the Interstate Commerce Commission. The requirement of the Shipping Act, 2 with which the respondent is said to have complied, as to filing tariffs with the United States Shipping Board, is not involved. Nor is any question presented under section 6(13)3 of the Interstate Commerce Act, added by the Panama Canal Act. \n4\n The provision of section 6(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act applies to common carriers as these are described in section 1 of that act, and the particular description with which we are here concerned is found in subdivision (1)(a) of that section relating to common carriers engaged in\n'(a) The transportation of passengers or property wholly by railroad, or party by railroad and partly by water when both are used under a common control, management or arrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment.' \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[283 U.S. 43, 47]\n\u00a0\n The government concedes that the respondent was not required to file tariffs with the Commission 'unless it was engaged in continuous interstate rail and water shipments pursuant to a common control, management, or arrangement,' and that 'there was no common control or management between respondent and the connecting railroads.' The question is thus the narrow one whether there was a 'common arrangement' for the rail and water shipment within the meaning of the statute.\n\n It is apparent that a mere practical continuity in the transportation is not enough, as the question under the statute is not simply whether there was a continuous carriage or shipment, but whether that carriage or shipment was pursuant to a common arrangement. \n6\n The provision of the statute, expressing a distinction in the policy of the Congress with respect to water transportation, clearly indicates that it is permissible for a water carrier, receiving at its port a shipment which has been carried by rail from an interior point to keep its own carriage distinct and independent. While a common arrangement may exist without the issue of a through bill of lading or any particular formality,7 it is not to be inferred from circumstances which are entirely consistent with the independence which the statute recognizes. In this instance, the facts show that the respondent undertook to maintain its own carriage as distinct and independent by having its separate contract, its independent rate, its direct instructions from the shipper as to its own transportation. The fact that the respondent advised the rail carrier of the \n\n[283 U.S. 43, 48]\n\u00a0\n sailings of its ships, the place where goods would be received, and the amount of its charges for the water transportation, manifestly did not constitute a common arrangement with the railroad for that transportation. The respondent could take delivery and pay the rail charges upon delivery without sacrificing its right to make, as it did make, its own separate contract directly with the shipper pursuant to which the goods were received and the payment made. The government stresses the fact that circulars were issued by the railroads as to the respondent's method of shipping and that shippers were generally informed as to the way in which shipments from interior points destined to Florida ports would be handled. But this information merely gave the facts and did not alter the transaction. The respondent did not forfeit its independence merely by making its service convenient, still less by advising both the railroads and shippers of the terms of its service.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

'That deposits of coal, phosphate, sodium, oil, oil shale, or gas, and lands containing such deposits owned by the United States , ... shall be subject to disposition in the form and manner provided by this Act. ...' 30 USCA  181.\n'Sec. 13. That the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized, under such necessary and proper rules and regulations as he may prescribe, to grant to any applicant qualified under this Act a prospecting permit, which shall give the exclusive right, for a period not exceeding two years, to prospect for oil or gas upon not to exceed two thousand five hundred and sixty acres of land wherein such deposits belong to the United States and are not within any known geological structure of a producing oil or gas field upon condition that the permittee shall begin drilling operations within six months from the date of the permit, and shall, within one year from and after the date of permit, drill one or more wells for oil or gas to a depth of not less than five hundred feet each, unless valuable deposits of oil or gas shall be sooner discovered, and shall, within two years from date of the permit, drill for oil or \n\n[283 U.S. 414, 417]\n\u00a0\n gas to an aggregate depth of not less than two thousand feet unless valuable deposits of oil or gas shall be sooner discovered. ...' 30 USCA  221.\n\n'Sec. 14. That upon establishing to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Interior that valuable deposits of oil or gas have been discovered within the limits of the land embracd in any permit, the permittee shall be entitled to a lease for one-fourth of the land embraced in the prospecting permit. ...' 30 USCA  223.\n\n Section 9 (30 USCA  211) authorizes the Secretary to lease lands containing deposits of phosphates under such general regulation as he may adopt. By section 17 (30 USCA  226) unappropriated deposits of oil or gas situated within the known geologic structure of a producing oil or gas field 'may be leased by the Secretary of the Interior to the highest responsible bidder, ...' such leases to be conditioned upon the payment by the lessee of such bonus as may be accepted and of such royalty as may be fixed in the lease, etc. Section 21 (30 USCA  241) authorizes the Secretary to lease deposits of oil shale under such regulations as he may prescribe, for indefinite periods.\n Section 2 (30 USCA  201) declares that the Secretary 'is authorized to, and upon the petition of any qualified applicant shall, divide any of the coal lands or the deposits of coal, classified and unclassified, owned by the United States, outside of the Territory of Alaska, into leasing tracts of forty acres each, ...' and thereafter 'shall, in his discretion, upon the request of any qualified applicant or on his own motion, from time to time, offer such lands or deposits of coal for leasing, and shall award leases thereon by competitive bidding or by such other methods as he may by general regulations adopt, to any qualified applicant. ...'\n'Sec. 22. That any bona fide occupant or claimant of oil or gas bearing lands in the Territory of Alaska, who, or whose predecessors in interest, prior to withdrawal had \n\n[283 U.S. 414, 418]\n\u00a0\n complied otherwise with the requirements of the mining laws, but had made no discovery of oil or gas in wells and who prior to withdrawal had made substantial improvements for the discovery of oil or gas on or for each location or had prior to the passage of this Act expended not less than $ 250 in improvements on or for each location shall be entitled, upon relinquishment or surrender to the United States within one year from the date of this Act, or within six months after final denial or withdrawal of application for patent, to a prospecting permit or permits, lease or leases, under this Act covering such lands. ...' 30 USCA  251.\n\n Section 23. That the Secretary 'is hereby authorized and directed, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, to grant to any qualified applicant a prospecting permit which shall give the exclusive right to prospect for chlorides, sulphates, carbonates, borates, silicates, or nitrates of sodium. ...' 30 USCA  261.\n These provisions quite plainly indicate that Congress held in mind the distinction between a positive mandate to the Secretary and permission to take certain action in his discretion. Also, the difference between applicants for mere privileges and those persons who, because of expenditures, or otherwise, deserved special consideration.\n The petitioners, acting separately and as directed by the general rules and regulations, either filed or sought to file applications for permits to prospect for oil and gas under section 13 (30 USCA  221). In order to effectuate the conservation policy of the President, the Secretary of the Interior by a general order either rejected or refused to receive their applications. Thereupon these proceedings were begun in the Supreme Court, District of Columbia. They seek writs of mandamus to compel the Secretary to receive or reinstate the applications and act upon each according to its merits. \n\n[283 U.S. 414, 419]\n\u00a0\n Answering, the Secretary admitted issuance of the general order and action thereunder. All this he claimed was done in pursuance of the authority vested in him by law. The Supreme Court of the District held against him, and ordered receipt or reinstatement of petitioner's applications followed by definite action thereon. The Court of Appeals reached a different conclusion and reversed the judgments. 46 F.(2d) 217, 224.\n The answers aver 'that under the Act, (1920) th gra nting of a prospecting permit for oil and gas is discretionary with the Secretary of the Interior, and any application may be granted or denied, either in part or in its entirety as the facts may be deemed to warrant.' Having examined the act, we cannot say that by any clear and indisputable language it refutes his position. Certainly there is ground for a plausible, if not conclusive, argument that, so far as it relates to the leasing of oil lands, it goes no further than to empower the Secretary to execute leases which, exercising a reasonable discretion, he may think would promote the public welfare.\n It is unnecessary now to declare the precise meaning of the relevant provisions of the act. It was passed when according to a widely accepted view decline of petroleum production in the United States was imminent. In fact, there has been an enormous increase and a consequent troublesome surplus. Looking only at its words, one may interpret section 13 as the Secretary says he did. And this conclusion is aided by consideration of his general powers over the public lands as guardian of the people, section 441, Rev. St. (5 USCA  485); United States v. Grimaud, \n220 \nU.S. 506\n, 31 S. Ct. 480; Williams v. United States, \n138 \nU.S. 514\n, 11 S. Ct. 457; Knight v. Association, \n142 \nU.S. 161\n, 12 S.

Ct. 309; Withdrawal Act, 1910, 36 Stat. 847. \n\n[283 U.S. 414, 420]\n\u00a0\n Under the established rule, the writ of mandamus cannot be made to serve the purpose of an ordinary suit. It will issue only where the duty to be performed is ministerial and the obligation to act peremptory and plainly defined. The law must not only authorize the demanded action, but require it; the duty must be clear and indisputable. United States ex rel. International Contracting Company v.

CO.(1931)\nNo. 33\nArgued: October 23, 1931Decided: November 30, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 195, 196]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. Stanley Payne, of Washington, D. C., for appellant, the United States and Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. Parker McCollester, of New York City, for appellant Hoboken Manufacturers' R. Co.\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 195, 198]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry S. Drinker, J., of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant railroad company operates a mile and one-quarter of main line (with convenient sidings and terminals) along the Hoboken front, New York Harbor, which connects directly with the Erie Railroad and interchanges freight with other roads through the former or by car floats. It owns locomotives and electric trucks, but no cars, and is primarily devoted to switching and terminal operations.\n Prior to August 6, 1926, that company, by agreement among the carriers, received 5.25 cents from the through rail rate of.$9.00 per hundred pounds upon silk moving from Pacific Coast points to destinations on its line. On that date it asked the Interstate Commerce Commission to allow a larger share. After hearing, and on November 5, 1927, the Commission found the agreed division unfair and made the following entry:\n'It is ordered, That of the joint eastbound transcontinental rates on silk from points on the Pacific coast to destinations on the line of complainant, at Hoboken, N. J., said complainant shall receive a division of 22 cents per 100 pounds, which division shall be apportioned among all defendants which participate in the revenues derived from this traffic.\n\n'It is further ordered, That this order take effect as of August 6, 1926, and shall continue in force until the further order of the commission.' \n\n[284 U.S. 195, 199]\n\u00a0\n February 20, 1928, Brimstone Railroad Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 104\n, 48 S. Ct. 282, was decided. We there held that before the Commission could prescribe a new division of joint rates among carriers it must carefully observe the sundry requirements set out in section 15(6) as amended by  418 of the Transportation Act 1920, 49 USCA  15(6). Also that where joint rates had been agreed on by the parties and were not 'established pursuant to a finding or order' the statute confers no power to require adjustment for any period prior to final order. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[284 U.S. 195, 200]\n\u00a0\n May 14, 1928, upon its own motion the Commission reopened for further hearing the proceeding instituted by appellant. Much additional evidence was presented. A second report and order, entered May 7, 1929, again held and directed that it should receive 22 cents for each hundred pounds of silk delivered to points on its line. The following is from the report:\n\n'It will be noted that the order (Nov. 5, 1927) prescribes a division from the date of the filing of the complaint, and for the future. The rate of which the division is here in issue was not 'established pursuant to a finding or order of the commission,' and under the holding in the Brimstone Case, supra, the basis for retroactive application of the division is lacking. The order was, therefore, beyond our jurisdiction in so far as it attempted to prescribe a retroactive adjustment, but it was and is valid as to the future. Its effective date under the circumstances here present must be found to be the date upon which said order could have become effective under the act. By paragraph 2 of section 15 of the act 'all orders of the commission, other than orders for the payment of money, shall take effect within such reasonable time, not less than thirty days, and shall continue in force until its further order.' An order prescribing a division for the future is not an order for the payment of money. Accordingly, the original order prescribing the division for the future should have become effective on December 5, 1927\n\n\n\n'Defendants take the position that the facts to which we are required to give consideration under section 15(6) of the act were not present in the original record; that, therefore, the original order herein was null and void; and that any order herein must speak from the date of a final decision upon the entire record. We do not agree with this contention. The former finding as to the future \n\n[284 U.S. 195, 201]\n\u00a0\n division is amply supported by the evidence upon the original record.\n\n'We find that on and since December 5, 1927, the division received by complainant out of joint rates on silk from points on the Pacific coast to Hoboken, N. J., on its line has been, is, and for the future will be unjust, unreasonable, and inequitable to the extent that it has been, is, or may be less than 22 cents per 100 pounds.\n\n'An appropriate order will be entered modifying the order herein of November 5, 1927, to the extent indicated.'\n\n The second order follows:\n'It appearing, That on November 5, 1927, division 1 entered its report and order in the above-entitled proceeding, and that on May 14, 1928, this case was reopened for rehearing;\n\n'It further appearing, That such rehearing has been had and that the commission on the date hereof has made and filed a report on rehearing containing its findings of fact and conclusions thereon, which said report and the report and order of November 5, 1927, are hereby referred to and made a part thereof;\n\n'It is ordered, That the said order of November 5, 1927, be and it is hereby modified to read as follows:\n\n'It is ordered, That on and after December 5, 1927, said complainant shall receive a division of 22 cents per 100 pounds out of the joint eastbound transcontinental rates on silk from points on the Pacific Coast to destinations on the line of complainant at Hoboken, N. J., which division shall be apportioned among all defendants which participate in the revenues derived from this traffic east of Chicago and Peoria, Ill., St. Louis, Mo., and related gateways,\n\n'And it is further ordered, That this order shall continue in force until the further order of the commission.' \n\n[284 U.S. 195, 202]\n\u00a0\n The appellees refused to obey the May 7th order and upon motion, February 4, 1930, the Commission entered a third directing an allowance of not less than 22 cents per hundred pounds on shipments on and after March 10th. Also that 'this order shall not be construed as modifying, amending or rescinding said orders of November 5, 1927, and May 7, 1929, in so far as they relate to and determine the matters in controversy in this proceeding or the rights of the parties hereto prior to March 10, 1930, or with respect to the division of rates on any shipment delivered to or transported by complainant prior to said date.'\n\n March 11, 1930, by petition in the United States District Court for New Jersey appellees challenged the three orders above mentioned and asked that each be declared ineffective. The cause was duly heard and determined, three judges sitting.\n Of the Commission's final action the court said: 'This (third) order, we understand, is accepted by the plaintiffs because of the fact that it becomes effective not less than thirty days after its entry.' Relief in respect of it was accordingly denied. As this part of the decree is not now challenged, we need not further consider the effect of that order.\n Relying upon Brimstone Railroad Co. v. United States, supra, the court held that the evidence presented to the Commission prior to November 5, 1927, did not meet the statutory requirements. And upon that ground, as well as because of its retroactive feature, the first order was declared ineffective. The court further declared that in view of the additional testimony introduced subsequent to the re-opening on May 5, 1928, the second order might have been lawful but for the retroactive provision; this rendered the whole invalid.\n As the cause will be decided upon another point, we need not inquire whether there was proper consideration \n\n[284 U.S. 195, 203]\n\u00a0\n of the sundry elements enumerated in section 15(6) of Interstate Commerce Act as amended by section 418 of Transportation Act 1920, prior to the first order. The applicable rule was definitely pointed out by Brimstone Railroad Co. v. United States, supra. The court below was of opinion that the statutory requirements were not met; and the Commission's own action in reopening the proceedings indicates rather plainly that it then accepted the same view.\n Section 15, par. (2), as amended by section 418 of Transportation Act, 49 USCA  15(2), provides that 'all orders of the commission, other than orders for the payment of money, shall take effect within such reasonable time, not less than thirty days, and shall continue in force until its further order, or for a specified period of time, according as shall be prescribed in the order, unless the same shall be suspended or modified or set aside by the commission, or be suspended or set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction.'\n The only provision in the first order in respect of the effective date is this: 'It is further ordered, That this order take effect as of August 6, 1926, and shall continue in force until the further order of the commission.' The Commission had no power to put this order into effect as of a prior day; no future day was prescribed; the designated date was not a lawful one. Accordingly, the order did not become operative and was wholly ineffective.\n'Orders ... shall take effect ... according as shall be prescribed in the order.' The courts may not usurp the function of the Commission and say one of its orders shall become effective thirty days, a hundred days, or at any other time after entry. An order must take effect as prescribed; its effective date, if any, is the one actually appointed not one which might have been. Unless and until the Commission duly designates a lawful date no carrier can know what is required and the courts can not command obedience. It follows that, notwithstanding \n\n[284 U.S. 195, 204]\n\u00a0\n the first order, the agreed division of the through rate continued to be the lawful one.\n\n Under the guise of putting a former one into effect, the second order likewise undertook retrospectively to change an existing agreed rate. This was beyond the power conferred. The order was not divisible; it specified no lawful date upon which it should become effective and was invalid. The division as originally agreed by the carriers remained the lawful one.\n The third order appointed a definite time, as the statute requires not less than thirty days after entry, upon which it should go into effect; it also definitely stated that nothing therein should be construed as modifying, amending, or rescinding the previous ones. Appellees do not question its validity.\n The decree of the court below is affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n The first order of the Commission, without regard to its later ones, should, I think, be held valid and operative thirty days from its date. Dated November 5, 1927, it directed that the 'complainant shall receive a division of 22 per hundred pounds' of the joint rate on silk from Pacific coast points to destinations on its line. It specified that it should take effect as of an earlier date, August 6, 1926, 'and shall continue in force until the further order of the Commission.' For present purposes, we must assume that it was supported by evidence and was intended to remove a division of the joint rate, which was grossly unfair to appellant.\n The Commission, as this Court later decided in Brimstone Railroad & Canal Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 104\n, 48 S. Ct. 282, was without authority to order a division of rates as to the past, but it did possess the power to order a division for the future, and sought, by an unambiguous use of words, \n\n[284 U.S. 195, 205]\n\u00a0\n to exercise it. Yet, it is held by the Court that the order is invalid in its entirety and, in consequence, the appellants lose the benefit of it, not only for the designated period antedating the Commission's action, but for the four years which have since elapsed, because the order did not, as required by section 15(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended by section 418 of Transportation Act of 1920, 49 USCA  15(2), prescribe a time at least thirty days from its date when it was to take effect. The section provides that orders of the Commission 'shall take effect within such reasonable time, not less than thirty days, and shall continue in force until its further order or for a specified period of time, according as shall be prescribed by the order.' On its face the statute would seem merely to curtail the power of the Commission to make its order effective within thirty days, rather than to require the order to specify some particular date beyond the thirty day period when it should be effective.\n But granting that the latter is the requirement of the statute, I fail to perceive in the present order any such failure to specify the time of its operation as would render it invalid as to the divisions which the Commission had power to make. It would not, I think, occur to any one unfamiliar with legal niceties that the order failed to prescribe a time for its operation with respect to the future. It bore a date and in terms said that the division ordered should take effect as of an earlier named date and should continue in force until further order of the Commission. Thus the order prescribed that it should operate in the future as well as in the past, on the thirty-first and future days as well as on the thirtieth and each earlier day after its date. In view of the nature of the subject matter, the removal of an unjust apportionment of a through rate, it cannot be said that the Commission did not intend it to operate on the thirty-first and later days, even though it should turn out that there was a lack of power to \n\n[284 U.S. 195, 206]\n\u00a0\n order the division as to earlier dates. See United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. Railroad Co., \n282 \nU.S. 311\n, 51 S. Ct. 159.\n But it is said, in effect, that since the order is void so far as it applied to a past period, identified by named dates, that part of it is as though it had never been written and, hence, the order when applied to the future must be read as though it specified no time for its operation. But the mere fact that the Commission commanded, in a single writing, some things which were beyond its power, together with others that were not, could not erase from the document either the dates or the words or change their meaning or preclude our looking at them to see in what manner and to what extent the Commission exercised the power it did possess. Looking at the words I cannot say that the order, so far as it directed the division after thirty days from its date, did not comply with section 15(2), or that it can rightly be set at naught regardless of the nature and amount of the evidence supporting it.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 15, par.

BENZ(1931)\nNo. 112\nArgued: December 8, 1930Decided: January 5, 1931\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Thomas D. Thacher, of Washington, D. C., for the United States. \n\n[282 U.S. 304, 305]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Francis Biddle, of Philadelphia, Pa., for Benz.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on a certificate from the court below under section 239 of the Judicial Code, as amended by the act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 938, U. S. Code, \n\n[282 U.S. 304, 306]\n\u00a0\n title 28,  346 (28 USCA  346). Benz was indicted for a violation of the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA). He entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of ten months beginning December 27, 1929. While undergoing imprisonment under this sentence, and before expiration of the term of the federal District Court which had imposed the sentence, he filed a petition asking that the sentence be modified. The court, over the objection of the United States, entered an order reducing the term of imprisonment from ten to six months. The government appealed, and the court below, desiring the instruction of this Court, certified the following question:\n'After a District Court of the United States has imposed a sentence of imprisonment upon a defendant in a criminal case, and after he has served a part of the sentence, has that court, during the term in which it was imposed, power to amend the sentence by shortening the term of imprisonment?'\n\n The contention of the government is that after the defendant has been committed and has entered upon service of a valid sentence, the power of the court to alter the sentence, even at the same term, has come to an end. In addition, some stress is put upon the fact that the powers of the three departments of government are separated by the Constitution, so that one of the departments may not exercise the powers conferred upon either of the others; and it is suggested that from this separation the implication fairly may be drawn that a reduction by the court of a valid sentence after it has been party served is, in effect, an invasion of the power to pardon offenses, including the power to commute, vested in the executive by article 2,  2, cl. 1, of the Constitution.\n The general ule is that judgments, decrees and orders are within the control of the court during the term at which they were made. They are then deemed to be 'in the breast of the court' marking them, and subject to be \n\n[282 U.S. 304, 307]\n\u00a0\n amended, modified, or vacated by that court. Goddard v. Ordway, \n101 U.S. 745\n, 752. The rule is not confined to civil cases, but applies in criminal cases as well, provided the punishment be not augmented. In re Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 167-174; Bassett v. United States, 9 Wall. 38. In the present case the power of the court was exercised to mitigate the punishment, not to increase it, and is thus brought within the limitation. Wharton, in Criminal Pl. and Pr . (9th Ed.)  913, says: 'As a general practice, the sentence, when imposed by a court of record, is within the power of the court during the session in which it is entered, and may be amended at any time during such session, provided a punishment already partly suffered be not increased.'\n The distinction that the court during the same term may amend a sentence so as to mitigate the punishment, but not so as to increase it, is not based upon the ground that the court has lost control of the judgment in the latter case, but upon the ground that to increase the penalty is to subject the defendant to double punishment for the same offense in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides that no person shall 'be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.' This is the basis of the decision in Re Lange, supra. There, the punishment prescribed by statute was imprisonment for not more than one year or a fine of not less than $10 nor more than $ 200; but Lange was sentenced to one year's imprisonment and to pay $200 fine. Five days after the imprisonment had begun, after payment of the fine and during the same term, Lange was brought before the same court on a writ of habeas corpus; an order was entered vacating the former judgment, and he was again sentenced to one year's imprisonment from that time. This court stated the rule to be, page 167 of 18 Wall.: 'The general power of the court over its own judgments, orders, \n\n[282 U.S. 304, 308]\n\u00a0\n and decrees, in both civil and criminal cases, during the existence of the term at which they are first made, is undeniable.' The court declared, however, that the power could not be so used as to violate the constitutional guarantee against double punishment, holding (page 173 of 18 Wall.) that this guaranty applied to all cases where a second punishment is attempted to be inflicted for the same offense by a judicial sentence:\n'For of what avail is the constitutional protection against more than one trial if there can be any number of sentences pronounced on the same verdict? Why is it that, having once been tried and found guilty, he can never be tried again for that offense? Manifestly it is not the danger or jeopardy of being a second time found guilty. It is the punishment that would legally follow the second conviction which is the real danger guarded against by the Constitution. But if, after judgment has been rendered on the conviction, and the sentence of that judgment executed on the criminal, he can be again sentenced on that conviction to another and different punishment, or to endure the same punishment a second time, is the constitutional restriction of any value? Is not its intent and its spirit in such a case as much violated as if a new trial has been had, and on a second conviction a second punishment inflicted?\n\n'The argument seems to us irresistible, and we do not doubt that the Constitution was designed as much to prevent the criminal from being twice punished for the same offence as from being twice tried for it.'\n\n But the court immediately proceeded to say, page 174 of 18 Wall.:\n'If the court, for instance, had rendered a judgment for two years' imprisonment, it could no doubt, on its own motion, have vacated that judgment during the term and rendered a judgmet f or one year's imprisonment; or, if no part of the sentence had been executed, it could have rendered a judgment for two hundred dollars fine after \n\n[282 U.S. 304, 309]\n\u00a0\n vacating the first.'\n\n Then returning to the question of double punishment, and reciting that Lange had paid the fine and had undergone five days of the one year's imprisonment first imposed, the court said, page 175 of 18 Wall.:\n'... Can the court vacate that judgment entirely, and without reference to what has been done under it, impose another punishment on the prisoner on that same verdict? To do so is to punish him twice for the same offence. He is not only put in jeopardy twice, but put to actual punishment twice for the same thing.'\n\n The Lange Case and the Bassett Case, supra, probably would have set at rest the question here presented had it not been for a statement in United States v. Murray, \n275 \nU.S. 347, 358\n, 48 S. Ct. 146, 149. In that case this Court held that where the defendant had begun to serve his sentence, the District Court was without power, under the Probation Act of March 4, 1925 (18 USCA ss 724-727), to grant him probation; and, citing In re Lange as authority, said: 'The beginning of the service of the sentence in a criminal case ends the power of the court even in the same term to change it.' But the Murray Case involved the construction of the Probation Act, not the general powers of the court over its judgments. The words quoted were used by way of illustration bearing upon the congressional intent, but were not necessary to the conclusion reached. That they state the rule more broadly than the Lange Case warrants is apparent from the foregoing review of that case.\n The rule thus being settled for this court by its prior decisions, we need not discuss the conflicting state cases nor the conflicting decisions of lower federal courts which are cited, further than to say that the federal cases cited by the government in support of its position are comparatively recent, and at least in some instances rest upon the general statement in the Murray Case just quoted. The earlier view is to the contrary. Thus in the case of In re Graves (D. C.) 117 F. 798, 799, where a person had been re- \n\n[282 U.S. 304, 310]\n\u00a0\n sentenced to serve for a period of one and one-half years after having been imprisoned for a number of days under a sentence of two years, the court refused to discharge him on habeas corpus, saying:\n'It involves only the inquiry whether the court possessed the power to recall the prisoner, set aside the sentence, and impose another modified sentence during the same term, notwithstanding the fact alleged that execution of the former sentence had commenced; and, whatever diversity of opinion appears in other jurisdictions, the doctrine is established in the federal courts that such power exists, and that it is applicable as well where the original sentence was in excess of jurisdiction. (Citing, among other cases, Ex parte Lange and Bassett v. United States, supra.) In Ex parte Lange, supra, the doctine so stated is distinctly recognized, but the case is distinguished as one where the statute authorized imprisonment, or fine, in the alternative only, and the sentence imposed both; and the majority opinion merely holds that new sentence of imprisonment alone cannot be imposed after payment of the fine, which operated as a satisfaction of the prior judgment. The sentence under which this petitioner is imprisoned is in all respects more favorable to him than was the original sentence, and escape therefrom is sought on the ground of change in the place of imprisonment after he had 'entered upon the service' of the first sentence.\n\n'As the place of imprisonment was discretionary, and in no sense affected the jurisdiction, and the power of the court over its own judgment within the term is undeniable (Exparte Lange, supra), I am clearly of opinion that the sentence and commitment in question are valid, and, no ground appearing to grant the petitioner the benefits of a writ of habeas corpus, the apli cation is denied.' \n\n[282 U.S. 304, 311]\n\u00a0\n With this application of the rule and interpretation of the prior decisions of this Court, we entirely agree.\n\n We find nothing in the suggestion that the action of the district court in reducing the punishment after the prisoner had served a part of the imprisonment originally imposed was a usurpation of the pardoning power of the executive. The judicial power and the executive power over sentences are readily distinguishable. To render judgment is a judicial function. To carry the judgment into effect is an executive function. To cut short a sentence by an act of clemency is an exercise of executive power which abridges the enforcement of the judgment, but does not alter it qua judgment. To reduce a sentence by amendment alters the terms of the judgment itself and is a judicial act as much as the imposition of the sentence in the first instance.\n The question propounded must be answered in the affirmative.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","167":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. BOSTON BUICK CO.(1931)\nNo. 42\nArgued: Decided: February 2, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 476, 477]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Chas. B. Rugg, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n Messrs.

Eames, of Boston, Mass., for respondent Iron Cap Copper Co.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases involve the same question as United States v. Swift & Co. ( No. 56) \n282 \nU.S. 468\n, 51 S. Ct. 202, decided this day, namely, What constitutes the allowance of a credit to a taxpayer who has overpaid his income or profits taxes? The issue is made on facts somewhat different from those involved in No. 56. It is whether interest to be paid on the amounts credited to the taxpayers shall be calculated as provided by section 1324 of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 316) or by section 1019 of the Revenue Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 346 (26 U. S. C. A.  153 note)). Interest runs from different periods under these acts. As the allowance made by the act of 1924 is more favorable to the taxpayers in these cases, they claimed interest on their credits \n\n[282 U.S. 476, 478]\n\u00a0\n under that act. The Commissioner awarded them interest under the act of 1921. The date of the allowance of the credits becomes important because we have held that interest on refunds and credits must be computed according to the statutory provision in force at the time of their allowance. United States v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., \n276 \nU.S. 160\n, 48 S. Ct. 236; Blair v. Birkenstock, \n271 \nU.S. 348\n, 46 S. Ct. 506.\n Upon audit of respondents' returns for 1918 it was disclosed that their taxes had been overassessed for that year. In March, 1924, the Commissioner approved schedules which informed the collector of the overassessments and instructed him to check the same against the taxpayers' accounts, determine whether to abate in whole or in part, determine any overpayment, and apportion the same as between credit and refund. In July, 1924, the collector completed his work, as to both taxpayers' accounts, and executed and forwarded to the Commissioner schedules of refunds and credits attached to the schedules of overassessments. The Commissioner placed his certificate of approval on the schedules of refunds and credits on July 31 and August 7. The Revenue Act of 1924 became effective June 2, 1924. If the credits were allowed after the effective date of that statute, the respondents are entitled to interest computed in accordance with section 1019 of that act; if before, they are entitled to interest computed as provided by section 1324 of the Revenue Act of 1921. The District Court (27 F. (2d) 395; 31 F.(2d) 628) held that the provisions of the 1924 act applied, and the Circuit Court of Appeals (35 F.(2d 50 6) affirmed its judgments. On petition of the United States, this court issued writs of certiorari in both cases.\n In view of the decision in No. 56, we hold that the Commissioner's approval of the schedule of refunds and credits constituted the allowance, and that interest is to be computed as required by the Act of 1924\n\n\n The judgments are affirmed. \n\n\n\n","168":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

Wood, both of New York City, for appellee.\n\n\n[282 U.S. 311, 318]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1925 the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway Company, a Wisconsin corporation, became insolvent and \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 319]\n\u00a0\n passed into the hands of receivers appointed by the federal district court for the northern district of Illinois and subsequently by other federal district courts. Thereupon, and pending a decree of foreclosure of outstanding mortgages, committees were formed by and for the various classes of security holders for the purpose of protecting their several interests in the receivership proceedings and in the ultimate disposition of the railway property. Reorganization managers were appointed by the committees for the purpose of preparing and submitting a plan of reorganization. Thereafter, a plan was submitted to, and adopted and approved by, the committees, with an exception not material here, and after some modification was approved by the court below. There was a final decree of foreclosure under which the properties of the railway company, in November, 1926, were sold, subject to certain existing liens, to persons acting as agents for the managers and for the benefit of the security holders. This sale was confirmed and the plan held valid by the court, with a proviso that conveyances should not be delivered to appellee, the new company formed in pursuance of the reorganization plan, until after the Interstate Commerce Commission, pursuant to law, had authorized such company to issue the securities provided for in the plan.\n The reorganization plan provided that the stockholders of the old company who accepted the plan might participate in the reorganization by depositing their common and preferred stock, together with the sum of $32 for each share of the former and $28 for each share of the latter. Each depositor was thereupon to receive in exchange common and preferred stock in the new company, and in addition $28 and $24, respectively, in 5 per cent. bonds of the new company. Out of the remainder of the money deposited, being $4 per share of the old stock, an amount equivalent to $1. 50 per share was separated from the remaining $2.50 of the $4 fund and 'set aside to provide for the compensation of the reorganization managers \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 320]\n\u00a0\n and the committees ... and the fees and disbursements of their counsel and all depositaries and subdepositaries, any balance of said sum to be paid over to the new company as additional working capital or, if the reorganization managers in their discretion shall so determine, to be returned pro rata to the holders of certificates of deposit for stock.' The discretion so to be exercised by the managers was declared to be absolute and uncontrolled. The amount to be paid as compensation to the managers was definitely fixed by agreement contained in the plan and compensation for the services of the committees was to be fixed by the managers unless the plan should be abandoned, in which event none was to receive any compensation. Payment to other persons for services was to be made whether the plan should be carried through or abandoned. In respect of the remainder of the $4 fund, namely $2.50 per share, the effect of the plan was to require that after satisfying such expenses as costs of foreclosure, court allowances, engraving of securities for the new company, charges of corporate trustees, etc., any balance remaining should be paid over to the new omp any.\n An application was made to the commission for a certificate of public convenience and necessity under the appropriate provisions of the Transportation Act, 1920, and for an order under  20a of Interstate Commerce Act as added by that act (c. 91,  439, 41 Stat. 494; U. S. Code, tit. 49,  20a (49 USCA  20a)), authorizing and approving the issue of securities in accordance with the reorganization plan. Section 20a of the act among other things provides:\n'(2) It shall be unlawful for any carrier to issue any share of capital stock or any bond or other evidence of interest in or indebtedness of the carrier (hereinafter in this section collectively termed 'securities') or to assume any obligation or liability as lessor, lessee, guarantor, indorser, surety or otherwise, in respect of the securities of any other person, natural or artificial, even \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 321]\n\u00a0\n though permitted by the authority creating the carrier corporation, unless and until, and then only to the extent that, upon application by the carrier, and after investigation by the commission of the purposes and uses of the proposed issue and the proceeds thereof, or of the proposed assumption of obligation or liability in respect of the securities of any other person, natural or artificial, the commission by order authorizes such issue or assumption. The commission shall make such order only if it finds that such issue or assumption: (a) is for some lawful object within its corporate purposes, and compatible with the public interest, which is necessary or appropriate for or consistent with the proper performance by the carrier of service to the public as a common carrier, and which will not impair its ability to perform that service, and (b) is reasonably necessary and appropriate for such purpose.\n\n'(3) The commission shall have power by its order to grant or deny the application as made, or to grant it in part and deny it in part, or to grant it with such modifications and upon such terms and conditions as the commission may deem necessary or appropriate in the premises, and may from time to time, for good cause shown, make such supplemental orders in the premises as it may deem necessary or appropriate, and may by any such supplemental order modify the provisions of any previous order as to the particular purposes, uses, and extent to which, or the conditions under which, any securities so theretofore authorized or the proceeds thereof may be applied, subject always to the requirements of the foregoing paragraph (2 ). ...\n\n'(11) Any security issued or any obligation or liability assumed by a carrier, for which under the provisions of this section the authorization of the commission is re- \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 322]\n\u00a0\n quired, shall be void, if issued or assumed without such authorization therefor having first been obtained, or if issued or assumed contrary to any term or condition of such order of authorization as modified by any order supplemental thereto entered prior to such issuance or assumption. ...'\n\n The commission, after a hearing, certified that public convenience and necessity required the acquisition and operation by the new company of the lines of railroad theretofore owned by the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway Company, and entered an order that the new company be authorized to issue the securities which were described in the report and order of the commission, 'Provided, however, ... that the applicant ... (b) shall impound in a separate fund the money received from the payment by holders of preferred and common stock in an amount equal to $4 a share, which shall not be paid out unless and until so authorized by order of the court in respect to payments subject to the court's jurisdiction or by this commission.'\n The present suit was brought to have the foregoing clause (b) of the proviso declared beyond the lawful authority of the commission and void, and perpetually to enjoin appellants from enforcing the order of the commission in that respect. In addition to the facts hereinbefore set forth, and others, it was allegd i n the petition that the commission and the United States had threatened to institute criminal or civil proceedings against appellee, in accordance with applicable provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, for violation of the condition imposed by clause (b) of the proviso. Appellants answered separately, admitting all the material allegations of the petition pertinent to the question now under review; and separately moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that the court was without jurisdiction to set aside that part of the order which was assailed. After \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 323]\n\u00a0\n argument the court below entered a decree denying the motions to dismiss and perpetually setting aside, suspending and annulling, and perpetually enjoining the enforcement of, or attempt to enforce, the condition (b) imposed by the proviso, so far as it here is in question; that is to say, such part thereof as required appellee to obtain the special fund of $1.50 per share and impound the same, and which prohibited the making of any payment out of that fund without a prior determination by the commission in respect thereof.\n The court below was of opinion that the proviso should be so construed as to include only the $2.50 part of the fund and exclude the special fund of $1.50 per share from its operation; otherwise that the condition in respect of the latter was void. The court further held that the case made by the petition was within the jurisdiction transferred to the district courts from the Commerce Court by chapter 32, 38 Stat. 219 ( 28 USCA  41(28), namely, jurisdiction over 'Cases brought to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend in whole or in part any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.' C. 309, 36 Stat. 539, 33 F.(2d) 582.\n We do not stop to discuss the holding of the court below in respect of the construction of the proviso further than to say that, contrary to the view of that court though plausibly stated, we have reached the conclusion that the terms of the proviso embrace, and were meant to embrace, the entire fund of $4 per share, including the special fund of $1. 50. Thus construed, two questions remain for consideration: (1) Was it within the power of the commission to impose the condition so far as it included the special fund? (2) Was that condition such a part of the commission's order as to cause it to fall within the jurisdiction conferred by the language last quoted above?\n First. The legality of the acquisition and operation by the new company of the lines of railroad theretofore owned by the old company is not now in question. The \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 324]\n\u00a0\n requisite certificate of public convenience and necessity was issued by the commission. The order of the commission authorizing the new company to issue securities was made after a finding of all the facts required by the act as a necessary basis therefor. By subdivision (3) of  20a the commission is empowered to make its grant of authority to issue securities upon such conditions as the commission may deem necessary or appropriate in the premises. The power to impose such conditions, however, is not unlimited and may not be exercised arbitrarily or (since Congress cannot delegate any part of its legislative power except under the limitation of a prescribed standard Union Bridge Co. v. United States, \n204 \nU.S. 364, 384\n, 385 S., 27 S. Ct. 367), unless there be found substantial warrant for the conditions in the applicable standards established by the provisions of the act relating to such securities. The powers possessed by the commission are delegated by Congress under, and are to be exercised in conformity with, the constitutional grant of authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce. Proceeding under that grant, as applied to the present matter, neither the commission nor Congress itself may take any action which lies outside the realm of interstate commerce. Hammer v. Dagenhart, \n247 \nU.S. 251\n, 38 S. Ct. 529, 3 A. L. R. 649, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 724. It follows that if the condition in question relates not to such commere, or to the rights or duties of the carrier engaged in such commerce, but exclusively to extrinsic matters, it is imposed without authority of law.\n In the light of the foregoing, we examine the provision of the reorganization plan in respect of the special fund of $1.50 per share. That provision embodies a contract between the committees (voluntarily created by private persons), the managers, and such stockholders as shall elect to become depositors under the plan and shall advance, with other monies for other purposes, the specified sum for the distinct and sole purpose of paying the man- \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 325]\n\u00a0\n agers and others for services rendered in behalf of and for the exclusive benefit of these depositors. Neither the old company nor the new one was a party or was privy to this contract. Neither the contract when made nor any of the parties to it, in respect of the contract, was subject to the jurisdiction of the commission. It was not contemplated by any of the parties, by the new company, or by the court which held the plan to be valid, that the new company should have any enforceable interest in this special fund. Indeed, by contract between the new company, the managers and the purchasers at the sale, it was expressly agreed that the remainder of all cash received by the managers under the reorganization plan should be paid over to the new company, except the special fund of $1.50 per share of the old company's stock, 'which, as provided in the reorganization plan, is to be set aside to provide for the compensation of the managers and the committees, fixed as therein provided, and the fees and disbursements of their counsel and of all depositaries and subdepositaries.' And, correlatively, the new company agreed to pay all other expenses incurred by the managers except such as were to be paid out of this special fund. These agreements of the interested parties lend emphasis to the conclusion that the services to be rendered and expenses to be incurred in formulating and bringing about an approval of the plan were to be paid for out of the special fund as matters in which the private parties alone were concerned.\n If the security holders, instead of agreeing to the provision for a special fund incorporated in the body of the reorganization plan, had bound themselves by a separate contract to compensate the managers and others for their services in behalf of the security holders, and had placed a sum of money in the hands of a trustee to secure payment of the estimated amount, as they well might have done, it probably would not have been contended that the \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 326]\n\u00a0\n commission lawfully could impose upon the issue of the securities the condition that the new company should take control of this money or that it should be paid out under the direction of the commission. But in principle how does the case under review differ from the case supposed? The agreement in respect of the special fund, though contained in the body of the plan, is in effect as distinct as though it had been made by separate contract. It seems plain enough that the commission, by the condition here in question, has undertaken to lay its hands upon and control the disposition of a fund created by contract between private persons to which the carrier was not a party, in which the carrier had no enforceable interest, and which was not within the purview of the regulating power of the commission. The most that can be said is that the creation of the special fund-like production or manufacture of commodities, United States v. E. C. Knight Co., \n156 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 15 S. Ct. 249, 253-'may (or may not) result in bringing the operation of commerce into play.' The contract was not one in respect of commerce but involved a transaction distinct and complete in itself without regard to its results; and, whether succeeded by commerce or not, was no part of it. Diamond Glue Co. v. United States Glue Co., \n187 \nU.S. 611, 616\n, 23 S. Ct. 206.\n The proviso itself aptly illustrates by contrast the extent of the commission's pwer to impose conditions in respect of the matter under review. From the entire fund of $4 per share, $2.50 per share was set apart to be used for paying costs of foreclosure, court allowances, etc., and any balance remaining was to be paid over to the new company; and by a subsequent agreement this balance, together with an unexpended amount intended for expenses not yet liquidated, was formally conceded to be the property of the new company. This portion of the fund, therefore, was properly a part of the carrier's resources; constituted a subject matter upon which the \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 327]\n\u00a0\n legislative standards controlling the action of the commission in respect of the issue of securities had a direct bearing; was proximately related to, and might substantially affect, the commercial activities of the carrier; and, accordingly, was a subject in respect of which the condition properly could be imposed by the commission. In the case of the special fund of $1.50 per share, however, the carrier had no such interest. That fund was owned by and subject to the sole control of private persons. Whether the carrier would receive any part of it in the future was a matter of speculation being wholly dependent upon the unrestricted will of its custodians. It results that the condition, in so far as it affects the special fund of $1.50 per share, was an interference with private property and rights lying outside the field of federal jurisdiction.\n The power to regulate commerce is not absolute, but is subject to the limitations and guarantees of the Constitution (Const. Amend. 5), among which are those providing that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation and that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law. Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312, 336\n, 13 S. Ct. 622; United States v. Joint-Traffic Association, \n171 \nU.S. 505, 571\n, 572 S., 19 S. Ct. 25; Adair v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 161, 180\n, 28 S. Ct. 277, 13 Ann. Cas. 764. Both the liberty of contract and the right to property here are involved. The contract was valid and had been so adjudged by the court having jurisdiction of the foreclosure and sale. The parties to it were willing and were entitled to have the contract executed according to its terms. There is no power in any department of the government to order otherwise. And certainly a carrier whose only interest in the property lies in the speculative possibility that some remnant of it in the future may come to the carrier as a gift is in no position to take it as of right without compensation. In that view, any legis- \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 328]\n\u00a0\n lative or administrative edict which purports to empower the carrier to take the property without compensation and dispose of it, not as the contract provides, but as the governmental body may direct, must fail as a futile attempt to accomplish what the Constitution does not permit.\n Second. The jurisdiction of the federal district courts, as already pointed out, extends over cases brought to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend, in whole or in part, any order of the commission. The contention of the government is that the authority to enjoin an order in part, applies to a severable part of the order, but not to a condition upon which the order was issued after the carrier has exercised the authority granted by the order. No pertinent authority is cited in support of this contention, and none has been called to our attention. A condition contained in the order by which the grant is limited is as much a part of the order as any of its substantive provisions, and if beyond the jurisdiction of the commission is not ratified by an acceptance of the valid part of the order. It long has been settled in this court that the rejection of an unconstitutional condition imposed by a state upon the grant of a privilege, even though the state possess the unqualified power to withhold the grant altogether, does not annul the grant. The grantee may ignore or enjoin the enforcmen t of the condition without thereby losing the grant. There are many decisions to this effect; but we need cite only Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v. R. R. Comm., \n271 U.S. 583\n, 593- 599, 46 S. Ct. 605, 47 A. L. R. 457, and Hanover Ins. Co. v. Harding, \n272 \nU.S. 494, 507\n, 508 S., 47 S. Ct. 179, 49 A. L. R. 713 where the cases are collected and reviewed. The decisions rest upon a principle, which 'is broader than the applications thus far made of it,' Frost Trucking Co. v. R. R. Com., supra, at page 598 of 271 U. S., 46 S. Ct. 605, 609. Broadly stated, the rule is that the right to continue the exercise of a privilege granted by the state cannot be made to depend upon the grantee's submission to a con- \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 329]\n\u00a0\n dition prescribed by the state which is hostile to the provisions of the federal Constitution. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1, 47\n, 48 S., 30 S. Ct. 190; Western Union Tel. Co. v. Foster, \n247 \nU.S. 105, 114\n, 38 S. Ct. 438, 1 A. L. R. 1278\n\n\n Without attempting to determine how far this principle may be carried in its application to orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, or attempting to formulate any general rule in respect thereof, we are of opinion that the principle does apply to the order now under review; and for present purposes that is enough.\n An examination of the report shows that the commission first considered the question in respect of the authority to issue securities sought by the new company. As to that matter it found specifically all the facts required by section 20a as prerequisites to an order granting such authority. The commission further found that the value of the properties sought to be acquired, which included no part of the $4 fund, exceeded the amount of the securities, including preferred stock, to be issued or assumed, by more than $70,000,000.1 In determining the value of \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 330]\n\u00a0\n the properties as a basis for the issue of the securities, the commission gave no consideration to the $4 fund, or to the amount of any balance which might remain after payment of the charges against it, upon the theory that it constituted any part of these properties. After a comprehensive review of the reorganization plan, the commission concluded: 'Upon consideration of all the facts we are of opinion that the public interest will be served by an approval of the application, even though we should believe that a stronger financial structure might have been erected by the adoption of some other plan of reorganization.'\n The commission, having thus disposed of the application for authority to issue securitie, t urned to a consideration of the $4 fund and announced that the authority granted to issue the securities would be upon the condition set forth in clause (b) of the proviso. But nowhere in the report do we find the slightest suggestion that any part of the fund was included with the properties which were held to be a sufficient basis for the issue of the securities, together with the proposed non par value common stock. The fund was dealt with as an independent and separate matter upon the theory that the commission could reserve jurisdiction over it 'for the purpose of taking further testimony as to the expenses of the reorganization, the nature and scope of the services performed for the compensation and fees claimed, and any other matters appropriate in the premises, and for the entering of pertinent orders in connection therewith.' That it was not regarded as involving the basic ground for granting the authority is borne out by the concurring opinion of \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 331]\n\u00a0\n Commissioner Hall, who evidently so understood. He said, 'I am in accord with the conclusions authorizing issuance and assumption of liability in respect of securities and granting certificate of public convenience and necessity. I do not conceive that as a commission we have anything to do with the application which may be made of the $4 per share paid in to the reorganization managers by existing stockholders. What those stockholders do with their money is their affair unless and until some part of that money is paid over to the applicant.'\n The order in itself, being complete and self-sustaining and resting upon grounds found to be sufficient to support it, cannot be made to depend upon submission to a collateral condition, which, as we have shown, is beyond the statutory and constitutional power of the commission to impose. Whatever may be the general rule, we have no difficulty in concluding that, under the circumstances above recited, the principle in respect of the separability of unconstitutional conditions imposed upon a privilege granted by a state is applicable to the present order of the commission-and for a stronger reason, since that body, unlike a state in the class of cases referred to, does not possess the power arbitrarily to deny the authority here sought by the carrier. From the foregoing it results that the condition in respect of the special fund of $1.50 per share was properly set aside and its enforcement enjoined by the court below.\n Decree affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n Opinion of Mr. Justice STONE.\n I think the judgment should be reversed and the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission upheld as one within its statutory authority. But even if it be assumed \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 332]\n\u00a0\n that the condition attached to the order was an improper one, it would seem that the respondent is now estopped to challenge it. In any case, I think the Court should not permit the order to stand as an unqualified approval of the proposed issue of securities, after striking from it the condition upon which the commission's approval was given.\n\n 1. \nThe obvious purpose of subsection (2) of  20(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act as added by section 439 of the Transportation Act (49 USCA  20a) is the prevention of any issue of securities by a rail carrier unless the Interstate Commerce Commission, 'after investigation ... of the purposes and uses of the proposed issue and the proceeds thereof, ... finds that such issue ... is ... compatible with the public interest , ... and ... reasonably necessary and appropriate' for the corporate purposes of the carrier. I suppose no one would doubt, and the opinion of the Court seems to concede, that if the assessments which, under the reorganization plan, were to be levied upon the stockholders of the old company, were all to paid into the new one in exchange for the new securities, it would have been the duty of the commission to investigate the purposes and uses of the new issue and its proceeds; and if it found that the issueto raise a fund for the payment of extravagant reorganization expenses was not compatible with the public interest, or reasonably necessary and appropriate for the corporate purposes of the new company, the commission could have refused to approve it. Under subsection ( 3)2 the commission could have provided against improper expenditures by annexing to its order the very condition which it added in the present case. \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 333]\n\u00a0\n But it is said that, because no part of the $1.50 fund provided by the stockholders to pay for the reorganization would necessarily ever come into the possession or control of the new company, and since its disposition was a mere matter of private contract between the stockholders and the reorganization managers, the condition was beyond the power of the commission. The question is thus presented, whether the salutary provisions of section 20(a) can be avoided, and an issue of securities, so far as it is made to raise a fund to defray excessive reorganization expenses, withdrawn from the control of the commission, by the simple expedient of so arranging the reorganization plan that reorganization managers may retain and disburse, from the moneys paid by the old stockholders to procure stock in the reorganized company, such amounts as may be required for reorganization expenses.\n The history of the receivership resulting in the present reorganization will be found in the report of the commission in the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Raul Ry. Co. Investigation, 131 I. C. C. 615, issued the same day as its report in the present case. The old company having reached the end of its financial rope, and protective committees representing respectively the bondholders, the preferred, and the common stockholders having been organized, its bankers, the present reorganization managers, were active in bringing about the receivership and have since dominated the reorganization. The commission said (pages 667, 668 of 131 I. C. C.):\n'For months prior to the receivership they (the railroad's directors) were impotent. It was an ideal situation for the bankers to control. This they promptly did, arranged all the details, framed up the committees favorably to themselves, put themselves on the bondholders' protective committee and constituted themselves reorganization managers.'\n\n As managers they formulated the reorganization plan, and incorporated it in an agreement between themselves \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 334]\n\u00a0\n and the committees. In every practical sense, the reorganization managers controlled the foreclosure proceedings resulting in the sale of the property of the old company. Their representatives were the purchasers at the foreclosure sale. They created and controlled the new company, which is the appellee here. The reorganization plan gave them full power to modify it as a whole or in detail, with the approval of the committee representing the securities affected. They were authorized to carry out the plan; and in doing so they were empowered to act for, and as intermediaries between, the committees, the stockholders, and the new company. Both preferred and common stockholders of the old company were required by the plan to surrender their stock in that company, and to pay $ 32 for each share of their common stock, and $28 for each of their preferred, in order to procure the securities of the new company. The alternative was loss of their rights as stockholders, which were still of substantial value. The plan called for the use of these sums to pay certain obligations of the old company, and such miscellaneous fiscal requirements of the new as were not supplied by the proceeds of its funded debt, and to create the $1.50 fund, from which were to be paid, in the uncontrolled discretion of the managers, the reorganizationexp enses incurred in launching the new company and securing the transfer to it of the business and property of the old.\n It would seem that technical distinctions between possible methods of procuring payment of the last from funds raised by a security issue of the new company ought not to affect the authority of the commission. I should have thought that, under our decisions, the commission, where its order controls only the action of the appellee, might look through legal forms and, disregarding the corporate entity of appellee, treat the action of the reorganization managers, in dealing with the sums paid by the stockholders for the new stock of appellee, as that of their \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 335]\n\u00a0\n creature and alter ego, the appellee. See United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission of Kentucky, \n278 \nU.S. 300, 308\n, 49 S. Ct. 150; Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Minneapolis Civic Ass'n, \n247 \nU.S. 490\n, 38 S. Ct. 553; United States v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. R. Co., \n238 \nU.S. 516\n, 35 S. Ct. 873; United States v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., \n220 \nU.S. 257\n, 31 S. Ct. 387.\n But even if we disregard this identity of interest, and whatever the form of the transaction, whether the reorganization expenses were to be paid out by the new company directly, or merely for its account by the reorganization managers, its creators, in order to enable it to acquire the railroad property for the benefit of its stockholders, the source of the expense fund was the assessments paid by the old stockholders, in reality and legal effect part consideration for, and proceeds of, the issue of the new stock. To say that so much of the reorganization agreement as related to the creation and expenditure of the $1.50 fund for the payment of these expenses was a mere private agreement, unrelated to the issue of securities, with which the commission is vitally concerned, is to ignore its plain terms and disregard its practical operation.\n The first installment of the assessments was not to be paid in by the stockholders until the plan under which the new securities were to be issued was declared operative by the managers. Stockholders who failed to pay the installments in full could acquire no rights to securities in the new company. It cannot be supposed that one dollar of the $1.50 fund would ever have been contributed by stockholders, had not the reorganization agreement definitely undertaken to issue the securities under the plan to those stockholders who deposited their stock and made the required payments. The creation of this fund for the payment of the reorganization and other expenses was a part of the necessary price exacted for the new securities. It was an important purpose for which the new stock was issued, and one of the purposes which the \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 336]\n\u00a0\n commission was directed by the statute to investigate in determining, as it was bound to do,3 whether the issue was in the public interest and reasonably necessary and appropriate for the corporate purposes of appellee. The considerations affecting the judgment of the commission in passing upon the reasonable necessity for the issue, its effect upon the public interest and upon the carrier's performance of its public service, are the same whether the expense fund was to be paid directly to the new company for disbursement by it, or short circuited, through the managers, from stockholders of the old to the various claimants for services rendered in creating the new.\n Neither the public interest nor the duty imposed on the Interstate Commerce Commission is limited to insuring the payment of debts by any particular railroad, or procuring for it an adequate amount of money or property for the securities which it issues. An important purpose of the Transportation Act of 1920 was to preserve for the nation the transportation system as a whole, and to that end, to secure a fair return on capital devoted to the transportation service. See New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 189\n, 43 S. Ct. 270; Railroad Commission of State of Wisconsin v. C., B. & Q. \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 337]\n\u00a0\n R. R., \n257 \nU.S. 563, 585\n, 42 S. Ct. 232, 22 A. L. R. 1086; Dayton-Goose Creek Ry. Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456, 478\n, 44 S. Ct. 169, 33 A. L. R. 472. The preservation of the transportation system and the stability of its credit essential to its preservation depend not alone upon the ability of individual carriers to meet their obligations, but upon the ability of all to attract the investment of funds in their securities. If such investments are impaired by receiverships of the carriers, followed by reorganizations of excessive cost, and if railroad shareholders, compelled by the necessities of their situation, must contribute to the rehabilitation of their properties excessive amounts upon which the reorganized carrier may not earn an adequate return, railroad credit in a broad sense is affected, the permanency and stability of the transportation system as a whole is impaired, and the public interest suffers. No one familiar with the financial and corporate history of this country could say, I think, that railroad credit and the marketability of railroad securities have not been profoundly affected, for long periods of time, if not continuously, by the numerous railroad reorganizations, in the course of which junior security holders have found it impossible to save more than a remnant of their investment, and that only by the assumption of a heavy burden of expense, too often the result of wasteful and extravagant methods of reorganization.\n The public likewise has an interest in the costs of reorganization insofar as they may affect rates and the application of the recapture provision of the Transportation Act. Such costs may play an important part in the going concern value of the new company, which is an element of value for rate making purposes. See Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, \n238 \nU.S. 153, 165\n, 35 S. Ct. 811; City and County of Denver v. Union Water Co., \n246 \nU.S. 178, 184\n, 192 S., 38 S. Ct. 278; Bluefield Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., \n262 \nU.S. 679, 686\n, 43 S. Ct. 675; McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., \n272 \nU.S. 440, 414\n, 47 S. Ct. 144. In United \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 338]\n\u00a0\n Railways v. West, \n280 \nU.S. 234\n, 50 S. Ct. 123, a substantial amount was included in the rate base to cover 'Cost of Financing.' The mere fact that going concern value is supplied from sources other than the treasury of the carrier, here the stockholders of the old company who became stockholders of the new, is not material. See United Railways v. West, supra. The commission is specially charged with public duties with respect to rates, valuation, and the administration of the recapture provisions. In all these respects the public interest may be adversely affected if railroad securities may be issued to effect, either directly or indirectly, the payment of excessive costs of reorganization.\n If example were needed of the nature and extent of the public interest which may be involved, it is afforded y t he present case. In passing upon the present issue of securities, the commission had before it the results of its elaborate Investigation of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co., supra, entered into after the receivership, in the course of which it commented on the excessive fees and commissions paid in the past by the railway company to its bankers, the present reorganization managers. It had before it tentative estimates of the total cost of reorganization running as high as $6,494,900. The $4 fund set apart for expenses approximated $9,330,000, of which the $1.50 fund was a part aggregating about $3,500,000, out of which were to be paid the reorganization managers, various protective committees, counsel, and depositaries. The estimated expenses to be paid from this fund ranged from $2,636,000 to $3,381,000, of which the compensation to be paid to the reorganization managers was $1, 044,000.\n These estimates were eighteen months old at the time the commission made its report. The commission concluded that the record was insufficient to enable it to arrive at an opinion as to the reasonableness of these expenses. It reserved jurisdiction to take testimony and \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 339]\n\u00a0\n to make further inquiry as to the expenses of reorganization, and the nature and scope of the services performed for the compensation fees claimed; but in order that the reorganization might proceed and the railroad property be released from the receivership, the authority for the issue of the new securities was granted upon the condition that the appellee impound the entire $4 fund, which was to be paid out only upon order of court or the commission.\n Since the commission had concluded that the expenses might be excessive and that there was no adequate safeguard against improper payments, it could, under the express terms of the statute,4 have rejected the application. But it is said that even though the commission might rightly have refused its permission to issue the securities, still, having granted permission, it could not annex this condition to the order; and that, as it could not compel the reorganization managers to impound the expense fund paid over to them, or to submit the reasonableness of the expenses which they had incurred to the commission or the court, it was an arbitrary and unwarranted exercise of power to make the commission's approval of the stock issue conditional upon such action.\n If that were a valid argument, it would follow that the commission, notwithstanding the authority given it by subsection (3), could never attach any condition to its approval of an issue of securities, when compliance with the condition would involve the performance of acts which the commission could not command. But the only purpose of subsection (3) would seem to be to enable the commission to induce, not compel, action, by annexing to its order, as the statute authorizes, 'such terms and conditions as the commission may deem necessary or appropriate.' Notwithstanding this broad language, it may be assumed that only those conditions which, like the present, are germane to the purposes of subsection (2) are \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 340]\n\u00a0\n intended; and that, consequently, only such terms and conditions may be annexed to the order as tend in some measure to remove objections to the issue, which legitimately might be the basis of withholding favorable action.\n If the commission, as I think it might, could have refused to approve the present issue of securities on the ground that they were to be issued to procure payment of reorganization expenses which were or might be excessive, then, plainly, under the provisions of subsection (3) and within the purview of subsection (2), it could have made its consent to the issue conditional upon the modification of the plan, in such manner as to preclude the payment of unreasonable expenses. Appellee was not obliged to comply with the condition, since it was not compelled to proceed with the plan, although compliance with it, through the exercise of the power of the managers to modify the plan, would not, so far as appears, have been impossible or even difficult. But as the condition was one which the commission had power to impose, appellee, having accepted the plan, cannot repudiate the condition.\n\n 2. \nEven if it be held that the condition which the commission attached to its order was beyond its authority, I should still have thought the present case not a proper one for a court of equity to lend its aid to the appellee, and in any event that the decree below should have been so framed as to leave no doubt that the commission was free to treat the whole order as though it had not been made.\n So far as appears, not until appellee filed the present petition did it disclose any purpose to disregard the condition upon which the order depended. In the meantime it had taken full advantage of the benefits of the order. After it was granted, appellee presented to the commission two supplemental petitions for orders authorizing payments from the expense fund, of specific amounts for \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 341]\n\u00a0\n corporate purposes, not including any item payable out of the $1.50 fund. The first of these was granted. Appellee stated in its first petition:\n'The applicant will make such further application or applications, if any, with respect to matters dealt with in the commission's order and not covered hereby as from time to time may be necessary or proper.'\n\n The order of the district court having jurisdiction of the foreclosure directed that deeds of the property should not pass to the appellee until it should have been authorized by the commission to issue the securities. The appellee, without disclosing any purpose not to comply with the commission's order, petitioned the district court for an order directing the delivery of the deeds, exhibiting, the court below found, the order and certificate of the commission. Upon consideration of this application, the court ordered the delivery of the deeds; and appellee then issued the new securities. Only after the reorganization had thus become an accomplished fact by appellee taking the benefit of so much of the order as suited its purposes, did it elect to repudiate the condition upon which the order was founded. Of the appellee's application to the district court, the court below rightly said, 'The petition was a representation to the court that plaintiff (appellee here) had accepted the order and expected to comply with the condition. ...'\n If appellee were unable or unwilling to comply with the order as made, equity and good conscience required, at least, either disclosure of that fact to the district court before securing the transfer of the railroad property to it; application, upon full statement of the facts, to the commission to exercise the jurisdiction, which it had reserved, to approve a modified plan; or prompt initiation of the present proceedings to test the validity of the order before a situation had been created prejudicial to the public interest and to the commission's performance of its \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 342]\n\u00a0\n duties. Instead, appellee adopted a course of conduct consistent throughout only with its apparent purpose to comply with the order; and now, without tendering any excuse for the belated disclosure of its real purpose, it asks relief from the condition only after it has enjoyed benefits which it cannot be said would have been granted without the condition. Neither this Court nor the court below is acting any the less as a court of equity because its powers are invoked to deal with an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The failure to conform to those elementary standards of fairness and good conscience which equity may always demand as a condition of its relief to those who seek its aid, seems to require that such aid be withheld from this appellee. See Davis v. Wakelee, \n156 \nU.S. 680\n, 15 S. Ct. 555.\n\n 3. \nBy the opinion of the Court, the order of the commission, so far as it approves the issue of the securities, is treated as effective without the condition. But even if we assume that the condition which the commission attached to the order is beyond its power, we should not attempt to substitute our judgment for that of the commission, since the statute requires its consent, not ours; and we should not allow the order to stand without the condition, since that is not the order which the commission made. By the Transportation Act, the giving or withholding of consent to the issue of securities is an administrative power, conferred, not upon the courts, but upon the Interstate Commerce Commission. Courts may determine whether the commission lacks the power to impose a particular condition; but they may not strike from an order the condition upon which it was granted, and thus declare that it shall stand although the condition is not complied with. See United States v. Louisville & Nashville R. R., \n235 \nU.S. 314, 320\n, 35 S.  Ct. 113; Proctor & Gamble Co. v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 282\n, 32 S. Ct. 761; Assigned Car Cases, \n274 \nU.S. 564\n, 47 S. Ct. 727. \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 343]\n\u00a0\n Whether or not the commission has in fact consented does not turn on whether the condition is good or bad, but on whether it can fairly be said that the commission would have given its unqualified consent independently of the condition. As the report of the commission discloses, consent to the issue was given only with reluctance, to release the properties from the receivership at the earliest possible moment, but with the undoubted assumption on its part as a moving cause for its consent, that by annexing the condition it would exercise control over the reorganization expenses, with respect to the amount of which it had expressed grave concern. With four of the Commissioners voting unconditionally against the issue, I see no sufficient warrant for assuming that any would have voted for it without the condition and without the further investigation which it thought necessary, and which it was authorized to make before unconditionally approving the issue. Both the report and order of the commission state that the authority granted was upon the 'express condition' which is now the subject of this controversy. If in the face of this language there can be any doubt as to the intention of the commission, we need not speculate upon what it might have done, had it thought it was without power to impose the condition, since it is able to speak for itself if this Court permits it to do so by setting aside the entire order without prejudice to further action by the commission, under the statute, upon the application for approval of the issue of the securities.\n The judgment below, as interpreted by this Court, not only makes effective an order different from any the commission has granted, but precludes any future action by the commission in the performance of its statutory duty. In this respect the case differs from those in which this court has set aside an unconstitutional condition imposed by state legislation on a foreign corporation seeking \n\n[282 U.S. 311, 344]\n\u00a0\n to do business within a state. In those cases the judgment of this Court in no way restricts the further exercise of the legislative power of the state in any constitutional manner. Here the commission is ousted from the exercise of power which Congress has given it, and an order is sanctioned authorizing an issue of securities which it cannot be said the commission has approved, and which this Court does not purport to say is approriate under the statute.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The finding in detail is as follows:\n'In the instant case the testimony is that the value of the properties proposed to be acquired ranges from $640,000,000 to $900,000, 000. For purposes of argument, the Jameson committee took $700,000,000. The book value on May 31, 1927, in round numbers was $707,000,000. Against these values or this investment there will be outstanding after the proposed reorganization the following: Undisturbed bonds, excluding $22, 129,000 of bonds assumed pursuant to the lease of Terre Haute, $160,001, 960; 50-year 5 per cent. mortgage gold bonds, $106,395,096; adjustment- mortgage bonds $182,873,693; preferred stock $119,845,800; total $569,116, 549. Using the lowest figure, $640,000,000, and deducting from that amount the total par value of the securities enumerated, or approximately $569, 100,000, would leave $70,900,000 as representing the value of the 1,174, 060 shares of common stock without nominal or par value. In the hypothetical balance sheet as of May 31, 1927, the applicant shows $174, 342,841.64 for the book value of the common stock. Without expressing any opinion as to the value of the no-par-value common stock, it would appear that upon applying the test suggested there will remain an unmortgaged equity in the properties sufficient to permit the bondholders to assign to the stockholders an interest therein and to support the issue of stock in the amounts proposed.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] (3) 'The Commission shall have power by its order to grant or deny the application as made, or to grant it in part and deny it in part, or to grant it with such modifications and upon such terms and conditions as the commission may deem necessary or appropriate. ...'

EQUITABLE TRUST CO. OF NEW YORK(1931)\nNo. 21\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[283 U.S. 738, 739]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Seth W. Richardson Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n Messrs. John W. Davis, and Carroll G. Walter, both of New York City, and Almond D. Cochran, of Okmulgee, Okl., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This writ brings under review a supplemental decree making allowances for attorney fees, expenses, etc., in a suit, instituted by a next friend, to recover and preserve a trust fund belonging to Jackson Barnett, an incompetent Creek Indian, and directing that the allowances be paid from that fund. The allowances are challenged by the United States as in conflict with existing restrictions on the disposal of the trust fund, and as excessive.\n Barnett is a full-blood Creek Indian, so enrolled, who received an allotment out of the Creek tribal lands when they were divided in severalty pursuant to congressional \n\n[283 U.S. 738, 740]\n\u00a0\n legislation. \n1\n By that legislation and an amendatory act2 his right and title under the allotment and the ensuing patent were subjected to restrictions against 'alienation, contract to sell, power of attorney, or any other encumbrance' prior to April 26, 1931,3 save in virtue of a full or partial removal of the restrictions by the Secretary of the Interior, and against leasing for oil, gas, or other mining purposes, save with the approval of that officer.\n In 1912 the probate court of the county of Barnett's residence, in Oklahoma, adjudged him a mental incompetent and appointed a guardian of his estate. Later in that year Barnett and the guardian (the former described as 'an incompetent'), with the approval of that court and of the Secretary of the Interior, executed to one Bartlett an oil and gas lease of the land allotted to Barnett. The lease required that the royalties be paid to a local representative of the Secretary of the Interior and held for Barnett's benefit.\n Royalties came in rapidly. In 1920 they had produced in the hands of the Secretary's local representative a fund of about $1,000,000, after various small sums had been turned over to the Oklahoma guardian for Barnett's support. Near that time the accumulated fund was taken over by the Secretary, invested in U. S. Liberty Bonds and held by him for Barnett's use.\n News of Barnett's wealth became widespread and thereafter, as was found by the District Court, he was kidnapped by an adventuress who took him to two States other than that of his residence and had him go through a marriage ceremony with her in both; was harassed and annoyed by her attorneys and their allies; and on De- \n\n[283 U.S. 738, 741]\n\u00a0\n cember 15, 1922, was induced by them to put his thumb mark upon an instrument, not understood by him, requesting the Secretary of the Interior to distribute the greater part of the trust fund in the latter's custody by giving $550,000 in Liberty bonds to the wife, and a like sum in such bonds to the American Baptist Home Mission Society, on condition that it pay for his use $20,000 a year during the remainder of his life. Barnett was then about 73 years of age, and the designated annuity was less than the yearly interest on the bonds to be given to that society.\n On February 1, 1923, the Secretary of the Interior approved that instrument, and soon after approving it he distributed the $1,100,000 in Liberty bonds as requested.\n After the distribution was effected the wife took Barnett to California, and on her application a court of that state, in 1924, adjudged him an incompetent, incapable of caring for his person or estate, and appointed a guardian.\n The Oklahoma guardian, on learning of the distribution, invoked the assistance of reputable attorneys with a vew t o asserting and protecting Barnett's interest in the bonds thus separated from his trust fund. These attorneys acquainted themselves with Barnett's mental incompetency and the other facts bearing on the validity of the distribution, brought the facts to the attention of the Secretary of the Interior, and earnestly and repeatedly requested that officer to take steps to secure a restoration of the bonds to the trust fund. The Secretary declined to take such action, insisted the distribution was valid and must stand, and refused to permit any moneys under his control and belonging to Barnett to be used in an effort to recover the bonds. The attorneys then laid the matter before the Department of Justice and urged the institution of suits on the part of the United States for the revocation of the distribution and the return of the bonds, \n\n[283 U.S. 738, 742]\n\u00a0\n but this request, like that to the Secretary of the Interior, failed.\n Thereafter, on January 22, 1925, the attorneys brought a suit in equity in the name of Barnett, by Elmer S. Bailey as next friend, against the American Baptist Home Mission Society and others to cancel the gift to that society and to protect and preserve Barnett's interest in the bonds so given and the income therefrom. Bailey, the next friend, was the Oklahoma guardian who had invoked the assistance of the attorneys. The suit was brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Other suits relating to the other bonds were brought elsewhere, but they are without bearing here.\n After the suit was begun, the Secretary of the Interior continued to oppose the effort to annul the distribution-and this notwithstanding he was advised in a letter of February 9, 1925, from the then Attorney General, Mr. Stone, to whom he had stated his opposition two days before, that the distribution appeared to be entirely unauthorized, and that the government was in duty bound to use its best efforts to assist in recovering the bonds. Mr. Stone retired from the officer of Attorney General Soon after the date of that letter, and thus was unable to carry his view into effect.\n On January 20, 1926, the succeeding Attorney General, at the solicitation of the next friend and his attorneys, sought and obtained leave for the United States to intervene in the suit and thereby participate in the effort to effect a recovery of the bonds and their income for Barnett's benefit. After the intervention was accomplished, the attorneys for the next friend and the solicitors for the United States harmoniously prosecuted the cause to a successful conclusion. All rendered commendable service, but in many particulars the leading part and major burden fell to the attorneys for the next friend. \n\n[283 U.S. 738, 743]\n\u00a0\n On the final hearing the court found that Barnett was illiterate and so stunted and undeveloped mentally that he was incapable of managing his own affairs or of understanding a transaction like the one in question; that the wife and her attorneys and allies, with selfish motives, induced him to place his thumb mark on the instrument requesting the distribution; and that he did this without any real comprehension or knowledge of what he was doing. The court also ruled that the Secretary of the Interior could not by his approval give validity to a gift which the apparent donor by reason of mental incompetency was incapable of understanding or making; that the defendants, although blameless, acquired no property or beneficial interest through the purported gift and must be regarded as holding the bonds and the income therefrom as the property of Barnett; and that, as the bonds were wrongly taken from the trust fund in the custody of the Secretary of the Interior, they and the income from them (less such allowances as the court should require to be paid therefrom for services and disbursements connected with the recovery) should be restored to that fund, and there held for Barnett agreeably to applicable laws of Congress. 4 A decree to that effect was entered ad an attempted appeal by one of the defendants proved of no avail. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The court later on, pursuant to a reservation in the decree, took up the question of what, if any, allowances should be made for services and disbursements. Applications for such allowances were made by the attorneys for the defendants, by the next friend and by his attorneys. All were opposed by the United States. The court rejected the application of the attorneys for the defendants and by a supplemental decree allowed to the next friend $7,500 for his services and allowed to his at- \n\n[283 U.S. 738, 744]\n\u00a0\n torneys $184,881.08 for their services and $4,282.93 to reimburse them for out-of-pocket expenses. There were also directions that these allowances be paid out of the fund which had been the subject of the litigation, and that the fund as thus reduced be restored to the custody of the Secretary of the Interior conformably to the prior decree. On an appeal by the United States the Circuit Court of Appeals reduced the allowance for the services of the attorneys for the next friend to $100,000 and sustained the other allowances. \n6\n This court then granted a petition by the United States for a further review on a writ of certiorari. \n280 \nU.S. 550\n, 50 S. Ct. 160.\n It is a general rule in courts of equity that a trust fund which has been recovered or preserved through their intervention may be charged with the costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred in that behalf,; and this rule is deemed specially applicable where the fund belongs to an infant or incompetent who is represented in the litigation by a next friend. 'Such a rule of practice,' it has been said, 'is absolutely essential to the safety and security of a large number of persons who are entitled to the protection of the law-indeed, stand most in need of it-but who are incompetent to know when they are wronged, or to ask for protection or redress.' \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Counsel for the United States concede the general rule, but regard it as inapplicable here. They assume that Barnett's fund was restricted in the sense that it was not subject to disposal in any form or for any purpose, save with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior; and from this they argue that the court by charging the fund with the costs and expenses and requiring their payment therefrom would be disposing of a part of the fund in violation of applicable restrictions. \n\n[283 U.S. 738, 745]\n\u00a0\n We make the assumption that the restrictions had substantially the same application to the fund that they ahd to the land from which it was derived, but we think the argument carries them beyond their purpose and the fair import of their words. Without doubt they were intended to be comprehensive and to afford effective protection to the Indian allottees, but we find no ground for thinking they were intended to restrain courts of equity when dealing with situations like that disclosed in this litigation from applying the rules which experience has shown to be essential to the adequate protection of a wronged cestui que trust such as Barnett was shown to be.\n The refusal of the Secretary of the Interior and the failure of the Department of Justice to take any steps to correct the wrong amply justified the institution, in 1925, of the suit in the name of Barnett by the next friend. The United States intervened only after the suit had proceeded for a full year. Its purpose in intervening, as shown by the record, was not to supplant or exclude the next friend and his attorneys, but to aid n es tablishing and protecting Barnett's interest in the fund in question. In its petition of intervention it prayed that this fund, 'after deducting the reasonable expenses of this litigation,' be restored to the custody of the Secretary of the Interior. Later on it acquiesced in an order allowing the next friend's attorneys $3,000 from the fund to meet expenses about to be incurred. In all the proceedings which followed the intervention it co-operated with the next friend to the single end that the diverted fund be recovered for Barnett's benefit. And both were satisfied with the main decree when it was rendered.\n When all is considered, we are brought to the conclusion that the United States by its intervention and participation in the suit consented, impliedly at least, that reasonable allowances be made from the fund, under the \n\n[283 U.S. 738, 746]\n\u00a0\n rule before stated, for the services and expenses of the next friend and his attorneys. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n We come then to the question whether the allowances were excessive. Counsel for the United States now confine their criticism to the one for the attorneys' services.\n The District Court apparently included some services in other litigation, particularly in Oklahoma. But the Circuit Court of Appeals excluded them, and we think its action was right. The nature of the other litigation was such that it could neither disturb the prosecution of this suit nor affect the outcome.\n While the Circuit Court of Appeals reduced the allowance to $100,000, it stated that $50,000 would have been enough but for the hazard. We think the hazard was small, and that the allowance should have been $50,000. The material facts were few and demonstrable; and the applicable legal principles were fairly certain. Of course, there was need for intelligent research and action; but otherwise there was not much hazard. While the record shows that these attorneys did their part well, it also shows that after the intervention of the United States the attorneys of the latter contributed much helpful service. The fund which was recovered was large, and of course this had a bearing on what was reasonable, but it gave no license to go further.\n The fund belonged to an Indian who was mentally incompetent. He had no voice in selecting the attorneys and could have none in fixing their fees. Thus justice to him required that special care be taken to confine the fees to what was reasonable. And by applying that standard justice would also be done to the attorneys.\n As before indicated, we think the allowance of $100,000 unreasonably high, and that to bring it within the standard of reasonableness it should be reduced to $50,000. \n\n[283 U.S. 738, 747]\n\u00a0\n The supplemental decree is modified accordingly, and, as so modified, is affirmed.\n Decree modified and affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE did not participate in consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Acts March 1, 1901, c. 676, 31 Stat. 861, and June 30, 1902, c. 1323, 32 Stat. 500. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act May 27, 1908, c. 199, 35 Stat. 312. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Extended to April 26, 1956, by Act May 10, 1928, c. 517, 45 Stat. 495. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Barnett v.

Gen., for the United States.\n Messrs. Thomas G. Haight, of Jersey City, N. J., and Robert H. Montgomery, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This Court granted certiorari, \n281 \nU.S. 719\n, 50 S. Ct. 466, to review a judgment of the Court of Claims, allowing recovery by respondent of income and excess profits taxes alleged to have been illegally exacted for the year 1917. 37 F.(2d) 977, 69 Ct. Cl. 204. It is conceded that respondent was entitled to a deduction from gross income for that year on account of exhaustion or obsolescence of patents, under section 203 of the Revenue Act of March 3, 1917, 39 Stat. 1001; sections 4 and 206 of the Act of October 3, 1917, 40 Stat. 302, 305; section 12(a) of the Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 767, which, if allowed, would result in the refund demanded.\n The sole objection to recovery urged by the government is that the claim for refund filed by petitioner as a prerequisite to suit did not comply with section 1318 of the Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 314 (26 USCA  156), and Article 1036 of Treasury Regulations 62, under that act.\n Section 1318 provides that 'no suit ... shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been ... illegally ... collected ... until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, according to the provisions of law in that regard, and the regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury. ...' Article 1036, Treasury Regulations 62, provides that claim for refund shall be made on form 843, and that 'all \n\n[283 U.S. 269, 271]\n\u00a0\n the facts relied upon in support of the claim should be clearly set forth under oath.'\n Respondent filed an application under oath for reduction of its 1917 tax liability and for a corresponding return of taxes paid, on form 843, which it designated a claim 'for refund of taxes illegally collected.' But the sole ground stated for the demanded reduction of tax was that respondent had filed with the Commissioner an application for special relief from the amount of its excess profits tax under section 210 of the Act of 1917, 40 Stat. 307.1\n That section provides for a special method of assessment of excess profits taxes in any case where the Secretary of the Treasury is unable satisfactorily to determine the invested capital of the taxpayer. It has no relation to deductions from gross income on account of exhaustion or obsolescence of patents. In support of its claim, which was ultimately allowed in part, respondent prepared and filed a brief, and an oral argument was held in the office of the Commissioner; but neither in its claim for refund, its brief, nor at the hearing, was mention made of the deduction now claimed. \n\n[283 U.S. 269, 272]\n\u00a0\n The filing of a claim or demand as a prerequisite to a suit to recover taxes paid is a familiar provision of the revenue laws, compliance with which may be insisted upon by the defendant, whether the collector or the United States. Tucker v. Alexander, \n275 \nU.S. 228\n, 48 S. Ct. 45; Maryland Casualty Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 342, 353\n, 354 S., 40 S. Ct. 155; Kings County Savings Institution v. Blair, \n116 \nU.S. 200\n, 6 S. Ct. 353; Nichols v. United States, 7 Wall. 122, 130.\n One object of such requirements is to advise the appropriate officials of the demands or claims intended to be asserted, so as to insure an orderly administration of the revenue, Nichols v. United States, supra, page 130 of 7 Wall., a purpose not accomplished with respect to the present demand by the bare declaration in respondent's claim that it was filed 'to protect all possible legal rights of the taxpayer.' The claim for refund which section 1318 makes prerequisite to suit, obviously relates to the claim which may be asserted by the suit. Hence, quite apart from the provisions of the Regulation, the statute is not satisfied by the filing of a paper which gives no notice of the amount or nature of the claim for which the suit is brought, and refers to no facts upon which it may be founded.\n The Court of Claims, in allowing recovery, relied upon Tucker v. Alexander, supra, and upon the fact that, at the time when respondent filed its return and its claim for refund, the Treasury had consistently refused to allow deductions from gross income for exhaustion of patents. Consequently it held that the filing of a demand which was certain to be refused was a futile and unnecessary act. But in Tucker v. Alexander the right of the government to insist upon compliance with the statutory requirement was emphasized. Only because that right was recognized was it necessary to decide whether it could be waived. The Court held that it could, and that in that case it had been waived by the stipulation of the collector \n\n[283 U.S. 269, 273]\n\u00a0\n filed in court. Here there was no compliance with the statute, nor was there a waiver of its condition, since the Commissioner had no knowledge of the claim and took no action with respect to it.\n The necessity for filing a claim such as the statute requires is not dispensed with because the claim may be rejected. It is the rejection which makes the suit necessary. An anticipated rejection of the claim, which the statute contemplates, is not a ground for suspending its operation, Even though formal, the condition upon which the consent to suit is given is defined by the words of the statute, and 'they mark the conditions of the claimant's right.' Rock Island R. R. Co. v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 141, 143\n, 41 S. Ct. 55, 56. Compliance may be dispensed with by waiver, as an administrative act, Tucker v. Alexander, supra; but it is not within the judicial province to read out of the statute the requirement ofits words, Rand v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 503, 510\n, 39 S. Ct. 359.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The material part of the claim for refund is as follows:\n'The taxpayer has filed with the commissioner a claim for special relief under section 210 of te 1 917 revenue act for the excess profits tax assessed for this period.\n\n'This claim is filed to protect all possible legal rights of the taxpayer, pending, and at the rate of, the settlement of the claim for relief.

Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. Robert Ash, of Washington, D. C., for respondent. \n\n[284 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.\n In July, 1923, the plaintiff, the Kirby Lumber Company, issued its own bonds for $12,126,800 for which it received their par value. Later in the same year it purchased in the open market some of the same bonds at less than par, the difference of price being $137,521.30. The question is whether this difference is a taxable gain or income of the plaintiff for the year 1923. By the Rev- \n\n[284 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n enue Act of (November 23) 1921, c. 136,  213(a), 42 Stat. 238, gross income includes 'gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever,' and by the Treasury Regulations authorized by  1303 (26 USCA  1245), that have been in force through repeated re-enactments, 'If the corporation purchases and retires any of such bonds at a price less than the issuing price or face value, the excess of the issuing price or face value over the purchase price is gain or income for the taxable year.' Article 545(1)(c) of Regulations 62, under Revenue Act of 1921. See Article 544(1)(c) of Regulations 45, under Revenue Act of 1918; Article 545(1)(c) of Regulations 65, under Revenue Act of 1924; Article 545(1)(c) of Regulations 69, under Revenue Act of 1926; Article 68(1) (c) of Regulations 74, under Revenue Act of 1928. We see no reason why the Regulations should not be accepted as a correct statement of the law.\n In Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co., \n271 \nU.S. 170\n, 46 S. Ct. 449, the defendant in error owned the stock of another company that had borrowed money repayable in marks or their equivalent for an enterprise that failed. At the time of payment the marks had fallen in value, which so far as it went was a gain for the defendant in error, and it was contended by the plaintiff in error that the gain was taxable income. But the transaction as a whole was a loss, and the contention was denied. Here there was no shrinkage of assets and the taxpayer made a clear gain. As a result of its dealings it made available $137,521.30 assets previously offset by the obligation of bonds now extinct. We see nothing to be gained by the discussion of judicial definitions. The defendant in error has realized within the year an accession to income, if we take words in their plain popular meaning, as they should be taken here. Burnet v.

There is no dispute about the facts. They are alleged in the petition and, in detail, made the subject of a stipulation of the parties in the district court. Pleas of former jeopardy and of res judicata were overruled by the district court, 26 F.(2d) 706, a jury was waived, and judgment for the United States entered for the full amount sued for. The court of appeals reversed the judgment on the ground that the action was barred by section 5 of the Willis-Campbell Act (27 USCA  3) 37 F.(2d) 269.\n The point is made that respondent failed to enter an exception to the order of the district court overruling the pleas, but, since the facts were agreed to by stipulation entered of record, the failure to note an exception to the order will not preclude their consideration. Certainly it does not appear that an exception was necessary to direct the mind of the trial court to the precise point to afford opportunity for reconsideration, which is one of the functions of an exception. United States v. U. S. Fidelity Co., \n236 \nU.S. 512, 529\n, 35 S. Ct. 298; Fillippon v. Albion Vein Slate Co., \n250 \nU.S. 76, 82\n, 39 S. Ct. 435. And an exception is not necessary to open for our consideration a question of law apparent on the record, as it is here, where there is nothing \n\n[282 U.S. 568, 571]\n\u00a0\n in the record to indicate waiver of the respondent's rights. Denver v. Home Savings Bank, \n236 U.S. 101\n, 103-104, 35 S. Ct. 265.\n By  35, title 2, of the National Prohibition Act, c. 85, 41 Stat. 305, 307 (U. S. C., title 27, s 52 (27 USCA  52)), it is provided that the act 'shall not reliee a nyone from paying any taxes or other charges imposed upon the manufacture or traffic in (intoxicating) liquor. No liquor revenue stamps or tax receipts for any illegal manufacture or sale shall be issued in advance, but upon evidence of such illegal manufacture or sale a tax shall be assessed against, and collected from, the person responsible for such illegal manufacture or sale in double the amount now provided by law, with an additional penalty of $500 on retail dealers and $ 1,000 on manufacturers.'\n Section 5 of the Willis-Campbell Act, c. 134, 42 Stat. 222, 223 (U. S. C., title 27,  3 (27 USCA  3)), so far as pertinent here provides:\n'That all laws in regard to the manufacture and taxation of and traffic in intoxicating liquor, and all penalties for violations of such laws that were in force when the National Prohibition Act was enacted, shall be and continue in force, as to both beverage and nonbeverage liquor, except such provisions of such laws as are directly in conflict with any provision of the National Prohibition Act or of this Act; but if any act is a violation of any of such laws and also of the National Prohibition Act or of this Act, a conviction for such act or offense under one shall be a bar to prosecution therefor under the other.'\n\n By section 701, par. 9, of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 327 (U. S. C., title 26,  206 (26 USCA  206 note)), it is provided that every person carrying on the business of retail liquor dealer, etc., in any state, etc., contrary to the laws of such state, etc., or in any place where the carrying on of such business is prohibited by local or municipal law, shall pay in addition to all other taxes, $1,000. This section \n\n[282 U.S. 568, 572]\n\u00a0\n was passed in lieu of a similar provision in the Revenue Act of 1918 ( section 1001, 40 Stat. 1128), repeated in the Revenue Act of 1921 ( 1001, 42 Stat. 296). The government, accordingly, treats the item sought to be recovered under section 701 as having been imposed by an act in force prior to the National Prohibition Act. With that view we agree.\n Of the four items involved, two unmistakably are penalties, and are so denominated. The other two, notwithstanding they are called taxes, are in their nature also penalties. Putting aside for later consideration the item of $4,68, we consider, for the present, only the other three items.\n By section 35, supra, it is provided that upon evidence of an illegal sale under the National Prohibition Act, tax shall be assessed and collected in double the amount now provided by law. This, in reality, is but to say that a person who makes an illegal sale shall be liable to pay a 'tax' in double the amount of the tax imposed by preexisting law for making a legal sale, which existing law renders it impossible to make. A 'tax' is an enforced contribution to provide for the support of government; a 'penalty,' as the word is here used, is an exaction imposed by statute as punishment for an unlawful act. The two words are not interchangeable one for the other. No mere exercise of the art of lexicography can alter the essential nature of an act or a thing; and if an exaction be clearly a penalty it cannot be converted into a tax by the simple expedient of calling it such. That the exaction here in question is not a true tax, but a penalty involving the idea of punishment for infraction of the law is settled by Lipke v. Lederer, \n259 U.S. 557\n, 561-562, 42 S. Ct. 549. See also Regal Drug Corp. v. Wardell, \n260 \nU.S. 386\n, 43 S. Ct. 152. There is nothing in United States v. One Ford Coupe , \n272 \nU.S. 321\n, 47 S. Ct. 154, 47 A. L. R. 1025, or Murphy v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 630\n, 47 S. Ct. 218, to the contrary. The first of these cases was a proceeding to forfeit an automobile because used in violation of law; the other \n\n[282 U.S. 568, 573]\n\u00a0\n was a suit in equity to enjoin the occupation and use of premises for a year because use in the commission of offenses under the National Prohibition Act, and to abate the maintenance as a nuisance.The distinction made by these four cases is that in the first two, the purpose of the proceedings was punishment; while, as to the other two, the purpose in the first case was to enforce a simple tax, not one which had been, as here, converted, by a change of its nature, into a penalty, and in the second case the purpose was prevention. Murphy v. United States, supra, page 632 of 272 U. S., 47 S. Ct. 218. Respondent already had been convicted and punished in a criminal prosecution for the identical transactions set forth as a basis for recovery in the present action. He could not again, of course, have been prosecuted criminally for the same acts. Does the fact that the second case is a civil action, under the circumstances here disclosed, alter the rule?\n In United States v. Chouteau, \n102 U.S. 603\n, a distiller and his sureties were sued upon a bond, one of the breaches of which was that the distiller had removed spirits from his distillery, without first paying the tax thereon. To this it was pleaded that before the suit was brought two indictments had been found against the distiller for the same removals, and that upon the recommendation of the Attorney General the government and accepted a specified sum in compromise and satisfaction of the indictments, which were thereupon dismissed and abandoned. The court held that the compromise was the same in principle as a conviction in the criminal proceedings, and that the action was barred; and at page 611 of 102 U. S., said:\n'Admitting that the penalty may be recovered in a civil action, as well as by a criminal prosecution, it is still as a punishment for the infraction of the law. The term 'penalty' involves the idea of punishment, and its character is not changed by the mode in which it is inflicted, whether by a civil action or a criminal prosecution. The \n\n[282 U.S. 568, 574]\n\u00a0\n compromise pleaded must operate for the protection of the distiller against subsequent proceedings as fully as a former conviction or acquittal. He has been punished in the amount paid upon the settlement for the offence with which he was charged, and that should end the present action, according to the principle on which a former acquittal or conviction may be invoked to protect against a second punishment for the same offense. To hold otherwise would be to sacrifice a great principle to the mere form of procedure, and to render settlements with the government delusive and useless.'\n\n In United States v. McKee, 4 Dill. 128, Fed. Cas. No. 15,688, where the defendant was indicted, convicted and punished for conspiring with others to defraud the United States by unlawfully removing distilled spirits from their distilleries without the payment of taxes, it was held by Mr. Justice Miller and Judge Dillon, sitting together, that this constituted a bar to a civil suit to recover the penalty of double the amount of the taxes of which the government had been defrauded by means of the conspiracy, the transactions in both cases being the same. To the same effect, see United States v. Gates, 25 Fed. Cas. page 1263, No. 15,191.\n In the light of these decisions it is clear that if the Willis- Campbell Act be so construed as to justify a recovery in this case, a grave question as to the constitutionality of the act will be presented. The decisions of this court are uniformly to the effect that 'A statute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional, but also grave doubts upon that score.' United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 \nU.S. 394, 401\n, 36 S. Ct. 658, 659; United States v. Standard Brewery, \n251 \nU.S. 210, 220\n, 40 S. Ct. 139; Baender v. Barnett, \n255 \nU.S. 224, 226\n, 41 S. Ct. 271. Doubts as to the meaning of the Willis-Campbell Act, in respect of the questions here for consideration, therefore, must be resolved in accordance with this rule.\n\n\n[282 U.S. 568, 575]\n\u00a0\n Section 5 of that act (27 USCA  3) continues in force all laws in regard to taxation of, and traffic in, intoxicating liqor and penalties for violations of such laws as were in force when the National Prohibition Act was enacted; but with the proviso that a conviction for an act or offense under one shall be a bar to prosecution under the other. The question whether this proviso applies to the present case turns mainly upon the scope and meaning of the word 'prosecution', since there is no doubt that respondent had been convicted under the National Prohibition Act of the offense of making the same illegal sales as those alleged as a basis for the imposition of the 'taxes' and penalties sought to be recovered in the civil action. The government contends that the word implies a criminal proceeding and cannot be extended to include a civil action. But an action to recover a penalty for an act declared to be a crime is, in its nature, a punitive proceeding, although it take the form of a civil action; and the word 'prosecution' is not inapt to describe such an action. In the McKee Case, supra, Mr. Justice Miller evidently held that opinion, since he used both the words 'offense' and 'prosecution' in characterizing the civil action there under consideration. In any event, we should feel bound to resolve a greater doubt than we now entertain in favor of that interpretation of the word so as to avoid the grave constitutional question which otherwise would arise.\n We find no merit in the contention of the government that, as additional maounts resulted from doubling the taxes imposed by R. S.  3244 and section 701 of the Revenue Act of 1924, and adding penalties, the civil action, in so far as the additional amounts are concerned, arose solely under the National Prohibition Act, and not, as the Willis-Campbell Act contemplates, under pre-existing acts. Except for these prior statutes, there would be no basis for seeking to impose a liability on respondent for the \n\n[282 U.S. 568, 576]\n\u00a0\n amounts sued for in the civil action. Section 35 of the act (27 USCA  52), in effect, amended the preceding statutes in the particulars stated; and, as thus amended, these statutes now are to be read, as to all subsequent occurrences, as if they had originally been in the amended form. Blair v. Chicago, \n201 \nU.S. 400, 475\n, 26 S. Ct. 427; Pennsylvania Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 351, 362\n, 35 S. Ct. 370, 59 L. Ed., 616; Kelleher v. French (D. C.) 22 F.(2d) 341, 347; Cumberland Telephone & Tel. Co. v. City of Memphis (C. C. A.) 200 F. 657, 660-661; Farrell v. State, 54 N. J. Law, 421, 423-424, 24 A. 725; Russell v. State, 161 Ind. 481, 482, 68 N. E. 1019. To hold that the acts of respondent in question were not violations of these preceding laws as amended, as well as of the National Prohibition Act, would be to give a narrow and strained application to this provision of the Willis-Campbell Act, and to raise the very doubts in respect of its constitutionality which we are bound to avoid if reasonably it can be done.\n The government seeks to draw a disctinction between the item of $4.68 and the other items, on the ground that the former constitutes a penalty for failure to make and file a return, and respondent was never charged with, or convicted of, an offense involving that omission. Neither the court of appeals nor the district court dealt with the question. The decisions in both courts proceeded upon the theory that all of the items were subject to the same rule; and the record plainly indicates that this was and had been the theory of the government throughout until it came to the preparation of its final brief in this court. The distinction now made was not referred to in the government's petition for certiorari, or in the brief filed in support of it. The point suggests questions which the court of appeals should have been given an opportunity to decide, that is to say, whether a second jeopardy results from the fact, if it be such, that the recovery of the penalty depends upon proof of the same criminal offense of which respondent had theretofore been convicted; and \n\n[282 U.S. 568, 577]\n\u00a0\n whether requiring under penalty a return as a retail lquo r dealer, amounting, as it plainly does, to an admission of criminal liability, violates the rule against compulsory self-incrimination. In this situation we do not now feel called upon to consider or decide the point. If the government, in view of the foregoing and of our decision upon the questions in respect of which the writ of certiorari was granted, shall still desire to press its contention, it will be given an opportunity to do so by first presenting it to the trial court.\n The judgment of the court of appeals will be affirmed and the cause remanded to the district court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion, without prejudice to the further consideration and determination by the district court of the question of liability in respect of the item of $4.68.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","173":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. MALCOLM(1931)\nNo. 512\nArgued: Decided: January 19, 1931\n\n\n\n Certificate of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit under section 239 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  346):\n Robert K. Malcolm and Esther Jarrett Mal colm are husband and wife and citizens of the United States. \n\n[282 U.S. 792, 793]\n\u00a0\n Since October 1, 1920, they have continuously maintained their domicile in the state of California. During the year 1928 Robert Malcolm received a salary of $3,600 for personal services rendered as an officer of the Liberty Farms Company, a California corporation. Under the laws of the state of California, this income was community property. On March 1, 1929, the husband and wife filed separate returns of their income for federal income tax purposes. Each reported one-half of the salary of $3,600 received in 1928 by the husband, and each fully paid the amount shown to be due on the returns. It is admitted that all income taxes due from either husband or wife for the year 1928 have been fully paid if, as a matter of law, they had a lawful right to make such separate returns under the provisions of sections 11, 12, and 51 of the Revenue Act of 1928 (26 USCA  2011, 2012, 2051).\n After the husband had filed his income tax return for the calendar year 1928, as set out above, the Commissioners, upon an audit and examination, determined that his return was incorrect in that the salary of $3,600 should have been reported by the husband alone, and an income tax paid thereon by him, instead of both husband and wife reporting it at $ 1,800 on each return. Accordingly, the Commissioner determined against the husband a deficiency in income tax amounting to $18.39. An assessment in this amount was then made and collected from the husband, the plaintiff herein, together with interest amounting to $1.12. A claim for refund was thereafter filed and rejected by the Commissioner. From a judgment for this amount in plaintiff's favor, the defendant has appealed.\n For a proper decision of the above-entitled cause, now pending on appeal and submitted for consideration, instructions are respectfully requested of the Supreme Court in the following questions of law, concerning which we are in doubt:\n\n\n (1)\n Under the applicable provisions of the Revenue Act of 1928, must the entire community income of a husband and wife domiciled in California be returned and the income tax thereon be paid by the husband? \n\n[282 U.S. 792, 794]\n\u00a0\n (2) Has the wife, under section 161a of the Civil Code of California, such an interest in the community income that she should separately report and pay tax on one-half of such income?\n Dated October 9, 1930\n\n\n Frank H.

Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. Donald Horne, of Washington, D. C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These actions were brought in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. Each respondent sued to recover income taxes incorrectly determined for 1919 and paid in 1920. On defendant's motion in the nature of a general demurrer that court dismissed. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 37 F. (2d) 38.\n The sole question is whether the actions were commenced within the time allowed by Rev. St.  3226, as amended (title 26 U. S. Code,  156 ( 26 USCA  156)).\n In 1924, Michel on February 7, and Krieger on September 15, filed a claim for refund. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue by a letter dated August 17, 1925, advised Michel that his claim would be rejected and that the rejection would officially appear on the next schedule to be approved by him. The claim was rejected September 2. The Commissioner, April 2, 1925, sent a like letter to Krieger, and his claim was rejected April 20. The Commissioner did not give notice to either of them that his claim had been disallowed or of the date of disallowance until June 27, 1928. The suits were subsequently brought more than two years after the rejections and less than two years after the notices. \n\n[282 U.S. 656, 658]\n\u00a0\n Section 3226 as amended provides:\n'No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected ... until a claim for refund of credit has been duly filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue . ... No such suit or proceeding shall be begun before the expiration of six months from the date of filing such claim unless the commissioner renders a decision thereon within that time, nor after the expiration of five years from the date of the payment of such tax ... unless such suit or proceeding is begun within two years after the disallowance of the part of such claim to which such suit or proceeding relates. The commissioner shall within 90 days after any such disallowance notify the taxpayer thereof by mail.'\n\n By the statute the United States waived its sovereign immunity from suit. The permission to sue is conditioned on the filing of a claim and the lapse of six months or the disallowance of the claim within that period, and is limited to not more than five years after payment of the tax, unless the claim has been disallowed and the action is commenced within two years from the disallowance.\n Neither of these claims was rejected within six months after filing. And in each case more than two years elapsed after rejection before the Commissioner sent notice that the claim had been disallowed. Neither action was commenced within five years after payment of the tax or within two years after disallowance of the claim. The taxpayers contend, and the Circuit Court of Appeals held, that the permission to sue continues for two years after notice that the claims had been disallowed, and that therefore these actions were commenced within time.\n As the Commissioner did not act within six months, permission to sue did not depend upon the rejection of \n\n[282 U.S. 656, 659]\n\u00a0\n the claim or upon the giving of the notice. By the terms of the statute the period within which the government consented to be sued commenced at the expiration of such six months, and continued uninterruptedly through the five-year period following the date of payment and until 'two years after the disallowance.' While the statute declares that the Commissioner within a specified time shall notify the taxpayer that his claim has been disallowed, it is nowhere stated that the Commissioner's failure to give the notice will in any event operate to extend the time for bringing suit. An implication to that effect cannot prevail against the rule expressly stated. It is clear that, where the Commissioner renders no decision within six months, the section contemplates that before commecing his suit the taxpayer will ascertain by inquiry whether the Commissioner has acted. This at least suggests that it may be the intention of the act to leave a like burden upon claimants in all cases.\n Provisions in tax laws limiting the time within which the United States may enforce the payment of taxes by distraint or suit are to be interpreted liberally in favor of the taxpayers.

But it is also well established that suit may not be maintained against the United States in any case not clearly within the terms of the statute by which it consents to be sued. Eastern Transp. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 675, 686\n, 47 S. Ct. 289; Price v. United States and Osage Indians, \n174 \nU.S. 373, 375\n, 376 S., 19 S. Ct. 765. There is nothing in the legislative history of the provision to indicate an intention that the two- year period should not commence upon the disallowance of the claim or that it should be extended by the failure of the Commissioner to give the specified notice. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 656, 660]\n\u00a0\n Having regard to the rule of strict construction to be applied to waivers by the United States of its sovereign immunity from suit, the clause reasonably may be read merely as a direction to the Commissioner to send the notice to claimant without making the failure so to do have the effect of enlarging the period for suing as otherwise definitely prescribed.\n The permission to each of the plaintiffs to bring suit expired two years after his claim was disallowed.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Senate Report No. 1137, 67th Congress, 4th Session, p. 5.

Bandy, of Granite City, Ill., for appellee.\n\n\n[284 U.S. 141, 146]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellee filed his individual federal income tax returns for 1927 and 1928, and in each year deducted $12,000 which he claimed to have paid to others. An authorized revenue agent summoned appellee to appear before him and disclose the recipients. Appellee appeared but refused to give the information on the ground that to do so might incriminate and degrade him.\n He was indicted for such refusal and interposed a special plea averring that he ought not to be prosecuted under the indictment because, if he had answered the ques- \n\n[284 U.S. 141, 147]\n\u00a0\n tions put to him, he would have given information that would have compelled him to become a witness against himself in violation of the Fifth Amendment and caused him to be subjected to prosecution in the court below for violation of various laws of the United States, as shown by a transcript of the questions asked and answers given which he included in his plea. The United States demurred to the plea on the grounds that it fails to show that the information demanded would have incriminated or subjected defendant to prosecution under federal law, and that defendant waived his privilege under the Fifth Amendment. The court overruled the demurrer and entered judgment discharging defendant.\n The judgment necessarily determined that to require defendant to supply the information called for would be to compel him to incriminate himself and that therefore he did not unlawfully or willfully refuse to answer. Its effect, unless reversed, is to bar further prosecution for the offense charged. It follows unquestionably that, without regard to the particular designation or form of the plea or its propriety, this court has jurisdiction under the Criminal Appeals Act. \n1\n United States v. Barber, \n219 \nU.S. 72, 78\n, 31 S. Ct. 209; United States v. Oppenheimer, \n242 \nU.S. 85\n, 37 S. Ct. 68, 3 L. R. A. 516; United States v. Thompson, \n251 \nU.S. 407, 412\n, 40 S.

Ct. 486.\n The offense charged is defined: 'Who willfully fails to ... supply such information (for the computation of any tax imposed by the Act) at the time or times required \n\n[284 U.S. 141, 148]\n\u00a0\n by law or regulations, shall ... be guilty of a misdemeanor.' 2 Other provisions authorize resort to the district courts to compel attendance, testimony and production of books. \n3\n While undoubtedly the right of a witness to refuse to answer lest he incriminate himself may be tested in proceedings to compel answer, there is no support for the contention that there must be such a determination of that question before prosecution for the willful failure so denounced. By the very terms of the definition the offense is complete at the time of such failure.\n Immediately in advance of the examination, appellee's counsel discussed with counsel for the Internal Revenue Bureau the matter of appellee's privilege against self-incrimination and stated that he had particularly in mind incrimination under state law. And at the hearing appellee repeatedly stated that, in answering, 'I might incriminate or degrade myself'; he had in mind 'the violation of a state law and not the violation of a federal law.' The transcript included in the plea plainly shows that appellee did not rest his refusal upon apprehension of, or a claim for protection against federal prosecution. The validity of his justification depends, not upon claims that would have been warranted by the facts shown, but upon the claim that actually was made. The privilege of silence is solely for the benefit of the witness and is deemed waived unless invoked. United States ex rel. Vajtauer v. Com'r of Immigration, \n273 \nU.S. 103, 113\n, 47 S. Ct. 302. \n\n[284 U.S. 141, 149]\n\u00a0\n The plea does not rest upon any claim that the inquiries were being made to discover evidence of crime against state law. Nothing of state concern was involved. The investigation was under federal law in respect of federal matters. The information sought was appropriate to enable the Bureau to ascertain whether appellee had in fact made deductible payments in each year as stated in his return, and also to determine the tax liability of the recipients. Investigations for federal purposes may not be prevented by matters depending upon state law. Constitution, art. 6, cl. 2. The English rule of evidence against compulsory self-incrimination, on which historically that contained in the Fifth Amendment rests, does not protect witnesses against disclosing offenses in violation of the laws of another country. King of the Two Sicilies v. Willcox, 7 St. Tr. (N. S.) 1050, 1068; Queen v. Boyes, 1 B. & S. 311, 330. This court has held that immunity against state prosecution is not essential to the validity of federal statutes declaring that a witness shall not be excused from giving evidence on the ground that it will incriminate him, and also that the lack of state power to give witnesses protection against federal prosecution does not defeat a state immunity statute. The principle established is that full and complete immunity against prosecution by the government compelling the witness to answer is equivalent to the protection furnished by the rule against compulsory self-incrimination. Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 \nU.S. 547\n, 12 S. Ct. 195; Brown v. Walker, \n161 \nU.S. 591, 606\n, 16 S. Ct. 644; Jack v. Kansas, \n199 \nU.S. 372, 381\n, 26 S. Ct. 73, 4 Ann. Cas. 689; Hale v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 43, 68\n, 26 S. Ct. 370. As appellee at the hearing did not invoke protection against federal prosecution, his plea is without merit and the government's demurrer should have been sustained.\n We are of opinion that leave to file the plea should have been withheld. The proceedings below are indi- \n\n[284 U.S. 141, 150]\n\u00a0\n cated by a chronological statement printed in the margin. \n4\n After demurrer- not shown by the record to have been disposed of-and motions for a bill of particulars and to suppress evidence which were denied, a plea of not guilty was entered. The case should then have been tried without further form or ceremony. 18 U. S. C.,  564 (18 USCA  564). The matters set forth in the plea were mere matters of defense determinable under the general issue. Federal criminal procedure is governed, not by state practice, but by federal statutes and decisions of the federal courts. United States v. Reid, 12 How. 361; Logan v. United States, \n144 \nU.S. 263, 301\n, 12 S. Ct. 617; Jones v. United States ( C. C. A.) 162 F. 417, 419; United States v. Nye (C. C.) 4 F. 888, 890. Neither require such piecemeal consideration of a case. \n\n[284 U.S. 141, 151]\n\u00a0\n A special plea in bar is appropriate where defendant claims former acquittal, former conviction, or pardon (2 Bishop New Criminal Procedure ( 2d Ed.)  742, 799, 805 et seq.) but there is no warrant for its use to single out for determination in advance of trial matters of defense either on questions of law or fact. That such a practice is inconsistent with prompt and effective administration of the law and is likely to result in numerous hearings, waste of courts' time, and unnecessary delays is well illustrated by the record in this case. The indictment was returned January 23, 1930, the judgment before us was entered more than a year later, and it seems certain that more than two years will have elapsed after indictment before the case can be reached for trial.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'A writ of error may be taken by and on behalf of the United States from the district courts direct to the Supreme Court of the United States in all criminal cases, in the following instances, to wit: ...\n'From the decision or judgment sustaining a special plea in bar, when the defendant has not been put in jeopardy.' 18 U.

RYAN(1931)\nNo. 49\nArgued: Decided: November 23, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 167, 168]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. G. A.Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 167, 169]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George D. Toole, of Butte, Mont., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[284 U.S. 167, 170]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Upon a libel filed by the United States in the District Court for Montana, praying the forfeiture of a bar, back bar, and other saloon furnishings and equipment, seized by federal prohibition agents, it was averred that, at the time and place of seizure, one Lewis had in his possession tax-unpaid intoxicating liquors for the purpose of selling or removing them in fraud of the revenue laws.\n Respondent, Ryan, intervened, claiming the seized property as owner, and set up that none of it was designed for the manufacture of intoxicating liquors, or intended for use in violation of the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA), or subject \n\n[284 U.S. 167, 171]\n\u00a0\n to forfeiture. At the trial it appeared from the evidence that at the time and place of seizure, the place being a so-called soft-drink parlor, in fact used for the sale of intoxicating liquors as beverages, tax-unpaid liquor was possessed for sale and was being sold by Lewis. At the close of the evidence, both sides having moved for a directed verdict, the court withdrew the case from the jury and gave judgment for the government, which the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the forfeiture authorized by Rev. St.  3453, 26 U. S. C.  1185 (26 USCA  1185), is confined to chattels, seized in places in which raw materials are manufactured into taxable articles in fraud of the revenue. 44 F.(2d) 951. This Court granted certiorari, \n283 \nU.S. 816\n, 51 S. Ct. 649, to resolve the conflict between the decision below and that of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in United States v. Ten Bottles of Scotch Whisky, 48 F.(2d) 545.\n The only questions presented here are whether the seized articles are within the definition of the statute and whether forfeiture of them under section 3453 is barred by the arrest and prosecution of Lewis, who controlled or possessed them, for his violation of the National Prohibition Law.\n Section 34531 contains three clauses. The first authorizes forfeiture of taxable 'articles' found in the posses- \n\n[284 U.S. 167, 172]\n\u00a0\n sion, custody, or control of any person 'for the purpose of being sold or removed by him in fraud of the internal-revenue laws.' The second authorizes forfeiture of 'raw materials found in the possession of any person intending to manufacture the same into articles of a kind subject to tax,' with intent to defraud the revenue. The third forfeits 'all tools, implements, instruments, and personal property whatsoever, in the place or building, or within any yard or inclosure where such articles or raw materials are found.' To support the respondent's contention it is necessary to read the phrase 'such articles' in the third clause as not referring to the taxable 'articles' possessed with intent to defraud the revenue described in the first, but only to the 'articles of a kind subject to tax' mentioned in the second, read to mean taxable articles which have been manufactured on the premises. That the phrase should be taken to refer to the articles mentioned in both clauses would seem to be an admissible construction, less restrictive of its natural meaning than that urged.\n We are not called upon to give a strained interpretation in order to avoid a forfeiture. Statutes to prevent fraud on the revenue are construed less narrowly, even though a forfeiture results, than penal statutes and others involving forfeitures. United States v. Stowell, \n133 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 10 S. Ct. 244; Smythe v. Fiske, 23 Wall. 374, 380; United States v. Hodson, 10 Wall. 395, 406; Cliquot's Champagne, 3 Wall. 114, 145; Taylor v. United States, 3 How. 197, 210. \n\n[284 U.S. 167, 173]\n\u00a0\n Section 3453 is a re-enactment of section 9 of the Act of July 13, 1866, c. 184, 14 Stat. 98, 111, amending section 48 of the Act of June 30, 1864, c. 173, 13 Stat. 223, 240. The earlier sections, like the present one, are each made up of three clauses, connected by the conjunction 'and.' In the first two acts, they constitute a single sentence; but in the present section the first clause appears as one sentence, and the other two are combined in a second sentence. The first two clauses of all three acts are substantially the same. The third clause of the act of 1864 provided for forfeiture of 'all tools, implements, instruments, and personal property whatsoever, in the place or building, or within any yard or enclosure where such articles on which duties are imposed, as aforesaid, and intended to be used by them (persons intending to manufacture) in the fraudulent manufacture of such raw materials, shall be found. ...' The apparent purpose was to embrace within the forfeiture at least all personal property seized in the place where taxable articles are found, but the further qualification of the taxable articles as those 'intended to be used ... in the fraudulent manufacture of such raw materials,' seems meaningless unless the phrase be transposed and real as meaning 'and such raw materials intended to be used ... in the manufacture of such articles.' This is the substance of the amendment of 1866, when the third clause took its present form. We think the purpose of it was to remove the ambiguity and uncertainty of the quoted phrase, and not to restrict the forfeiture to chattels associated with the illicit manufacture, to the exclusion of those associated with taxable articles possessed with the purpose to sell or remove in fraud of the revenue, which were evidently intended to be confiscable by the section as originally drawn. We cannot assume that so radical a change, if intended, would have been expressed by language so plainly capable of the opposite construction as that of the act of 1866. \n\n[284 U.S. 167, 174]\n\u00a0\n Nothing in the legislative history is suggested to indicate that such was the intention, and there is no such plain or obvious distinction to be made, in a section devised for the protection of the revenue, between articles associated with illicit manufacture and those associated with illicit possession, each equally frauds upon the revenue, as to be persuasive that the present act was designed to hit the first and not the second. The companion section, 3450 (26 USCA  1181, 1182), authorizing the forfeiture of vehicles and horses used for propelling them made no such distinction. By it, vehicles used for transporting or concealing taxable articles with the prescribed intent are forfeitable, as well as those used to transport or conceal contraband raw material or implements of manufacture. See Goldsmith, Jr.-Grant Co. v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 505\n, 41 S. Ct. 189; United States v. One Ford Coupe , \n272 \nU.S. 321\n, 47 S. Ct. 154, 47 A. L. R. 1025\n\n\n The separation by the revisers of the first clause from the other two by a period instead of a semicolon, retaining the conjunction 'And,' and the dropping of the conjunction 'also' from the second and third clauses, are changes hardly substantial enough to warrant any changed construction of the section. McConald v. Hovey, \n110 \nU.S. 619, 629\n, 4 S. Ct. 142; Anderson v. Pacific Coast S. S. Co., \n225 \nU.S. 187, 199\n, 32 S. Ct. 626; see Buck Stove & Range Co. v. Vickers, \n226 \nU.S. 205, 213\n, 33 S. Ct. 42.\n If the point were more doubtful, we should hesitate to set aside, at this late date, the uniform construction given to the section with respect to this question by the lower federal courts for more than sixty years. United States v. Quantity of Rags, Fed. Cas. No. 16103 (1868); Quantity of Distilled Spirits, Fed. Cas. No. 11494 (1868); compare United States v. Thirty-Three Barrels of Spirits, Fed. Cas. No. 16470 (1868); United States v. Thirty-Six Barrels of High Wines, Fed. Cas. No. 16468 (1870); see United States v. Eighteen Barrels High Wines, Fed. Cas. No. 15033 (1871); United States v. Quantity of Tobacco, Fed. \n\n[284 U.S. 167, 175]\n\u00a0\n Cas. No. 16106 (1872); compare United States v. Distillery at Spring Valley, Fed. Cas. No. 14963 (1873); United States v. Sixteen Barrels of Distilled Spirits, Fed. Cas. No. 16300 (1879); United States v. One Ice Box, 37 F.(2d) 120 (D. C., N. D. Ill. 1930); contra, In re Hurley, 37 F.( 2d) 397 (D. C., W. D. N. Y. 1930); United States v. Ten Bottles of Scotch Whisky, 48 F.(2d) 545 (C. C. A. 2d. 1931). By the adoption of section 3453 in the Revised Statutes, as of December 1, 1873, without substantial change of the section as amended in 1866, Congress must be considered to have adopted the consistent interpretation of the latter as authorizing forfeiture of nontaxed articles found in a place in which taxed articles are either possessed or manufactured with intent to defraud the revenue. Sessions v. Romadka, \n145 \nU.S. 29, 41\n, 42 S., 12 S. Ct. 799; see McCaughn v. Hershey Chocolate Co., \n283 \nU.S. 488\n, 51 S. Ct. 510.\n It is said that the construction urged by the government is inadmissible because so broad as to lead to absured results; that it would permit seizure of chattels having no relation to the taxable articles or their intended sale or removal, if anywhere in the same building or inclosure, and might include chattels possessed on the premises by others having no connection with the taxable articles or their intended sale or removal. But we do not so construe it. To do so would be to justify penalties having no relation to the offense, and the infliction of hardship on innocent persons unnecessary for the protection of the revenue. All laws are to be given a sensible construction. A literal application of a statute which would lead to absurd consequences is to be avoided whenever a reasonable application can be given which is consistent with the legislative purpose. United States v. Katz, \n271 \nU.S. 354\n, 46 S. Ct. 513; United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 \nU.S. 394\n, 36 S. Ct. 658; United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 631.\n Notwithstanding the broad language of the section, we think it may be given a reasonable construction, and the \n\n[284 U.S. 167, 176]\n\u00a0\n one most consistent with its apparent purpose, by the application of the principle noscitur a sociis. The taxed articles and the raw materials intended for manufacture are the principal things aimed at by the statute. Tools and implements by their use are connected incidents. By reason and analogy, as well as by context, we conclude that the general words 'all personal property whatsoever' were intended to include chattels other than the specified tools and implements, but to be restricted to those which, like tools or implements, are related to one or the other of the principal things, or incident to their intended use or disposition in fraud of the revenue. See United States v. Thirty-Three Barrels of Spirits, supra. Here the seized articles, being the furnishings and equipment of a room in which tax-unpaid intoxicating liquors were dispensed, were incident to the sale, and were so related to the tax evasion at which the statute was aimed as to be clearly embraced within both its purpose and its words.\n Respondent's objection that forfeiture under Rev. St.  3453 (26 USCA  1185) is barred by the arrest and prosecution of the offender under the National Prohibition Act is without force. It is true that by the express command of section 26 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA  40), in all cases of arrest for transportation of intoxicating liquors, the transporting vehicle must be seized and proceedings for its forfeiture had under that section and not under Rev. St.  3450 (26 USCA  1181, 1182). Commercial Credit Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 226\n, 48 S. Ct. 232; Richbourg Motor Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 528\n, 50 S. Ct. 385, 73 A. L. R. 1081. But by section 5 of the Willis-Campbell Act of November 23, 1921, c. 134, 42 Stat. 222, 223 (27 USCA  3), all penalties for violation of the revenue laws, not directly in conflict with any provision of the National Prohibition Act, are continued in force. See United States v. One Ford Coupe , supra. There is no question here of use of a vehicle for transportation, and there is nothing in the National Prohibition Act nec- \n\n[284 U.S. 167, 177]\n\u00a0\n essarily or directly in conflict with the application given here to the provisions of section 3453.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] R.

C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 716, 719]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Julius Henry Cohen and Selden Bacon, both of New York City, for appellees.\n\n\n[282 U.S. 716, 729]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States prosecutes this appeal from an order of the District Court (U. S. C. tit. 18,  682; tit. 28,  345 (18 USCA  682; 28 USCA  345)), quashing an indictment which charged appellees with unlawful transportation and possession of intoxicating liquors in violation of section 3 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act (U. S. C. tit. 27,  12 (27 USCA  12)). $That court held that the Eighteenth Amendment by authority of which the statute was enacted has not been ratified so as to become part of the Constitution.\n The appellees contended in the court below, and here, that notwithstanding the plain language of article 5, conferring upon the Congress the choice of method of ratification, as between action by legislatures and by conventions, this Amendment could only be ratified by the latter.\n They say that it was the intent of its framers, and the Constitution must, therefore, be taken impliedly to require, that proposed amendments conferring on the United States new direct powers over individuals shall be ratified in conventions; and that the Eighteenth is of this character. They reach this conclusion from the fact that the framers thought that retification of the Constitution must be by the people in convention assembled and not by legislatures, as the latter were incompetent to surrender the personal liberties of the people to the new na- \n\n[282 U.S. 716, 730]\n\u00a0\n tional government. From this and other considerations, hereinafter noticed, they ask us to hold that article 5 means something different from what it plainly says.\n In addition they urge, that if there be any doubt as to the correctness of their construction of article 5, the Tenth Amendment removes it.\n The District Court refused to follow this reasoning. It quashed the indictment, not as a result of analysis of article 5 and Amendment 10, but by resorting to 'political science,' the 'political thought' of the times, and a 'scientific approach to the problem of government.' These, it thought, compelled it to declare the convention method requisite for ratification of an amendment such as the Eighteenth. The appellees do not attempt to justify the lower court's action by the reasons it states, but by resubmitting to us those urged upon that court and by it rejected.\n The United States asserts that article 5 is clear in statement and in meaning, contains no ambiguity, and calls for no resort to rules ofcon struction. A mere reading demonstrates that this is true. It provides two methods for proposing amendments. Congress may propose them by a vote of two-thirds of both houses; or, on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the States, must call a convention to propose them. Amendments proposed in either way become a part of the Constitution, 'when ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths of the several States or by Conventions in three-fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress. ...'\n The choice, therefore, of the mode of ratification, lies in the sole discretion of Congress. Appellees, however, point out that amendments may be of different kinds, as e. g., mere changes in the character of federal means or machinery, on the one hand, and matters affecting the liberty of the citizen on the other. They say that the \n\n[282 U.S. 716, 731]\n\u00a0\n framers of the Constitution expected the former sort might be ratified by legislatures, since the States as entities would be wholly competent to agree to such alterations, whereas they intended that the latter must be referred to the people because not only of lack power in the legislatures to ratify, but also because of doubt as to their truly representing the people. Counsel advert to the debates in the convention which had to do with the submission of the draft of the Constitution to the legislatures or to conventions, and show that the latter procedure was overwhelmingly adopted. They refer to many expressions in contemporary political literature and in the opinions of this court to the effect that the Constitution derives its sanctions from the people and from the people alone. In spite of the lack of substantial evidence as to the reasons for the changes in statement of article 5 from its proposal until it took final form in the finished draft, they seek to import into the language of the article dealing with amendments, the views of the convention with respect to the proper method of ratification of the instrument as a whole. They say that if the legislatures were considered incompetent to surrender the people's liberties when the ratification of the Constitution itself was involved, a fortiori they are incompetent now to make a further grant. Thus, however, clear the phraseology of article 5, they urge we ought to insert into it a limitation on the discretion conferred on the Congress, so that it will read, 'as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress, as may be appropriate in view of the purpose of the proposed amendment.' This can not be done.\n The Constitution was written to be understood by the voters; its words and phrases were used in their normal and ordinary as distinguished from technical meaning; where the intention in clear there is no room for construction and no excuse for interpolation or addition.

Ct. 463; Story on the Constitution (5th Ed.)  451; Cooley's Constitutional Limitations (2d Ed.) pp. 61, 70.\n If the framers of the instrument had any thought that amendments differing in purpose should be ratified in different ways, nothing would have been simpler that so to phrase article 5 as to exclude implication or speculation. The fact that an instrument drawn with such meticulous care and by men who so well understood now to make language fit their thought does not contain any such limiting phrase affecting the exercise of discretion by the Congress in choosing one or the other alternative mode of ratification is persuasive evidece that no qualification was intended.\n This Court has repeatedly and consistently declared that the choice of mode rests solely in the discretion of Congress. Dodge v. Woolsey, 18 How. 331, 348; Hawke v. Smith (No. 1), \n253 \nU.S. 221\n, 40 S. Ct. 495, 10 A. L. R. 1504; Dillon v. Gloss, \n256 \nU.S. 368\n, 41 S. Ct. 510; National Prohibition Cases, \n253 \nU.S. 350\n, 40 S. Ct. 486, 488. Appellees urge that what was said on the subject in the first three cases cited is dictum. And they argue that although in the last mentioned it was said the 'Amendment, by lawful proposal andratification, has become a part of the Constitution,' the proposition they now present was not before the Court. While the language used in the earlier cases was not in the strict sense necessary to a decision, it is evident that article 5 was carefully examined and that the Court's statements with respect to the power of Congress in proposing the mode of ratifi- \n\n[282 U.S. 716, 733]\n\u00a0\n cation were not idly or lightly made. In the National Prohibition Cases, as shown by the briefs, the contentions now argued were made-the only difference between the presentation there and here being one of form rather than of substance.\n The Tenth Amendment provides:\n'The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.'\n\n Appellees assert this language demonstrates that the people reserved to themselves powers over their own personal liberty, and that the legislatures are not competent to enlarge the powers of the federal government in that behalf. They deduce from this that the people never delegated to the Congress the unrestricted power of choosing the mode of ratification of a proposed amendment. But the argument is a complete non sequitur. The fifth article does not purport to delegate any governmental power to the United States, nor to withhold any from it. On the contrary, as pointed out in Hawke v. Smith (No. 1), supra, that article is a grant of authority by the people to Congress, and not to the United States. It was submitted as part of the original draft of the Constitution to the people in conventions assembled. They deliberately made the grant of power to Congress in respect to the choice of the mode of ratification of amendments. Unless and until that Article be changed by amendment, Congress must function as the delegated agent of the people in the choice of the method of ratification.\n The Tenth Amendment was intended to confirm the understanding of the people at the time the Constitution was adopted, that powers not granted to the United States were reserved to the states or to the people. It added nothing to the instrument as originally ratified and has \n\n[282 U.S. 716, 734]\n\u00a0\n no limited and special operation, as is contended, upon the people's delegation by article 5 of certain functions to the Congress.\n The United States relies upon the fact that every amendment has been adopted by the method pursued in respect of the Eighteenth. Appellees reply that all these save the Eighteenth dealt solely with governmental means and machinery rather than with the rights of the individual citizen. But we think that several amendments touch rights of the citizens, notably the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Sixteenth and Nineteenth, and in view of this, weight is to be given to the fact that these were adopted by the method now attacked. The Pocket Veto Case, supra.\n For these reasons we reiterate what was said in the National Prohibition Cases, supra, that the 'Amendment, by lawful proposal and ratification, has become a part of the Constitution.'\n The order of the court below is reversed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","178":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

The United States asks that the claim of Utah to any right, title, or interest in the river beds in question be adjudged to be null and void, that it be determined that the United States has full and exclusive title thereto, and that injunction issue accordingly.\n By its answer, Utah denies ownership by the United States of the river beds described in the complaint and sets up title in the state, alleging the navigability of the rivers.\n The Court referred he c ase to Charles Warren as special master to take the evidence and to report it with his findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations for decree. Hearings have been had before the master, voluminous evidence has been received, and the master \n\n[283 U.S. 64, 73]\n\u00a0\n has filed his report. The report gives a comprehensive statement of the facts adduced with respect to the topography of the rivers, their history, impediments to navigation, and the use, and susceptibility to use, of the rivers as highways of commerce.\n A distinction in descriptive terms should be noted. When Utah became a state, the Grand river, rising in Colorado and flowing through that state and within Utah to the junction with the Green river, was designated on all government maps and reports as separate from the Colorado river, and the name Colorado river was applied only to the river formed by the confluence of the Green river and the Grand river. The Congress, by the Act of July 25, 1921,2 provided that the river theretofore known as the Grand river, from its source in Colorado to the point where it joined the Green river in Utah and formed the Colorado river, should thereafter be designated as the Colorado river. Considering that this act had no retroactive effect, and as it expressly provided that the change in name should not affect the rights of Colorado and Utah, the master has followed in his report the earlier designations and thus has dealt with four rivers, the beds of which are in question, instead of three; that is, the Green river, the Grand river, the Colorado river (below the junction of the Green and Grand) and the San Juan river.\n The master has made his findings as to navigability as of January 4, 1896, the date of the admission of Utah to the Union. \n3\n The master finds that at that time the following streams in question were navigable waters of Utah: The Green river, from a point where the river crossed the township line between townships 23 and 24 south, range 17 east, Salt Lake base and meridian down to its confluence with the Grand river (about 95 miles); the Grand river, from the mouth of Castle creek down to the confluence of the Grand river with the Green \n\n[283 U.S. 64, 74]\n\u00a0\n river (about 79 miles); and the Colorado river, from Mile 176 above Lees Ferry south to the Utah-Arizona boundary (about 150 miles); and that the following streams were nonnavigable waters of Utah: The Colorado river, south from the confluence of the Green and the Grand rivers down to the end of Cataract Canyon at Mile 176 above Lees Ferry (about 40 miles); and the San Juan river from the mouth of Chinle creek at Mile 133 above the confluence of the San Juan river and the Colorado river down to the mouth of San Juan river.\n On these findings, the master has concluded that the title to the beds of the rivers, where the rivers were found to be navigable as above stated, was in the state of Utah, and, where the rivers were found to be nonnavigable, was in the United States. Accordingly, the master has recommended that the Court enter a decree dismissing the complaint so far as it relates to the bed of the Green river to that portion of the bed of the Colorado river which in 1896 constituted the Grand river, and to that portion of the bed of the Colorado river from Mile 176 above Lees Ferry south to the Utah-Arizona boundary; and that the Court decree that the title to the bed of the Colorado river, from the confluence of the Green river with the Grand river down to the end of Cataract Canyon at Mile 176 above Lees Ferry, and to the bed of the San Juan river, was vested in the United States on January 4, 1896 (except so far as theretofore granted by the United States), and that Utah be enjoined from asserting title or interest therein.\n Both parties have filed exceptions to the master's report.\n Neither party excepts to the finding and conclusion with respect to the nonnavigability of the San Juan river, or of the Colorado river from the first rapid or cataract at Mile 212.15 above Lees Ferry down to he e nd of Cataract Canyon at Mile 176 above Lees Ferry.\n The United States has a large number of exceptions to the findings and conclusions of the master as to the navi- \n\n[283 U.S. 64, 75]\n\u00a0\n gability of the Green river, and of the Grand river down to its junction with the Green river, and of the Colorado river from Mile 176 above Lees Ferry to the Utah-Arizona boundary.\n Utah excepts to the findings and conclusion of the master as to the nonnavigability of the Colorado river from the confluence of the Green river and the Grand river at Mile 216.5 above Lees Ferry down to the first rapid or cataract at Mile 212.15 above Lees Ferry.\n The controversy is with respect to certain facts, and the sufficiency of the basis of fact for a finding of navigability, rather than in relation to the general principles of law that are applicable. In accordance with the constitutional principle of the equality of states, the title to the beds of rivers within Utah passed to that state when it was admitted to the Union, if the rivers were then navigable; and, if they were not then navigable, the title to the river beds remained in the United States. \n4\n The question of navigability is thus determinative of the controversy, and that is a federal question. This is so, although it is undisputed that none of the portions of the rivers under consideration constitute navigable waters of the United States, that is, they are not navigable in interstate or foreign commerce, and the question is whether they are navigable waters of the State of Utah. \n5\n State laws6 cannot affect titles vested in the United States. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[283 U.S. 64, 76]\n\u00a0\n The test of navigability has frequently been stated by this Court. In The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 563, the Court said: 'Those rivers must be regarded as public navigable rivers in law which are navigable in fact. And they are navigable in fact when they are used, or are susceptible of being used, in their ordinary condition, as highways for commerce, over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water.' In The Montello, 20 Wall. 430, 441, 442, it was pointed out that 'the true test of the navigability of a stream does not depend on the mode by which commerce is, or may be, conducted, nor the difficulties attending navigation,' and that 'it would be a narrow rule to hold that in this country, unless a river was capable of being navigated by steam or sail vessels, it could not be treated as a public highway.' The principles thus laid down have recently been restated in United States v. Holt State Bank, \n270 \nU.S. 49, 56\n, 46 S. Ct. 197, 199, where the Court said:\n'The rule long since approved by this court in applying the Constitution and laws of the United States is that streams or lakes which are navigable in fact must be regarded as navigable in law; that they are navigable in fact when they are used, or are susceptible of being used, in their natural and ordinary condition, as highways for commerce, over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the usto mary modes of trade and travel on water; and further that navigability does not depend on the particular mode in which such use is or may be had-whether by steamboats, sailing vessels or flatboats-nor on an absence of occasional difficulties in navigation, but on the fact, if it be a fact, that the stream in its natural and ordinary condition affords a channel for useful commerce.' 8 \n\n[283 U.S. 64, 77]\n\u00a0\n In the present instance, the controversy relates only to the sections of the rivers which are described in the complaint, and the master has limited his findings and conclusions as to navigability accordingly. The propriety of this course, in view of the physical characteristics of the streams, is apparent. Even where the navigability of a river, speaking generally, is a matter of common knowledge, and hence one of which judicial notice may be taken, it may yet be a question, to be determined upon evidence, how far navigability extends. \n9\n The question here is not with respect to a short interruption of navigability in a stream otherwise navigable,10 or of a negligible part, which boats may use, of a stream otherwise nonnavigable. We are concerned with long reaches with particular characteristics of navigability or nonnavigability, which the master's report fully describes.\n\n The Green river has its source in the mountains of Western Wyoming and has a total length of about 700 miles. After passing through a series of canyons, the rock walls of which are of great height, it enters the Green River valley in which the town of Green River, Utah, is situated, about 117 miles above the river's mouth. The drop in elevation between the town of Green River, Wyo., and Green River, Utah, is from 6,067 to 4,046 feet-2,021 feet in 387 miles causing many difficult and dangerous rapids. For the first 23 miles below the town of Green River, Utah, to the point where the San Rafael river enters from the west, the country is more or less open. From \n\n[283 U.S. 64, 78]\n\u00a0\n the mouth of the San Rafael river (approximately the beginning of the section to which the controversy relates) to the junction of the Green and Grand rivers, there is a very gradual slope, there being a drop of 111 feet in the 94 miles. In this section the river flows through Labyrinth and Stillwater Canyons, the rock walls of which in many places rise almost vertically from the water's edge, and in other places are over a thousand feet apart, with heights of 600 to 1,300 feet. The average width of the river is from 500 to 700 feet. In four or five places there are bottom lands along the side in the canyons. The course of the river is tortuous; the distance (in this section) in a straight line being less than one-half that by the river. The government maintains gauging stations to measure the depth, the velocity, and the amount of discharge of water. On the Green river the gauge was located at or near the town of Green River, Utah. From these measurements the master finds that the depth of the Green river ranged from between 1 1\/2 and 3 feet for 53 days in the year to between 7 and 12 feet for 60 days, and that for 312 days in the year there was a depth of 3 feet or over. For 290 days in the year there was a discharge of over 2,000 cubic feet per second, and, for 149 days, of over 4,200 cubic feet per second.\n The Grand river rises in North-Central Colorado and flows to its junction with the Green river in Utah, approximately about 423 miles. Its course is through a succession of long, narrow, fertile valleys, alternating with deep canyons, with walls, in places, of over 2,000 feet in height. There are many difficult and dangerous rapids. The total drop from Grand Junction, Colo., to Castle Creek, Utah (where the section in controversy begins), is from 4,552 feet in elevation to 3,993 feet, a drop of 559 feet in 94 miles. From Castle Creek to the town of Moab, 14 miles, the slope averages 3.5 feet per mile, and there are slight rapids or riffles and rocks in the stream. At \n\n[283 U.S. 64, 79]\n\u00a0\n Moab there is an open valley, leaving which the Grand river flows 65 1\/2 miles largely through rock canyons having walls 600 to 2,100 feet in height. The course of the Grand river in this section is slightly more tortuous than that of the Green river; the width of the river averages about 500 feet and the slope below Moab is only a little over 1 foot per mile. The government's gauge was located at Cisco, about 17 miles above Castle Creek. From readings at that point, the master finds that the depths of the river vary from 2.9 to 3 feet for 16 days in the year to over 7 feet for 61 days, and that for 349 days in the year there is a depth of 3 feet or over. There is a discharge of over 2,000 cubic feet per second for 351 days in the year, and for 169 days of over 4,200 cubic feet per second.\n The master finds that on the Grand river, in the 79 miles between Castle Creek and the junction with the Green river, there is a stretch of about three miles out of the first 14 miles between Castle Creek and Moab Bridge in which there are three small rapids, and that, in this stretch, the river is less susceptible of practical navigation for commercial purposes than in the remainder of the river. But the master finds that, even in this 3-mile stretch, the river is susceptible of being used for the transportation of lumber rafts, and that there has been in the past considerable use of the river for that purpose.\n The Colorado river, that is, treating the river as beginning at the junction of the Green and Grand rivers, flows southwesterly and finally reaches the Gulf of California. The distance from the confluence of the Green and Grand rivers in Utah to the Utah-Arizona boundary is about 189 miles; the boundary being about 27 miles above the point known as Lees Ferry in Arizona. The table of distances gives the junction of the Green and the Grand rivers as being 216.5 miles above Lees Ferry. The master finds that the Colorado river is nonnavigable from this junction down to the end of Cataract Canyon at Mile \n\n[283 U.S. 64, 80]\n\u00a0\n 176 above Lees Ferry. The state of Utah contests the finding of the master with respect to the first 4.35 miles of this stretch of the river; that is, to a point 212.15 miles above Lees Ferry (a question to which we shall return in dealing with Utah's exceptions), where it is said that the first rapid or cataract of Cataract Canyon begins. But there is no controversy as to the nonnavigability of the stream from this point through Cataract Canyon down to Mile 176 above Lees Ferry. Through this canyon, with rock walls from 1,500 to 2,700 feet in height, the river has a rapid descent or slope of about 399 feet, a drop of 11 feet per mile, with a long series of high and dangerous rapids.\n The master's finding of navigability relates to the section of the river from Cataract Canyon to the Utah-Arizona boundary. At the end of Cataract Canyon (the end of the portion of it known as Dark Canyon), the country becomes more open, the river somewhat wider, and the canyon walls not over 600 feet in height, this stretch being known as Glen Canyon. Two rivers enter from the west, the Fremont andthe Escalante, and one from the east, the San Juan. As the Colorado river approaches the Utah-Arizona boundary, the canyon walls increase in height and average 1,300 to 1,600 feet. There are various points at which bottom lands are cultivated in the river beds. The width of the river averages from 600 to 700 feet. Its slope through this section is gentle, being less than 2 feet per mile. As to the 90 miles of Glen Canyon, that is, from Mile 176 above Lees Ferry to the mouth of the San Juan river, the master states that there are no gauging station figures of any discharge, flow, and depth which are applicable, but the master finds that, as the waters of the Green and the Grand rivers join and form the Colorado river, there must be a discharge of water in the Glen Canyon stretch equal to the combined discharge of the other two rivers, and hence at \n\n[283 U.S. 64, 81]\n\u00a0\n all times sufficient water for navigation so far as discharge alone is concerned. As to depth, the master finds that the Colorado river in this stretch should have a depth at least equal to that of the Green or the Grand river. Between the mouth of the San Juan river and the Utah-Arizona boundary, figures were obtained from the Lees Ferry gauging station from which it appears that the average depths range from between 3 and 4 feet for 17 days in the year to over 8 feet for 124 days in the year, and that the discharge varies from less than 4,000 cubic feet per second for 13 days in the year to over 6,000 feet per second for 352 days in the year.\n The question thus comes to the use, and the susceptibility to use, for commerce of the sections of these rivers which the master has found to be navigable.\n The United States, in support of its exceptions, stresses the absence of historical data showing the early navigation of these waters by Indians, fur traders, and early explorers, that is, uses of the sort to which this Court has had occasion to refer in considering the navigability of certain other streams. 11 The master has made an elaborate review of the history of the rivers from the year 1540 to 1869, and reaches the conclusion that neither 'the limited historical facts put in evidence by the Government or the more comprehensive investigation into the history of these regions' tends to support the contention that the nonuse of these rivers in this historical period 'is weighty evidence that they were non-navigable in 1896 in fact and in law.' The master points out that the nonsettlement of Eastern Utah in these years, the fact that none of the trails to Western Utah or to California were usable to advantage in connection with these rivers, and many other facts, are to be considered in connection with that of nonuse. \n\n[283 U.S. 64, 82]\n\u00a0\n Coming to the later period, that is, since 1869, the master has set forth with much detail the actual navigation of the rivers with full description of the size and character of boats, and the circumstances of use. It appears that navigation began in 1869 with the expedition of Major John W. Powell down the Green and the Colorado rivers, and this was followed by his second trip in 1871. It is said that there were no further attempts at navigation for 17 years. There was a survey by Robert Brewster Stanton in 1889, and in the succeeding years there were a large number of enterprises, with boats of various sorts, including rowboats, flatboats, steamboats, motorboats, barges and scows, some being used for exploration, some for pleasure, some to carry passengers and supplies, and others in connection with prospecting, surveying, and mining operations. Much of this evidence as to actual navigation relates to the period after 1896, but the evidence was properly received and is reviewed by the master as being relevant upon the issue of the susceptibility of the rivers to use as highways of commerce at the time Utah was admitted to the Union.\n The question of that susceptibility in the ordinary condition of the rivers, rather than of the mere manner or extent of actual use, is the crucial question. The government insists that the uses of the rivers have been more of a private nature than of a public, commercial sort. But, assuming this to be the fact, it cannot be regarded as controlling when the rivers are shown to be capable of commercial use. The extent of existing commerce is not the test. The evidence of the actual use of streams, and especially of extensive and continued use for commercial purposes may be most persuasive, but, where conditions of exploration and settlement explain the infrequency or limited nature of such use, the susceptibility to use as a highway of commerce may still be satisfactorily proved. As the Court said, in Packer v. Bird, \n137 \nU.S. 661, 667\n, 11 S. Ct. 210, 211: 'It \n\n[283 U.S. 64, 83]\n\u00a0\n is, indeed, the susceptibility to use as highways of commerce which gives sanction to the public right of control over navigation upon them, and consequently to the exclusion of private ownership, either of the waters or the soils under them.' In Economy Light & Power Company v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 113, 122\n, 123 S., 41 S. Ct. 409, 412, the Court quoted with approval the statement in The Montello, supra, that 'the capability of use by the public for purposes of transportation and commerce affords the true criterion of the navigability of a river, rather than the extent and manner of that use.'\n It is true that the region through which the rivers flow is sparsely settled. The towns of Green River and Moab are small, and otherwise the county in the vicinity of the streams has but few inhabitants. In view of past conditions, the government urges that the consideration of future commerce is too speculative to be entertained. Rather is it true that, as the title of a state depends upon the issue, the possibilities of growth and future profitable use are not to be ignored. Utah, with its equality of right as a state of the Union, is not to be denied title to the beds of such of its rivers as were navigable in fact at the time of the admission of the state either because the location of the rivers and the circumstances of the exploration and settlement of the country through which they flowed had made recourse to navigation a late adventure or because commercial utilization on a large scale awaits future demands. The question remains one of fact as to the capacity of the rivers in their ordinary condition to meet the needs of commerce as these may arise in connection with the growth of the population, the multiplication of activities, and the development of natural resources. And this capacity may be shown by physical characteristics and experimentation as well as by the uses to which the streams have been put. \n\n[283 U.S. 64, 84]\n\u00a0\n The controversy as to navigability is largely with respect to impediments to navigation in the portions of the rivers found by the master to be navigable, and as to these impediments there is much testimony and a sharp conflict in inferences and argument. The government describes these impediments as being logs and debris, ice, floods, rapids, and riffles in certain parts, rapid velocities with sudden changes in the water level, sand and sediment which, combined with the tortuous course of the rivers, produce a succession of shifting sand bars, shallow depths, and instability of channel.\n The master states that, while there is testimony that in floods and periods of high water these rivers carry a considerable quantity of logs and driftwood, the evidence as to actual trips made by witnesses discloses little danger thereby incurred except in the case of paddle-wheel boats. The master's finding, which the evidence supports, is that this condition does not constitute a serious obstacle to navigation. With respect to ice, it is sufficient to say, as the master finds, that ice periods on these rivers do not prevail in every winter, and that they are shorter than on most of the rivers in the Northern and Northeastern States of the country. As to floods, it appears that there are months of extreem high water caused by the melting of snows in the mountains and also local floods of short duration caused by rainstorms. From the testimony of the witnesses who have actually boated on these rivers, the master is unable to find that this element of variation in flow, or of rapidity of variation, has constituted any marked impediment to the operation of boats except possibly in one or two instances. In relation to rapids, riffles, rapid water, and velocity of current, the master uses the classifications of an engineer presented by the government, and finds that in the portions of the Green river involved in this suit there are no rapids, riffles, or rapid water, and that the slope of the bed is only a little over \n\n[283 U.S. 64, 85]\n\u00a0\n one foot per mile; that there is a stretch on the Grand river (above Moab Bridge) where there are three small rapids, already mentioned, and also 2 1\/2 miles of rapid water, but that this is a stretch of only six miles in all, and is not characteristic of the whole section of the Grand river here in controversy. It appears that, neither the current nor the velocity of the Green and Grand rivers impede navigation to any great extent except in the days of extreme or sudden flood, and that motorboats of proper construction, power, and draft can navigate upstream without trouble, so far as current or velocity alone is concerned. The slope of the section of the Colorado river which the master has found to be navigable is for the most part slight, as already stated; there are four drops in elevation which may be called small rapids, but it appears that these do not ordinarily make necessary any portage of boat or cargo.\n The principal impediment to navigation is found is shifting sandbars. As the rivers carry large amounts of fine silt, sandbars of various types are formed. The master's report deals with this matter at length. Referring to the Green and the Grand rivers, the master states that the most constant type of sandbar forms on the sides of the rivers on the convex curves or inside of the bends; that changes in discharge and in velocity, and floods caused by sudden heavy rains, may affect the size, shape, and height of these side sandbars, but, in general, after the spring high water has receded, these sandbars have constant and fixed locations. There is a second type of bar which forms at the mouth of tributary streams, creeks, or washes, usually at times of sudden floods caused by heavy summer rains, and these generally are of short duration. A third type consists of what is termed 'crossing bars' which are formed below the places where the rivers cross from one side to the other in following the curves or bends; wherever these crossing bars occur, there \n\n[283 U.S. 64, 86]\n\u00a0\n is generally more or less difficulty in ascertaining the course of the channel, as the stream may divide into several channels, or it may distribute itself over the full length of the bar so as greatly to lessen the depth of the water from that prevailing in the well-defined channels which follow the bends. There are frequent and sudden variations in these bars resulting in changes in the course of the channel. The bed of the Colorado river above the mouth of the San Juan is found to be more gravelly than that of the Green and Grand rivers. There are, however, long high side bars of sand and gravel on which placer mining has been done and also a few sandbars or bottoms which have been cultivated. Crossing bars, occur, but not as frequently as on the Green and Grand rivers, and they cause less trouble. After the recession of the water at the end of the high-water season, the channel remains more or less stable during the rest of the year, although there are temporary changes. In general, the channel is less shifting than on the Green and Grand rivers, and the river is less tortuous.\n Recognizing the difficulties which are thus created, the master is plainly right in his conclusion that the mere fact of the presence of such sandbars causing impediments to navigation does not make a river nonnavigable. It is sufficent to refer to the well-known conditions on the Missouri river and the Mississippi river. The presence of sandbars must be taken in connection with other factors making for navigability. In The Montello, supra, the Court said: 'Indeed, there are but few of our fresh-water rivers which did not originally present serious obstructions to an uninterrupted navigation. In some cases, like the Fox River, they may be so great while they last as to prevent the use of the best instrumentalities for carrying on commerce, but the vital and essential point is whether the natural navigation of the river is such that it affords a channel for useful commerce. If this be so the river is navigable in fact, although its navigation may be encompassed with difficul- \n\n[283 U.S. 64, 87]\n\u00a0\n ties by reason of natural barriers, such as rapids and sand-bars.'\n The government invites a comparison with the conditions found to exist on the Rio Grande river in New Mexico, and the Red river and the Arkansas river, above the mouth of the Grand river, in Oklahoma, which were held to be nonnavigable, but the comparison does not aid the government's contention. Each determination as to navigability must stand on its own facts. In each of the cases to which the government refers, it was found that the use of the stream for purposes of transportation was exceptional, being practicable only in times of temporary highwater. \n12\n In the present instance, with respect to each of the sections of the rivers found to be navigable, the master has determined upon adequate evidence that 'its susceptibility of use as a highway for commerce was not confined to exceptional conditions or short periods of temporary high water, but that during at least nine months of each year the river ordinarily was susceptible of such use as a highway for commerce.' \n\n[283 U.S. 64, 88]\n\u00a0\n The government invokes an Executive Order of May 17, 1884, withdrawing lands from sale and settlement in order to provide a reservation for Indian purposes in Utah, in which the boundary of the reservation wad described as running 'up and along the middle of the channel' of the Colorado and San Juan rivers. This is said to have included the Colorado river from the Utah-Arizona boundary to the mouth of the San Juan river. This Executive Order was revoked by another Executive Order of November 19, 1892, so far as it affected lands west of the 110th degree of west longitude and within the Territory of Utah, thus excluding the lands in question along the Colorado river. The earlier Executive Order did not constitute a grant such as that which was under consideration in Brewer-Elliott Oil & Gas Company v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 77, 80\n, 85 S., 43 S. Ct. 60, and it does not appear that the question of the navigability of the rivers was considered when that order was made. The government also refers to proceedings since Utah became a state, with respect to governmental investigations, operations under placer claims, and withdrawals for power and reservoir sites. It is not necessary to review these transactions in detail, as nothing that has been done alters the essential facts with respect to the navigability of the streams, and the United States could \n\n[283 U.S. 64, 89]\n\u00a0\n not, without the consent of Utah, divest that state of title to the beds of the rivers which the state had acquired. Nor has Utah taken any action which could be deemed to estop the state from asserting title.\n We conclude that the findings of the master, so far as they relate to the sections of the Green, the Grand, and the Colorado rivers, found by him to be navigable, are justified by the evidence and that the title to the beds of these sections of the rivers vested in Utah when that state was admitted to the Union. The exceptions of the government are overruled.\n The state of Utah excepts to the finding of the master as to nonnavigability so far as it relates to the first 4.35 miles of the stretch of the Colorado river south from the confluence of the Green river with the Grand river. In the master's report, this short stretch is included, without separate or particular characterization, in the section of the Colorado river found to be nonnavigable through Cataract Canyon to Mile 176 above Lees Ferry. Utah contends that the portion of the Colorado river immediately below the junction of the Green and the Grand rivers, at Mile 216.5 above Lees Ferry, does not differ in its characteristics, with respect to navigability, from these streams as they reach the point of confluence, save that there is more water and a slightly increased gradient, and that no difficulties in navigation appear until the first rapid in Cataract Canyon is reached at Mile 212.15 above Lees Ferry. In the classification made by the government engineer with respect to rapids and rapid water, to which reference has been made, 4.2 miles of this stretch (to Mile 212.3 above Lees Ferry) are described as quiet water, and the government has not called our attention to any facts which would substantially differentiate this portion of the Colorado river, immediately below the confluence of the Green and Grand rivers, from those parts of these rivers found by the master to be navigable. \n\n[283 U.S. 64, 90]\n\u00a0\n On the assumption that there is not basis for such a differentiation as to navigability in fact, the exception of Utah in this respect should be sustained. In this view, however, the exact point at which navigability may be deemed to end, in the approach to Cataract Canyon, should be determined precisely. This determination may be left, for the present, to the agreement of the parties, and, if they are unable to agree, they may submit their views in connection with the settlement of the decree.\n Utah also excepts to the recommendation of the master that the decree contain a proviso that the United States 'shall in no wise be prevented from taking any such action in relation to said rivers or any of them as may be necesary to protect and preserve the navigability of any navigable waters of the United States.' While a statement to that effect is not necessary, as the United States would have this authority in any event, the provision is not inappropriate in a decree determining the right, title, or interest of the United States and of Utah, respectively, in relation to the beds of the rivers in question, and its inclusion may avoid misapprehension of the effect of the decree. This exception and the remaining exception of Utah, which does not require separate examination, are overruled.\n Decree will be entered dismissing the complaint of the United States so far as it relates to the beds of the portions of the Green, Grand, and Colorado rivers found to be navigable, as above stated, and adjudging that title to such beds was vested in Utah on January 4, 1896, except so far as the United States may theretofore have made grants thereof; and also adjudging that, on that date (except as to lands theretofore granted), title to the beds of the portion of the Colorado river and of the San Juan river, where there rivers are found to be nonnavigable, was vested in the United States. The decree shall also contain the proviso above mentioned. Each party will \n\n[283 U.S. 64, 91]\n\u00a0\n pay its own costs, one-half of the expenses incurred by the master, and one-half of the amount to be fixed by the Court as his compensation.\n The government will prepare a form of decree in accordance with this decision, and furnish a copy to the state of Utah within 15 days; and, within 10 days after such submission, the draft decree, together with suggestions on behalf of the state of Utah, if any, will be submitted to the Court. \n1\n\u00a0\n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] For decree pursuant to opinion, see \n283 \nU.S. 801\n, 51 S.

Ct. 770, 773): 'Its use for any purposes of transportation has been and is exceptional, and only in times of temporary high water. The ordinary flow of water is insufficient. It is not like the Fox river, which was considered in The Montello, in which was an abundant flow of water and a general capacity for navigation along its entire length, and, although it was obstructed at certain places by rapids and rocks, yet these difficulties could be overcome by canals and locks, and when so overcome would leave the stream, in its ordinary condition, susceptible of use for general navigation purposes.' In Oklahoma v. Texas, \n258 \nU.S. 574, 587\n, 42 S. Ct. 406, 411, the Court, describing the Red river in the western part of Oklahoma, said that 'only for short intervals, when the rainfall is running off, are the volume and depth of the water such that even very small boats could be operated therein. ... The rises usually last from 1 to 7 days and in the aggregate seldom cover as much as 40 days in the year'; and, in relation to the eastern part of the river, it was found (Id., page 591 of 258 U. S., 42 S. Ct. 406, 413) that 'its characteristics are such that its use for transportation has been and must be exceptional, and confined to the irregular and short periods of temporary highwater.' In Brewer-Elliott Oil & Gas Co. v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 77, 86\n, 43 S. Ct. 60, the Court accepted the findings of the two courts below as to the nonnavigability of the Arkansas river above the mouth of the Grand river in Oklahoma, and the District Court, to whose findings the Circuit Court of Appeals referred, had said that 'The use of that portion of the river for transportation boats has been exceptional and necessarily on high water, was found impractical, and was abandoned. The rafting of logs or freight has been attended with difficulties precluding utility. There was no practical susceptibility to use as a highway of trade or travel.' Id. (D. C.) 249 F. 609, 623; Id.

SWIFT & CO.(1931)\nNo. 56\nArgued: Decided: February 2, 1931\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Chas. B. Rugg, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. G. Carroll Todd, of Washington, D. C., for respondent. \n\n[282 U.S. 468, 469]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action by respondent for the recovery of the amount of an admitted overpayment of income and war profits taxes for the taxable year 1917, with interest.\n In its return for 1917, respondent included the value of stock dividends received. February 28, 1923, it filed a claim for refund, alleging that the dividends in question should have been allocated to other years than 1917. The claim was rejected. Subsequently this court decided that stock dividends did not constitute income, as efi ned by the Sixteenth Amendment. Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 \nU.S. 189\n, 40 S. Ct. 189, 9 A. L. R. 1570. September 3, 1927, respondent filed a second claim for refund, which it designated as an amended claim, and therein for the first time asserted that the dividends did not constitute taxable income. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the latter claim was barred by the statute of limitations, and rejected it.\n The respondent's position is that the second claim should be construed as an amendment of the first; but, if not, then, treating the second as an original claim, it was filed within the time required by law and should have been allowed. The Court of Claims (68 Ct. Cl. 97) overruled respondent's first contention, but held with it upon its second, and entered judgment in its favor. Upon the petition of the United States, this court granted a writ of certiorari. \n281 \nU.S. 709\n, 50 S. Ct. 250\n\n\n If the Court of Claims was right in its disposition of respondent's second contention, we need not trouble ourselves with respect to the first. It is admitted that, if the later claim for refund was filed in time, the respondent should recover. The sums of which a refund is sought were not paid in cash, but consisted of a credit of an amount overpaid for other taxable years. Whether the claim was filed in due time depends, therefore, upon a determination of the date when the credit was allowed \n\n[282 U.S. 468, 470]\n\u00a0\n within the meaning of the statutes. Section 252 of the Revenue Act of 1921 ( 42 Stat. 268) contains the following provision:\n'That if, upon examination of any return of income made pursuant to ... the Revenue Act of 1917, ... it appears that an amount of income, war-profits or excess-profits tax has been paid in excess of that properly due, then, notwithstanding the provisions of section 3228 of the Revised Statutes, the amount of the excess shall be credited against any income, war-profits or excess-profits taxes, or installment thereof, then due from the taxpayer under any other return, and any balance of such excess shall be immediately refunded to the taxpayer: Provided, That no such credit or refund shall be allowed or made after five years from the date when the return was due, unless before the expiration of such five years a claim therefor is filed by the taxpayer. ...'\n\n The applicable portion of section 284(b)(1) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 66, 26 USCA  1065(b)(1) follows:\n'No such credit or refund shall be allowed or made after ... four years from the time the tax was paid in the case of a tax imposed by any prior Act, unless before the expiration of such period a claim therefor is filed by the taxpayer. ...'\n\n Under the quoted statutes the respondent was required to file its claim within four years from the date of the allowance of the credit. The petitioner asserts that the credit was allowed on February 9, 1923, when the Commissioner certified the overassessment to the collector. The respondent insists that it was when the Commissioner signed the schedule of refunds and credits as reported by the collector on September 6, 1923. The earlier date is more than four years from the filing of the claim, and the later one is within said period. \n\n[282 U.S. 468, 471]\n\u00a0\n The issue thus raised will be resolved by determining what act constituted the allowance of the credit. Proper decision requires an understanding of the procedure followed in such cases.\n The record discloses that the practice of the Bureau was in the first instance to examine the taxpayer's return, and, if it disclosed an overassessment, to prepare for the Commissioner a so-called certificate of overassessment, which when certified by the Deputy Commissioner went to the Commissioner. When the Commissioner had accumulated a number of such certificates with respect to taxpayers in a single collection district, a form called a schedule of overassessments was prepared; one line on such schedule dealing with each taxpayer's account for the taxable year in question. On this scheule was noted the overassessment of the taxpayer, and blanks were left for further entries by the collector of the district. To it was attached a subsidiary schedule, called a schedule of refunds and credits, on which the collector should make report of his actions pursuant to the schedule of overassessments, and these two schedules, together with the individual certificates of overassessment, were forwarded to the collector. On the schedule of overassessments were certain printed instructions as follows:\n'The several amounts herein noted as reduction of tax liability are hereby approved and allowed.\n\n'You will immediately check the items herein against the accounts of the several taxpayers and determine whether the several amounts in which the tax liability has been reduced should be abated in whole or in part and make such abatement as may be warranted by the condition of the taxpayer's account for the year involved.\n\n'If any part of the tax is found to be an overpayment, you will examine all accounts of the taxpayer for sub- \n\n[282 U.S. 468, 472]\n\u00a0\n sequent periods and apply such overpayment as a credit against the tax owing (if any) on the taxpayer's account for subsequent periods. ( This applies to income, war-profits and excess-profits taxes only.)\n\n'The balance (if any) of the overpayment shall be entered in column 12 and placed upon a schedule of refunds (Form 7777A) and an appropriate memorandum made upon the taxpayer's account.\n\n'You will thereupon complete and certify this schedule and Schedule 7777A and return three copies of each to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue at Washington, making the appropriate entries in your accounts.1\n\n The Commissioner, when he forwarded these papers to the collector, had no way of knowing whether the overassessment would bring about an abatement of taxes theretofore assessed and unpaid, or would result in an overpayment by the Taxpayer. This could only be ascertained by the collector from the books and records kept by him. Moreover, after the collector ascertained whether an overpayment resulted, he would have to determine from his books and records the further question whether such overpayment should be applied as a credit on taxes due, or, in the absence of any taxes due, ought to be refunded.\n When the collector had completed his investigation and filled in the information as to abatement, overpayment, credit, and refund on the schedule of assessments, and the subsidiary schedule of refunds and credits, he certified the correctness of these schedules and returned them, together with the certificates of overassessment, to the Bureau in Washington. There the schedule and certificate were examined by the Deputy Commissioner, checked by him \n\n[282 U.S. 468, 473]\n\u00a0\n to ascertain whether they were correct, and forwarded by him to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for action. On the basis of his deputy's certificate, the Commissioner would certify the schedule of refunds thus directing the disbursing clerk of the Treasury to draw checks for refunds shown on the schedule and checks for the interest, if any, on such refunds and on credits. Meantime the amounts shown on the schedule with respect to each taxpayer's account had been copied on the certificate of overassessment of that taxpayer, and, when checks had been prepared for refunds and interest, if any, the certificate of overassessment, together with the checks, were sent to the collector to be by him mailed to the taxpayer. The first official notification which the taxpayer received as to how his account had been handled with respect to abatement, credit, refund, and interest was the certificate of overassessment which accompanied the check for the payment due him, if any. If there were no payment due him, he received a certificate of overassessment with the amount of the credit which had been allowed him noted upon it. t i  true that this certificate of overassessment stated that credit would be given, refund would be made, etc., whereas the credit had already been given and the refund check accompanied the certificate when it reached the taxpayer, but we do not think this affects the question of the date of allowance.\n One of three dates may possibly be considered the date of the allowance of the credit-that on which the Commissioner forwarded the schedule of overassessments to the collector, that on which the Collector finished his calculations and entered the amount of the credit in the taxpayer's account, or that on which the Commissioner approved the schedule of credits and refunds. The petitioner insists upon the first and the respondent upon the last as the date of allowance of the credit; alternatively \n\n[282 U.S. 468, 474]\n\u00a0\n the United States says that, if the first be not the date of the allowance, the intermediate one is.\n In Girard Trust Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 163\n, 46 S. Ct. 229, 232, this court, after adverting to the above-mentioned procedure, said:\n'We cannot concur, however, in the view of the Treasury Department that the date of the allowance of the claim as intended by the statute is the date when the Commissioner first decides that there has been an overassessment and sends upon a proper form his decision to the collector of internal revenue, who made the collection and keeps the account with the taxpayer. ...'\n\n In the same case it was also said:\n'The Commissioner of Internal Revenue is the final judge in the administrative branch of the government to decide that an overassessment has been made and that a refund or credit should be granted, and when he has made that decision finally, he has allowed the claim for the refund or credit of the taxes paid within the meaning of the section.'\n\n It is conceded that the quoted language applies to the present case, but petitioner points out that it was used in a case in which only the date of allowance of a refund was involved. It is urged that, as respects the allowance of a credit, it was dictum; that, conceding its correctness with respect to the date of allowance of a refund, different considerations apply with respect to a credit. The petitioner argues that, as was stated in the Girard Trust Company Case, the last significant act done by the Commissioner is to authorize the refund, that being in fact made by the drawing of a check by a clerk and the mailing of a check by the collector, whereas in the case of a credit the last act of authorization is the forwarding of the schedule of overassessments to the collector, who then does the mere ministerial act of making the necessary calculations and ascertaining and entering the proper amount of the credit \n\n[282 U.S. 468, 475]\n\u00a0\n on his books and on the schedule of refunds and credits which is to be returned to the Commissioner. It insists that, when the schedule of refunds and credits is returned to the Commissioner, he does authorize the drawing of checks for refunds, but does nothing whatever with respect to the credits shown on the schedule, merely filing it for reference. There is evidence, however, that the subordinates of the Commissioner check the calculations shown on the schedules when they are returned to the Bureau; that the Deputy Commissioner certifies the correctness of the schedule to the Commissioner; and that the official record of the credit is the schedule approved by the Commissioner and filed in his office. Moreover, the final act, so far as the taxpayer is concerned, is the receipt from the collector of the certificate showing how the overassessment has been applied.\n When he executes the schedule of overassessments the Commissioner has no knowledge as to what the collector's account with the taxpayer shows. He does not know whether the overassessment will be entirely used up in abatements, or whether, if an overpayment is shown, it will have to be apportioned partly as a credit and partly as a refund. It is true that the Commissioner's directions to the collector are thatthe latter shall examine the accounts and make the proper allocations, and it is true that the collector's action is so doing is ministerial. But after that clerical work is performed the practice requires the return to the Commissioner of a statement or schedule of the allocations, the approval of that schedule by him, and the mailing of the certificate of overassessment, executed on his behalf, to the taxpayer. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the Commissioner might not order corrections to be made in the accounts of the taxpayer prior to the mailing of this certificate. The proofs do not disclose that he has not in practice done so. As the sole discretion and authority to allow a credit rests \n\n[282 U.S. 468, 476]\n\u00a0\n with the Commissioner, we think that, in the light of the procedure above outlined, his approval of the schedule of credits and refunds must be taken to be the final exercise of that discretion and the allowance of the credit. This construction of the act brings about uniformity in administration, as it makes the allowance of credits and refunds simultaneous.\n It results that, even though the second claim for refund filed by the respondent be treated not as an amendment of its original claim of 1923, but as a new and independent claim, it was filed within four years of the payment of the tax, since that payment must be taken to have occurred on the date of the allowance of the credit by the Commissioner's signature approving the schedule of refunds and credits. Such approval was given as respects the credit to respondent on September 6, 1923, which was within four years of the date of the filing of the second claim.\n The views herein expressed make it unnecessary to decide whether the later claim may properly be considered an amendment of the original claim for refund.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] At the time here in question the schedule of refunds, Form 7777A, referred to in the last two paragraphs of these instructions, had been changed to a schedule of refunds and credits, Form 7805A. \n\n\n\n\n","180":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. VANBIERVLIET(1931)\nNo. 163\nArgued: Decided: December 14, 1931\n\n\n Statement of Facts.\n The sole question is whether the Philippides Case, \n283 \nU.S. 48\n, 51 S. Ct. 358 (decided by the Supreme Court March 23, 1931), and its result are controlling here. Having concluded to certify this to the Supreme Court, we state the important facts:\n The alien entered the United States at Detroit on July 14, 1924, without any immigration visa, thus entering in violation of section 13 of the Immigration Act of 1924 (title 8,  213 USCA). He was arrested for deportation January 3, 1930; and the warrant of deportation, based upon the finding 'that he was not, at the time of his entry into the United States, in possession of an unexpired immigration visa,' was issued February 17, 1930. Upon his petition for habeas corpus the District Court at Detroit discharged him from custody, because the period of limitation provided by section 19 of the Immigration Act of 1917 (title 8,  155, USCA) had expired. From that order of discharge the government has appealed.\n Question Certified. Upon these facts, and for the proper decision of the cause, we desire the instructions of the Supreme Court upon this question:\n'On January 3, 1930, did section 19 of the Immigration Act of 1917 ( section 155, tit. 8, USCA) by its time limitations bar the deportation proceedings?'\n\n A. C. DENISON, CHAS. H. MOORMAN, XEN HICKS, Circuit Judges. Statement of Conflicting Considerations. For such convenience, if any, as it may be to the Supreme Court, we state briefly the conflicting considerations, developed by our study, which have led us to certify.\n The record shows that the alien entered without inspection as well as without immigration visa. He was therefore for that reason (at least before the act of 1924) deportable only [590-Continued.]\nwithin three years after his entry, under that portion of the first sentence of section 19 (8 USCA  155), which follows the last semicolon; but neither the warrant of arrest nor the warrant of deportation charges entry without inspection. He was also in 1930 'found (to be) in the United States' in violation of that law of the United States (section 13, Act of 1924,  213, tit. 8, USCA) which forbade entry without an immigration visa. He was therefore, at any time within five years after entry, deportable under the first clause of section 19. Entry without inspection not being charged, all parties have assumed that the five-year limitation is the one applicable, if any is.\n In one view it may seem that the language of section 14 of the Act of 1924 (section 214, tit. 8, USCA), 'at any time,' is clear, and that the Philippides Case cannot be distinguished. In the other view it is to be observed that the precise question in the Philippides Case was whether section 34 of the act of 1917 (39 Stat. 896 (8 USCA  166 and note)) had been repealed by this section 14; that this (34) was a specific statute referring to a particular class, which was or might be entitled to admission for a limited time; that the act of 1924, permitting deportation 'at any time,' expressly reached this same specific class, the class in which Philippides belonged, by its reference to aliens who had remained for a longer time than permitted by regulation; that this section 34 of the act of 1917, which contained the provision for deportation of this particular class within three years, was omitted in the act of 1924, although the subject-matter, alien seamen, was specifically covered by its sections 19 and 20 (8 USCA  166, 167); and hence that the reasons which thus required holding that the particular limitation of section 34 had been repealed do not necessarily apply to the entire scheme of varying limitations provided by section 19 of 1917, nor surely support the inference of congressional intent to abandon entirely the long-observed plan of providing varying appropriate limitations for these varying proceedings.\n We note further that section 14 of the act of 1924 (8 USCA  214) makes no possibly preservative reference to section 34 of the act of 1917, but does refer to and recognize the continued existing force of section 19 of the act of 1917. True, it says 'in the manner provided by'; but may not 'time when' well be a part of 'in the manner provided by'? And if reference was intended only to forms of procedure, would section 19 have been included, for section 20 is the one which provides forms?\n We find also that in the 68th Congress there was introduced (January 25, 1925, H. R. 11796), passed by the House, and sent to the Senate a bill which was a general revision of the immigration law, and that the committee reports and the discussions indicate that one purpose was to extend or repeal the limitations of section 19 of the Act of 1917, which limitations were clearly then understood to be in force. Apparently some of [590-Continued.]\nthe limitations were still to be preserved. In the 69th Congress several bills were introduced, one of which (H. R. 12444) passed the House. This apparently extended certain of the supposedly existing time limitations of section 19, and it was said to be a compromise between those who opposed any extension and those who wished to have no limitation. It seems that similar bills have been considered in later Congresses, indicating with more or less certainty the congressional and departmental understanding. There is also a considerable body of judicial decisions in the District Courts and in the Circuit Court of Appeals which assumes that the limitations of section 19 were not repealed in 1924.\n Messrs.

Wells, a resident of Menominee, Mich., died on August 17, 1921. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed additional estate taxes, upon the ground \n\n[283 U.S. 102, 105]\n\u00a0\n that certain transfers by the decedent within two years prior to his death, were made in contemplation of death and should be included in the taxable estate under the provisions of section 402(c) of the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1057, 1097. The amount of the additional tax was paid by the executors and claim for refund was filed. The claim having been rejected, the executors brought this suit in the Court of Claims to recover the amount paid. The Court of Claims decided in favor of the executors (39 F.( 2d) 998, 69 Ct. Cl. 485), and this Court granted a writ of certiorari.\n The substance of the findings of the Court of Claims with respect to the circumstances of the transfers may be stated as follows:\n The decedent died at the age of seventy-three years; his wife and five children, three sons and two daughters, survived him. When a young man he became interested in the business of acquiring and selling timber lands and of manufacturing lumber. He continued in that business to the time of his death.\n As early as the year 1901, decedent began the making of advancements of money and other property to his children. He kept a set of books on which he charged to his children some, but not all, of the amounts transferred to them. The decedent believed that the appropriate course for a man of wealth was to give to his children substantial sums of money during his lifetime while he could advise with them as to its proper use. He informed one of his friends: 'I am making distribution from time to time of part of my property to see what my children will do during my lifetime, and I will then know when my time is up what I ought to do with the balance.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[283 U.S. 102, 106]\n\u00a0\n In 1918, decedent advanced to three of his children, Ralph W. Wells, Mrs. Edna Walsh, and Mrs. Florence Law, shares of stock in the Dunbar & Wausaukee Railway Company for which he charged each of them, in the equalization hereafter mentioned, the sum of $25,460. Neither this transfer, nor any of the earlier transfers, is in controversy.\n In December, 1919, decedent transferred to his son Artemus C. Wells, 343 shares, and to his son Daniel Wells, 73 shares, of the stock of the J. W. Wells Lumber Company. He charged Artemus with $89,180, and Daniel with $ 18,890, on account of these transfers.\n On January 1, 1921, after carefully examining his accounts in preparing for the final equalization of the prior advancements, decedent transferred to his children 68,985 shares of the stock of the Girard Lumber Company. His summaries of accounts with each of his children showed debit balances, on which he had computed interest, as follows: Daniel Wells, $266,530; Artemus C. Wells, $231,651; Ralph W. Wells, $214,008; Mrs. Florence Law, $216,445; and Mrs. Edna Walsh, $180,662. The decedent indorsed each of these statements with the words, 'Account with _____,' 'This account is canceled and ledger balanced to date as a gift to _____' ( the name of the son or daughter being inserted), or with other words to the same effect.\n In this process of equalization decedent charged his children with a total of 3458 shares of the capital stock of the Lloyd Manufacturing Company. These shares were not delivered at that time, as decedent had agreed to exchange them for a like number of shares in a new company to result from an expected merger. On January 26, 1921, decedent transferred to Marshall B. Lloyd, as trustee for the benefit of his wife and five children, 3,713 shares of the stock of the Lloyd Manufacturing Company with authority to exchange these shares for shares of the stock of the new corporation, on the issue of which the trustee \n\n[283 U.S. 102, 107]\n\u00a0\n was to assign the shares to decedent's wife and children, respectively, in designated amounts, or, in the event that the exchange was not consummated before December 1, 1921, to distribute to them the shares of the Lloyd company. \n2\n On April 6, 1921, Lloyd, the trustee, distributed the certificates for the shares in the new company, but the finding states that the decedent had divested himself of all interest in the 3,713 shares of the Lloyd stock when they were transferred in trust.\n The transfers which the Commissioner deemed to be subject to the additional estate tax are these:\n That of December, 1919, to his sons Daniel and Artemus, of 416 shares of the stock of the J. W. Wells Lumber \n\n[283 U.S. 102, 108]\n\u00a0\n Company, increased by a subsequent stock dividend to 1,280 shares at the date of the decedent's death;\n That of January 1, 1921, to his children, of 68,985 shares of the stock of the Girard Lumber Company:\n That of January 26, 1921, in trust for his wife and children, of 3, 713 shares of the stock of the Lloyd Manufacturing Company.\n The aggregate value at the time of the decedent's death of all the property embraced in these transfers was $782,903. Excluding this property, the value of decedent's estate at the time of his death was $881,314.61, on which the decedent's annual income was approximately $50,000 a year.\n The Court of Claims made detailed findings as to the state of decedent's health. It appeared that for some time prior to the year 1919, he had suffered from attacks of asthma. In May of that year he went to a hospital in Chicago for treatment and remained eleven days. About the middle of April, 1920, decedent began to be afflicted with ulcerative colitis, a condition in which the large intestine becomes inflamed. The finding states: 'It is a curable disease. About eighty to eighty-five per cent of the cases are cured.' In June, 1920, decedent was advised by physicians in California that he was suffering from cancer of the intestines. In the following July, decedent again entered the hospital in Chicago and, on an examination by a specialist in diseases of the bowels, the case was diagnosed as ulcerative colitis. Between July and September, 1920, decedent was informed in detail of his condition. His physician told him that 'he would get well.'\n While at the hospital, following an inquiry by his business associate, Marshall B. Lloyd, whether decedent had made any agreement with his second wife, Katherine Wells, with reference to a division of property after his death, decedent made such an agreement. Reciting his \n\n[283 U.S. 102, 109]\n\u00a0\n illness, it provided that his wife 'should have $100,000 in money and certain other property in lieu of her statutory and dower rights.' Mrs. Wells ratified all gifts theretofore made by the decedent to his children and all gifts which might be made to his children thereafter 'and before his death whether any of such gifts be made in contemplation of his death, or otherwise.' Pursuant to the agreement, decedent made his will on August 18, 1920, the provisions of which differed only slightly from those of an earlier will. After providing for the payment of $100,000 to his widow and making other bequests, decedent devised his residuary estate to his five children, with the proviso: 'Provided, however, that the amount shown to be due me from each of my children severally in accordance with my books at the time of my death, shall be considered advancement made by me to them from time to time and shall be chargeable to each of them severally as advancements and shall be deducted from their respective shares.'\n On September 14, 1920, decedent wrote to his son Ralph: 'The doctors say that I will be absolutely cured if I am careful for two or three months after leaving and I certainly will be careful after this.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n On September 22, 1920, decedent was discharged from the hospital in an improved condition. His medial a dviser stated that decedent's condition was 'excellent,' 'he had not fully at that time recovered but he did within the next two of three months.' 'His appearance was normal; he had gained an appreciable amount of weight' and 'he was in a very fair state of health.' On his return to Menominee, decedent said to his son, who had been in charge of his affairs during his absence, that \n\n[283 U.S. 102, 110]\n\u00a0\n 'he was completely cured of the trouble that he had had and he felt good.' Decedent then resumed his normal business activities. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Decedent was again admitted to the hospital in Chicago, on November 30, 1920, for the purpose of an operation to relieve his asthma. His physician stated that at that time 'he found him to be in good general condition.' \n5\n On December 9, 1920, decedent was discharged from the hospital and returned to his home. He went back to the hospital on January 10, 1921, for the completion of the nasal operation. \n6\n At the time of his discharge on January 14, 1921, the medical examination showed \"a very greatly improved condition' and that 'in respect to the ulcerative colitis it was '90 per cent normal.\"\n On January 26, 1921, the date of the trust agreement (constituting the last of the transfers in question), decedent wrote to his son Ralph: 'The doctors pronounce me cured of bowel trouble, but I will always have asthma. I weight 140 stripped.' On February 3, 1921, he left for California, where he was accustomed to spend the winter months. His physician stated that decedent at that time 'considered himself well, and I told him that he need have no anxiety whatever about his state of health; \n\n[283 U.S. 102, 111]\n\u00a0\n that I considered him in excellent condition; that he need have no fears of any recurrence of the ulcerated colitis.' \n7\n\u00a0\n\n But in April, 1921, while still in California, decedent had such a recurrence. He consulted a specialist of reputation who after examination informed him that he might have a cancer, and advised an operation. In June, 1921, decedent reentered the hospital in Chicago. His condition proved to be due to a virulent form of infection that failed to yield to treatment. Returning to his home, he continud to lose ground and he died on August 17, 1921. An autopsy disclosed a severe and extensive inflammation of the large intestine, with ulceration of the bowel. No trace of cancer was found. The death certificate signed by his physician set forth the cause of decedent's death as 'suppurative colitis' and its 'duration one year.'\n The Court of Claims did not find, in terms, that the transfers in question were not made in contemplation of death, but it is evident that the court considered that its findings of fact amounted to that in substance, in view \n\n[283 U.S. 102, 112]\n\u00a0\n of the conclusion of law, based upon these findings, that the executors were entitled to recover the additional tax. This is also manifest from the reasoning of the court's opinion. The court said:\n'The plaintiffs have not only overcome the presumption created by the statute that the transfers were made in contemplation of death, but have definitely established the fact that the immediate and moving cause of the transfers was the carrying out of a policy long followed by decedent in dealing with his children of making liberal gifts to them during his lifetime. He had consistently followed that policy for nearly thirty years, and the three transfers in question were a continuation and final consummation of such policy. In the last transfer such amounts were given to his children as would even them up one with another, in the gifts and advancements made to them.\n\n'That this was the motive which actuated the decedent in making these transfers seems unquestioned. He repeatedly, in letters to his children and in statements to business associates at about the time the transfers were made, gave this as his reason for such transfers. After the final transfer in which the advancements and gifts to the children were evened up in January, 1921, the decedent still possessed property of the value of nearly $900,000, from which he drew an annual income of approximately $50,000. At the time the transfers were made, decedent had no reason to believe otherwise than, aside from his asthma, he was, for a man of his age, in ordinary health. While he had gone through a most serious and painful illness, he had, as he believed, made an almost complete recovery. He was assured of this fact by his physician, an eminent specialist, in whom he had great confidence. The repeated statements made by him to close friends and associates, his daily activities in matters connected with his business affairs, his letters to his children assuring them of his renewed health, show \n\n[283 U.S. 102, 113]\n\u00a0\n that he fully believed the assurances given him by his physician that he was cured and had nothing to fear on account of his former illness.\n\n'The presumption created by the statute that the transfers in question were made in contemplation of death cannot stand against ascertained and proven facts showing the contrary to be true. The best evidence of the state of the decedent's health at the time the transfers were made is the statement of his doctor. The best evidence of the decedent's state of mind at that time and the reasons actuating him in making the transfers are the statements and expressions of the decedent himself, supported as such statements are by all the circumstances concerning the transfers.'8\n\n The Government contests the decision of the Court of Claims upon the ground that the conclusion was reached by an erroneous construction of the words 'in contemplation of death' as used in the statute. The court held that \"contemplation of death' does not mean that general knowledge of all men that they must die, but that \n\n[283 U.S. 102, 114]\n\u00a0\n there must be a present apprehension, from some existing bodily or mental condition or impending peril, creating a reasonable fear that death is near at hand, and that such reasonable fear or apprehension must be the direct or animating cause, and the only cause of the transfer.' 9 The Government insists that this definition is too narrow; that transfers in contemplation of death are not limited to those induced by a condition causing expectation of death in the near future; that the character of such gifts is determined by the state of mind of the donor at the time they are made, and that the statutory presumption may be overcome only by proof that the decedent's purpose in making the gift was to attain some object desirable to him during his life, as distinguished from the distribution of his estate as at death. \n\n[283 U.S. 102, 115]\n\u00a0\n The phrase 'in contemplation of death,' previously found in state statutes, was first used by the Congress in the Revenue Act of 1916, imposing an estate tax. It was coupled with a clause creating a statutory presumption in case of gifts within two years before death. \n10\n The provision was continued in the Revenue Act of 1918,11 which governs the present case, and in later legislation. While the interpretation of the phrase has not been uniform, there had been agreement upon certain fundamental considerations. It is recognized that the reference is not to the general expectation of death which all entertain. It must be a particular concern, giving rise to a definite motive. \n12\n The provision is not confined to gifts causa mortis, \n\n[283 U.S. 102, 116]\n\u00a0\n which are made in anticipation of impending death, are revocable, and are defeated if the donor survives the apprehended peril. Basket v. Hassell, 107 U S. 602, 609, 610, 2 S. Ct. 415.13 The statutory description embraces gifts inter vivos, despite the fact that they are fully executed, are irrevocable and indefeasible. The quality which brings the transfer within the statute is indicated by the context and manifest purpose. Transfers in contemplation of death are included within the same category, for the purpose of taxation, with transfers intended to take effect at or after the death of the transferor. The dominant \n\n[283 U.S. 102, 117]\n\u00a0\n purpose is to reach substitutes for testamentary dispositions and thus to prevent the evasion of the estate tax. Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531, 542\n, 47 S. Ct. 710, 52 A. L. R. 1081; Milliken v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 15\n, 51 S. Ct. 324, decided March 2, 1931. As the transfer may otherwise have all the indicia of a valid gift inter vivos, the differentiating factor must be found in the transferor's motive. Death must be 'contemplated,' that is, the motive which induces the transfer must be of the sort which leads to testamentary disposition. As a condition of body and mind that naturally gives rise to the feeling that death is near, that the donor is about to reach the moment of inevitable surrender of ownership, is most likely to prompt such a disposition to those who are deemed to be the proper objects of his bounty, the evidence of the existence or nonexistence of such a condition at the time of the gift is obviously of great importance in determining whether it is made in contemplation of death. The natural and reasonable inference which may be drawn from the fact that but a short period intervenes between the transfer and death is recognized by the statutory provision creating a presumption in the case of gifts within two years prior to death. But this presumption, by the statute before us, is expressly stated to be a rebuttable one, and the mere fact that death ensues even shortly after the gift does not determine absolutely that it is in contemplation of death. The question, necessarily, is as to the state of mind of the donor.\n As the test, despite varying circumstances, is always to be found in motive, it cannot be said that the determinative motive is lacking merely because of the absence of a consciousness that death is imminent. It is contemplation of death, not necessarily contemplation of imminent death, to which the statute refers. It is conceivable that the idea of death may possess the mind so as to furnish a controlling motive for the disposition of property, although death is not thought to be close at hand. Old age \n\n[283 U.S. 102, 118]\n\u00a0\n may give premonitions and promptings independent of mortal disease. Yet age in itself cannot be regarded as furnishing a decisive test, for sound health and purposes associated with life, rather than with death, may motivate the transfer. The words 'in contemplation of death' mean that the thought of death is the impelling cause of the transfer, and while the belief in the imminence of death may afford convincing evidence, the statute is not to be limited, and its purpose thwarted, by a rule of construction which in place of contemplation of death makes the final criterion to be an apprehension that death is 'near at hand.'\n If it is the thought of death, as a controlling motive prompting the disposition of property, that affords the test, it follows that the statute does not embrace gifts inter vivos which spring from a different motive. Such transfers were made the subject of a distinct gift tax, since repealed. \n14\n As illustrating transfers found to be related to purposes associated with life, rather than with the distribution of property in anticipation of death, the Government mentions transfers made 'for the purpose of relieving the donor of the cares of management or in order that his children may experience the responsibilities of business under his guidance and supervision.' The illustrations are useful but not exhaustive. The purposes which may be served by gifts are of great variety. It is common knowledge that a frequent inducement is not only the desire to be relieved of responsibilities, but to have children, or others who may be the appropriate objects of the donor's bounty, independently established with competencies of their own, without being compelled to await the death of the donor and without particular \n\n[283 U.S. 102, 119]\n\u00a0\n consideration of that event. There may be the desire to recognize special needs or exigencies or to discharge moral obligations. The gratification of such desires may be a more compelling motive than any thought of death.\n It is apparent that there can be no precise delimitation of the transactions embraced within the conception of transfers in 'contemplation of death,' as there can be none in relation to fraud, undue influence, due process of law, or other familiar legal concepts which are applicable to many varying circumstances. There is no escape from the necessity of carefully scrutinizing the circumstances of each case to detect the dominant motive of the donor in the light of his bodily and mental condition, and thus to give effect to the manifest purpose of the statute.\n We think that the Government is right in its criticism of the narrowness of the rule laid down by the Court of Claims, in requiring that there be a condition 'creating a reasonable fear that death is near at hand,' and that 'such reasonable fear or apprehension' must be 'the only cause of the transfer.' It is sufficient if contemplation of death be the inducing cause of the transfer whether or not death is believed to be near. But it does not appear that the decision of the court rests upon the limitation thus expressed. The court did not rely merely upon the fact that at the time of the transfers decedent considered that he had recovered from his former illness and believed the assurances given him by his physician that he need have no fear of its recurrence or any 'anxiety whatever about his state of health.' That fact was manifestly important, but, in addition to that, the court held that 'immediate and moving cause of the transfers was the carrying out of a policy, long followed by decedent in dealing with his children of making liberal gifts to them during his lifetime.' The court regarded the transfers in question as 'a continuation and and final consummation of such policy,' saying 'that this was the motive \n\n[283 U.S. 102, 120]\n\u00a0\n which actuated the decedent in making these transfers seems unquestioned.' In the view of the court as thus explicitly stated, not only was there no fear at the time of the transfers that death was near at hand, but the motive for the transfers brought them within the category of those which, as described by the Government, are intended by the donor 'to accomplish some purpose desirable to him if he continues to live.' In the presence of such a motive, appropriately found, and of the underlying facts which have been expressly found, there would be no ground for a reversal of the judgment merely because of an inaccuracy in the general statement as to the meaning of the statutory phrase.\n The only difficulty presented by the record is that this statement with respect to the motive of decedent appears in the opinion of the court and not in its findings of fact. We are not at liberty to refer to the opinion for additional findings. The findings of fact of the Court of Claims are to be treated like the verdict of a jury. \n15\n We cannot add to them, or modify them, but the absence of the finding of an ultimate fact does not require a reversal of the judgment if the circumstantial facts as found are such that the ultimate fact follows from them as a necessary inference. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n It is evident that the court did not consider the statements in its opinion, which we have quoted, as additional findings of fact, but as an argument with respect to the conclusion to be drawn from its findings. In its opinion, the court was summarizing what it considered to be the effect of its findings, and no useful purpose would be served in returning the case for a specific finding that the motive which impelled the decedent to make the transfers \n\n[283 U.S. 102, 121]\n\u00a0\n wasprec isely that which the court has thus definitely stated. While, in accordance with proper practice and the rule of this Court,17 the Court of Claims should have found the ultimate fact, and we do not approve the method it adopted, we are of the opinion that, in view of the findings of fact actually made and the conclusion they import, the judgment should be sustained. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Speaking of a less liberal policy of a former business associate, who died in or about the year 1918, decedent frequently expressed his opinion that his friend 'had made a big mistake in not distributing his property to his children while he was alive to help them handle it properly and said 'that is not my policy.\" \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] On the day that this trust agreement was made, decedent wrote to his son Ralph (then in England): 'I am going to divide Lloyd pref. stock and most of G. L. Co. (Girard Lumber Co.) among you children at once so you will have enough to keep you from hunger at least. I own now 5103 Lloyd stock, $100 per share. Income $35,721. I am going to even up my gifts to all now, and the following is the way they stand before the evening up' (inserting statement). 'I have charged all of you interest on your accounts at 5% and I have charged you and Art $50,000 apiece for motor loss and credit you for W. P. L. Co. stock charged you. I am mighty busy getting ready for the West, so good-by.'\n On February 3, 1921, on leaving for California, decedent wrote to his daughter, Mrs. Edna Walsh: 'I have been working on my books and evening up all your accounts. Dan, Art, and Ralph have had advances that were more than you and Florence had and I have equalized one with the other by charging each with what they have had and charging them interest on the account to date, and the inclosed sheet shows what each has had and how I equalized your a\/cs by giving stock to even. Your Lloyd stock will be delivered as soon as the deal is closed, which will be very soon. Your Lloyd stock is worth $108,600 and the Girard stock is worth $252000, so you need not take in washing for support unless you throw it away on copper or other junk. In making out these accounts, the thing that seems most important is how interest runs up. Good safe bonds are the best investment for a person who does not understand business. Well, my dear girl, take good care of this, remember the poor and needy, and you will receive your reward. Good-by.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] At about this time, the hospital physician found marked evidence of an inflammation of the ethmoid cells which are connected with the nasal cavity, and concluded that there was very likely a close relation between the ethmoiditis and the asthma. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Writing to his son Ralph on October 30, 1920, decedent said: 'I am around about the same as usual. ... I feel as well as ever, and bowels seem normal, but doctor says I must diet and take bismuth medicine for a while and be careful. Gained six pounds since I came home.' \n[\nFootnote 5\n] The physician said that decedent 'came to the hospital for treatment of the asthma, not for the bowel trouble. In fact, it was by arrangement when he left the hospital in September that he came back at this time, in November, to have the operative work done on the nose that was designed to clear up the asthma.' \n[\nFootnote 6\n] His physician then made the following entry in the hospital record with respect to decedent's condition: 'In general feels very well. Gained six pounds in weight. Asthma has been somewhat troublesome at times. Has had very good bowel function. No pain. Returns for completion of nasal operation.' \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In February, 1921, friends of the decedent, visiting him in California, were taken by him on extended motor trips. 'Decedent drove the car himself through the congested portion of the city (Los Angeles), as well as around or over the mountains near that city. At places on these mountain roads the automobile party driven by the decedent traversed roads that ran along a precipice where there is a sheer fall of six or seven thousand feet without any apparent concern or distress on the part of the decedent.' His friends 'did not see any difference in his appearance. He seemed to be just as spry as he ever was, and handled the car in pretty good shape.' He was thought to be 'very cheerful.'\n In a letter dated February 21, 1921, written to his children, decedent said: 'I am about free of my bowel trouble, but have my old complaint, asthma, but I have taken treatment at Batch Creek Treatment Rooms here the last two years and they have cleared it up and they are now treating me and it is clearing up.' \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Referring to the agreement made in the summer of 1920 with the decedent's wife as to her share of his property, and to the making of his will, the court said: 'While these transactions are entitled to consideration in connection with all the other facts and circumstances shown, we do not regard them as having a great deal of weight in determining the question as to the decedent's state of mind, and the motives actuating him in making transfers of property, four months later. No transfers of property were made to the children at the time of the execution of the property agreement with his wife, and the provisions made for their benefit in the will executed at that time were identical with the provisions of a former will. Whatever apprehensions the decedent entertained at the tie of the making of the property agreement with his wife as to the chances of recovery from the illness from which he was suffering at that time, had ceased to exist before the transfer of the Girard Lumber Company stock on January 1, 1921, and the Lloyd Manufacturing Company stock on January 26, 1921.' \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] In support of this view, the court cited Spreckels v.

Section 402(c) provides: 'To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, or with respect to which he has at any time created a trust, in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death (whether such transfer or trust is made or created before or after the passage of this Act), except in case of a bona fide sale for a fair consideration in money or money's worth. Any transfer of a material part of his property in the nature of a final disposition or distribution thereof, made by the decedent within two years prior to is death without such a consideration, shall, unless shown to the contrary, be deemed to have been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this title;' \n[\nFootnote 12\n] Article 23 of Regulations 37, under the Revenue Act of 1918, contained the following:\n'Art. 23. Nature of Transfer.-The words 'in contemplation of death' do not refer to the general expectation of death which all persons entertain. A transfer, however, is made in contemplation of death wherever the person making it is influenced to do so by such an expectation of death, arising from bodily or mental conditions, as prompts persons to dispose of their property to those whom they deem proper objects of their bounty. The cause which induces such bodily or mental conditions is immaterial; and it is not necessary that the decedent be in the immediate expectation of death. Such a transfer is taxable, although the decedent parts absolutely and immediately with his title to and possession of the property. Transfers made within two years of a decedent's death are presumed to be taxable if they are of a material part of his property and are in the nature of a final disposition thereof. ... All facts relating to the transfer should be stated, including the motive therefor, the decedent's state of health, and his anticipation of death. The pesum ption of taxability may be rebutted by proof that the transfer was not induced by bodily or mental conditions leading the grantor to make a disposition of property testamentary in its nature. The fact that a gift was made as an advancement, to be taken into account upon the final distribution of the decedent's estate, is not enough, standing alone, to establish taxability; but it is a circumstance to be considered in determining whether the transfer was made in contemplation of death.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] In Matter of Seaman, 147 N.

Matthews, all of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 234, 236]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ernie Adamson, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 234, 237]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action that was brought in a Court of the State of New York and tried before a jury. At the close of the plaintiff's case the complaint was dismissed upon the merits and the decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 252 N. Y. 530, 170 N. E. 131, on the authority of Resigno v. F. Jarka Co., 248 N. Y. 225, 162 N. E. 13. A Writ of certiorari was granted by this Court, \n281 \nU.S. 708\n, 50 S. Ct. 240, because there is involved an improtant question as to the applicability of the Jones Act, Act March 4, 1915, c. 153,  20, as amended by the Act of June 5, 1920, c. 250,  33, 41 Stat. 988, 1007 (U. S. Code title 46,  688 ( 46 USCA  688)).\n The action was for causing the death of the plaintiff's intestate, Anton Uravic, an American citizen, employed \n\n[282 U.S. 234, 238]\n\u00a0\n in work as a stevedore by the F. Jarka Company, a Delaware corporation. The suit against the other defendant named was discontinued. At the time of receiving the injury that caused his death, July 13, 1926, Uravic was helping to unload a vessel flying the German flag, in the harbor of New York. He was on the vessel at the time and we are to take it that he was hurt by the negligence of a fellow servant. That fact was no defence if the above-mentioned section 33 governed, because it is not one in the case of railway employees; Act of the April 22, 1908, c. 149,  1, 35 Stat. 65; ( U. S. Code, tit. 45,  51 (45 USCA  51)); and this section 33 giving an action at common law to the personal representative of any seaman suffering death in the course of his employment makes applicable all statutes of the United States conferring or regulating such right of action in the case of railway employees. It is decided that stevedores come within the benefits conferred by section 33. International Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, \n272 \nU.S. 50\n, 47 S. Ct. 19. But the question is raised whether the statute applies to a stevedore working on a vessel that we assume to have been German, since she flew the German flag.\n The language of the statute is general. The right is given to 'any seaman,' including, as we have aid , stevedores. The jurisdiction and the authority of Congress to deal with the matter are unquestionable and unquestioned. Cunard Steamship Co. v. Mellon, \n262 U.S. 100\n, 124 et seq., 43 S. Ct. 504, 27 A. L. R. 1306. The conduct regulated is of universal concern. The rights of a citizen within the territorial limits of the country are more extensively determined by the scope of actions for torts than even by the law of crimes. There is strong reason for giving the same protection to the person of those who work in our harbors when they are working upon a German ship that they would receive when working upon an American ship in the next dock, as is especially obvious in the case of stevedores who may \n\n[282 U.S. 234, 239]\n\u00a0\n be employed in unloading vessels of half a dozen different flags in turn.\n But it is said that stevedores only get their rights by a somewhat artificial extension of the word 'seaman' and it is argued that a seaman upon a German vessel clearly would not be given the rights claimed. It is said that the word is defined by Rev. St.  4612 (U. S. Code, tit. 46,  713 (46 USCA  713)). But that section merely provides that for the purposes of the chapter 'seaman' shall include persons who otherwise might be deemed not to be seamen. It is directed to extension not to restriction, as remarked by Judge Crane in Resigno v. F. Jarka Co., 248 N. Y. 225, 242, 162 N. E. 13. Then it is argued that the grant of jurisdiction to the Court of the District in which the defendant employer resides or has his principal office without granting a proceeding in in the case of tramp steamers from abroad shows that seamen on a foreign vessel were not contemplated. But the question is not whether they were thought of for the purpose of inclusion but whether they were intentionally excluded from a description that on its face includes them. The express mention of them in sections as to the payment of wages does not help the respondent since that is a domestic matter of contract that unless mentioned might be left to the parties concerned. See Jackson v. The Archimedes, \n275 \nU.S. 463, 467\n, 48 S. Ct. 164.\n Perhaps it would be a sufficient answer to the objections that while the section 33 is construed to give the rights of seamen to stevedores it does not say or mean that stevedores are to be regarded as seamen on the particular vessel upon which for the moment they happen to be at work. They simply are given the rights of seamen and as they are American workmen they have the rights of American seamen as well on German as on American ships.\n But we may go further. Here we are dealing with the conduct of persons within the jurisdiction affecting the \n\n[282 U.S. 234, 240]\n\u00a0\n safety of other persons within it. If the rule is wise there is no reason why it should not be universal. Wise or not it is law and the question is why general words should not be generally applied. What would be the alternative? Hardly that the German law should be adopted. It always is the law of the United States that governs within the jurisdiction of the United States, even when for some special occasion this country adopts a foreign law as its own. The Exchange v. M'Faddon, 7 Cranch, 116, 136; The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 571, 572; The Western Maid, \n257 \nU.S. 419, 432\n, 42 S. Ct. 159; Cunard S.S. Co. v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 100, 124\n, 43 S. Ct. 504, 27 A. L. R. 1306. There hardly seems to be a reason why it should adopt a different rule for people subject to its authority because they are upon a private vessel registered abroad. They are not within the exception as to public armed vessels of a foreign sovereign, whatever its extent. The Exchange v. M'Faddon, 7 Cranch, 116, 143. Crimes committed upon such private vessels may be punished by the territorial jurisdiction. Wildenhus' Case, \n120 \nU.S. 1\n, 7 S. Ct. 383; Patterson v. The Eudora, \n190 \nU.S. 169, 177\n, 23 S. Ct. 821. We see no reason for limiting the liability for torts committed there when thy g o beyond the scope of discipline and private matters that do not interest the territorial power. But in these latter cases the local authority might abstain from interfering simply because it did not care to interfere. It would be extraordinary to apply German law to Americans momentarily on board of a private German ship in New York.\n At the argument it was suggested that the case should be governed by the general maritime law. This means, as we have indicated, by the law of the United States, with the provisions of section 33 left out. It is assumed that by the law so qualified a master would not be liable to a servant for an injury caused by the negligence of a fellow servant. But that doctrine is of relatively recent appear- \n\n[282 U.S. 234, 241]\n\u00a0\n ance in admiralty following the common law. The City of Alexandria (C. C.) 17 F. 390. And, as we believe, it was introduced into the common law almost within the memory of men still living upon a principle of policy. Labatt, Master & Servant,  471, et seq.,  484; 2d Ed.  1394, 1408. It would be somewhat hard to maintain that principal as still the policy of the law in this case after the doctrine has been abolished for railroad employees and seamen. See International Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, \n272 \nU.S. 50, 52\n, 47 S. Ct. 19.\n If it should appear that by valid contract or special circumstances seamen on a foreign ship should not be protected by the statute it will be time enough to consider the exception when it is presented. But the purport of the words is plain and there is no reason to deny stevedores the benefit of them even if exceptions to the rule for seamen may be found upon peculiar facts.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","183":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nv.

This court granted petitioner's application for a writ of certiorari, limited to the question whether petitioner is entitled under section 234(a)(7) of the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1078) \n\n[282 U.S. 638, 640]\n\u00a0\n to any deduction for obsolescence of its tangible property in such years. \n282 \nU.S. 823\n, 51 S. Ct. 76, 75 L. Ed. -.\n Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1077, 1078, provides:\n'Sec. 234. (a) That in computing the net income of a corporation ... there shall be allowed as deductions .... (7) A reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of property used in the trade or business, including a reasonable allowance for obsolescence . ...'\n\n A jury having been waived in writing, the case was tried by the court without a jury. The court found:\n Plaintiff, from 1879 until October 29, 1919, was engaged at New York City in the business of manufacturing and selling beers, ales, and porter, and for that purpose erected and installed suitable buildings and equipment. January 31, 1918, it had become common knowledge, and was known to plaintiff, that prohibition would become effective, and that as a result plaintiff and others engaged in that business would suffer obsolescence in the value of their capital assets. Prohibition did become effective January 16, 1920. As found by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the depreciated cost of plaintiff's buildings as of that date was $ 153,932.18. The buildings were constructed especially for the purposes of such manufacture, and were not commercially adaptable for any other use. They had no salvage value. As a result of prohibition and beginning January 31, 1918, and ending January 16, 1920, plaintiff suffered obsolescence of such buildings equal to such depreciated cost which should be ratably apportioned over that period. After making provision for allowances for such obsolescence, plaintiff had no net income for 1918 or 1919\n\n\n And at defendant's request the court found: With the advent of prohibition, it became illegal to manufacture beers, ales, and porter having an alcoholic content in excess of one-half of 1 per cent. Accordingly, such man- \n\n[282 U.S. 638, 641]\n\u00a0\n ufacture was discontinued by the plaintiff when the prohibitory law became effective. Subsequently plaintiff to a small extent continued the manufacture of beers, ales, and porter having an alcoholic content not in excess of one-half of 1 per cent., and it still continues to manufacture such beverages to a small extent.\n The sole question for decision is whether, in calculating its taxes for 1918 and 1919, plaintiff was entitled to any allowance for obsolescence of its buildings resulting from the imminence and taking effect of the prohibitory laws.\n The language of section 234(a)(7) is broad enough to include all obsolescence from whatever cause. But the government maintains that Congress did not intend to provide compensation in any form for losses caused by prohibition legislation, and that consequently there can be no deduction for obsolescence here even upon the facts found by the District Court. It relies on Clarke v. Haberle Brewing Co., \n280 \nU.S. 384\n, 50 S. Ct. 155, and Renziehausen v. Lucas, \n280 \nU.S. 387\n, 50 S. Ct. 156.\n The case at bar was decided in the District Court before our decision in the Haberle Case, and on the authority of that decision the Circuit Court of Appeals held plaintiff not entitled to any allowance for obsolescence of its buildings. But the sole question presented to us in that case was whether a brewing company making its tax return for 1919 under the act now before us and whose business would be destroyed by the taking effect of prohibition was entitled to deduct anything on account of exhaustion or obsolescence of its good will. The court said (page 386 of 280 U. S., 50 S. Ct. 155, 156): 'We shall not follow counsel into the succession of regulations or the variations in the law before the date of the Act that we have to construe. In our opinion the words now used cannot be extended to cover the loss in this case and it is needless to speculate as to \n\n[282 U.S. 638, 642]\n\u00a0\n what other cases it might include.' When regard is had to the issue between the parties and the point decided, it is clear that there is nothing in our construction of the statute or in the reasons adduced to support the conclusion reached that is decisive of the question now under consideration or that suggests that, in respect of allowances for obsolescence of tangible property, the statute does not apply to brewers and their buildings just as it does to others and their tangible property. Indeed, the language used definitely limits the opinion to obsolescence of good will.\n In Renziehausen v. Lucas the taxpayer was a distiller. His claim for obsolescence of good will, under section 214(a)(8), 40 Stat. 1066, applicable to individuals and in the same words as section 234(a)(7), 40 Stat. 1078, was denied on the authority of the Haberle Case. He also claimed allowances for obsolescence resulting from prohibition to his plant, equipment, and bonded warehouses. That claim was denied by the Commissioner, but it was allowed by the Board of Tax Appeals, 8 B. T. A. 87, and that decision was affirmed in the Circuit Court of Appeals. 31 F.( 2d) 675. The taxpayer insisted here that the allowance for obsolescence of his warehouses was inadequate. The government opposed the increase, but did not challenge either the propriety of an allowance or the amount fixed below. Dealing with the case on the assumption that the statute applied to obsolescence due to prohibition just as it does to that resulting from other causes, we held that the taxpayer had 'no reason to complain of the allowance for obsolescence of the warehouses.' That case makes against rather than for the government's present contention.\n The tangible property by which a business is carried on is plainly distinguishable from the element of good will inhering therein. The cost of plant depreciation, i. e., exhaustion, wear, tear, and obsolescence, is a part of oper- \n\n[282 U.S. 638, 643]\n\u00a0\n ating expenses necessary to carry on a manufacturing business. The gain or loss in any year cannot be rightly ascertained without taking into account the amount of such cost that is justly attributable to that period of time.\n The history of section 234(a)(7) discloses a legislative purpose that the amount reasonably attributable to each year on account of obsolescence of tanibl e property used in the taxpayer's business is to be taken into account in ascertaining his taxable income. The excise tax act of 1909 permitted the deduction of 'a reasonable allowance for depreciation of property, if any.' 1 Regulations of the Treasury Department construed the provision to mean the loss in value 'that arises from exhaustion, wear and tear, or obsolescence out of the uses to which the property is put.' \n2\n The Revenue Act of 1913 provided for a 'reasonable allowance for depreciation by use, wear and tear of property, if any.' \n3\n The Regulations provided for a deduction for depreciation in the value of the property 'that arises from exhaustion, wear and tear, or obsolescence out of the uses to which the property is put.' \n4\n The Revenue Act of 1916 dropped the word 'depreciation' and permitted 'a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of property arising out of its use or employment in the business or trade.' \n5\n Under that provision no deduction on account of obsolescence was allowed, except for the 'withdrawal from use of the obsolete property.' \n6\n The House draft of the act of 1918 provided for an allowance for exhaus- \n\n[282 U.S. 638, 644]\n\u00a0\n tion, wear, and tear. It did not expressly refer to depreciation or obsolescence. The Senate amended by substituting 'depreciation' for 'exhaustion, wear and tear.' In conference, that word was taken out, and the provision was made to read as it now stands, 'a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of property used in the trade or business, including a reasonable allowance for obsolescence.'\n None of the acts made any classification based on the causes from which obsolescence results. And, as the sole purpose is to arrive at the net income subject to taxation, it is clear that such a discrimination could not reasonably or justly be made. Section 234(a)(7) and other provisions of the same substance have been generally, if not uniformly, held to apply to obsolescence of tangible property, whatever its cause, where the amount fairly attributable to the tax year has been shown. \n7\n There is nothing in the language of the statute or the circumstances of its enactment to suggest that Congress intended that the taxable incomes of brewers should not be arrived at according to the rules that govern taxable incomes of others. \n\n[282 U.S. 638, 645]\n\u00a0\n The government also insists that in any event there was no obsolescence in plaintiff's buildings in 1918 or 1919, because, from its very nature, obsolescence begins only when there is a reasonable certainty that the property will become obsolete.\n The statute contemplates annual allowance for bso lescence just as it does for exhaustion, wear, and tear. That is necessary in order to determine true gain or loss because postponement of deductions to cover obsolescence until the property involved became obsolete would distort annual income. It is well understood that exhaustion, wear, tear, or obsolescence cannot be accurately measured as it progresses, and undoubtedly it was for that reason that the statute authorized 'reasonable' allowances to cover them in order equably to spread that element of operating expenses through the years. The findings of fact show that the imminence of prohibition became known in January of 1918 and that it took effect in January of 1920. The court found that, although they were subsequently used to a small extent in the manufacture of nonintoxicating beverages, plaintiff's buildings had no salvage value when prohibition took effect. Undoubtedly it was obvious from the beginning of that period that buildings not commercially adaptable to any use other than brewing intoxicating liquor would suffer obsolescence because of the destruction of that business.\n Under the order granting the writ, there is before us no question as to the propriety of the amount of the allowance or its allocation between the tax years in question.\n Judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.\n Judgment of the District Court affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 38, 36 Stat. 112, 113. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Regulations 31, art. 4. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section II G(b), 38 Stat. 172. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Regulations 33, art. 129. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Section 12(a), 39 Stat. 767, 768. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Regulations 33 Revised, art. 178. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Dean v.

H. Hoppe and Alonzo M. Snyder, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Gilbert Bettman, of Cincinnati, Ohio, and G. H. Birrell, of Warren, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Van Huffel brought this suit in the court of common pleas of Trumbull county, Ohio, to quiet his title to two parcels of real estate acquired from the purchaser at a sale made by the bankruptcy court for that district. The defendant, the county treasurer, asserts a lien for unpaid state taxes which had accrued prior to the bankruptcy. The sale was made pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court which directed that all liens be marshaled; that the property be sold free of all incumbrances; and that the rights of all lienholders be transferred to the proceeds of the sale. The trial court entered a decree quieting the title. Its judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals of the county. The Supreme Court of the state declined to review the case. 177 N. E. 587. This Court granted certiorari. \n283 \nU.S. 817\n, 51 S. Ct. 649\n\n\n Section 5671 of the Ohio General Code provides: 'The lien of the state for taxes levied for all purposes, in each year, shall attach to all real property subject to such taxes \n\n[284 U.S. 225, 227]\n\u00a0\n on the day preceding the second Monday of April, annually, and continue until such taxes, with any penalties accruing thereon, are paid.' The bankruptcy court, having held two mortgages executed by the bankrupt to be prior in lien to the taxes, applied all of the proceeds of the sale toward the satisfaction of one of them; and left the state taxes unpaid. The treasurer did not by any proceeding in that court question the propriety of such action. Van Huffel admits that the decision of the bankruptcy court was erroneous in denying priority to the taxes, but insists that it is res judicata. The treasurer contends that the judgment of the bankruptcy court authorizing and confirming the sale free from the tax lien is a nullity, because the court was without power to sell property of the bankrupt free from the existing lien for taxes; and also because it did not acquire jurisdiction over the State in that proceeding.\n First. The present Bankruptcy Act (July 1, 1898, 30 Stat. 544, c. 541 ( 11 USCA  1 et seq.)), unlike the Act of 1867,1 contains no provision which in terms confers upon bankruptcy courts the power to sell property of the bankrupt free from incumbrances. We think it clear that the power was granted by implication. Like power had long been exercised by federal courts sitting in equity when ordering sales by receives or on foreclosure. 2 First National Bank v. Shedd, \n121 \nU.S. 74, 87\n, 7 S. Ct. 807; Mellen v. Moline Malleable Iron Works, \n131 \nU.S. 352, 367\n, 9 S. Ct. 781. The lower federal courts have consistently held that the bankruptcy court possesses the \n\n[284 U.S. 225, 228]\n\u00a0\n power, stating that it must be implied from the general equity powers of the court and the duty imposed by section 2 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA  11) to collect, reduce to money and distribute the estates of bankrupts, and to determine controversies with relation thereto.3\n No good reason is suggested why liens for state taxes should be deemed to have been excluded from the scope of this general power to sell free from incumbrances. Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA  104) grants to the court express authority to determine 'the amount or legality' of any tax. To transfer the lien from the property to the proceeds of its sale is the exercise of a lesser power; and legislation conferring it is obviously constitutional. Realization upon the lien created by the state law must yield to the requirements of bankruptcy administration. Compare International Shoe Co. v. Pinkus, \n278 \nU.S. 261\n, 49 S. Ct. 108; Isaacs v. Hobbs Tie & Timber Co., \n282 \nU.S. 734\n, 51 S. Ct. 270; Straton v. New, \n283 \nU.S. 318\n, 51 S. Ct. 465. In many of the cases in the lower federal courts the order of sale entered was broad enough to authorize a sale free from tax liens as well as from others;4 and in some of them it appears affirmatively that liens for taxes were treated as discharged by the order. 5 \n\n[284 U.S. 225, 229]\n\u00a0\n No case has been found in which the power to sell free from the lien of state taxes was denied.\n Second. The treasurer contends that the order authorizing a sale free from incumbrances was void as against the state for lack of notice and opportunity to be heard. He asserts that he had no knowledge of the ruling of the court determining the priority of the liens; that neither he nor his counsel, the prosecuting attorney, was present at any of the proceedings; and that the notice of the public sale, mailed to him after the order of sale had been made by the referee, did not state that the property was to be sold 'free and clear of encumbrances.' But it appears that, prior to any action by the court, notice of the filing of the application to sell free and clear of incumbrances was mailed to the treasurer; and that thereafter he mailed to the referee a statement of the taxes due. It is urged that such notice was insufficient; and also that a proceeding to determine the priority of liens is plenary, whereas the order now complained of was entered in a summary proceeding. Compare Ray v. Norseworthy, 23 Wall. 128. We have no occasion to pursue the argument. So far as appears, neither of these objections was made by the treasurer below, nor were they discussed by any of the state courts. They cannot, therefore, be urged here. Compare Peck v. Heurich, \n167 \nU.S. 624, 628\n, 629 S., 17 S. Ct. 927; Virginian Ry. Co. v. Mullens, \n271 \nU.S. 220, 227\n, 228 S., 46 S. Ct. 526; New York v. Kleinert, \n268 \nU.S. 646, 650\n, 45 S. Ct. 618. \n\n[284 U.S. 225, 230]\n\u00a0\n Third. There remains for consideration a question of practice. After the adverse judgment in the Court of Appeals, Van Huffel filed in the Supreme Court of Ohio a petition in error as of right, claiming that a constitutional question was involved; and he filed there also a motion requesting that the Court of Appeals be directed to certify its record for review. The Supreme Court dismissed the petition in error on the ground that no debatable constitutional question was involved; and it overruled the motion to certify the record for review. An application for rehearing was denied as to both. Van Huffel filed two petitions for certiorari, one ( No. 54) directed to the Court of Appeals, the other (No. 55) directed to the Supreme Court. He states that he did this because he was uncertain to which of the state courts the certiorari from this Court should be directed.\n The question which we have discussed is a federal constitutional question. The Constitution of Ohio, article 4,  2, confers upon the Supreme Court of the state 'appellate jurisdiction in all cases involving questions arising under the Constitution of the United States or of this state.' The order of the Supreme Court dismissing the petition in error as of right, on the ground that no debatable constitutional question was involved, was not, in law, a dismissal of the petition for want of jurisdiction. It was a decision of the case on the merits. Hetrick v. Village of Lindsey, \n265 \nU.S. 384, 386\n, 44 S. Ct. 486; Matthews v. Huwe, \n269 \nU.S. 262, 265\n, 46 S. Ct. 108. Under the federal practice a writ of certiorari would, therefore, have to be directed to that court if it had possession of the record to be reviewed. Atherton v. Fowler, \n91 U.S. 143\n, 146. The petition in error as of right was necessarily accompanied by a transcript of the final record in the Court of Appeals. Ohio General Code,  12263. It is suggested in the brief for the treasurer, however, that such record went out of the possession of the Supreme Court after it dismissed \n\n[284 U.S. 225, 231]\n\u00a0\n the petition in error and denied the motion for certiorari; and in support of this allegation we are referred to rule IX of the Supreme Court, 122 O. S. lxxii, which provides for the return of the record to the lower court 'after the decision of a cause ... in which a final record is not required to be made in' the Supreme Court. But we have obtained the record from the court whose decision we are to review, and so have no occasion to resort to any other court in order to get it. Atherton v. Fowler, supra. Our Rule 43 provides that the certified transcript of the record on file here shall be treated as though sent up in response to a formal writ. The case at bar should, therefore, properly be considered on the writ (in No. 55) issued to the Supreme Court of Ohio; and the writ (in No. 54) issued to the Court of Appeals should be discharged.\n In No. 55, judgment reversed.\n In No. 54, writ of certiorari discharged. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 517, c. 176,  1, 20; Ray v.

U.S.(1931)\nNo. 114\nArgued: January 27, 1931Decided: February 24, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 577, 578]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Lewis Landes, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. G. A. Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a proceeding, under Rev. St.  3257 and 3281 (26 USCA  261, 193), by the United States to forfeit a distillery, warehouse, and denaturing plant of the Waterloo Distilling Corporation on the ground that the corporation had conducted its distilling business upon the premises with intent to defraud, and had defrauded, the government of the tax on the spirits distilled, in consequence of which the premises had become forfeited to the government. The fraud alleged was the withdrawal of alcohol ostensibly for nonbeverage but in reality for beverage purposes, without payment of the tax on spirits diverted to beverage purposes imposed by section 600(a) of the Revenue Act of 1918, as amended (26 USCA  245). The corporation denied any violation of law. \n\n[282 U.S. 577, 579]\n\u00a0\n Evidence was introduced by the government tending to support the libel. The government admitted that, prior to the filing of the libel, the corporation and others had been indicted and convicted for conspiring to violate provisions of the statute, involving the transactions set forth in the libel as a basis for the forfeiture. A motion to dismiss the libel on the ground that the forfeiture proceedings were therefore barred was denied by the district court. There was a verdict for the government and judgment declaring a forfeiture of the premises to the government. This judgment was affirmed by the court below. 40 F.(2d) 422.\n The only questions arising upon the record which we deem it necessary to consider are two in number: (1) Whether under section 600(a) of the Revenue Act of 1918, as amended, there was a diversion of distilled spirits to beverage purposes; (2) whether a conviction of a conspiracy to violate section 600(a) barred the proceedings to forfeit the premises.\n First. By section 600(a), as amended (U. S. Code, Supp. III, title 26 ,  245(4), 26 USCA  245(4), it is provided:\n'On and after February 26, 1926, on all distilled spirits which are diverted to beverage purposes or for use in the manufacture or production of any article used or intended for use as a beverage there shall be leived and collected a tax of $6.40 on each proof gallon or wine gallon when below proof, and a proportionate tax at a like rate on all fractional parts of such proof or wine gallon, to be paid by the person responsible for such diversion. If a tax at the rate of $2.20, $1.65, or $1.10 per proof or wine gallon has been paid upon such distilled spirits a credit of the tax so paid shall be allowed in computing the tax imposed by this paragraph.'\n\n Included in the $6.40 is the basic tax of $2.20, which is not a penalty but a true tax. Only the remaining part of the $6.40 may be regarded as a penalty; but, whether \n\n[282 U.S. 577, 580]\n\u00a0\n the exaction be a tax or a penalty o pa rtly one and partly the other, there is no constitutional objection to enforcing it by forfeiture of the offending property. See United States v. One Ford Coupe, \n272 \nU.S. 321, 328\n, 329 S., 47 S. Ct. 154, 47 A. L. R. 1025\n\n\n The alleged diversion was accomplished by the withdrawal of pure alcohol, which was then specially denatured and made unfit to drink, and in that condition was sold. Petitioners contend that this was a diversion not of distilled spirits, but of denatured alcohol, and, therefore, not within the reach of section 600(a). But upon the evidence and the instructions of the court it was open to the jury to find that the alcohol was specially denatured to the contemplated end that, after it had passed into the hands of purchasers, it would be 'cleaned' and finally used for beverage purposes. In that view it is entirely accurate to say that the alcohol was diverted to beverage purposes, the special denaturing being only an intervening step.\n Second. In United States v. La Franca, \n282 \nU.S. 568\n, 51 S. Ct. 278, decided this day, we hold that, under section 5 of the Willis-Campbell Act (42 Stat. 223), a civil action to recover taxes, which in fact are penalties, is punitive in character and barred by a prior conviction of the defendant for a criminal offense involving the same transactions. This, however, is not that case, but a proceeding in rem to forfeit property used in committing an offense. At common law, in many cases, the right of forfeiture did not attach until the offending person had been convicted and the record of conviction produced. But that doctrine did not apply, as this court in an early case pointed out, where the right of forfeiture was 'created by statute, in rem, cognizable on the revenue side of the exchequer. The thing is here primarily considered as the offender, or rather the offense is attached primarily to the thing; and this, whether the offense be malum prohibitum, or malum in se.' The Palmyra, 12 \n\n[282 U.S. 577, 581]\n\u00a0\n Wheat. 1, 14. In that case the forfeiture was of a vessel in admiralty. But in Dobbins's Distillery v. United States, \n96 U.S. 395\n, the property seized was a distillery in the hands of a lessee. The acts or omissions of the lessee with intent to defraud the revenue were unknown to the owner. Nevertheless, it was held that the distillery was subject to forfeiture. The court after referring to The Palmyra, supra, and to the statute which provided for the forfeiture of the property in consequence of the unlawful acts of the distiller with intent to defraud, said (page 401):\n'Nothing can be plainer in legal decision than the proposition that the offense therein defined is attached primarily to the distillery, and the real and personal property used in connection with the same, without any regard whatsoever to the personal misconduct or responsibility of the owner, beyond what necessarily arises from the fact that he leased the property to the distiller, and suffered it to be occupied and used by the lessee as a distillery.'\n\n To the same effect, see Goldsmith-Grant Co. v. United States, \n254 U.S. 505\n, 510-512, 41 S. Ct. 189, United States v. Five Boxes of Asafoetida (D. C.) 181 F. 561, 564. And compare Murphy v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 630, 632\n, 47 S. Ct. 218.\n A forfeiture proceeding under Rev. St.  3257 or  3281 is in rem. It is the property which is proceeded against, and, by resort to a legal fiction, held guilty and condemned as though it were conscious instead of inanimate and insentient. In a criminal prosecution it is the wrongdoer in person who is proceeded against, convicted and punished. The forfeiture is no part of the punishment for the criminal offense. Origet v. United States, \n125 U.S. 240\n, 245-247, 8 S. Ct. 846. The provision of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution in respect of double jeopardy does not apply. United States v. Three Copper Stills (D. C.) 47 F. 495, 499; United States v. Olsen (D. C.) 57 F. 579, 582 et seq.; Sandersv. State of Iowa, 2 Iowa (Cole Ed.) 230, 278. \n\n[282 U.S. 577, 582]\n\u00a0\n It is said that included in the decree of forfeiture is an island not 'bonded' or used as a means of ingress or egress to, but entirely separate from, the distilling premises. Our attention, however, is called to nothing in the record which appears to verify these statements. No instructions to the jury were asked or given on the subject, nor was it considered by the court below or referred to in the application for certiorari. In these circumstances it is unreasonable to expect us to consider the question.\n We have not overlooked other contentions made by petitioner, but, in so far as they are not met by what already has been said, we find it unnecessary to consider them for lack of substance.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] State Report Title: Various Items of Personal Property v.

On March 6, 1923, the Bureau of Internal Revenue duly mailed to the taxpayer notice of a deficiency. A timely appeal was taken to the Commissioner who had meanwhile, in March, 1923, made a jeopardy assessment. On March 27, 1923, the taxpayer filed a claim for abatement. On June 4, 1924, this claim and the appeal were sent by the Income Tax Unit to the Committee on Appeals and Review. \n1\n On October 28, 1925, the Commissioner duly mailed to the taxpayer notice of his determination, the claim for abatement being allowed in part and rejected in part. On November 18, 1925, the taxpayer appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals for a redetermination of the deficiency. There the parties stipulated the amount of the additional tax, and submitted the question whether it was barred by the statute of limitations. The Board held that it was not, 13 B. T.

Moreover, while there was under the Revenue Act of 1917 a limitation of three years on the period for assessment,2 the taxpayer had duly executed and filed on December 13, 1920, before the three years expired, a waiver which extended the period for assessment to April 1, 1924.3 This waiver was valid, even though executed by the taxpayer before the act of 1921 and not executed by the Commissioner until 1922. Aiken v. Burnet, \n282 \nU.S. 277\n, 51 S. Ct. 148, decided this day. The original letter advising the taxpayer of the deficiency, the intradepartmental appeal therefrom, the jeopardy assessment, and the claim for abatement were all made in 1923 within the extended period.\n The sole question for discussion is whether the right of collection has been barred under section 250(d) of the Revenue Act of 1921 which imposed a five-year limitation on col- \n\n[282 U.S. 283, 287]\n\u00a0\n lection. See Stange v. United States, supra. No payment has been made on account of the additional tax; and no proceeding for collection has been taken, either by suit or by distraint. Unless extended by waiver, the period allowed for collection expired April 1, 1923. Three waivers were given. The first was executed by the taxpayer and filed with the Bureau December 13, 1920; was approved by the Commissioner on December 2, 1922; and expired April 1, 1924. The second was executed by both the taxpayer and the Commissioner on December 10, 1923, and expired by its terms one year from its date. The third was executed by the taxpayer and the Commissioner on October 25, 1924; and it was in terms declared to be 'in effect for a period of one year after the expiration of the statutory period of limitation within which assessments of taxes may be made for the year or years mentioned, or the statutory period of limitations as extended by section 277(b) of the Revenue Act of 1924 (26 USCA  1057 mote ), or by any waivers already on file with the Bureau.' All three waivers were effective in extending the period for collection. The first was valid, although executed by the taxpayer before the act of 1921 and not executed by the Commissioner until 1922, and operative even though it did not make express reference to collection. Aiken v. Burne, 2 \n82 \nU.S. 277\n, 51 S. Ct. 148, decided this day. The second was valid because given within the period as extended by the first. The third was valid because given within the period as extended by the second. Moreover, both were valid although given after five years from the date of the filing of the return. \n4\n See Stange v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 270\n, 51 S. Ct. 145; Burnet v. Chicago Railway Equipment Co., \n282 \nU.S. 295\n, 51 S. Ct. 137, both decided this day. In terms, both covered collection. The third had not ex- \n\n[282 U.S. 283, 288]\n\u00a0\n pired when the appeal was taken to the Board of Tax Appeals on November 18, 1925.\n Whether the right of collection became barred thereafter depends upon the construction to be given to the applicable statutes. The taxpayer contends that the right of collection was barred on December 10, 1925, that is, twenty-two days after the appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals had been taken, although this appeal was then pending without having been heard, and indeed could not have been heard under the practice of the Board. See rule 15, 1 B. T. A. 1289; rules 24-25, 7 B. T. A. 1361, 1362. Besides the Revenue Act of 1921, provisions of the Revenue Act of 1924 and of the Revenue Act of 1926 are relied upon. The argument is that, despite the appeal to the Board, the Commissioner was at all times at liberty to enforce payment of the tax as assessed by the jeopardy assessment or as later reduced; that hence collection was barred on December 10, 1925, by section 250(d) of the 1921 act; and that there was nothing in either the Revenue Act of June 2, 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, or the Revenue Act of February 26, 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, which kept alive the right of collection. The Board of Tax Appeals rested its decision on provisions of the 1924 act;5 the Circuit Court of Appeals on those and also on the 1926 act. Only the latter act need be considered.\n Section 283(f) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 64 (26 USCA  1064), provided: \n\n[282 U.S. 283, 289]\n\u00a0\n 'If any deficiency (in any 1916-21 income or profits taxes) ... was assessed before June 3, 1924, but was not paid in fully before June 3, 1924, but was not paid in full before 2, 1924, but before the enactment of this Act finally determined the amount of the deficiency, and if the person liable for such tax appealed before the enactment of this Act to the Board and the appeal is pending before the Board at the time of the enactment of this Act, the Board shall have jurisdiction of the appeal. In all such cases the powers, duties, rights, and privileges of the Commissioner and of the person who has brought the appeal, and the jurisdiction of the Board and of the courts, shall be determined ... in the same manner as provided in subdivision (e) of this section. ...'6\n This section is applicable to the case at bar. The deficiency was assessed in March, 1923; and hence before 'June 3, 1924,' 'and was not paid.' n O ctober 28, 1925, between the effective dates of the 1924 and the 1926 acts, the Commissioner finally determined the amount of the deficiency; and on November 18, 1925, also prior to the enactment of the 1926 act, the taxpayer appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals. One effect of the section was to confirm the jurisdiction of the Board. \n7\n Another \n\n[282 U.S. 283, 290]\n\u00a0\n effect was to make applicable to the case at bar section 274(a) and section 277(b) of the 1926 act (26 USCA  1048, 1057).8 Section 274(a) provided that no distraint or proceeding in court for the collection \n\n[282 U.S. 283, 291]\n\u00a0\n of the deficiency 'shall be made, begun, or prosecuted ... if a petition has been filed with the Board (of Tax Appeals), until the decision of the Board has become final.' \n9\n And section 277(b) provided that the running of the statute of limitations on 'the beginning of distraint or a proceeding in court for collection, in respect of any deficiency shall ... be suspended for the period during which the Commissioner is prohibited from ... beginning distraint or a proceeding in court, and for 60 days thereafter.' \n10\n That period still continues, as there is not yet a final determination of the Board. \n11\n The taxpayer concedes that section 283(f) of the 1926 act confirmed the jurisdiction of the Board of Tax Appeals in the present case, but contends that it did not operate to extend the period for collection until after a final determination.\n First. It is argued that section 283(f) cannot be interpreted as extending the time for the collection of the tax because of section 1000 ( 26 USCA  1217 note).12 The latter section amended the 1924 act by providing that, where the Board found that the tax was barred by the statute of limitations, its decision should be that there was no deficiency. This section was inserted \n\n[282 U.S. 283, 292]\n\u00a0\n to confirm the jurisdiction of the Board in making final disposition of a deficiency already barred. \n13\n It contains nothing which affects the special jurisdiction conferred by section 283(f).\n Second. It is argued that neither section 277(b), which suspended the running of the statute, nor section 283(f), which incorporated the former, 14 indicate that section 277(b) was to be given a retroactive effect. The argument is unsound. Subdivision (f) of section 283 shows that it was the intention of Congress to apply the provisions of section 277(b) to cases like that at bar. Since in such cases the assessment (before June 3, 1924), the final determination and the appeal to the Board (after June 2, 1924) must expressly have occurred prior to the enactment of the 1926 act, the reference to section 277(b) contained in section 283(f) necessarily meant that in these cases the former section was to be applied retroactively.\n Third. The taxpayer relies also upon section 278(e)15 of the 1926 act which prohibited collection, in the absence of a waiver prior to that act, if at the date of its enactment the tax was already barred. The argument is that, since the last waiver by its terms expired on December 10, 1925, that is, prior to the effective date of the 1926 \n\n[282 U.S. 283, 293]\n\u00a0\n act, this section bars collection. That interpretation is not correct. As was said by the court below: 'The authority for extending the time for collection under the facts of the case at bar is found in section 283(f), and not in section 278. ... If we are to accept petitioner's contention that section 278(e) is inconsistent with the interpretation we have given section 283(f), we must necessarily hold that section 278(e) in effect nullifies the clear provisions of section 283(f). Not only is there nothing in the statute to warrant this interpretation, but the interrelatios o f section 274(e) and section 283(f) makes the contrary clear.' 16 38 F.(2d) 431.\n Fourth. It is argued that, inasmuch as the Commissioner was not prohibited from making collection between November 18, 1925, the date of the appeal, and February 26, 1926, the effective date of the 1926 act,17 and since \n\n[282 U.S. 283, 294]\n\u00a0\n the period for collection, as extended by the waivers, expired December 10, 1925, section 277(b) does not aid the Commissioner because the statute and run before section could cause it to be suspended. Attention is called to another section of the 1926 act, section 283(l), which provided that in the case of any tax imposed by a prior act there shall be added to the period of suspension given by section 277(b) any period prior to the act of 1926 during which the Commissioner was prohibited from beginning distraint or proceeding in court. 18 The argument is that this section indicates that section 274(a) and section 277(b) are not to be applied retroactively; that only the period, if any, obtained under section 283(l) can be added to the waivers; and that, since the Commissioner was not prohibited from collecting prior to the expiration of the last waiver, section 283(l) is inapplicable. Section 283(l) expressly provides that the time therein granted shall be 'in addition to the period of suspension provided for in subdivision (b) of section 277.' It undoubtedly had reference to those cases in which a claim for abatement, accompanied by a bond, had been filed and collection stayed between the 1924 act and 1926 act. \n19\n It cannot limit the application to the case at bar of section 274(a) and section 277(b) as section 283(f) directs. This argument of the taxpayer is also unsound.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Williamsport Wire Rope Co. v. United States, \n277 U.S. 551\n, 563, note, 48 S. Ct. 587. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] There was doubt whether the 1916 and 1917 acts required the Commissioner both to discover the error in the return and to make an additional assessment, or merely to make discovery, within three years. Revenue Act of 1916, c. 463,  14(a), 39 Stat. 756, 772, incorporated by reference into Revenue Act of 1917, c. 63,  206(c), 40 Stat. 300, 305. At that time, the Commissioner thought it sufficient that he discover the error within the three years. See Reg. 33 (Rev. Ed. 1918) art. 233. Compare Eliot National Bank v. Gill (C. C. A.) 218 F. 600, 602; United States v. Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. (C. C. A.) 249 F. 678, 682; Du Pont v. Graham (D. C.) 283 F. 300, 302, reversed on other grounds, \n262 \nU.S. 234\n, 43 S. Ct. 567. Section 250(d) of the 1921 act extended this period for assessment to five years (compare United States v. Chicago & E. I. Ry. (D. C.) 298 F. 779), but provided that the time run from the filing of the return. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] This waiver was unlimited in time but expired April 1, 1924, under a departmental ruling promulgated April 11, 1923, Mim. 3085, I. R. Cum. Bull. II-1, p. 174. See Aiken v. Burnet, \n282 \nU.S. 277\n, 51 S. Ct. 148, decided this day, note 1. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Inasmuch as the second and third waivers were in themselves sufficient to extend the period for collection, the first waiver may be disregarded in this connection, as was done by the lower court. See 38 F.( 2d) 428. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] It relied upon G. L. Ramsey v. Commissioner, 11 B. T. A. 345, where it had held that, on a jeopardy assessment which had been made within the fiveyear period as extended by a valid waiver, the Commissioner had, under section 278(d) of the Revenue Act of 1924 (26 USCA  1061 note), six years after the assessment within which to commence proceedings for collection, even though the parties had agreed in the waiver for a different period for collection. The Board held further that there was nothing in section 278(d) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (26 USCA  1061) which restricted this period to that mentioned in the waiver.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Somewhat similar provisions relating to like cases under prior estate and gift tax statutes were enacted at the same time. See Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27,  318(d)(e)(f), 44 Stat. 9, 82, 83 (26 USCA  1118); De Sabichi v. Commissioner, 4 B. T. A. 445. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Although some doubt was expressed in Appeal of Reynolds & Reynolds Co., 1 B. T. A. 275, the Board of Tax Appeals very early took jurisdiction in these cases. Appeal of Joseph Garneau Co., Inc., 1 B. T. A. 75; Appeal of Ormsby McKnight Mitchel, 1 B. T. A. 143; Appeal of Boston Structural Steel Co., 1 B. T. A. 602; Appeal of Buffalo Slag Co., 1 B. T. A. 749. Compare Appeal of Terminal Wine Co., 1 B. T. A. 697. Following the act of 1926, the board has uniformly held that section 283(f) confirmed its jurisdiction. See Appeal of Covert Gear Co., 4 B. T. A. 1025; Appeal of Elizabeth W. Stranahan, 4 B. T. A. 1141; Appeal of Nice Ball Bearing Co., 5 B. 484; Appeal of Slater Mills, Inc., 5 B. T. A. 971; Appeal of Ocean Accident & Guarantee Corp., 6 B. T. A. 1045; Reliance Mfg. Co. v. Commissioner, 7 B. T. A. 583. Such was clearly the legislative purpose of the section. See Hearings Before the Committee on Ways and Means on Revenue Revision of 1925, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 898 et seq., particularly the statement of the Board Chairman, Charles D. Hamel, p. 923; H. Rep. No. 1, Id., December 7, 1925, p. 13; Sen. Rep. No. 52, Id., January 16, 1926, p. 32; Conference Report, H. Rep. No. 356, Id., February 22, 1926, pp. 46, 47. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Subdivision (f) of section 283 refers to subdivision (e). That section provides that the situation dealt with therein should be treated as though a deficiency notice had been sent under section 274(a), and that the tax 'shall be collected and paid in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations ... as in the case of a deficiency in the tax imposed (by the 1926 Act), except as otherwise provided in section 277,' and in certain sections relating to interest and jeopardy collection, which are here immaterial. 44 Stat. 64 (26 USCA  1064). Deficiencies under the 1926 Act were governed by sections 273, 274, and 275, 44 Stat. 55-57. Section 273 (26 USCA  1047), defining the term, and section 275 ( 26 USCA  1055), providing for additions in the case of negligence, fraud, etc., are not here applicable. Section 274(a) is quoted in the text. Section 277(a), 26 USCA  1057, related to the periods for assessment and collection generally and re-enacted the five-year limitation on the collection of 1917 taxes. It was qualified by section 277(b), quoted in the text.\n Section 283(f) was, in addition, limited by section 283(j), 26 USCA  1064, which prohibited an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals if the hearing before the Board had been held prior to the enactment of the 1926 act. Blair v. Curran (C. C. A.) 24 F.(2d) 390; Blair v. Hendricks (C. C.A .) 24 F.(2d) 819; Power & Bro. v. Commissioner (C. C. A.) 27 F.(2d) 116. In the case at bar, the hearing was held on April 26, 1928. Also section 284(d), 44 Stat. 67 (26 USCA  1065), which imposed restrictions on the allowance of refunds and credits after an appeal had been taken to the Board of Tax Appeals, was made inapplicable to cases under section 283(f). Compare Burnet v. Chicago Railway Equipment Co., \n282 \nU.S. 295\n, 51 S. Ct. 137, decided this day, note 8. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] 44 Stat. 55 (26 USCA  1048). Notwithstanding the prohibition in Rev. St.  3224 (26 USCA  154), such suit or distraint proceeding may, by express provision in section 274(a), be enjoined. Peerless Woolen Mills v. Rose (C. C. A.) 28 F.(2d) 661. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] 44 Stat. 58, 59 (26 USCA  1057). \n[\nFootnote 11\n] Section 274(h), 44 Stat. 56 (26 USCA  1048(f) provided that the decision of the Board should become final according to the rules set out in section 1005. That section provides that finality shall be given thirty days after the issuance of the mandate of this Court, in case of an affirmance or dismissal, or upon correction in case of a modification or reversal. 44 Stat. 111 (title 26 U. S. Code,  1228 (26 USCA  1228). \n[\nFootnote 12\n] 44 Stat. 105, 107. This section was a general amendment to title 9 of the Revenue Act of 1924. An entire new section, section 906, was inter alia, thereby added to the 1924 act, of which subdivision (e) (26 USCA  1217 note) is relied upon by respondent. \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] See Hearings Before Committee on Ways and Means on Revenue Revision of 1925, supra, note 7, pp. 849, et seq., 900-02. The Board had early decided that it had jurisdiction in such cases under section 900 of the 1924 act (26 USCA  1211 note et seq.). Appeal of National Refining Co ., 1 B. T. A. 236. Compare note 12, supra. \n[\nFootnote 14\n] See note 8, supra. \n[\nFootnote 15\n] 'This section ... shall (not) authorize ... the collection (of a tax) ... (1) if at the time of the enactment of this Act (such collection) was barred ... unless prior to the enactment of this Act the Commissioner and the taxpayer agreed in writing thereto, or (2) contrary to the provisions of subdivision (a) of section 274 of this Act.' 44 Stat. 59 (26 USCA  1062). \n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] As was pointed out below, the latter part of section 278(e), which prohibits collection contrary to section 274(a), quoted supra page 290, recognizes and reinforces the prohibition against collection while a case is pending before the Board. See note 9, supra. Since this same subsection 274(a) is incorporated in section 283(f), supra note 8, it seems clear from this interrelation that section 278(e) was not intended to limit section 283(f), and that the suspension of the statute given by section 277(b) is applicable to the instant case. See 38 F.(2d) 431. \n[\nFootnote 17\n] The filing of the claim for abatement of the jeopardy assessment did not operate as a stay of collection. The claim filed in the present case, under section 252 of the 1921 act (42 Stat. 268) and Rev. St.  3228, as amended by section 1316 of that act (42 Stat. 314 (26 USCA  157)), was apparently not accompanied by a bond. Under such circumstances the filing of the claim would not have prevented collection if the Commissioner had believed that collection of the tax was jeopardized. See Reg. 33 (1918 Ed.) art. 261; Reg. 45, art. 1032; Reg. 62, art. 1032. Cf. United States v. Burden, Smith & Co. (C. C. A.) 33 F.(2d) 229, 230. Prior to the decision in Bowers v. N. Y. & Albany Lighterage Co., \n273 \nU.S. 346\n, 47 S. Ct. 389, it was, however, the common practice to postpone collection upon the filing of a claim for abatement if there was no doubt as to the taxpayer's solvency. See H. Rep. No. 2, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., December 7, 1927, p. 34. \n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] 44 Stat. 66 (26 USCA  1064). \n[\nFootnote 19\n] See section 279 of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 300 (26 USCA  1063 note). Compare section 283(b) and (c) of the 1926 act ( 26 USCA  1064). These sections confirmed the jurisdiction of the Board in cases in which an assessment had been made and an appeal taken, or in which the 60-day period had not expired before the 1926 act. Compare Plains Buying & Selling Ass'nv. Commissioner, 5 B. T. A. 1147, 1153. In such cases a jeopardy assessment and claim for abatement, accompanied by a bond and providing for a stay of collection, between the 1924 and 1926 act, would have been possible, and section 283(l) would have applied. \n\n\n\n\n","187":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWAITE v.

Dwibrow, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the court.\n By an amended bill presented to the United States District Court, Northern District of California, April 5, 1929, petitioner sought to prevent respondent from constructing an alleged extension until permission should be obtained from the Interstate Commerce Commission as \n\n[284 U.S. 47, 49]\n\u00a0\n provided by Transportation Act of 1920, Ch. 91,  402, paragraphs 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 41 Stat. 456, 477, 478 (49 USCA  1(18-22).1\n The petitioner is a railroad corporation organized under the laws of California to construct and operate a standard steam railroad from San Francisco southward along the western shore of San Francisco Bay and to Redwood City in San Mateo county. The proposed line, approximately 25 miles in length, lies eastward of, near, and substantially parallel to, a line operated by the respondent. In July, 1928, petitioner's directors authorized application to the Interstate Commerce Commission for authority to construct the proposed road, and this was promptly presented. During the following August, September, and October, surveys of the route were made; a definite location was adopted in March, 1929\n\n\n The Interstate Commerce Commission heard the application in January, 1929; the Southern Pacific Company appeared in opposition. Prior to the filing of the bill, the \n\n[284 U.S. 47, 50]\n\u00a0\n Commission had taken no final action, nor had actual construction of the proposed road begun.\n The respondent, as owner or lessee, operates an extensive interstate railroad system, including a double track line from San Francisco southward through Redwood City. In March, 1929, it began to lay tracks in San Mateo county with the intention that they should ultimately extend from its main line some eighty-two hundred feet easterly and across petitioner's proposed route to points along the Bay. Its purpose was to impede and prevent petitioner's proposed construction and operation; also to secure traffic from a district adjacent to the petitioner's proposed line, the industrial development of which was anticipated.\n In defense to the bill, respondent relied especially upon two grounds: First, that petitioner was not a 'party in interest' within in the meaning of the Transportation Act, and therefore could not maintain the suit; second, that the line which it had commenced to construct would not become an extension, but a mere industrial, or spur, track. The trial court considered and rejected both grounds of defense, and directed an injunction as prayed.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals (46 F.(2d) 729) was of opinion that, in the circumstances, the petitioner was not a 'party in interest,' and upon that ground reversed the decree of the trial court. It expressed no opinion in respect of the second defense. This action, we think, was error; and its decree must be reversed. The cause will be remanded there for determination of the question of fact.\n Paragraphs 18 to 22, supra, were considered here in Texas & Pacific Ry. v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry., \n270 \nU.S. 266\n, 46 S. Ct. 263, and were declared to be part of the general plan by which Congress intended to promote development and maintenance of adequate railroad facilities. It was there said, page 277 of 270 U. S., 46 S. Ct. 263, 266: 'It (Congress) recognized that preservation of the earning capacity, and conserva- \n\n[284 U.S. 47, 51]\n\u00a0\n tion of the financial resources, of individual carriers, is a matter of national concern; that the property employed must be permitted to earn a reasonable return; that the building of unnecessary lines involves a waste of resources, and that the burden of this waste may fall upon the public; that competition between carriers may result in harm to the public, as well as in benefit; and that, when a railroad inflicts injury upon its rival, it may be the public which ultimately bears the loss. See Railroad Commission v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563\n, 42 S. Ct. 232, 22 A. L. R. 1086; The New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184\n, 43 S. Ct. 270; The Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258\n, 44 S. Ct. 317; Railroad Commission v. Southern Pacific Co., \n264 \nU.S. 331\n, 44 S. Ct. 376. The act sought, among other things, to avert such losses.'\n The Texas & Pacific Railway sought to prevent an unauthorized competitor from building an extension into territory already served by it. Prior to the statute, it could not have maintained such a suit, since the competitor's proposed action did not threaten interference with any legal right. No carrier could then demand exemption from honest competition.\n If, as the court below seems to have assumed, a 'party in interest' must possess some clear legal right for which it might ask protection under the rules commonly accepted by courts of equity, the paragraphs under consideration would not materially aid the Congressional plan for promoting transportation. On the other hand, there was no purpose to permit any individual so inclined to institute such a proceeding. The complaint must possess something more than a common concern for obedience to law. See Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447, 488\n, 43 S. Ct. 597. It will suffice, we think, if the bill discloses that some definite legal right possessed by complainant is seriously threatened, or that the unauthorized and therefore unlawful action of the defendant carrier may directly and adversely affect the complainant's welfare by bringing about \n\n[284 U.S. 47, 52]\n\u00a0\n some material change in the transportation situation. Here, the petitioner was peculiarly concerned; its own welfare was seriously threatened. It alleged the beginning of an unlawful undertaking by a carrier which might prove deleterious to it as well as to the public interest in securing and maintaining proper railroad service without undue loss. It relied upon the procedure prescribed by the statute to secure an orderly hearing and proper determination of the matter. The disclosures of the bill were enough to show that the respondent's intended action might directly and seriously affect the project which complainant was undertaking in good faith. There was enough to give the latter the standing of a 'party in interest' within intendment of the act.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Transportation Act 1920,  402-\n Paragraph '(18) No carrier by railroad subject to this chapter shall undertake the extension of its line of railroad ... unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require the construction ... of such additional or extended line . ...'

JOHNSON(1931)\nNo. 29\nArgued: December 5, 1930Decided: January 5, 1931\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 367, 368]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry K. Urion, of Chicago, Ill., for Clinton R. White.\n Mr. Thomas D. Thacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for Johnson and another.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals has certified five questions. From the statement of facts contained in the certificate it appears that since August 15, 1926, appellant has owned and operated a radio broadcasting station in Chicago and has had successive licenses from the Secretary of Commerce, and (after the enactment of the Radio Act of 1927 c. 169, 44 Stat. 1162; U. S. Code Supp. III, title 47,  81 et seq. (47 USCA  81 et seq.)) from the Federal Radio Commission. Under those from the Commission he at first broadcasted on a wave length of 760 kilocycles with a power of 500 watts, and subsequently on a wave length of 1340 kilocycles with the same power, and was required to divide time with two other stations.\n On January 12, 1928, he filed an application for renewal of his then current license, which would expire on September 1, 1928. May 25, 1928, the Commission entered a \n\n[282 U.S. 367, 369]\n\u00a0\n general order concerning that application and 163 others, stating that it was not satisfied that public interest, convenience or necessity would be served by granting any of them, and fixing a date for a hearing. Each applicant was notified that failing an affirmative showing that public interest, convenience or necessity would be served by granting his application it would be denied. Hearings were had on all the applications. Thereafter, on August 22, 1928, an order was promulgated by the Commission modifying the appellant's existing license by reducing the authorized power to 100 watts, and extending the term to October 1, 1928\n\n\n The approximate value of the physical equipment of appellant's station is $5,000. He has expended some $16,000 in its operation. At the time of the Commission's action his net profits were about $400 per week. His equipment will not operate efficiently or satisfactorily at 100 watts. To broadcast with that power he will have to replace a very substantial portion of his present apparatus. The reduction in power will restrict the area which can be served to one-fourth of its former size, and will cause the loss of a large portion of his listening public and advertising clientele.\n Although section 16 of the Radio Act of 1927 (U. S. C. Supp. III, title 47,  96 (47 USCA  96)) authorized an appeal from the Commission's order to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, it was conceded at bar that appellant took none. He filed a bill quia timet in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois praying that the enforcement of the criminal provisions of the act against him for violation of the order be enjoined; and, upon dismissal of that bill, appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\n The questions certified follow.\n Qest ion 1. Did a person who, prior to the enactment of the Radio Act of 1927, applied for and was granted suc- \n\n[282 U.S. 367, 370]\n\u00a0\n cessive licenses by the Secretary of Commerce for the operation of a broadcasting station, and who owned and continuously operated such broadcasting station, whereby it developed a following of listeners and advertisers which constituted a going business, have or acquire thereby property in the continued operation of such station, with power appropriate to continue the operation of said business, within the meaning of the word 'property' as used in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States?\n'Question 2. If the answer to Question 1 is in the affirmative, is the Joint Resolution of Congress of December 8th, 1926 valid as against the claim that by virtue of the waiver it requires it works a deprivation of such property without due process of law or a taking of private property for public use without just compensation?\n\n'Question 3. If the answer to Question 1 is in the affirmative, is the Radio Act of 1927, as amended, valid as against the claim that, by virtue of the waiver required in the last paragraph of Section 5 and by virtue of the condition required to be contained in all licenses by subparagraph (A) of Section 11, it works a deprivation of such property without due process of law or a taking of private property for public use without just compensation?\n\n'Question 4. If the answer to Question 1 is in the affirmative, is the Radio Act of 1927, as amended, valid as against the claim that it authorizes or requires the Federal Radio Commission, in its action on an application for renewal of license by a person such as is described in Question 1, to take private property for public use without just compensation, either by denying such application or by granting it on such terms as virtually to destroy a going broadcasting business of such person?\n\n'Question 5. If the answer to Question 1 is in the affirmative, is the Radio Act of 1927, as amended, valid as against the claim that it authorizes or requires the Fed- \n\n[282 U.S. 367, 371]\n\u00a0\n eral Radio Commission, in acting upon an application for renewal of license by said person, to deprive such person of such property without due process of law, in that the only standards provided by the Act for the guidance of the Commission in acting upon such applications are that of 'public interest, convenience or necessity' and that set forth in Section 5 of the Amendatory Act of March 28, 1928, and in that the Act fails to require that the Commission, prior to proceeding to a hearing or decision on such application, shall specify in what respect it deems or has failed to find that the granting of such application would not serve public interest, convenience or necessity?'\n\n Rule 37 (par. 1) of this Court (28 USCA  354) provides, inter alia:\n'Only questions or propositions of law may be certified, and they must be distinct and definite.'\n\n The court has repeatedly held that it will not answer questions of objectionable generality. United States v. Worley, \n281 \nU.S. 339, 340\n, 50 S. Ct. 291; United States v. John Barth Co., \n276 \nU.S. 606\n, 48 S. Ct. 338; United States v. Mayer, \n235 \nU.S. 55, 70\n, 35 S. Ct. 16; United States v. Northway, \n120 \nU.S. 327\n, 7 S. Ct. 580. And a question is improper which is so broad and indefinite as to admit of one answer under one set of circumstances and a different answer under another. Enfield v. Jordan, \n119 \nU.S. 680\n, 7 S. Ct. 358; Jewell v. Knight, \n123 \nU.S. 426\n, 8 S. Ct. 193; Hallowell v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 101\n, 28 S. Ct. 498.\n The first question inquires merely whether the employment of tangible property in an existing business begets in the proprietor a 'property' in the continuance of the business, as the word 'property' is used in the Fifth Amendment. It is so broad and indefinite that an answer would not necessarily be of assistance in the decision of the cause. It was never intendedtha t in answer to a question certified, we should give a dissertation on the application of the Fifth Amendment. Were we to attempt to do so, we should have to assume the existence of facts and circumstances, the absence of which from the record \n\n[282 U.S. 367, 372]\n\u00a0\n might render our statements wholly irrelevant. Reinecke v. Gardner, \n277 \nU.S. 239\n, 48 S. Ct. 472. The essence of the amendment is its application under all the circumstances of a given case. A broad statement as to whether a thing or a status is property within its intent might well be meaningless or misleading.\n Much argument was directed to the proposition that one who first establishes a broadcasting station in and serves a given area thereby appropriates that portion of the ether which he employs or through which the station's radio activity operates; and it was suggested that in analogy to the doctrine as to appropriation of waters, et id omne genus, a property right is thus acquired. It was urged that the question presents this proposition; but it clearly fails so to do. We are not required to answer it.\n Questions 2 and 3 are contingent upon our answer to question 1. The first asks whether, if we answer question 1 in the affirmative, the Joint Resolution of December 8, 1926, is valid as against the claim that by virtue of the waiver it requires of the applicant for a license it violates certain constitutional guaranties. The second asks whether, if our answer to question 1 be in the affirmative, the Radio Act of 1927, as amended, is valid as against the claim that by virtue of the similar waiver required in the last paragraph of Section 5 (47 USCA  85 note), and the waiver required to be contained in all licenses, it violates the same constitutional guaranties.\n The appellees concede that if a person has a right guaranteed by the Constitution, legislation requiring that such right be waived as a condition of the exercise of a privilege granted would be invalid. However that may be, no such concession calls on us to answer questions which are themselves contingent on another which we do not answer.\n The fourth question asks us to say whether, if our answer to question 1 is in the affirmative, the Radio Act of \n\n[282 U.S. 367, 373]\n\u00a0\n 1927 as amended is valid as against the claim that it authorizes or requires the Federal Radio Commission, in acting on an application for renewal of license by a person such as described in question 1, to take private property for public use without just compensation, by denying or granting the application on terms destructive of the going business of the applicant.\n This question we need not answer, for the reasons stated as to the two preceding. But it has another fatal defect. An answer would involve merely an examination of the Act and a determination whether on its face it violates the Fifth Amendment. Neither this Court nor the court below is authorized to answer academic questions. The constitutionality of a statute is not drawn into question except in connection with its application to some person, natural or artificial. We have above called attention to the provisions of the Radio Act which give redress against arbitrary or unjust action by the Commission. We repeat that the appellant did not see fit to avail himself of the right of appeal thereby conferred, but on the contrary chose to violate the Commission's order and to stand on an alleged constitutional right which he says the action of the Commission infringed. It would be subversive of all established principles were courts, in litigations between parties, who have reciprocal rights under the Constitution, to settle their controversies by broad statements to the effect that acts of Congress are unconstitutional upon their face; and this not only in ignorance of the circumstances and manner of the application of the statute by the administrative body, but with knowledge that the party complaining had failed to pursue the remedy provided by law.\n The fifth question not only is contingent on our answer to question 1, but assumes that th Radio Act may be unconstitutional because it fails to provide a specific method of procedure and does not furnish a standard of \n\n[282 U.S. 367, 374]\n\u00a0\n conduct for the Commission. But the appellant's rights, as respects procedure, depend not alone on the alleged requirements of the Act, but on the adequacy of the hearing in fact afforded him; and his substantive rights under the statute depend upon the public interest, convenience or necessity in view of all the facts adduced and circumstances appearing before the Commission. We are not advised what sort of hearing was held, nor what facts were proved. If the proceeding was an unfair one, as lacking adequate notice, full hearing, or development of all relevant facts, appellant had a remedy provided by the statute, which in the orderly processes of the administration of the law he was bound to pursue. To answer the question as framed we should have to treat the proceedings before the Commission as irrelevant; to hold that body's interpretation of the language of the act as applied to appellant in all the circumstances of his case as of no moment; and to ignore his admitted failure to avail himself of the right of review conferred by the statute. The question need not be answered.\n The certificate is dismissed. \n\n\n\n","190":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILBUR v.

C., and Mac Asbill, of Atlanta, Ga., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court. \n No. 66.\n\n May 31, 1919, the relator under section 5 of the Act of March 2 of that year, 40 Stat. 1272, 1274 (50 USCA  80 note), known as the War Minerals Relief Act, filed with the Secretary of the Interior a claim for net losses alleged to have been suffered by reason of producing or preparing to produce chrome in compliance with the request of the Secretary. The claim included an item of $16,259 asserted to be a net loss by \n\n[284 U.S. 231, 234]\n\u00a0\n reason of the expenditure of that amount for the purchase of land upon which the mine was located. Relator still holds the title. May 15, 1922, the Secretary held that under the act he was not authorized to adjust or pay losses by reason of expenditures for the purchase of property, and on that ground denied any award on account of that item.\n In Work v. Rives (1925) \n267 \nU.S. 175\n, 45 S. Ct. 252, we held that the act made the Secretary's decisions conclusive. But Congress, by the Act of February 13, 1929, 45 Stat. 1166, authorized the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia to review the final decision of the Secretary upon any question of law which had arisen or might thereafter arise in the adjustment of such claims, expressly leaving his decisions on questions of fact conclusive.\n February 18, 1929, relator sued for a writ of mandamus directing the Secretary to take jurisdiction and to adjust and pay relator its net losses suffered by reason of the purchase of such property. The court held the Secretary rightly decided the question of law and dismissed the petition. The Court of Appeals, following its earlier decision in Work v. United States, 54 App. D. C. 84, 295 F. 225 (reversed here on the ground that under the Act of 1919 the Secretary's construction was not subject to review), held that Secretary erred in law and reversed the judgment. 47 F.( 2d) 422. This court granted a writ of certiorari. \n283 \nU.S. 817\n, 51 S. Ct. 650\n\n\n The question for decision is: To what extent, if at all, does the statute empower the Secretary in respect of net loss incurred by relator by reason of its expenditure for such land?\n During the World War certain mineral substances and products including chrome became essential to the nation's defense. The need having become very great, Congress by the Act of October 5, 1918, 40 Stat. 1009, declared a large number of such materials to be necessaries, em- \n\n[284 U.S. 231, 235]\n\u00a0\n powered the President, through such agencies as he should designate, to acquire and distribute the same and also to requisition, develop, and operate lands, mines, and plants capable for producing them, and appropriated $50,000,000 to carry out the purpose of the statute. The Armistice, November 11, 1918, ended the emergency.\n By section 5 of the Relief Act the Secretary is empowered 'to adjust ... and pay such net losses as have been suffered by any person ... by reason of producing or preparing to produce, either manganese, chrome, pyrites, or tungsten in compliance with the request or demand of the Department of the Interior, the War Industries Board, the War Trade Board, the Shipping Board, or the Emergency Fleet Corporation to supply the urgent needs of the Nation in the prosecution of the war. ...' And the sectioin limits the authority of the Secretary to such 'adjustments and payments in each case as he shall determine to be just and equitable.' It requires that all disbursements shall be made out of funds appropriated by the Act of 1918, and shall not exceed $8,500,000. A proviso declares that no claim shall be allowed or paid unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the expenditures so made were made in good faith 'for or upon property which contained either manganese, chrome, pyrites, or tungsten in sufficient quantities to be of commercial importance.'\n The Act of November 23, 1921, 42 Stat. 322 (50 USCA  80 note), amends and broadens section 5 of the Relief Act by adding to its first paragraph a provision that 'all claimants who, in response to any personal, written, or published request, demand, solicitation, or appeal from any of the government agencies mentioned in' the Act of October 5, 1918,1 'in good faith expended money in producing or preparing to produce any of the ores or minerals named therein and have \n\n[284 U.S. 231, 236]\n\u00a0\n heretofore mailed or filed their claims or notice in writing thereof within the time and in the manner prescribed by said Act, if the proof in support of said claims clearly shows them to be based upon action taken in response to such request, demand, solicitation or appeal, shall be reimbursed such net losses as they may have incurred and are in justice and equity entitled to from the appropriation in said Act.' And by the Act of June 7, 1924, 43 Stat. 634, the limitation of the aggregate amount to be disbursed under the act of 1919 was repealed.\n Section 5, the proviso referring to expenditures 'for or upon property' containing the minerals, and the amendment of 1921, are plainly broad enough to include net losses resulting by reason of expenditures for the purchase of property and leaves no room to doubt that it was the purpose of Congress to empower the Secretary to take them into account in arriving at the amount, if any, to be allowed and paid.\n The petitioner argues that the phrase 'such net losses as have been suffered' excludes claims where, at the time of the enactment, the purchaser still retained title to the property. But the net losses mentioned are not thus limited. Losses by reason of expenditures for property, real or personal, still owned by claimants are not excepted. The purpose is merely to reimburse; loss resulting from speculative investments is exluded; allowance of profits is forbidden. In determining actual net loss the value of the property purchased and retained by alaimant is necessarily to be taken into account. The construction for which petitioner contends necessarily rests upon the hypothesis that one may not suffer loss by reason of expenditures for land while he continues to own it. No such assumption can be entertained for it is everywhere known that the contrary is true, and that the value of lands and plants purchased and constructed to produce \n\n[284 U.S. 231, 237]\n\u00a0\n minerals and other things needed wholly or principally to carry on the war was liable to, and in fact generally did, greatly and permanently decline when the struggle ended. And, in support of his contention, petitioner invokes history of the legislation, but that is not here permissible for the language and meaning of the statute in respect of the question under consideration are clear. United States v. Missouri Pacific R. R. Co., \n278 \nU.S. 269, 278\n, 49 S. Ct. 133.\n The conclusion is plain. The Secretary is required to proceed to ascertain whether relator, on March 2, 1919, had incurred net loss by reason of the expenditure of $16,259 for such land; and, if he shall find that relator has suffered such a loss, then the Secretary, having regard to the safeguards and limitations specified in the statute, shall determine how much, if any, of the net loss so found the relator is 'in justice and equity entitled to from the appropriation in said Act.'\n No. 67.\n March 5, 1919, relator filed with the Secretary of the Interior a claim for losses by reason of expenditures for the production of pyrites under the conditions specified in section 5. The claim included items of interest on money borrowed, so expended and lost by relator. The Secretary and his successors including petitioner have uniformly held that the statute prohibits any award on account of such interest and have disallowed all claims therefor. After the passage of the act of 1929, relator brought this suit for mandamus to compel the Secretary to take jurisdiction and allow such interest. \n2\n The court held the \n\n[284 U.S. 231, 238]\n\u00a0\n Secretary rightly construed the statute and dismissed the petition, the Court of Appeals reversed, 47 F.(2d) 424, and we granted a writ of certiorari, \n283 \nU.S. 817\n, 51 S. Ct. 650.\n The amount of interest that at the time of the passage of the Relief Act March 2, 1919, had been paid or incurred by relator for money borrowed and lost in producing and preparing to produce pyrites upon the specified conditions, is to be taken into account in determining the amount of its net loss as of that date. It constitutes a part of relator's expenditures and cost of the undertaking and so is within the terms of the section as amended. United States v. New York, \n160 U.S. 598\n, 621-624, 16 S. Ct. 402. But the mere fact that such interest was lost does not entitle relator to have, or warrant the Secretary in allowing, any part of it. It must be shown clearly that such interest was paid or the obligation incurred by relator at the instance of one of the specified governmental agencies. And the Secretary, upon a consideration of all the circumstances and with due regard to the provisions of the section as amended, must be satisfied, and determine as a matter of fact, that an allowance on account of such interest is just and equitable and that the loss is one for which relator in justice and equity is entitled to be reimbursed from the appropriation.\n As we sustain the construction placed upon the statutes by the Court of Appeals, the cases will be remanded to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia with directions to award a writ of mandamus requiring the Secretary of the Interior to proceed to an examination and adjustment of the claim in question conformably to the statutes as here construed.\n Subject to this direction, the judgment of the Court of Appeals in each case is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '... officer or officers, department or departments, board or boards, agent, agents, or agencies as he (the President) shall create or designate, from time to time.'

Bunn, in the years 1919 and 1920 purchased for cash, as investments, bonds issued by various counties and cities in the State of Minnesota. In January, 1924, he sold these bonds, realizing a net profit of $736.26. Upon this net profit, less a net loss of $41.20 suffered by him on similar bonds held less than two years, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined an additional income tax in the amount of $85.44. The plaintiff paid this amount to the Collector, under protest, and claimed a refund upon the ground that the tax was illegal because assessed upon income from municipal bonds. The claim was rejected and this suit was brought against the Collector to recover the money paid.\n The complaint, alleging these facts, charged that the Revenue Act of 1924, if thus applied, was unconstitutional and void in that the tax was laid upon the instrumentalities of States. Demurrer to the complaint was overruled by the District Court, and, the defendant having declined to plead further, judgment was entered for the plaintiff. The judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (35 F.(2d) 29) and this court granted a writ of certiorari (\n280 U.S. 551\n, 50 . C t. 162).\n The Revenue Act of 1924 (chapter 234,  213, 43 Stat. 253, 267, 268, U. S. Code tit. 26,  954 (26 USCA  954)) clearly authorized the \n\n[282 U.S. 216, 224]\n\u00a0\n tax. The act included in the term 'gross income' the grains and profits derived from 'sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal.' See Irwin v. Gavit, \n268 \nU.S. 161, 166\n, 45 S. Ct. 475. The Act gave an express exemption to 'interest upon the obligations of a State, Territory, or any political subdivision thereof,' but this exemption was not extended to profits realized on the sale of such obligations and the statement of the Government is not challenged that it has been the uniform practice of the Treasury Department in administering the federal income tax acts in include in taxable income the gain derived from the sale of state and municipal bonds.\n The authority of the Congress to lay a tax on the profit realized by an investor from the sale or conversion of capital assets in general is not open to dispute and is not disputed. That is a matter of governmental policy and not of constitutional power. \n1\n The question raised here is not because the securities sold were capital assets but because they were governmental in character.\n The question is further limited by the fact that it does not appear that the securities were issued at a discount, so that the gain derived could be considered to be in lieu of interest. Whatever questions might arise in cases of that sort are not now before the court. \n2\n The present case is simply one of profit obtained from purchase and sale, without qualification by any special circumstances.\n The well-established principle is invoked that a tax upon the instrumentalities of the States is forbidden by \n\n[282 U.S. 216, 225]\n\u00a0\n the Federal Constitution, the exemption resting upon necessary implication in order effectively to maintain our dual system of government. \n3\n The familiar aphorism is 'that, as the means and instrumentalities employed by the general government to carry into operation the powers granted to it are exempt from taxation by the states, so are those of the states exempt from taxation by the general government.' Ambrosini v. United States, \n187 \nU.S. 1, 7\n, 23 S. Ct. 1, 3. And a tax upon the obligations of a State or of its political subdivisions falls within the constitutional prohibition as a tax upon the exercise of the borrowing power of the State. Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Company, \n157 U.S. 429\n, 584-586, 15 S. Ct. 673; Id., \n158 \nU.S. 601, 618\n, 15 S. Ct. 912; National Life Insurance Company v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 508, 521\n, 48 S. Ct. 591.\n The limitation of this principle to its appropriate applications is also important to the successful working of ourgov ernmental system. The power to tax is no less essential than the power to borrow money, and, in preserving the latter, it is not necessary to cripple the former by extending the constitutional exemption from taxation to those subjects which fall within the general application of non-discriminatory laws, and where no direct burden is laid upon the governmental instrumentality, and there is only a remote, if any, influence upon the exercise of the functions of government. This distinction has had abundant illustration. Thus, while the salary of an officer of the State cannot be taxed by the Federal Government, the compensation paid by a State or a municipality to a \n\n[282 U.S. 216, 226]\n\u00a0\n consulting engineer, who is neither an officer nor an employee of government, for work on public projects, may be subjected to a federal income tax. Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514, 524\n, 46 S. Ct. 172. No constitutional implications prohibit a non- discriminatory tax upon the property of an agent of government merely because it is the property of such an agent and used in the conduct of the agent's operations and necessary for the agency, McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 436; Railroad Company v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 33; Central Pacific Railroad Company v. California, \n162 \nU.S. 91, 126\n, 16 S. Ct. 766; Baltimore Shipbuilding Company v. Baltimore, \n195 \nU.S. 375, 382\n, 25 S. Ct. 50; Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf Railroad Company v. Mackey, \n256 \nU.S. 531, 537\n, 41 S. Ct. 582. The Congress may tax state banks upon the average amount of their deposits, although deposits of state funds by state officers are included. Manhattan Company v. Blake, \n148 \nU.S. 412\n, 13 S. Ct. 640. Both the Congress and the States have the power to tax transfers or successions in case of death, and this power extends to the taxation by a State of bequests to the United States, and to the taxation by the Congress of bequests to States or their municipalities. United States v. Perkins, \n163 \nU.S. 625\n, 16 S. Ct. 1073; Snyder v. Bettman, \n190 \nU.S. 249, 253\n, 254 S., 23 S. Ct. 803\n\n\n In the case of the obligations of a State or of its political subdivisions, the subject held to be exempt from federal taxation is the principal and interest of the obligations. Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Company, supra. These obligations constitute the contract made by the State, or by its political agency pursuant to its authority, and a tax upon the amounts payable by the terms of the contract has therefore been regarded as bearing directly upon the exercise of the borrowing power of the government. In Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 468, 469, where the tax, laid under an ordinance of the city council upon United States stock which had been issued for loans made to the United States, was held invalid, the principle was \n\n[282 U.S. 216, 227]\n\u00a0\n thus stated by Chief Justice Marshall: 'The right to tax the contract to any extent, when made, must operate upon the power to borrow, before it is exercised, and have a sensible influence on the contract. The extent of this influence depends on the will of a distinct government; to any extent, however inconsiderable, it is a burden on the operations of government . ... The tax on government stock is thought by this court to be a tax on the contract, a tax on the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States, and consequently, to be repugnant to the constitution.' This language was applied by the Court in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Company, supra (157 U. S. at page 586, 15 S. Ct. 673) in holding invalid federal taxation 'on the interest' from municipal securities.\n But it does not follow, because a tax on the interest payable on state and municipal bonds is a tax on the bonds and therefore forbidden, that the Congress cannot impose a nondiscriminatory excise tax upon the profits derived from the sale of such bonds. The sale of the bonds by their owners, after they have been issued y t he State or municipality, is a transaction distinct from the contracts made by the government in the bonds themselves, and the profits on such sales are in a different category of income from that of the interest payable on the bonds. Because the tax in question is described as an 'income tax' and the profits on sales are included in 'income,' the distinction is not lost between the nature of a tax applied to interest and that of a tax applied to gains from sales. The federal income tax acts cover taxes of different sorts. Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Company, \n240 \nU.S. 1, 17\n, 36 S. Ct. 236, L. R. A. 1917D, 414, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713; Stanton v. Baltic Mining Company, \n240 \nU.S. 103, 114\n, 36 S. Ct. 278. The tax upon interest is levied upon the return which comes to the owner of the security according to the provisions of the obligation and without any further transaction on his part. The tax falls upon the owner by virtue of the mere fact of ownership, regard- \n\n[282 U.S. 216, 228]\n\u00a0\n less of use or disposition of the security. The tax upon profits made upon purchases and sales is an excise upon the result of the combination of several factors, including capital investment and, quite generally, some measure of sagacity; the gain may be regarded as 'the creation of capital, industry and skill.' Tax Commissioner v. Putnam, 227 Mass. 522, 531, 116 N. E. 904, 910, L. R. A. 1917F, 806.\n The tax not being on the obligations of the State or municipality, or on the investment therein, as such, the question is whether the tax must nevertheless be held to be invalid because sales by investors are to be deemed inseparably connected with the exercise of the borrowing power of the State. When the Constitution prohibits States from laying duties on imports, the prohibition not only extends to a tax upon the act of importing, but also to one upon the occupation of the importer or upon the articles imported. A tax on the sale of an article, imported only for sale, is a tax on the article itself. Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 444. Similarly, with respect to federal taxation of articles exported from any State, the constitutional inhibition gives immunity to the process of exportation and to the transactions and documents embraced in that process. Fairbank v. United States, \n181 \nU.S. 283\n, 21 S. Ct. 648; United States v. Hvoslef, \n237 \nU.S. 1\n, 35 S. Ct. 459, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 286; Thames & Mersey Marine Insurance Company v. United States, \n237 \nU.S. 19\n, 35 S. Ct. 496, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 1087. Only on that construction can the constitutional safeguard be maintained. Again, when the United States has assumed duties with respect to Indian lands, a State cannot impose an occupation or privilege tax on operations conducted in or upon such lands by lessees who have been constituted federal instrumentalities for the purpose of discharging the Government's obligation, Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf Railroad Company v. Harrison, \n235 \nU.S. 292, 298\n, 35 S. Ct. 27, or upon the leases themselves or capital stock representing them, Indian Territory Illumi- \n\n[282 U.S. 216, 229]\n\u00a0\n nating Oil Company v. Oklahoma, \n240 \nU.S. 522, 530\n, 36 S. Ct. 453, or upon the net income of such a lessee, Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501, 504\n, 42 S. Ct. 171. See, also, Jaybird Mining Company v. Weir, \n271 \nU.S. 609, 612\n, 46 S. Ct. 592. 4 These cases are not analogous to the one under consideration. If the tax now in question is to be condemned, it must be because of practical consequences and not because purchases and sales by private owners of state and municipal bonds are a part of the State's action in borrowing money. It would be farfetched to say that such purchases and sales are instrumentalities of the State. They are not transactions made directly or indirectly in behalf of the State or in the course of the performance of any duty of the State. Sales are merely methods of transferring title to the obligation, that is, the igh t to receive performance of the promise of the State or municipality.\n That a transfer of government bonds is not inseparably connected with the exercise of the Government's borrowing power so as to make the transfer per se immune from taxation is clearly demonstrated by the decisions upholding non-discriminatory taxation laid upon the transmission of such securities upon the death of the owner. This Court has decided that a State may lay a transfer tax upon a legacy although it consists entirely of bonds of the United States, Plummer v. Coler, \n178 \nU.S. 115\n, 20 S. Ct. 829, and that the Congress may tax the transfer of the net assets of a decedent's estate although municipal bonds are included in determining the net value, Greiner v. Lewellyn, \n258 U.S. 384\n 42 S. Ct. 324. In Plummer v. Coler, supra at (page 125 of 178 U. S., 20 S. Ct. 829, 833), the tax of the State was sustained, despite the provision of the Act of Congress under which the bonds were issued that they should be exempt 'from taxation in any form by or under state, municipal, or local authority.' Id., pages 134, \n\n[282 U.S. 216, 230]\n\u00a0\n 135 of 178 U. S., 20 S. Ct. 829, 836; Act of July 14, 1870, c. 256,  1, 16 Stat. 272, Rev. Stat.  3701, U. S. Code, tit. 31,  742 (31 USCA  742 ). See, also Orr v. Gilman, \n183 \nU.S. 278, 289\n, 22 S. Ct. 213; Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 13 S., 48 S. Ct. 410. And in Greiner v. Lewellyn, supra (page 387 of 258 U. S., 42 S. Ct. 324), the Court said that 'the estate tax ... like the earlier legacy or succession tax, is a duty or excise, and not a direct, tax like that on income from municipal bonds. Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., supra . ... Municipal bonds of a state stand in this respect in no different position from money payable to it. The transfer upon death is taxable, whatsoever the character of the property transferred and to whomsoever the transfer is made. It follows that in determining the amount of decedent's net estate municipal bonds were properly included.' On similar grounds, as the Federal Government has power to tax transfers of property by gift inter vivos, Bromley v. McCaughn, \n280 \nU.S. 124\n, 50 S. Ct. 46, 74 l. Ed. 226, there would seem to be no question of its constitutional authority to include in such taxation gifts of state or municipal securities.\n It is urged however, that a federal tax on the profits of sales of such securities should be deemed, as a practical matter, to lay such a burden on the exercise of the State's borrowing power as to make it necessary to deny to the Federal Government the constitutional authority to impose the tax. No facts as to actual consequences are brought to our attention, either by the record or by argument, showing that the inclusion in the federal tax of profits on sales of state and municipal bonds casts any appreciable burden on the State's borrowing power. We are left to the inadequate guidance of judicial notice. It may be considered to be a matter of common knowledge that the bonds of States and their municipalities are for the most part purchased for investment. But while, in the language of the tax act regarding deductions for losses, the purchase of municipal bonds for investment, as in the \n\n[282 U.S. 216, 231]\n\u00a0\n case of other investments, may be regarded as 'entered into for profit' as distinguished from mere personal use, it may be doubted whether the prospect on the part of the ordinary investor of obtaining profit on the resale of such obligations is so important an element in inducing their acquisition that a federal tax laid on such profits, in common with profits derived from the sales of other property, constitutes any substantial interference with the functions of state governments. While the tax is laid on gains, there is also a deduction for losses on sales, and whether investors in such securitie wo uld consider it an advantage if both provisions were eliminated is a matter of mere speculation. It must be remembered that we are dealing, not with any express constitutional restriction, but only with an asserted implication. The constitutional provisions authorizing the Congress to lay taxes (article 1,  8; Sixteenth Amendment) are certainly broad enough to cover the tax in question, and before we can restrict their application upon the ground of a burden cast upon the State's borrowing power, where the tax is not laid upon the contracts made by the State in the exercise of that power, or upon the amounts payable thereunder, but is laid upon the result of distinct transactions by private owners, it must clearly appear that a substantial burden upon the borrowing power of the State would actually be imposed. But we have nothing but assertion and conjecture. The assertion might as easily be made as to the necessity of the complete immunity of such securities from federal taxation in the case of estate taxes, and, if mere conjecture were sufficient as to the possibility of a burden being cast by the tax on the essential authority of the State, it could be as readily entertained in the one case as in the other. Indeed, the existence of the illegal burden might be more easily assumed in the case of the estate tax, where the entire value of the securities, and not merely gains on sales, are taken into the reckoning in determining the amount of the tax. \n\n[282 U.S. 216, 232]\n\u00a0\n There is, however, an outstanding fact, more important than any possible conjecture. That fact is found in uniform and long-established practice. This practice clearly indicates that neither the Federal Government nor the States have found a tax on the profits of the sales of their securities to be a burden on their power to borrow money. So far as we are advised, the Federal Government has not at any time deemed it to be necessary to exempt from taxation the profits realized by owners on the sale of its obligations, with the exception, recently made, of short-term Treasury bills issued on a discount basis and payable without interest. \n5\n Such profits are included in the general \n\n[282 U.S. 216, 233]\n\u00a0\n phrase 'gains, profits and income' from 'sales, or dealings in property,' in the Act under consideration. And we understand that under all federal income tax acts, these or similar words have been construed invariably by the administrative authorities as including profits derived from the sale of state and municipal bonds. The present case appears to be the first in which the tax in this respect has been assailed. No state has ever appeared at the Bar of this Court to complain of this federal tax, and it is not without significance that in the present instance the \n\n[282 U.S. 216, 234]\n\u00a0\n States of New York and Massachusetts do appear here as amici curiae in defense of the tax. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The history of income tax legislation is persuasive, if not controlling, upon the question of practical effect. Plummer v. Coler, supra (pages 137, 138 of 178 U. S., 20 S. Ct. 829, 837, 838). Before the power of the Congress to lay the excise tax in question can be denied in the view that it imposes a burden upon the States' borrowing power, it must appear that the burden is real, not imaginary; substantial, not negligible. We find no basis for that conclusion, or any warrant for implying a constitutional restriction to defeat the tax.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Merchants' Loan & Trust Co. v.

Darlington, 15 Wall. 63, where the question related to the federal tax under the Act of March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 477, 478, upon the profits on the sale of bonds of the United States, the point of the decision was that the statute applied only to annual 'gains, profits and income' and did not extend to the increase in value of the bonds which had taken place in several prior years and was realized in the preceding year. But it was not questioned that annual gains or profits on the sale of government bonds were taxed by the Act. See Hays v. Gauley Mountain Coal Co., \n247 \nU.S. 189, 191\n, 38 S. Ct. 470.\n In O. D. 729, Cumulative Bulletin No. 3, July-December, 1920, pp. 123, 124, the Treasury Department ruled: 'In the case of Treasury certificates of indebtedness which are offered by the Government at par and accrued interest and not at a discount, only the coupon interest can be considered exempt from normal tax, and from surtax to the extent provided by the act approved September 24, 1917. Where such certificates are subsequently purchased at a discount, the difference between the purchase price and the par value of the certificates rcei ved at maturity is profit subject to both normal tax and surtax. The subscriber for Treasury certificates who sells them at a discount sustains a deductible loss, which is the difference between the par value of the certificates and the selling price. Any gain or loss on the sale of Treasury certificates of indebtedness prior to maturity should be determined in accordance with section 202 of the Revenue Act of 1918.'\n In the 71st Congress, 1st session, an amendment was proposed to section 5 of the Second Liberty Bond Act as amended (40 Stat. 290, as amended U. S. Code, tit. 31,  754 (31 USCA  754)), providing for the issue of Treasury bills 'on a discount basis and payable at maturity without interest' and that (subdivision (b)) all certificates of indebtedness and treasury bills issued thereunder 'both as to principal and interest, and any gain from the sale or other disposition thereof shall be exempt from all taxation (except estate or inheritance taxes) now or hereafter imposed by the United States, or by any local taxing authority; and no loss from the sale or other disposition thereof shall be allowed as a deduction, or otherwise recognized, for the purposes of any tax now or hereafter imposed by the United States or any of its possessions.' H. R. 1648, 71st Cong., 1st sess. \n The committee reports in the Senate and House of Representatives state that the amendment, in relation to both certificates of indebtedness and the new Treasury bills, 'provides that gain from the sale of either shall be tax exempt, with the necessary supplementary provision that any loss shall not be recognized. Inasmuch as these are short-term obligations, any advance in price will as a practical matter represent nothing more than interest.' 71st Cong., 1st sess., H. R. Rep. No. 13, Sen. Rep. No. 9. The words above italicized were, however, omitted in the act as passed. Act of June 17, 1929, c. 26, 46 Stat. 19, 20 (31 USCA  754). By act of June 17, 1930 (chapter 512, 46 Stat. 775 (31 USCA  754)), a similar provision as to tax on profits on sales, but limited to the short-term Treasury bills issued at a discount, was enacted. The committee report in the House of Representatives stated that the reason for this enactment was found in the special nature of such Treasury bills. 71st Cong., 2d sess., H. R. Rep. Nos. 1609 and 1759. Aside from these Treasury bills, the federal tax on profits on sales of federal securities has not been changed. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Undoubtedly each of these States has in view the circumstance that it subjects to its own income taxation the gains derived from the sale of federal securities, and it does not desire, in the absence of an applicable legislative restriction, to be deprived of that source of revenue as a corollary of a decision against the power of the Federal Government to tax the gains derived from the sale of state securities. The State of New York disavows any claim that 'the tax in question has any appreciable tendency to burden its fiscal operations' or those of its municipalities. The State of Massachusetts contends that: '1. The non- discriminatory taxation of all gains derived from the use of business knowledge and of human ingenuity in dealings in intangible property can have no material effect to impair the ability of a government to issue its bonds and obligations, even if gains from the sale of such bonds are subjected to the tax. 2. The history of the exemptioin of state instrumentalities from Federal taxation and of the exemption of Federal instrumentalities from state taxation reveals that the doctrine of exemption has protected governmental obligations only from taxation of the principal amount of such obligations and of the stated interest upon such obligations.' \n\n\n\n\n"}}
